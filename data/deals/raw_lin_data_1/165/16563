nt|Walddk2: A quiet 4@S coming up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Format is cross IMPs, 9 tables in play|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Indeed Henry there are many examples|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  A quiet board top get us underway|pg||
nt|idc: South has a little bit to spare for 4@s but the singleton in partner's first suit is a negative feature|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: of course, with North holding Txxx of @d, it is actually a good one|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When I lead a trump my partner has Qx, declarer J10xx and I have given the show away|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Waht else would you have led on this hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing different|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KI am merely telling you how (un)lukcy I am|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is actually not a terrible contract. It needs @h to come in and a little more, and the play is not actually straightforward, but Roland and I for sure have been in much worse slams|pg||

nt|henryb:  Staying above 12.86% recently?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pc|s8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Does that suggest Roland your declarer play is better than your leads?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The one yesterday was actually close to 20% so I was a bit unlucky|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We have four women playing also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good, keep you in youur place :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Perhaps all weak balanced hands open 1@C, 1@D is unbalanced (or 18-19) |pg||
mb|1H|nt|viren169: Hi Robin|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning |pg||
nt|barbyh: you probably like it that way|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Hi Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: Strange opening by Cook|pg||
nt|viren169: Is it systematic?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought the same apart from lack of majors|pg||
nt|viren169: better!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Sorry folks - still early in Lodon|pg||
nt|viren169: be interesting how high East bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wheres Lodon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what now|pg||
nt|bobholl: start with a quit 2@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS lying 3rd in the published results, but maybe not current results?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: No messing around from Lizzie Godfrey|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a hand to start|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ok now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: thazt so0lves that|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|viren169: In Malaysia I guess!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sounds like it|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of 2@D with intermediate values|pg||
nt|viren169: worked well here|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Lots of explaining going on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tthe leading three pairs are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Looks about the limit|pg||
nt|viren169: 11 tricks next bd...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: her partner relatively new on the tournament scene|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ten tricks|pg||
nt|barbyh: playing it safe in case of a bad trump split|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: probably better to bid 3@D with East's hand|pg||
nt|barbyh: maybe not|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rmb1: 3@H sounds like more hearts and less values|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|idc: 4! playable for E-W this time - but may need a good guess or two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S the value bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  and not obvious to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I used to like mini-splinters on hands like these - 3@c by West|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulhac:  Catherine Seale certainly bids up:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A fitting @HQ is enough for Jagger to raise|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|idc: Gives East more information - on actual hand, knows QT9x @c aren't working|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  a heart and not a diamond?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|idc: That @h switch has helped declarer quite a lot|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although it does not look like a good switch it may tempt declarer not to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|idc: may make even if she leads a small @s now|pg||
nt|idc: the lost tempo (no @d switch) as bad for defence as was setting up @h suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14352  Catherine Jagger|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is there a reason not to lead the @cQ, ruff and take the @s finesse?|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Seems logical henry but.....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Is North about to revoke?|pg||
nt|idc: the pause here makes we wonder if actual play has gone differently|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe frozen computer?|pg||
nt|idc: maybe Ace & another @s for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Lizzie just ruffed with !KS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Like I said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A revoke|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: K@S|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, a gold star to Roland for that revoke comment!|pg||
nt|henryb:  and the computer won't let you do that!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: no|pg||
nt|paulhac:  That is called good table presence Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: unless I've mised a card|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe just claim eventually, Simon?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The play makes no sense any more|pg||
nt|idc: I think this is another 'units' mistake - metres instead of km?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: k@s played instead of 5@c remember|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I am in Denmark at the moment, so 1300 km away as I said|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: maybe board is incorrect|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Of course E/W may not notice the revoke|pg||
nt|henryb:  Denmark is 1300 km from where this is being played? Seems unlikely.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Copenhagen --> London   1300 km|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1Â½ hour flight|pg||

nt|yo_yo: but a new partnership i believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: just cosd its sunday i suppose|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have known Sandra Penfold for quite a few years she is very competitive --used to play with Rita Oldroyd ( the Rixi Mrakus of the North lol)  She competes pretty agessively |pg||
nt|bobholl: kelly 1@C i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Kelly opened 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: what dat dere 1C|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|eggy: orry David palyed with Zia, not Forrrester who played with David Herman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: v ery interesting hand with anythin g likely to happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2cx wont be nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: South will just wait and show her suit in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D over 1N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pays sometimes to lurk in the bushes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Senior passed for a start, so you need to undo all of them|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jim Griffin|pg||
nt|viren169: the Vul probably kept her at bay!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: We need a few undos here I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tim?|pg||
nt|mamos: op   look at auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ew went very tamely there although E might think she has good defence|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting confused|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think anyone would be in  that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: she might also think she does not have an awful lot of playing strength in spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please start from scratch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eggy: Lizzie godfrey has represented England on and off since the 80s although she now lives in the Pyrennees and plays many major French events as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and they vul as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont agree t.o x by w|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who would double, W for take out?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: what a fabulous place to live|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but that 2nd suit makes a lot of tricvks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Undo all bids please|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and start all over|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|tlc: as long as declarer attacks hearts first, there will be 9 tricks...an early spade finesse and this will go down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: and E would pass under declarer?  I dont think so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont see why not you must speculate etc|pg||
nt|dburn: if West doubled 2@c, it would show three spades, not be for takeout|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah dont be a spoilsport|pg||
nt|dburn: which is why it's OK to make rancid overcalls if playing against idio... er, people who use support doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: count me in as one of those id....s david :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i love them|pg||
nt|jcomyn: children....|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barbyh: lots of options|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: how nice to know you have either 3 or 4 card support|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East at the other table took your advice, and she pushed her opponents to the five level where they went down|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: One doesn't want to bid 5 card suits vulnerable when everyone in watching|pg||
nt|viren169: Upside down signals?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould easily play 1NT fromn either side if w had not opened|pg||

nt|jcomyn: all the more reason to eat you my child|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tlc: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sT|nt|eggy: Her partner Dinah Caplan is an experienced player, but has not, to my knowledge,much high level duplicate history|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a woman after my own heart|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly more complicated now, though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer may have to get hearts right|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|dburn: well, that would have endplayed East if West's weak two bid were based on a three count, but it might have been safer to throw spades on those diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: south squeezed|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|dburn: slight loss of plot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: sorry s has kept hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: then what has happened to the ace of clubs?|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems no one knows what is happening|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dropped it on the floor|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately for declarer, it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|mamos: it does if South has thrown @cA|pg||
nt|dburn: and the overall effect of this may be mildly to irritate South, which is no bad thing|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: cant see may have kept Ac|pg||
nt|barbyh: then her clubs are good|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: i guess she has AC|pg||

nt|vugraphzzj: no double|pg||
nt|idc: In their system, a balanced 12-14 is a likely hand type for South, so as North I wouldn't try 5@d|pg||

pc|c4|nt|paulhac:  Sorry did not|pg||

nt|jcomyn: cant undersatand that|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: slam anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: me neither|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|rmb1: Another slam Roland would be proud of - played by West to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good slam...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nikce breaks in majors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D can win in many ways|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially with slam on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Kx of diamonds lad from pd will probably best 3N. and sometimes E will elect to make a TO double and EW will get to wrong game|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes i meant in general, not on this specific deal|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer was not looking at defence's cards|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, though, South must have kept all her hearts or she would have conceded in the endgame|pg||
nt|barbyh: 4hts makes of course but lets see if they get there|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: and where did the ca go then|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there was an american movie a decade or two ago called "Heathers"|pg||

nt|rmb1: What do you rebid - just 4@S ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no too good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|viren169: tough bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a noise|pg||
nt|viren169: Unless you have a gadget or two to cover these types of hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just allow space for e to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you suggest John|pg||
nt|mamos: S threw it away|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I give up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Strange things happen on vugraph, not easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chilloncan: not a comfortable choice for E there either, as X has warts, but so of course do 3N and 3S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and now Kaye is declarer again |pg||

pc|c7|nt|viren169: 6@H is better than 6@S as the cards lay|pg||

pc|c2|nt|viren169: Tough lead to find. I fancy this to make.|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 3@D non forcing |pg||
nt|bobholl: you could play lebensohlish here than 2nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is usual when 1NT is doubled for the doubling side to play pass as forcing over two of either minor |pg||
mb|1S|nt|eggy: here probably :)4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some (ladies) pairs still playing a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: decent result for East-West at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: very true - in what|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: important match, that - 4th against 2nd, with 4th having the better of it so far|pg||

nt|jcomyn: good judgement I daresay|pg||

nt|jcomyn: HATE it|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like the obvious 1-off|pg||
nt|viren169: some good players also play weak NT! |pg||
nt|mug: as I recall Sandra (and Brian Senior) and Holland/Brunner were the only pair playing weak NT in the English Premier League|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The South hand is worth 4@D non forcing but it will be taken differently --its in between forcing and non forcing |pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 1 min|pg||
pc|hT|nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with weak NT in the right hands!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: could well be the limit in that lead|pg||
nt|lml: East has an unfitting 5 count|pg||
nt|barbyh: so they only ope 1 d with 4?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: not a very enterprising final pass, but the form of scoring apparently dictates cautions for these players|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: West should perhaps redouble to show a good 2@H bid --pass to show two and 2@H average |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcomyn: whats the besat advice lads for those playin weak. I have a class and it is diffiult to explain whast not to do|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: 1@c is natural or most weak no trumps|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|s6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: its a pretty big punt unless east shows a bit more|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for that matter, E might have doubled 1S. and certainly N was close to a game try with 5 LTC (Losing Trick Count)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|viren169: Send me an email and I will send you pros and cons for both!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mug: I don't think what NT range you play is going to make much difference to your results below expert level|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|garnetts: NS can play lebensol here after 2@D as Bob suggests|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so 1@D would be 5 card?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: North somewhat endplayed now, and that @h2 will persuade her to give declarer a club trick|pg||

nt|garnetts: what is your rebid over 1@S Bob?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Cook would prefer to hear 4@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Youngs broke the transfer with such good @H|pg||
nt|barbyh: so their 2nt is unbalanced?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so they have to alert|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 2n not alerted|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator, any alert?|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think it is alertable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it may be on their CC of course|pg||
mb|5C|nt|eggy: anyway, I imagine all roads lead to ROme|pg||
nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont make|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we all know if u are in slam the KJ108 will be in the E hand|pg||
nt|lml: either hand will do|pg||
nt|tlc: and the club's off|pg||
nt|mug: you can take a horse to water etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: Erichsen in other room bid 3@D on first round as North|pg||
nt|mug: not that I'm comparing any of our last trialists to members of the equine species|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D looks about right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: given the auction I think they did well to get to 5D|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: why not?|pg||
nt|dburn: three spadess, four hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant count any more at my age|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: but North's hand was pretty good relative to what she'd show already, she could afford to show her spade control, the six good diamonds were huge|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Cook was going to drive to game whatever!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2  in best minor :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it's about a 17% slam, plus mb some sqz chances|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i fail to see whay it has to be alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: it doesn't|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i havent m;y rule book to hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chilloncan: 1N on the N hand cashes in when pd has a moderate hand with 5 hearts. it has the downside of possibly burying spades. whenever N would be reluctant to pass a 1N response to 1S, but ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also reluctant to raise, a 1N opener is recommended. here that is not the case, i think, so it is a very close decision for N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yo-yo seems to think so|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|mug: "ladies" I meant, not "last"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: better please|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: I have mine, and it specifically says: Players should not alert [...] a 2NT opening which is normally balanced (or semi-balanced) but may be|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: not obvious how 1BNT made in other room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|tlc: a claim coming soon|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D or 2@D on the first round depends a bit on doubling style|pg||
nt|mug: I think I prefer Helen's choice of 3@D but 2@D was not a mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D allow you to bid the spots of the cards afterwards. 4@S was clear cut.|pg||
nt|dburn: made on occasion with a singleton|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: now shes thinking about slam :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that the same for 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: no - you announce 1NT, including "may contain a singleton" if appropriate|pg||
mc|13|nt|bobholl: @D lead 1@D 1@C and 5@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont like bidding 3-card suits at any time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which rule book is that david|pg||
nt|mamos: no 1NT should inclusde an announcement |pg||

nt|eggy: Don't tell Roland!|pg||
nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|lml: she had to hold on to dummy's hearts|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe thats too tough single dummy|pg||
nt|lml: when West returns a diamond she has to rise ace and then there is a kind of winkle|pg||
nt|mug: I think 5@C exclusion was in order over 3@D|pg||
nt|mug: or simply void showing, in either case reaching the decent slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another lively hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure how much it mattered but a 4th heart throwing dummy's last diamond must be better then leaving a loser there |pg||
nt|jcomyn: another pushy 3nt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still points are there but rotten w hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: not making either |pg||
nt|dburn: Orange Book 2010, 5G3c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i became a director last summer, good job i didnt get questioned on that rule :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty  will check |pg||
nt|dburn: well, give it another couple of months and your answer may well be right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: spades usually win, but not this time|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty but too tough|pg||
nt|tlc: except lizzie can unblk the Q@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Last board of the round, the vugraph will shut down briefly between rounds|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@C over 4@S would achieve the same result|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C?!?!|pg||
nt|dburn: not the best game at the other table|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT   not going to make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: an economics student said to his professor "the questions in this exam are the same as last year's"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: a bit wet to pass, but in accordance with the classical rule of 500|pg||
nt|rmb1: Constructive weak two (?)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am not passing that s hand|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal 3@C to me by Cook|pg||
nt|garnetts: 24 points only |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am no fan of the opening unless it is 18/19 |pg||
nt|bobholl: is he lying a point or systematic ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah shure thats more than enough these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the 9 sets up I believe but I need to look at it|pg||
nt|eggy: Wasn't dummy entryless though?  I thought a winkle was only for overcoming blocked suits|pg||
nt|tlc: good hand to be playinggood/bad 2NT...|pg||
nt|lml: yes if east gets in she has to give dummy a heart|pg||
nt|mamos: is the East hand upgrade?   downgrade ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rmb1: NS found an 8 card minor fit anyway|pg||
nt|mug: yes a lot of pairs like the two tier weak twos these days, 2@S showed about 8-11|pg||
nt|mug: the heart fit went begging|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any game is wonderful, but five of either minor will make|pg||
nt|dburn: "true", said the professor, "but the answers are different"|pg||
nt|mamos: on a Spade lead   :)  o|pg||
nt|mamos: I remember going through a test on alerting and either adding not or deleting it to about 3/4 of the questions|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: anyway one for the blog|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what about that 6-3 h fit. I dont like 2S on the w hand|pg||
nt|dburn: here, West probably should have rebid 2@d (or opened 1@d if intending to treat the hand as a minimum, but...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 3NT on a 6-5-1-1 distribution a bit hairy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 9pts in one suit downgrade|pg||
nt|yo_yo: needs a good view in @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: not for the table :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that the heart switch may have kyboshed that, but interesting anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: some case for East doubling 3NT, I guess|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|tlc: hope heather has her guessing shoes on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  in my opinion west should not pass|pg||
nt|dburn: West probably ought to bid on here - if 3NT were the right contract, partner would have bid it earlier|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south also might have raised to 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 'in the tank'|pg||
nt|garnetts: not with the standard of card play I usually watch it aint--they need at least 30 --and thats not being sexist either applies to men and women |pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy to find heart fit after 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West could have balanced with a double, but would be normal to have diamond shortage for that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1S allowoing space|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S then 2@S shows 12+|pg||
nt|mug: you miss hearts anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why quibble about 1 pt|pg||
nt|mug: on a free run you do anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  notice if south raised to 2@h it might continue 3@c(?) pass 3NT(?) and now more difficult for west to remove?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: reluctant pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: this may of course get through |pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: you get out the wrong side of the bed this mornin|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: there are a few downsides to 2H though|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right, I guess - maybe partner has something like @hK10x, @cA and @dQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case 3NT is better than five of a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but the odds seem to favour bidding - not least because slam might make|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to find their 3@S tricks fast|pg||
nt|mamos: these two pairs are inthird and 4th places in the trials contending for the vital third spot and selection for the Home Internationals|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i asm not sitting on a 6-card major and say nothing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  with K10x @h and Ace of @c then maybe east would bid 3N over 2@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: West has a final chance for success on this hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what the discard meant |pg||
nt|yo_yo: like @S?|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: indeed some guess for a great deal of imps|pg||
nt|lml: is there a reason to finesse or just intuition|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: no it meant @C ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: udca i think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mckinney|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or suit preference whichever name you like|pg||
nt|yo_yo: trouble is   Youngs doesnt know Kaye has 3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4 - neither nowt nor some at|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however someat is spelt in yorkshire|pg||
nt|barbyh: party over|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however Sally Brock will be very happy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: west has more spade so fewer vacant spaces?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a very good day you make 3NT without the club suit|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: It's close here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: when partner throws a 4 i am not clever enough to know she has the 3 also|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: always do get out of bed in a bad mood --its age related |pg||
nt|barbyh: true|pg||
nt|mamos: there's a lot to be said for not winning a trick if you dont know what you are going to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: s in deep thought|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|mug: no extra shape and a stray jack, I'm happy to call it 11|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|eggy: Would have done well to get it right I think, so early in the play|pg||
nt|mug: Jagger could hardly bid|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no law says she cant|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mug: 5NT would also have been a legal call, not very sensible though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is why i go fo the odd 1100|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh well done |pg||
nt|yo_yo: is East being squeezed now?|pg||
nt|mamos: still work to be done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs seeing a stepping stone squeeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 5 mins to go 1 board to go|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if anyone can see it Sally Brock will|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|dburn: true, but if you can make 3NT without the club suit, you can probably make five of a minor also|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: the reason to finesse is weak|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now J@H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d8|nt|garnetts: North has made it easy--East might have overtaken as it was her best chance  |pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: still, tough problem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But Kaye could not know that 5m would be better|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like east's bidding here but maybe they just need to discuss this |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back soon|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sometimes you need bad results to sort things out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: going for the wrong ending|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: this is the one your grannie always gets right|pg||

pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: oh dear dummy squeezed|pg||
