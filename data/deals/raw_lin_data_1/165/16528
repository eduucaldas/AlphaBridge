nt|Walddk2: Too strong for 3@D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|roswolf: inventing a suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C GF is also an option of course, but it's dangerous if partner keeps supporting them|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David Birman now playing with Fohrer in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|djneill:  ok South jumped to 4@s to show a minimum hand, fast arrival|pg||
nt|djneill:  not many losers, but are there 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Things lie pretty well here and the lead doesn't hurt.  Still, declarer has some decisions to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  double finesse in diamonds seems to be the simplest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|othered1: well you still have some entry considerations|pg||
nt|djneill:  that avoids the need for too many ruffs, or possibly even the @c guess if the @h can be used to pitch one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Hasan A. Zaidi|pg||
nt|famus: hi all--merry merry xmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rashed and Hasan!|pg||
nt|famus: hi Ed|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Ed, taking two diamond finesses and the @s finesse means 3 entries, but luckily both diamonds are onside which avoids one of those requirements|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're thinking of pitching @C on @H, are you going to win @HA and finesse J?  GIB would, but GIB peeks.|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting stuff, this, but the final contract is not at all bad|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@C a heart raise?|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 2@c was clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise 3@c would be hard to explain|pg||
nt|athene: i've not met that convention :)|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 3@C might be a game try in hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: now thats really treading on dangerous mines|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it's all that easy to explain anyway, but...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|djneill:  in these types of hands, I usually try to think about plays which have to be done no matter what, like the diamond finesse, rather than think too deep|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: gppd [;au|pg||
nt|othered1: good play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzzk: Have to alert penalty doubles inEngland|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|famus: planning to pitch @cs now|pg||
nt|djneill:  unfortunately if there is no need to ruff a diamond, it presents a losing option in the way to play spades!  double-finesse against East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2D a lot better than 2H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eggy: Well all doubles not for take out, in fact|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: depends on the @S play. After taking @HAce |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  another attraction to the double finesse is that it puts West on lead after one losing finesse, safeguarding the @c|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer concerned about 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: but as long as East has both aces, that isn't really a worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Gold|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: of course, there's no guarantee that west has the @DK|pg||
nt|dburn: even if West had four hearts to the jack, declarer could draw trumps and play a diamond|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes if East had the @dK, West could always get back to East's hand with it for the @c through|pg||
nt|dburn: but ought to have started with the ten from dummy, not the two|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eggy: Hello David|pg||
nt|dagold: Good evening (from St Moritz)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|dburn: unless she was going to finesse the eight, of course|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|djneill:  if kibs believe the @s should have been played Ace and another, then imagine East with KJx (or West with Kxx or Jxx)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink the lines are equivalent ignoring issues like entries and other considerations outside the trump suit|pg||
nt|famus:  Well zack didn't get to hear Dan--tuff choices|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|hK|nt|djneill:  that is a good one, I was not sure about that, always assumed 75% was optimal|pg||

nt|djneill:  @sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: N is calling to TD about hesitation|pg||
nt|famus: hesitation on @s10 obviously:)|pg||
nt|famus: if there was any|pg||
nt|djneill:  this may be a variant of the Sominex coup|pg||
nt|djneill:  North puts East to sleep then calls hesitation|pg||
nt|famus: can u describe that coup for us Dan?|pg||
nt|djneill:  I am kidding of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: ok we comntinue now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are not nice fitting hands at all|pg||
nt|dagold: but 5@d is tough to beat (and bid!)|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe unbeatable |pg||
nt|jcomyn: stilkl with opps bidding majors might get there|pg||
nt|dburn: which was a remarkable thing to do - if it had lost to the jack, the defenders could have taken a club ruff|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: oh, OK - maybe it didn't really go like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hardly now|pg||
nt|dagold: now 2@d-2@h-3@d is quite likely...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  17 in the other room, North did not open and (so) EW got to 3@S-1 |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: dont think so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: there may be a pass in there somewhere|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dagold: as expected|pg||
nt|dagold: the normal auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odder|pg||
nt|athene: did it go 1@H 2@C 2@H 3@C 3@S 3N uncontested?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing mousy about that|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine so|pg||
nt|athene: that does seem a slightly weird auction because if 2@C is GF, most would rebid 2@S with east anyway even with min|pg||
nt|athene: and if 2@C isn't GF, 3@C isn't forcing, and then 3@S is a bit of a happy bid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|dburn: this needs undoing|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interesting way to bid the west  hand with such a disparity in suit length and strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: nice dummy for E :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dagold: so 5 is cold now but I think it always was due to the lucky heart layout|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: east cant lead trumps AND destroy the entries|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: with no pressure--might make 6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: n could have bid 3C and then 4D after 3D - maybe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not the best switch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: norf the worst i daresay|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: what was the best switch?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|djneill:  it would be good to have agreements on how to bid 5-4, 5-5, 6-4 majors|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|dagold: maybe and after 3@h?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: For those of us who prefer 2-way Stayman to 2-level transfer structures, it's no problem.|pg||
nt|famus: Ya-most most prtnships have these things worked out -|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: GUESSEM|pg||
nt|dagold: I think 3@d was enough. Dummy had some ideal cards, but couldn't really move|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: South ought to have ducked that|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ducking @HK was worth another undertrick but South does not know enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eggy: and as you said, without the heart position, 5D was hardly a gimme|pg||
nt|dagold: right|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

nt|othered1: 4 isn't my style.  Would rather bid 2 than 4, but 3 looks OK|pg||
nt|dagold: that is not a second seat 4@d in my book, as opened in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still what a foul hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an oul 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is not ideal but closer to the mark|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so where do they end up|pg||
nt|dagold: still, they may end up overboard if Anne bids 3@h as well she might|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as well she will|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: even at the 3-level, you have to push to get into the auction when short in preemptor's suit.|pg||
nt|djneill:  East might infer partner has a singleton @s so not many @s losers|pg||
nt|djneill:  are we going to see another double-finesse in 5@h|pg||
nt|dagold: well facing akjt to seven and out|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: she should pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: she might have passed over the double though|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 4@h making much less likely now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4N, probably implies two places to play.   so when east converts @C to @D, h e also shows @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: good if they restrict it to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: @D+@H now|pg||
nt|dagold: NS off the hook|pg||
nt|dagold: a chance missed|pg||
nt|dagold: a horrible double by north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely W should pass 3H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: 5@hs i         mean|pg||
nt|dagold: can go one off now though|pg||
nt|dagold: at least|pg||
nt|dagold: or make if south makes the mistake of playing the club queen|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 3@h is forcing fo them|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps the lead of the 8 will give her a clue though :)|pg||
nt|dagold: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: also dont know why E bid after the double. surely NS in trouble|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||

nt|dagold: now she can make i think|pg||
nt|dagold: pitch heart|pg||
nt|eggy: It didn't apparently|pg||
nt|dagold: take ruffing finness|pg||
nt|dagold: lose just 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: club queen an error|pg||
nt|dagold: oh sorry|pg||
nt|dagold: no ruffing finnese in hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: ace wrong!|pg||
nt|dagold: so 1 off it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: to gain a fortuitous (and undeserved) 2 imps against 1 pair at least|pg||
pc|s3|nt|djneill:  Zack is in auto-double mode|pg||
nt|djneill:  honor location is critical, and all those honors behind the takeout bode well|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: dont think he can avoid -2--too much work|pg||
nt|djneill:  shortened @h forces the heart play from that side, rather than @hA and another|pg||
nt|othered1: agree and -2 may take some careful play at that|pg||
nt|famus: and the sing @d doesnt help|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|eggy: 3 I should say|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|djneill:  if North keeps playing @s this might make by default with North's @hK skewered, handling problem is those diamonds with the pending ruff|pg||
nt|famus: yep|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|eggy: 2NT wasn't an underbid anyway|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: no seems to have hit the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Georgia thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2NT is known as Truscott in Europe, Jordan in USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Not surprising really, but the vul was not good for another x|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm any bid will attract the red card|pg||

nt|djneill:  and West, even more shocking, bid 5@c vulnerable with a loser-filled hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ending with a whimper|pg||
nt|dagold: passing worked better in the other room as EW found hearts which 1@s preempted|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dagold: 1n rebid, south may double|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  nominally not so bad, but the same @s tap reduced West's hand to less trumps than North|pg||
nt|eggy: wouldn't think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Teshome plans to pass whatever partner rebids i suspect|pg||

pc|dA|nt|eggy: where's the Doc when you need him?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||

nt|drorp: the one who has the spade void|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Dror, does that affect the odds of the 2-way finesses signficantly?|pg||
nt|drorp: pretty much, especially if u get to explore some of the other suits aswell and see that diamonds are 4-3 to some direction and clubs at worst 5-3 to some direction...|pg||

pc|hK|nt|dburn: so far, so good, but...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|djneill:  seems there is only one thing to do here, I can't see any ways to trick N-S into playing @d for East|pg||

nt|djneill:  the Crank rule (Barry Crane in Ranked suits)|pg||
