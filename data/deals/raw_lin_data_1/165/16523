nt|mrnye: will be a bad score anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite boring hands now. Next.|pg||
nt|kareno: He went after the wrong suit - heart finesse makes it|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and the last bd here |pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx to our great operator |pg||
nt|kareno: <applause>|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: thx :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thx so much Karen for helping out |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrnye: this hand goes to show that it is worth fighting for every trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: My pleasure, Shirley :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: and we have had great fun in Oz as usual |pg||
nt|kareno: There were some very exciting hands tonight.  Did your colleague pick and choose from different tournaments or did he just take hands from one secret tournament and create the ...|pg||
nt|kareno: datums and the tournament from those hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If team and I go under one trick for safe in a contract, I will never be proud by one overtrick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: thx to Griff and his great staff, and the ABF |pg||
nt|kareno: I guess Griff left - that's an interesting question though.|pg||
nt|enelya: i don't actually know the full details.  I believe he took datums from high quality events that would never have been heard of here in Australia.  Each set of boards is from the ...|pg||
nt|enelya: one event|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra2: I had a million questions about how it was the kids didnt know etc |pg||
nt|kareno: As I play, that calls for your shortest suit lead.  But there are many ways to play that double.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: who can memorize all the hands in the world?  I can barely remember what i played yesterday |pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|kareno: I'm told:  The hands and datums are from a number of different local and overseas events - Cheers, Matt, the Director|pg||
nt|kareno: and they weren't particularly chosen, just 20 random hands|pg||
nt|kareno: Are you sure of that, Matt?  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: It would be tempting to pick exciting hands.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: now the club??? |pg||
nt|kareno: So 'definitely' they were not selected specifically, just at random.|pg||
