nt|by:  so, a lukewarm result|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|wkc:  the declarer knows W has @SA @HKQ and @DK along with a bal hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|wkc:  so I think it's better to play E has @CK, otherwise W might open 1NT|pg||

nt|lorderic: NS might reach 3NT on this if N bid aggressively|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a slam for NS|pg||
nt|lorderic: as I know, EW used to play in a highly artificial system called MOSCITO|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like they didn't play that in this event|pg||
nt|lorderic: it worth a try. he knows he doesn't have 5 quick loser|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wkc:  and it's a grand slam, lets see if they could reach there|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  12-14?|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|lorderic: NS could make 3@S and EW could make 4@D on this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like NS is playing weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2NT should be a lebensohl here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 7@D is almost a lay-down|pg||
nt|lorderic: can make 7NT with dropping @SJx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  if it's a 12-14 1NT, then N did bid aggressively|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D opening from S is precision, could have longer @C than @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back!|pg||
nt|lorderic: this is the final set for 18th NTU cup, a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lorderic: it's unlikely for west to bid 4@D after 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance to get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: a raise to 3@S now would get there|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lorderic: W chooses an aggressive one|pg||
nt|wkc:  South should bid 3@C right after pn's overcall, because things like this happens everyday|pg||
nt|lorderic: Do they play strong club Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1N shows 13-15|pg||
nt|lorderic: N hand to me is only an invitational one|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is some kind of checkback|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@D looks strange to me|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzxs: but west wanna to do that haha|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's too risky due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree. in competative bidding, one should raise pd's suit as soon as possible|pg||
nt|lorderic: now 5@C is kind of risky while Vul |pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: they both lead 014th|pg||
nt|wkc:  this is going to go down quickly|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they make another mistake and get an "expensive" sacrifice|pg||
nt|lorderic: the last 14 boards to decide which team would be our champion|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzxs: NS they play precision|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3NT could usually be the best contract if E has 6 cards @D and @S stopper|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lorderic: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|lorderic: with everything unfavor to declarer, I expect this will go down 2 or 3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|wkc:  X = "pn, please don't bid again"|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@D is real @D and 3@D shows a fit in @D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lorderic: N knows they have all the keycards... what's next?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|lorderic: that's a good news for NCTU... because 2NT goes down also|pg||
nt|wkc:  now N knows they have all the keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: he just settled in 6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wkc:  W wants to use J(from QJ) to indicate a @H shift|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think it's better to tell your pn that fact by bidding 5NT, instead of 6@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: he does not know how many @H S have|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lorderic: but this time 4@D is the best since neither 5@D nor 3NT could be made|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lorderic: if @S has a hand like Axx Kxx Qxxxx Ax then 7 is not playable|pg||
nt|lorderic: books tell us to lead a trump on this kind of bidding|pg||
nt|lorderic: to prevent a cruss-ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s8|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|wkc:  3@H is a little overbid IMO|pg||

nt|wkc:  will S bid 1@D with that hand, I mean I think he might open 1NT with that hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: my mistake, both could be make if play @S for 3 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: EW can make 3NT, but i don't think they would get there|pg||
nt|wkc:  a 20 points 3NT for EW, but I think it's a little hard too reach there|pg||
nt|wkc:  looks like a @S vs @H drama again here|pg||
nt|lorderic: how about Axxx Kxx Qxxxx A?|pg||
nt|lorderic: FYI, LI Na just advanced in Australian Open Wumen Final|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lorderic: an off-shape 1NT opening|pg||
nt|wkc:  then you could throw away your @H w/ @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and maybe he|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: it looks like NS don't play pre ?|pg||
nt|wkc:  he'll raise @S after 1@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: 6@H could be made here if @D played correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 4@H is the par, but if S open 1@H and W takeout|pg||
nt|lorderic: Kitty leads by 13.5 IMPs in the first half|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wkc:  he tries his best for 3NT :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: hmm... seems like NS here does not play precision as the other pair do|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: EW might bid 4@S after 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lorderic: good decision for north not raising 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: hand is too weak and @HKQx is better for defense|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is now thinking for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|lorderic: otherwise N should open 1@C with 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is glad to see no X here|pg||
nt|lorderic: the event's website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lorderic: sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: no double, no trouble|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lorderic: although 4@H/4@S both go down 1, I don't think it is a bad sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if either makes that would be huge IMPs for not bidding 4@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|lorderic: 4@H is a great contract... only before you see the cards lie|pg||
nt|lorderic: W can easily get 10 tricks on this board when @H split 3-2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lorderic: E could play a low @S to drop singleton @SK in S, or ...|pg||
nt|wkc:  now E is thinking which is more likely, N has singleton @SJ or S has singleton @SK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|lorderic: in board  1, CGU went 2 off on 2@S so NCTU is only 2.5 IMPs behind|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|lorderic: @CA will make 2 overtricks|pg||

nt|wkc:  and in CR, EW made a 5@H sacrifice, which should be 3 off|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|wkc:  so -300 is a good score for kitty|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|jonky:  West may preempt 3@H earlier|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  1@S is 0-7 and may be only 3 card @S, and this stops S a little bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  but now he knows his pn is max and at least 4 card @S|pg||

nt|lorderic: here comes a slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  A very good 6NT by W|pg||
nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
nt|lorderic: a partscore here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|lorderic: and take the lead by 3.5 IMPs|pg||
mb|d|nt|curious: reached 6@D on board 14 in OR|pg||
nt|wkc:  4@H is not making in this board|pg||
nt|wkc:  nice bid!|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@S by S is the par here, see if they can get there|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|wkc:  2@D shows @S +@D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: 1H opening by N is light. i suppose N can open 2@H shows @H + minor?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|wkc:  I agree, I would open 2@H when red vs white|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a better description of his hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  no slam is making now|pg||
nt|lorderic: after a freebid by N, S will definitely bid 4@S now|pg||
nt|lorderic: even W has both @H and @D support, his hand is too weak for further bidding|pg||
mb|5H|nt|wkc:  2@H is inv or better, and now W might pass because of misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: i don't agree with this 4@S. 2@S rebid is enouth for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: as you can see 5@H doubled would be -3 if @D played wrong|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxs: would you double 4 @S ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: they are heading to slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  notice that the bidding here helps S to find a @D lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: again i would rather overbid than play an unknown 5-1 trump|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's easy to make 3NT if pd has some @C support|pg||
nt|wkc:  ok maybe I'm too conservative|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: definitely not.|pg||
nt|lorderic: apologize for the connection problem|pg||
nt|lorderic: hope we did not miss anything ;)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|lorderic: S should give a count signal here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lorderic: i suppose they play upside down right, Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: udca i think.|pg||
nt|lorderic: thank you|pg||
nt|lorderic: @CT shows 3 cards @C so N is better cash @CA now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs:  4  they played that on @C|pg||
nt|wkc:  S knows that E has a @H stopper(and a control) for her 3NT/4@H, so he might lead a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|lorderic: in OR, BTU bid 6@D and grab 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wkc:  uh...I don't like @DQ lead if my LHO have shown his @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: the cards lie favor to declarer, should manage some overtricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|lorderic: i'm wondering why S did not raise in @H|pg||
nt|wkc:  now S need to find a small @C shift|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lorderic: @D is better since E already denied @D control|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wkc:  wow|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wkc:  ya|pg||
nt|wkc:  now making 7|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lorderic: now a @s from N is the best return|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wkc:  ok nvm|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's a trend that you raise pd suit after a takeout double need not promise any strength|pg||

nt|lorderic: 4@S by E here, should be a flat board|pg||
nt|wkc:  oops, we did miss something :(|pg||
nt|lorderic: for everyone new to here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: a flat 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  NS could make 6m, but it's hard to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: on board  3 CGU overbid to 4@S. another 5 IMPs for NCTU|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: looks like on both table CGU overbid a lot|pg||
nt|lorderic: wondering if NS will get to 4@S on this hand?|pg||
nt|lorderic: S make a typical usunual 2NT shows both minors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lorderic: a really light 2@S preempt, 3rd seat nV |pg||
nt|lorderic: if E knows that his pd usually open with 5 low spades, he should not do anything here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: yes, but today is not their day :(|pg||
nt|lorderic: from N point of view, if S has a hand as good as xx x KQxxx AKQxx then a slam is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@S in 4ht seat shows 11-12 HCP with 6 cards @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: go for 3N now?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lorderic: since W didn't open, i don't think it is a good decision for E to bid 3NT here|pg||
nt|lorderic: I think 3@H shows a GF hand with long hearts|pg||
nt|lorderic: personally i would bid 4@H after 1NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: the slam is unlikely|pg||
nt|lorderic: even if is nV 4@Sx could be -1100|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzxs: just guess :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: i would open 3@C with W hand. some might say the clubs are not good enouth Vul|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS slightly overbid on previous 3NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: looks like they are not as aggressive as the other NCTU pair |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lorderic: making 7 with this lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzxs: 2 pass hands play 3N here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: a @D lead will set the contract immediately|pg||
nt|lorderic: this is another chance for them to overbid again|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU-96 bid and made the game on board  3, 10 IMPs and take the lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: N takes some time for the lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lorderic: on a @S lead E could make 3NT if he plays @C correctly|pg||
nt|lorderic: yes it is|pg||
nt|wkc:  and they do|pg||
nt|lorderic: he wish his pd has stiff @D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lorderic: sometimes is correct to be aggressive... but not today|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: 9 tricks is for sure|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lorderic: from the bidding N knows that S doesn't have much high cards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lorderic: @S lead could be a chance to make the contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lorderic: so @DA and wish to get a ruff is reasonable|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lorderic: oops|pg||
nt|lorderic: unfortunately not this time|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lorderic: BTU is leading by 31.5 IMPs with 6 boards to go|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lorderic: NS might have misunstanding on this @D8|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know what @D 8 means|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lorderic: it quite difficult for NCTU to catch up|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|lorderic: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|lorderic: but it is likely to be a flat board|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|wkc:  E shows us a lesson by playing @D: always let your opponent guess before they know your card|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lorderic: guess S thinks @D8 is a count whereas N think it's discourage|pg||

nt|lorderic: even if they stop at 4@S still 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: from EW hands 4@S is typical|pg||
nt|lorderic: however if you know all 4 hands...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: i usually play A from AK to ask for attitude, K for count|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: overbid wins this time|pg||
nt|wkc:  what will you open with S hand, eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: this one could be a huge score|pg||
nt|lorderic: N managed to make 6 on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@H to show @H + minor is typical to me|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|lorderic: 3@H shuts everyone's mouth|pg||
nt|lorderic: a double by E is better than 1NT for sure|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|wkc:  EW has a not-easy-play 3NT, but not after 3@H|pg||

mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|lorderic: it's a good try here. don't need much for 4@S|pg||

nt|wkc:  don't let opps have a chance to show their hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS might not find the best 3NT after this|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@C should have 5 cards @C with some other side strength|pg||
nt|lorderic: usually that mean 9 quick tricks for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: NCTU picks up another 6 IMPs on board  5 and is ahead by 14.5 now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: Director said the boards might be cut in the second half due to the slow-play|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: what you saw is real|pg||

nt|lorderic: E don't want to take the risk on finessing @H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lorderic: alright, since that just a matter of undertricks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: we're halfway for the first set in final|pg||
nt|lorderic: for those new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|lorderic: this is probably the board NS want: a perfect fit 4@S which you can only get there by overbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: EW play 2/1, 2NT here shows non-minimum and could be a non-balanced hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: another highly competitive bidding coming|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a big misfit. could they stop at the right place?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lorderic: it is reasonable that EW settle in 2|pg||
nt|wkc:  2@C is not my style, I would prefer to make a balance X after the 2S bidding by W|pg||
nt|lorderic: compete with their own partner|pg||
nt|lorderic: EW reaches a thin 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: now W is considering for a heart slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: it "was" the closest|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if 1NT is 15-17, E hand is a little weak for invitational|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lorderic: I would suggest pass 1NT here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lorderic: the problem is that his void is in pd's suit|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@H seems a little aggressive|pg||
nt|lorderic: however they can make this if the @H split 22 |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lorderic: finally both agree with 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lorderic: i totally disagree with this 5@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: overbid again?|pg||
nt|lorderic: after 2@C, E has a minimum hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  the declarer has a chance to find his 9th trick by squeezing E's minor, but lots work need to be done|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is also not my style|pg||
nt|wkc:  not an easy one, for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|lorderic: on this board it's the right decision to bid 2@C|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@H and 4@C almost tell everything he has|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: how do you think at West seat ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: W hand worth a slam-try, but void in @C is kind of useless|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs:  6 @D8 costs 16 imps |pg||
nt|wkc:  EW reach 6NT/W on board 5 in OR to take them back on the track|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lorderic: another problem for W is perhaps the trump|pg||
nt|lorderic: E can easily have every side control ... @DK, @SQ, but no @HJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: you definitely don't want to play a slam with only 8 cards trump without A and J|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wkc:  oops, now he has his 8th trick|pg||
nt|lorderic: since @C split 33 and all the cards are on the right side|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lorderic: and also @D split 44|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|wkc:  he's short in entry to dummy before the last round|pg||
nt|lorderic: now declare can make this one by winning the spade, cashes @Hs and @Ds|pg||
nt|wkc:  but now he's making his contract |pg||
nt|lorderic: and throw-in W by a @S|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|lorderic: not this time|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wkc:  @DA and another @D would do the work|pg||
nt|lorderic: since @DQx drop it's always -1 now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lorderic: oops, the throw-in will be the 10th trick|pg||
nt|wkc:  @D to A, @CQ to get some @C tricks first|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|wkc:  E could shift @C to prevent an overtrick|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|lorderic: any miracal?|pg||
nt|lorderic: this one looks like a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|lorderic: a better line is to cash both top @S and @H in dummy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: however, while N had 4 cards trump (likely after S overcall @C), a finesse in @S is necessary|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS could make both 3NT/4@S on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if someone with 4 @Cs with @S/@H would get squeeze|pg||
nt|lorderic: dummy would get squeezed the way W played by cashing @C first|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lorderic: looks like another flat board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|lorderic: maybe 4@S is a better choice for S hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lorderic: a gambling 4@H by N|pg||

pc|cA|nt|wkc:  for the last board, W should duck @HA. He knows that the declarer have the hand like KQx KJx(x) KJ Axxx(x) for his 1NT opening and pn's @S8 lead|pg||

pc|c6|nt|lorderic: the rule is, you are more willing to play 3NT with side Aces, to play 4@S without them|pg||

nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
nt|lorderic: if N has a hand like KQJxxx Jxx xx xx in a @C lead usually 3NT went down|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wkc:  so he should know that the 5th @D is declarer's 9th trick bur dummy is short in entry|pg||

nt|lorderic: on a @H lead, the only hope for S is to play @S for no loser ...|pg||
nt|lorderic: this one also tells: you can afford a @S loser if playing 4@S|pg||

nt|by:  here, the @CJ is onside 3-3|pg||
nt|lorderic: anyone would open with E hand?|pg||
nt|wkc:  3 boards to go, 7 boards to compare, and BTU is heading by 34 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: or pd might think you have A64 rather than A9864|pg||
mb|1S|nt|by:  so unless the NS defenders get to their heart tricks, 3N would make on bad defence|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@S/S is likely to be the contract|pg||

nt|lorderic: in E prospective, if he is quite sure that W leads a 5 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: W must find a @H lead to set it, otherwise S can pinches @H on @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3NT by S and a @H lead is what NCTU need now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lorderic: but a @S lead will give defensive side first 8 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|wkc:  4@S opening is not my style|pg||
nt|wkc:  maybe to stop the 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|lorderic: since S pass they cannot get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|lorderic: still NS can make 5@D if defender don't cash their tricks|pg||
nt|lorderic: however N hand is too weak to respond|pg||
nt|lorderic: if N bid 2@H (or 2@D if they play transfer here), they might get to 4@H|pg||
nt|lorderic: return the lowest from own 5 cards is better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lorderic: @S again choose to be aggressive by opening 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: opening with E hand is not my choice. but they will definitely bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|by:  I think that most people opens today|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if E passes, the bidding could be p-1@D-1@H-2@C-2NT-p|pg||
nt|wkc:  if 3@H is ask for the stopper, I would definitely bid 3NT even after X. This might be all what pn want|pg||
nt|lorderic: which is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  i don't agree with it, but that's fashion|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lorderic: S knows that N hand is too weak to make a negative dbl after 1@S|pg||

pc|d7|nt|lorderic: neither do i|pg||

mb|p|nt|by:  it is hard to get 14 IMPs, still |pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks to KC, and all of you watching here!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lorderic: a huge hand in N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lorderic: not quite sure what 3NT is|pg||
nt|jonky: If 2@C GF, N should bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jonky: Then if S rebid 3@C, can go to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to show a 16-18 bal hand ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: another precision-style 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C could be longer @C than @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a tough decision on S hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS has 13 trick for 7NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: pass 3@Hx is a great choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: he is not sure which minor is longer|pg||
nt|lorderic: but it's really difficult to get there, even in small slams|pg||
nt|lorderic: i don't think opening 1@S with 25 HCP is a good idea|pg||
nt|lorderic: too many strength so that it is possible 1@S-all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: beating 2@S is not enough for NTHU|pg||
nt|lorderic: on a @S lead by S, E would have 2@S, 4@C and 3@D to make this one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lorderic: since 2@C could be a wide range of hands, it's not good to waste so many spaces by bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know their thought haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: of course|pg||
nt|lorderic: but NS could get 5 tricks earlier on a shift in @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzxs: still a safe contract here :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: much better than 3NT at the other table|pg||
nt|wkc:  a @H shift now?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lorderic: 2NT would be kind of overbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  thanks eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: that is how they do in the whole match|pg||
nt|wkc:  I agree, he knows that they are misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2C means 54/45 minors |pg||
nt|lorderic: another aggressive 3NT, any chance here?|pg||
nt|lorderic: oops|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wkc:  it will be a quick one|pg||
nt|by:  alas|pg||
nt|by:  only makes it close|pg||
nt|wkc:  and a 10 point inv is absolutely overbid to me|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's true. but when you choose between playing in 4-2 trump or overbid, i choose the latter|pg||
nt|lorderic: pass 2@C/correct to 2@D could also be disaster|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
nt|lorderic: @S is thinking which suit split 33, @D or @S?|pg||
nt|lorderic: see if N could find it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lorderic: since @S split 3-3 should be making 5, 13 IMPs to NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: so after the first half NCTU is ahead by 22.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: this would set 3@H a lot|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|lorderic: fortunately they still get to a makable slam|pg||
