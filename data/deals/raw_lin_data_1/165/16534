nt|roswolf: a choice of majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: west taking the conservative view|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s is clearly better than 4@h, although neither game is what you would call "excellent"|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed henry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  Another case of the 4-4  being superior to the 5-3|pg||
nt|idc: Hard to avoid getting locked into @h as trumps - perhaps 4-card majorettes may start 1@h - 1@s|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 8|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can see two ways to get to spades: Geoffreys way, which has problems if partner rebids 2 of either minor as you really are not good enough to jump to 3@h and partner won't expect three card support on a preference to 2@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: updated scores now available|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C checkback (?)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: ... or something else, any guesses about 2@D|pg||
nt|mug: did North bid 2@D or 2@H operator?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Hi John and David|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aternon|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|mug: this will make but there's a little to play, Sally Brock has to worry about bad breaks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|mug: I think one heart finesse, then a club to the jack|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: East could be ducking from @HK-x-x-x|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|mug: perhaps it's simply too early in the morning to worry about bad breaks?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: yes, but not entirely of her own doing - her partner could have taken a trick more|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: I hate 3@h with East's hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|rmb1: its already 12 o'clock - should be awake by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi Steve|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|eggy: Me too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mug: she knows East has @CQ after West showed up with @DAK and @HK and played the clubs accordingly|pg||

mb|2D|an| |mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could br murky|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 - not to my taste|pg||
nt|henryb:  why not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: too strong!|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like an absolutely classic weak two at these colors|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like a classic weak 2 at almost any colours|pg||
nt|roswolf: europeans tend to be less sound with their weak 2's than americans|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Different styles on different sides of the Atlantic I expect|pg||
nt|othered1: depends on the Americans :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe they shouldnt be but they are|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: I blame Al Roth (always a playable line) |pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: west i think should have re-opened with short diamonds - double for my choice|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|henryb:  The question, I suppose, is whether you treat a "weak two" as basically a preempt or as a constructive action with less than opening high card values|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|mug: this looks more interesting!|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C when clubs are 1-1 and you can ruff 3x@H in North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and oul N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mug: that's a good start for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have to open 1@C playing normal methods with North's 22HCP|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: must play 2/1 game forcing, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but even so, you might risk 2@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eggy: I have http://tinyurl.com/4vxjrjc|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: rather than putting this down as dummy in 2@s|pg||
nt|mug: she might have tried redouble on the way, just once in a while EW aren't playing in hearts|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D* would have been a lot, although Sally Brock may not have stood it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j for standings - now updated|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the results I think the adjustment represents capping the results of a round to +28IMP|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: The field is starting to widen a bit now|pg||
nt|eggy: but you can gain up to 28 imps per match|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eggy: or lose any amount - scoring is x imps/8 capped at 28 for the winners|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess she will go after @ss and get home here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: so why didn't the 2nd pair receive a negative adjustment for their +53 in round one?|pg||
nt|mug: kibitzer makes a good point|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: It won't make much difference, but trying to make as many ruffs as possible looked a better prospect|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with 4@h also down on a club lead, this may not be too expensive|pg||

nt|roswolf: some number of @D i expect|pg||
nt|othered1: with very friendly @D position, 3n is easy to make, less easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|idc: I guess you'd want to be in 4@s as N-S, but not if you could see the E-W cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: almost impossible to bid i'd say|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: If  north has 2@D-3@D auction available, 3N is possible.  If stuck with forcing NT (or ugly semi-forcing), i t's a different story|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: Playing traditional Acol methods that SOuth hand is a nightmare rebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  If, as I would expect, North bids 3 non-forcing diamonds, South might well bid 3N|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N at this point isn't silly |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  Pass isn't silly either|pg||
nt|idc: You'd like to have singleton honour at least in @d|pg||
nt|othered1: extras, stoppers in unbid suits.  3@S wouldn't have been among my choices|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S is the worst of all possible reasonable alternatives|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed it is not a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|roswolf: and west has been merciful|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  I would have whacked this as West. They are not making overtricks, and they might well go two down|pg||
nt|othered1: No, west has been smart.  Care to defend 4N?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: no but then i would be confident they wouldnt run there|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|d7|nt|othered1: and there west, luckily, earned an extra 100.|pg||
nt|roswolf: as specs point out they might run to 5@D which might be a different story!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  Not on a spade lead|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but then ed was right to praise west for leaving them to stew in 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: and, couldn't north have the same hand with @DAJ rather than KQ?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|dT|pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps North could have tried slam over the double, the finesses were likely to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: the pair that got -31 got their full score. the pair that got +31 were adjusted to +28|pg||
nt|rmb1: The cap is per round (of 7 boards) not per session (of 2/3 rounds)|pg||
nt|mug: another possible slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3NT will make, but 4@h won't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they will|pg||
nt|mug: ic|pg||
nt|mug: maybe she can bid 2@C transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|mug: a popular and effective method|pg||
nt|mug: I like transfers here as you can happily give up the natural 1NT, much better to pass with the 6-9 hands rather than let the next hand off the hook by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Unlucky 4@s here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is|pg||
nt|jtr: Might get doubled even|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mug: natural 1NT over 1M-(dbl) is one of the worst bids in bridge in my view|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: some form of puppetry|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: cruel game sometimes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: infact it is a cruel game most of the time|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s not a very satisfactory bid but understandable|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: and this form may actually work|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|mug: 3@D too timid|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mug: hi Bill|pg||
nt|jtr: Now will get a double surely?|pg||
nt|eggy: no|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north had no way to show that diamond suit immediately over the double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Looks like it will end the same though|pg||
nt|dburn: though this lead will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Tom was describing the merits of 2@C transfer instead of 2@D when N passed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings |pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
nt|jcomyn: why by the way. I did that the other night and pard had no trick. I won my 3 spades and that was all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: maybe they like to have six-card suits for these actions, but still |pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: a diamond would have been worst for the defence (apart from ace and another trump, which would have been fatal)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|eggy: To be honest, any lead should have been enough, once you see the dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: I don't think pass was a crime, but 3@D was|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: exactly the same hand slightly different only i had a better hasnd thasn w|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jtr: As you say, it can be a hard life|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|athene: if north, in their partnership style, passes a wide range of hands over the double, then there is a case for lebensohl next time i suppose|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: Find a better partner is my advice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mug: a bit to the play in 5@D mind you, let along 6@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|nt|dburn: maybe, but after a diamond lead and a heart to the ace, it would not be clear to shift to ace and a spade|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north will be claiming anyway|pg||
nt|eggy: You have to make sharpish doubles when overtricks are unlikely, otherwise the odd for vul games are too good|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: because partner might have started with @sQx|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mug: she's only going to make 10 tricks, that will improve partnership spirits|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: yes, +130 is a much better score than +150 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|mug: no point using up your energy on pointless overtricks|pg||
nt|mug: just make the contract and move on|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: i agree, but isnt this just a complete gamble. Why should E have a defensive trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?|pg||
nt|othered1: south's raise looks n ormal|pg||
nt|idc: East's choice of dbl rather than 2@s seems to have worked well|pg||
nt|othered1: as does west's opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the rest of the players WN appear to be on a different planet|pg||
nt|idc: Though E-W may get a little too high in @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  Why? Why would East bid again?|pg||
nt|othered1: who is thinking, north or east?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|henryb:  Except to double 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D is not absurd as east|pg||
nt|othered1: west did bid freely at 3-level|pg||
nt|idc: Some might expect extras for West's 3@d - and @cK looks well placed|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|idc: Yup, gathering pace now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: will north express an opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Personally, I'd pass with the West hand over 3@c, since partner's dbl only promises spades for me|pg||

nt|jcomyn: my pazrtners dont|pg||
nt|eggy: I refer you to my honourable friend's reply above John|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not totally trivial here is it? let's say the defence start with three rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now declarer can't draw all the trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Jagger/Seale bid (and made) 6@C on  9 but we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but south ducks the @HA and now there is a heart ruff lurking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they wont be in 4S surely|pg||
nt|mug: South's duck is the key play in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4-0 trump break definitely causes a but of bother|pg||
nt|mug: let's see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of bothere even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would only this one is good-looking|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|athene: double from south now i guess|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: especially if s bids|pg||

nt|jcomyn: rubbitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: end|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: north will have to put a lead-directing 3@C bid in to cause a problem for declarer in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|eggy: Do the panel prefer x of 1S?|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably inferring a diamond fit, but I still hate 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i expect we will get a diamond lead now rather than the club, so no problems|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well well who would have thought that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, south going for a singleton heart opposite perhaps and an immediate knockout with two ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: reasonable defence|pg||
nt|athene: or this might work with hearts 3-3 in the EW hands if north can win a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Does the panel prefer 1@s or 2@c as a response to partner's opening 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly dont like 1s|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Leading three pairs after 17 rounds are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|mug: can she pick the singleton @SJ?|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting point of theory is what the double of 3@C means|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: we have plenty of them here too - the we-didnt-come-here to pass brigade|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with overcalling 4-card suits with good hands is it's really hard to move forwards thereafter, because you are always worried that you will end in a 4-3 fit|pg||
