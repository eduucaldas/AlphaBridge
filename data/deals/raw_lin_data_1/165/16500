nt|mtvesuvius: -3 is right at that point|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but could be only -2 was my point|pg||
nt|othered1: More fun.  I'd expect to pass west's hand and hope to get things in later,  May be a minority position today|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: could be -2 if he led a spade to dumm|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: y|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mtvesuvius: then would score both trumps in hand, as well as a ruff in dummy|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|mtvesuvius: this will be a suprise for Hollands... now he just needs to decide how high|pg||
nt|sybarra: W checking backs of cards to see if same deck with @D overcall|pg||
nt|minimeck: hmm, interesting choice of 1@d instead of 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what EW's 1N overcall range is?  Or do they use it for takeout in some way?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'd be tempted to try a fit jump, but hate my heart suit so much that I think 4@c is reasonable|pg||
nt|tlc: hard to not just bid 5@d...|pg||
nt|othered1: But I personally prefer 1@D to 1N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 1N seems normal|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sybarra: 6?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems a bit much |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: unfortunately for Hollands, his partner is the one with values, instead of the opponents|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm in the 1NT camp too..\|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: change the majors in E hand it 6 rolls home|pg||
nt|minimeck: holland is way out in left field here, he's buying a huge dummy and it still has no play, surely there were other ways to go about this|pg||
nt|tlc: 5 was oplenty|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: I would be very concerned about judging right over a 5@s bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: perhaps 5@c is a winner|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe that it why W chose 6 on the get go|pg||
nt|othered1: it's a tough hand, but 5@D would be my choice.  I'd not get involved with cue-bids or splinters, however|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed,  some level of @D bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: but arrived undoubled |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 6@d is certainly not unreasonable, however it's a punt I'm not willing to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: for what it is worth|pg||
nt|sybarra: its butler scoring|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding their suits gives them too much of a chance to distinguish their hands.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: north and east are playing noughts and crosses|pg||
nt|minimeck: agree adam, bidding your hand accurately instead of a Push & Pray play at least gives u no regrets :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so imped agst the datum I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: imped against the two middle scores|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,   sorry I never get this right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tlc: it's pretty hard to ever bid ur hand accurately with 66 hands in competitve auctions..it usually ends up being someone's guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably chuckles at the table when dummy hits |pg||
pc|h3|nt|mtvesuvius: there is a lot to be said for trying to make it the opponent's guess, and I don't like 5@d since it will often go (5@s)-P-(P) back to me... I think 5@c gets both across, and allows ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: partner to judge reasonably whether to bid onto 6 (or even 7)@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|minimeck: yea that's true jim although he was looking at 1@s at his first call, can't hurt to diagnose further|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
