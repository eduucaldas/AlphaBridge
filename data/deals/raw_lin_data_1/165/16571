mb|1H|nt|fluffy: Hi all This is the Open de Cataluña tournament played in Barcelona|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|fluffy: this match features Juanito Pont and Javier Graupera (NS) one of the best and most succesful pairs in Spain all time against Xavi Massana and Norberto Bocchi, not a regular pair as ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: long as I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they are confirming me now, Javier Graupera actually passed 1@s with 20 HCP on board 1 on the last set and collected +150 only|pg||
mb|3H!|an|3cards|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I think East opened a multi 2@d showing a weak in a major hand or 22-23 balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: or maybe 2@d is just GF hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@s might be artificial|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2NT is a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h is a transfer bid showing spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: 1@s is I think Brazilian style, showing a forcing 1NT hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fluffy: this is the only way to show 10-11 HCP support for hearts|pg||
nt|fluffy: if Llluis opted for showing spades he would have to force to game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: and Xavi now bis 3NT as choice of games|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 2D its For.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 23+|pg||
nt|fluffy: Norberto picks 3NT with his stiff spade|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fluffy: thank you|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|fluffy: some might be surprised by the decision of Norberto to show a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: it is a very common "lie" to show a balanced hand with 4441 and 5431 with a stiff King or Ace|pg||
nt|fluffy: the reason is that showing your shape, specially 4441 across as well as strenght is very complicated, takes 3 rounds of bidding, and in the end partner is unsure if you have 18 or ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: 23|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fluffy: Nacho only has 11 HCP,but he goes for game, 6-4 hands only require the correct 18 HCP to make game (@hAKQ @dAKQ), this is just a dream hand, but actually with a 6-4 hand you might ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: make game with a lot less than 25 HCP|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|fluffy: but when you just go with the balanced approach you define your hand in 1 bid|pg||
nt|fluffy: or something very close to it :)|pg||

nt|fluffy: Walter Johnson will soon join the comentators "team" (that is me at the moment), thx a lot Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ga/e :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this requires to trust partner's spade count with a lot of faith|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|fluffy: A superb result on previous board by EW thx to the unlucky diamond lead from south|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: even without the @D lead it looked like they would be able to scramble 9 tricks and only had 4 losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but the @D lead surely put declarer at ease|pg||
nt|fluffy: at the other table Bocchi found the @sA duck but his partner slipped a bit in the endgame not puling trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: declarer "should" missguess clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fluffy: yes, to defeat it it would be needed some perfect defence, winning @sA on first round wich is almost impossible from the bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: looks like declarer will lose the race to 7 here|pg||
nt|fluffy: graupera makes an agressive switch now, clubs would be great if partner had @cA or @cJ, but sadly he has neither this time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he may even go -2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the proper way to play @cKJ10x vs @cAxxx or @cAJ10x vs @cKxxx is to play the lonely top honnor first|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then finese the queen by low to 10 or jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: would u play @D4 or @D10 from that holding?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fluffy: why? because if you play a force finese by winning @cA and running the @cJ, you only make 3 tricks if the suit breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that's looking at the suit in isolation of course...  other information may (and usually does) indicate a different path|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|fluffy: hey Peter nice to see you again :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|fluffy: and Walter :) I was feeling lonely here|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: if hearts were 4-3 south would be squeezed and the contract might make, but as it is NS have 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer did the right thing to go on spades, if e tries a diamond adventure he loses another trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: Yes as you can see, declarer started the hand by palying hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fluffy: the reason this time is, that you want to knock out north's entry if he has one before touching clubs|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|fluffy: like gazilli and some other stuff I am not very familiar with|pg||
nt|fluffy: Javier graupera opts for a normal 1NT but it is also possible to pass 1@D and let them play them (perhaps doubled) wich might bring a lot of points|pg||

pc|d9|nt|bigtrain: norby has quite a reputation :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: obviously he doesn't know that partner has @d singleton instead of the more likelly @h singleton, but if he investigates the worst that can happen is that he plays 5@c|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|fluffy: yeah me too, I'd definetelly do it with @dKJ942, but I probably wouldn't with @dKJ742, with @dKJ842 its the critical for me, but I would do it as well|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|fluffy: having an easy lead from @cKQx is also a possitive factor|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bigtrain: it's also important to set the tone in long matches...  let them know you will penalize light intervention and they will be less apt to intervene|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|h4|pg||
mc|9|nt|bigtrain: also, it's very likely he's facing short @D since without any stopper help since 2NT is such a convienent bid in the auction|pg||

mb|3H|nt|fluffy: this is probably unknown for anyone not from Bacelnoa|pg||

nt|pelu: depend on system agreements - many would X first|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: yes, but it doesn't take much imagination to construct a hand where 1NT X makes and so does 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: u can also use 2NT as minors from S|pg||
nt|fluffy: constructing a hand consisten with west passing 1NTX will be a lot tougher though|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: but now NS have preblems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fluffy: this makes double dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: but requires verty precise timing|pg||
nt|fluffy: you have to cross ruff all the minors|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then put East in with @sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: but from the bidding is is a possible play|pg||
nt|pelu: S has shown are better hand - but N know that East has @SK so vewry agresssive to go for slam with 5@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, and, what is 5@d anyway? shouldn't it be 5@c?|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer was looking for something amazing on Open room, I am too lazy today to try to igure out what|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fluffy: anyway, note that the key for this hand is to use dummy's entrys properly|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: good start|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D is not in my book :)|pg||
nt|pelu: snd easy ride in OE after a @h-lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: we all know many players who after winning @dA, would draw trumps and then try @c finese, and when they later found north with @sAJ and 1 club honnor would say "I was so unlucky"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|fluffy: you ahve 2 sure entries to dummy: @dA and @hK, and oyu ahve 2 club fineses to do, so you use both entries to do club fineses|pg||

nt|fluffy: and the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: in the other room I mean|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: 3 very expensive bords by NS in OR |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Xavi cannot pass 2@c, not because he has 7 spades, but because he has only 1 club, and parnter might have up to 20 HCP with long clubs, awaiting for us to reopen with a double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: both north and south have stretched to bid 4@h, and its no surpise that they go down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: ouch East makes an agressive double|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fluffy: good for him|pg||
nt|pelu: very few swings in this half - and no expensive misunderstandings by EW - but some defensive problems|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: I like the 4@S opening in OR - |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|fluffy: whenever the auction prceeds 1x open-2y overcall-pass-pass you should try to reopen the hand with a doubl whenever its possiblem adn never pass with a singleton on their suit, nor ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: with a low doubleton I'd say|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes 4@s was a good decision|pg||
nt|fluffy: I can't blame NS for playing 5@c|pg||
nt|fluffy: -1100 looks by a lot I didn't analyce the play, maybe 800 were possible but still a disaster|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|pelu: 5@C is a gamble - "all inn" on a mediuym hand :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I know I would also bid 5@c hehe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|pelu: for sure I will open 4@S against you :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: but it depends on your opponents I guess, my normal opponents when they open 4@s they have an 8 card suit with few values, not 3 defensive tricks hehe|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|pelu: @S3 = for me values in C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
