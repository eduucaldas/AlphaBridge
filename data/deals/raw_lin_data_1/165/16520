mb|p|nt|Walddk2: There is not a lot wrong with 6@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|reisig: 6@d is perfect|pg||
nt|mamos: now this is everybodies slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse grand slams I can reveal|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that much wrong with seven, apart from the trump break|pg||
nt|reisig: Not so tough to bid either|pg||
nt|dburn: but not quite the right odds for a grand slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 53%?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: a fraction less|pg||
nt|dburn: but not a very big fraction|pg||
nt|reisig: over 3@d ...is 4@d asking keycard?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: doubt it - good idea, though|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Kickback is not mainstream among British ladies|pg||
nt|reisig: Normal ...to me :)|pg||
nt|dburn: might as well jsut bid Blackwood, though|pg||
nt|dburn: 4NT has now become shrouded in murk|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can bid 4@C now|pg||
nt|copeyj: well you can bid 4@D to reset @D, or 4@C to show control|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|copeyj: 4@C now agrees @D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but this is daisy-picking|pg||
nt|idc: I remember when kickback in bridge meant bribing the director & scorer - simpler days|pg||
nt|reisig: hmm - I thought @ds agreed before|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  Ian, don't give Copey ideas|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: Kelsey's favourite word, daisy-picking. He has a chapter about it in one of his books|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, someone bid Blackwood|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4NT discouraging !?|pg||
nt|reisig: Yikes|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4NT was rkcb im sure and 5@D 0/3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I hope they know what's going on|pg||
mb|6D|nt|reisig: I have seen worse bidding...but can't remember when|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Worse bidding would not get to 6@D|pg||
nt|mamos: EW are Juniors and both quite inexperienced|pg||
nt|idc: West has no idea whether slam or grand is the target, which is why East should be the one to take control and ask for Aces|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice contract|pg||
nt|mamos: after 3@D    East should take control I agree   - |pg||
nt|idc: I've been impressed by E-W in this match, just a small nitpick this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "The standard will be variable - from World champions to average club players. Once again we have a few pairs who haven't played with screens before and who certainly have never ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: been on BBO. We aim not to put a weak pair on BBO against an expert pair, so there will be a few matches between two below average pairs. We ask the commentators to be aware of the ...|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thank goodness|pg||
nt|copeyj: let's not discuss Hodgson - it is too painful|pg||

nt|copeyj: Yes, Richie, U25 :)|pg||

nt|pitiful:  maybe 2N pass 3@s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: I am happy to pass 3NT after I show 5-6 in the blacks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and to our many enthusiastic commentators|pg||
nt|mamos: spec suggests  Cola is bad for you|pg||
nt|dburn: they have things at the YC bar that are worse for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: too much coca cola|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: whoops op|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Don't leave your seats!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: East ought to bid now, but...|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: ...she didn't, and she may have been a bit lucky not to concede a double partscore swing|pg||
nt|mamos: i wondered if East had left for the bar|pg||
nt|rmb1: A penalty double !?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Kaye will pull to 2@S I think|pg||
nt|idc: Normally this would be takeout, but perhaps they have an agreement that it is two way (East looks at @h length and decides)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: still, West has decided to take a swing at this - not entirely sound, but if South has opened light there could be a big penalty|pg||
nt|mamos: West thinks it is|pg||
mb|3D|nt|idc: or perhaps they play it as penalty when over the @h length|pg||
nt|mamos: but not East|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, it helps if partner knows that double is for penalty, but no harm done|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@D is a tad nuts|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, the penalty available may just have increased|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Frisky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But she won't get doubled|pg||
nt|rmb1: "fearless" was a word David used earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: why not|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would smack it|pg||
nt|copeyj: with the East hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 bangers and 4 trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are not a lady, Simon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least not last I saw you|pg||
nt|copeyj: and partner has penalty doubled 2@H opposite norralot potentially|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not something Simon is frequently accused of|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, David explained that "fearless" was the new BBO term for "bonkers"|pg||
nt|copeyj: get the red flag out|pg||
nt|idc: replacing the word "collings"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What'd I say?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NO double|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: What'da we know |pg||
nt|copeyj: I didnt say she would double|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Alon playing with his father in the first set|pg||
nt|djneill:  interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David Birman now playing with Fohrer in the open room|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok South jumped to 4@s to show a minimum hand, fast arrival|pg||
nt|djneill:  not many losers, but are there 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Things lie pretty well here and the lead doesn't hurt.  Still, declarer has some decisions to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  double finesse in diamonds seems to be the simplest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|othered1: well you still have some entry considerations|pg||
nt|djneill:  that avoids the need for too many ruffs, or possibly even the @c guess if the @h can be used to pitch one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Hasan A. Zaidi|pg||
nt|famus: hi all--merry merry xmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rashed and Hasan!|pg||
nt|famus: hi Ed|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Ed, taking two diamond finesses and the @s finesse means 3 entries, but luckily both diamonds are onside which avoids one of those requirements|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're thinking of pitching @C on @H, are you going to win @HA and finesse J?  GIB would, but GIB peeks.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jcomyn: now thats really treading on dangerous mines|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  in these types of hands, I usually try to think about plays which have to be done no matter what, like the diamond finesse, rather than think too deep|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: gppd [;au|pg||
nt|othered1: good play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzk: Have to alert penalty doubles inEngland|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|famus: planning to pitch @cs now|pg||
nt|djneill:  unfortunately if there is no need to ruff a diamond, it presents a losing option in the way to play spades!  double-finesse against East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2D a lot better than 2H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|eggy: Well all doubles not for take out, in fact|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: depends on the @S play. After taking @HAce |pg||
pc|h4|nt|djneill:  another attraction to the double finesse is that it puts West on lead after one losing finesse, safeguarding the @c|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Gold|pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: of course, there's no guarantee that west has the @DK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|djneill:  yes if East had the @dK, West could always get back to East's hand with it for the @c through|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|eggy: Hello David|pg||
nt|dagold: Good evening (from St Moritz)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|h8|nt|djneill:  if kibs believe the @s should have been played Ace and another, then imagine East with KJx (or West with Kxx or Jxx)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink the lines are equivalent ignoring issues like entries and other considerations outside the trump suit|pg||
nt|famus:  Well zack didn't get to hear Dan--tuff choices|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  agreed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dagold: 3@d is not ideal but closer to the mark|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so where do they end up|pg||
nt|dagold: still, they may end up overboard if Anne bids 3@h as well she might|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as well she will|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: even at the 3-level, you have to push to get into the auction when short in preemptor's suit.|pg||
nt|djneill:  East might infer partner has a singleton @s so not many @s losers|pg||

nt|dagold: well facing akjt to seven and out|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: 4N, probably implies two places to play.   so when east converts @C to @D, h e also shows @H|pg||

pc|d9|nt|djneill:  Zack is in auto-double mode|pg||
nt|djneill:  honor location is critical, and all those honors behind the takeout bode well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|famus: dont think he can avoid -2--too much work|pg||
nt|djneill:  shortened @h forces the heart play from that side, rather than @hA and another|pg||

nt|famus: and the sing @d doesnt help|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: 3 I should say|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  if North keeps playing @s this might make by default with North's @hK skewered, handling problem is those diamonds with the pending ruff|pg||
