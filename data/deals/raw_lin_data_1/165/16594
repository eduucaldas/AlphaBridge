nt|vugraphzzg: The cards were wrong in the holder.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: They have a new set of board 3, which is now correct.|pg||
nt|april7: ifthey don't find out about the K of @S, they might bid 7 with the known 35 P!!!|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|april7: at least 34 on precision bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: -200 -- kiss of death|pg||

nt|disa: this is not the board they r playing|pg||
nt|april7: its another hand probably|pg||
nt|disa: i predict this is board 4|pg||
nt|april7: but here we have a grand on a  finesse|pg||
nt|disa: on this board S will open a strong club and they will relay 2 7 diamonds or 7N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they really playing board 3, Hrafnhildur?|pg||

nt|vugraphzzg: No. The players are playing the wrong board.|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they are relaying correctly it will be 6NT (the most desirable contract in pairs)|pg||
nt|bobholl: we won't know their meanings i guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thorlakur asking|pg||
nt|disa: oh yeah this will take awhile|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H artiicial game-force I believe|pg||

mb|4H|nt|disa: 1H Gf after that everthing N bids asking |pg||
nt|april7: even in 7@D with this 9card fit you need the K of @S in 7@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  no shortness  1NT  no 5-card suit|pg||
nt|disa: actually u don't need it w gets squeezed in the blacks|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: Vienna coup!|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|april7: but how to get to the @C??:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: their is no entry for a vienna |pg||
nt|april7: right!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: so close your eyes and take spade finesse in 7 |pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that  a finesse is the best chance |pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: in this case a singleton @C would be better then a  void, but not on @C lead!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: they are lucky their relay serie didn't work out alrigth|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by some kibs,  dont close eyes for finesse |pg||
nt|Walddk2: here is a link to the full disclosure card: http://bridgefiles.net/VAR2/Systems/SYS-PrecisionIcelandic.htm|pg||
nt|april7: in spite of all the relay bids, they didn't find out about the K, so they might as well bid immediately7 with the N's cards|pg||

nt|dburn: 7NT, but may not be so easy to reach if North-South bid a lot|pg||
mb|d|nt|jwit: Should be an easy grand here.  Interesting 7C would go down with a diamond lead played from the west side.|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 7 @c is on the right hand so no @d ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, overcall showing majors, double showing something or other, 4@s...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: ...and now, East-West will do pretty well to get to seven|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|bessi2: I'm pretty sure 3@c is either @d or both M's|pg||
nt|dburn: OK - North's bid is certainly consistent with that|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure that East's is, but this is a horrible position for him|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|jwit: Pretty wild 6D bid by East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|bessi2: this will make despite the bad @d split|pg||
nt|dburn: still, West did what he could|pg||
nt|bvdahl: might be able to make, thoughm by running @c's|pg||
nt|dburn: he cam make by drawing trumps|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: or by doing this and then running clubs|pg||
nt|bvdahl: still makes by playing clubs now, I thnk|pg||
nt|jwit: No I guess he can still handle it, but more difficult|pg||
nt|bessi2: players are all getting tired,  starting @d with playing low to the king is pretty easy,  especially considering souths overcall|pg||

nt|bessi2: not easy to play k @h and @h to jack as the threat of 2 rounds of @d then is looming|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bessi2: why are baldursson-jonsson, ew all of a sudden ?|pg||

nt|vugraphzzg: I missed this one, I will claim once finished.|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  that was what I was thinking aswell|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe they felt that being North-South hadn't done them much good in the last few rounds|pg||
nt|dburn: so they decided to have a go at East-West|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: but that ought to be OK - East able to compete with 3@c because he plays a strong club|pg||
pg||

pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jwit: EW needed to make an impossible double, granted, not as difficult at matchpoints as at imps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|bvdahl: but EW could have competd to 3@h and made 140 at least|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but they needed the spade finesse right for that to make.  Of course, if the spade finesse is wrong NS make 3D|pg||
nt|bessi2: difficult hand for e-w.. they can hardly dbl 3@d,  and with only 8card fit and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|bvdahl: +100 EW can't be much more than 25% I think|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jwit: I agree, tough to push especially for East in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but North will overcall at the one level at a lot of tables|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|dburn: he couldn't over 1@d at this one, of course|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bvdahl: sure, NS will be in the auction, but hard to see many score worse than 100 EW|pg||
nt|bvdahl: since both alternatives to passing over 3@d yield bigger scores|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jwit: West might have taken the push over 3D with four pretty good trumps, but probably worried his KJx of clubs not worth very much underneath the 2NT bidder, especially with South ...|pg||
nt|jwit: preferring diamonds.|pg||

nt|bessi2: really don't understand Jonsson passing 3N.. after 3@h NF,  4@d over 3N surely shows he has a relatively weak red hand|pg||
