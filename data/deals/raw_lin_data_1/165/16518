nt|Walddk2: Good evening to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is "Ray" Georgina?|pg||
nt|dburn: no, just Georgia|pg||
nt|idc: I feel for the players: first board of a long weekend you look forward to 1NT with 7 top tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Georgia Ray|pg||
nt|idc: instead, this|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: Very convenient with same first name|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: What do you think about 3@C?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|copeyj: sort of feels like you have to, but very playable in @H|pg||
nt|mamos: like it better than 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind 3@d all that much - aim at 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Not sure why they piked up board 1|pg||
nt|dburn: and 4@d might be some sort of Leaping Kangaroo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Screens so I guess op can not see North's pass until East calls.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|copeyj: Bryony likely to bid 4@h now I wld guess|pg||
nt|idc: I guess 3NT is fine with South holding a singleton club honour|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she might bid 4@h, but she probably should not|pg||
nt|dburn: she doesn't have a bad dummy for 3NT at all|pg||
nt|idc: a lot better than East has as a dummy in 4@h certainly|pg||
nt|copeyj: East has a pretty useful dummy for 4@H imo|pg||
nt|rmb1: Her club holding is important for 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKAK|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, East can correct to diamonds and there will be no harm done|pg||
nt|copeyj: well doesnt 4@H make anyway, David?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She may make 4@H too, who knows|pg||
nt|idc: For sure - was just trying to whet the audience's appetite for a bidding disaster|pg||
nt|dburn: depends how she plays - she can win a club lead and ruff a diamond, but if she tries a spade to the ace instead...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: oh|pg||
nt|rmb1: we shall see ...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Or she could play to lose just 1 spade and 2 hearts|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Discarding 2 clubs on diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and she does|pg||
nt|dburn: good view - not sure I'd have done that|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, North might barely have a singleton diamond rather than a void spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ruffing a club is safer than trying to enter her hand with a spade|pg||
nt|copeyj: but if you have 3@h losers you need to establish the @D to throw the losing @s|pg||
nt|rmb1: Only now the diamonds have stood up|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This will also work but it was scary|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|copeyj: what is right line in @H - A then J i spose - only 4-2 break is HT dbleton or TX dbleton|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Much sweat for her 420|pg||
nt|copeyj: @C ruff with the @HK now and a spade ruff for Barton and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: A "Heather" managed +480 in 4@H on board 6|pg||
nt|mamos: yep all that matters at the end is writing the score in the plus column|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Women don't sweat, they perspire I am told. Thanks for letting me know|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no - horses sweat and men perspire, but women only glow|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|copeyj: K@C is a mistake|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mamos: well bryony is glowing then :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: should play low @C to get pard to ruff|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|dburn: 2NT may have been intended as lebensohl but taken as scrambling|pg||
nt|copeyj: misunderstanding about scarmbling 2N v lebensohl 2N here|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes David you beat me to it|pg||
nt|idc: Where game is not really likely as here, many prefer to play 2NT as a scramble - and West's 3@d suggests she may think that|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bid 3@C to avoid misunderstandings if you have no agreement is my advice|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ebu.co.uk/internationals/ladiestrials.htm  for entry list|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dburn: 3NT isn't very likely to make on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like double  prefer to bid two suits|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, it isn't very likely to be bid either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading three pairs guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is North going to bid again?|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind double - would hate to think I had to make two bids with a misfitting five count|pg||

nt|copeyj: I would have put my house on west passing, David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Travelling to London to play 1@C, not me|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stockdale now playing with Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|copeyj: Stockdale and Youngs split because Youngs moved to the USA to do her postgrad stuff, but she has been back for a few years now|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot of English pairs now play a strong no trump, and that will be more of a struggle than 1@c|pg||

nt|rmb1: Even 1@C may be a struggle|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H or 2NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h regarded as orthodox now|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: definitely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Qx is usually a good holding for notrumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: indeed but if partner over 2@H bids 3@C or something now you can suggest 3N|pg||
nt|mamos: especially if p has AKxx|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wd Georgia, that's my gal!|pg||
nt|rmb1: orthodoxy has not reached NS|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, in real Acol 2@h would not be forcing (and neither would 2NT)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|copeyj: thing is|pg||
nt|idc: yes, you'd need to bid an artificial 3@d or something playing trad Acol where 4th suit not game forcing|pg||
nt|copeyj: this auction cld be a singleton @H with south the way many people play not|pg||
nt|copeyj: and QX is a BIG difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They stayed out of it? Disappointing :(|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thought you never open 1nt on 5-4-2-2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: do you like 1NT with Qx and Qx.  We do but I like more in the doubletons and less in the long suits|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a big fan of slightly offshape NTs, but not with 5@C-4@s..rebids are too easy|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: anyway, I imagine all roads lead to ROme|pg||
nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we all know if u are in slam the KJ108 will be in the E hand|pg||
nt|lml: either hand will do|pg||
nt|tlc: and the club's off|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||

nt|dburn: or the club non-finesse, which is what declarer played, I assume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heather Bakhshi had no particular reason to get it right|pg||
nt|dburn: especially since she was dummy|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another Roland slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK; so the other Heather|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: or early spade leads - North probably should not have played for ruffs with four trumps against a known seven-card (at best) fit|pg||

mb|3C|nt|copeyj: from Kaye, rather. I have already been asked not to use maiden names|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The other room's 3NT didn't work well, but hard to stop with the N-S cards|pg||
nt|copeyj: wrong to bid 3@S with a 4333 hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|dburn: is she married?|pg||
nt|tlc: right, 2@s is plenty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Guess clubs and make it|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps he meant first names|pg||
nt|copeyj: is who married|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: she|pg||
nt|rmb1: Someone with a maiden name|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Barton has taken a pessimistic view of her 11 count|pg||

nt|dburn: is it?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h looks optimistic to me|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: She should have doubled at his first turn if she wanted to introduce hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: this is an awkward feeling auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: OK, but this won't go 4 down|pg||

nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|lml: she had to hold on to dummy's hearts|pg||
