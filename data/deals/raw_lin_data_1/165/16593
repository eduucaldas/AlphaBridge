mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Eyjafjallajökull erupted again I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: undo, bet @C is bid by W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
nt|vugraphzzg: The trouble has been our internet connection, it should be up and running now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  I doubt it, Shirley. North presumably showed 5@s and a 5 card minor, and South's bid is "pass or correct"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right,   |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|sybarra: and gm Henry |pg||

nt|disa: they've qed for the next one 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  nice end holding by West: three Jacks|pg||
nt|henryb:  30 is a strange board to start|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we might be "catching up" |pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h showed 5+@h, 4@s and less than sound values|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@h showed 4+ @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This will drift 1 off, sooner or later, presumably later|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many pairs now play some method to show both majors in response to 1 of a minor with a hand too weak to bid over a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|april7: for example 2@H: 5-4 in @S @H and 7-9P|pg||
nt|april7: 5-9|pg||
nt|bobholl: i like 2@H to show 5@S and 4+@H so you don't miss @H after 1@D 1@S 2@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a heart shift to the 10 might have led to 2 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club shift did not help declarer; he could get rid of a loser himself on a spade later|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hardly at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: has E enough for a vulnarable weak 2 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so a pshyce?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: oh yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|april7: again a @D partscore hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has 10 tops|pg||
nt|disa: easy 10 trcks here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|henryb:  Just plays W for @dQ|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|bobholl: but if @D 3-1 he has to duck indeed for 9 :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|april7: if he has to give up a trick to @D Q|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: But this is MP, you can't afford to play safe|pg||
nt|bobholl: not much possibilities in @H and @C so duck seems rigth|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|april7: to rectify the count!|pg||
nt|sybarra: kibber asked (although not applicable here)  are psyches allowed on artificial bids?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|pc|d8|nt|bobholl: guess so but it is never handy |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|disa: i think this tournament is played pretty much by wbf rules|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In some places you are not allowed to psyche your strongest bid, 2@C/1@C depending on system|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: after 2@H and a of @C small @C duck is possible :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  And in North America you are not allowed to psyche an artificial opening|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In NA you are not allowed to bid much that isn't invented in NA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Everything else is bad per definition|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not actually true, Roland|pg||
nt|bobholl: on low level multi 2@D are forbidden in the US isn't it (only in IMP at higl level ?)|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi Roland @h|pg||
nt|disa: 6 or more boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And an opening showing a weak hand with both majors is also barred|pg||
nt|disa: per round then you can play multi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ridiculous, as both suits are known|pg||
