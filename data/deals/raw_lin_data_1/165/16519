mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mamos: y|pg||

nt|vugraphzzj: Gross in deeeeep thought|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a re-raise?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think weak 56 hands are often best opened 1@h|pg||
nt|idc: Even a pass is possible, hoping to catchup later and get both suits in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leading three pairs after 17 rounds are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||
nt|idc: Interesting bidding problem for both E & W - I think a 3-card @h fragment in East is likely on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: so West should stick with @d - and probably at this level, not slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well judged|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: That wasn't the defence's best lead - the @s ruff North gets will be with her 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|idc: and meanwhile declarer's @c loser will have disappeared|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|idc: Just noticed the auction in the other room - I expect South wishes she had passed 4@s with hindsight|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Director  just called '25 minutes'|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gross a rubber bridge player so her cardplay is normally pretty sharp (hope I don't put the kiss of death on her)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|copeyj: but if partner has @SA you have it beaten probably - I am not saying it is easy to lead @CA but it is certainly a lively possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Misfits seem to be the theme of this set|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: might pass now |pg||
nt|copeyj: even though 3@D technically FG|pg||
nt|copeyj: tough to see a game|pg||
nt|idc: As a lover of puns I must pass on one from a spec: they asked "don't they have miss fits in the Lady Milne?"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 1NT response would work better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Rosen did in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a very tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For all Stockdale knows they could have a slam on in a red suit|pg||
nt|idc: I think I'd admit to heart support with the North hand - 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|idc: The good news is that 4@h is a very borderline game, and likely to go down as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree that 3@H is slightly better than 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, I thought 3@D is game-forcing|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Bridge is too difficult if new suit at the 3 level is not forcing to game in my opinion|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: It's plenty difficult as it is|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure it was FG for Stockdale too|pg||
nt|mamos: it is clear though that 3@h is much better   youve already denied three card support with 2@s|pg||
nt|idc: This is a tough hand for defence & declarer, but one where most semi-sensible lines of play lead to -2|pg||
nt|copeyj: but when she realised no fit, and partner's 2@S was NF, she decided to pass|pg||
nt|idc: the players think it is tough, but as the cards lie almost all choices lead to the same result|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|h5|pg||

mb|2S|nt|dburn: but even so, you might risk 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unlucky to go down in 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: this is an unlucky 4@h too|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But they can't get there|pg||
mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|an| |mb|p|nt|idc: There's a sensible theory that the more points you have the more inclined you should be to play 3NT with balanced hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D at least one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (I guess)|pg||
mb|3N|an| |mb|p|nt|rmb1: puppet stayman to get strong/wrong hand as declarer - no|pg||
nt|idc: rather than risk a 4-4 major fit when a bad break may scupper you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 3NT now shows both majors for them|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: it does|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With both majors some play that 4@C is slam interest, 4@D no interest after opener has shown a major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: unless of course 3NT was forcing - i.e. could be based on a slam try|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|idc: Spec just made that very point to me David - South hand opposite 4-4 in majors may well play better in 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: and that 3NT is natural where responder was just looking for a 5-card major|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: kybosh is a Scottish dialect|pg||
nt|dburn: either "kibosh" or "kybosh" is sactioned by the clever men at Oxford, though the former is more common|pg||

pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Hugh has a standard phrase when he tables dummy: "Sorry if I am wrong, partner"|pg||
nt|dburn: the most plausible theory is that the word comes from the Gaelic "cie bias", a black cap worn by a judge pronouncing a death sentence|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rmb1: What strength was 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: it had an upper limit of 14|pg||

pc|sA|nt|copeyj: well it helps partner find what is likely the best lead, but against that it allows the opps XX and pass as extra options|pg||

nt|Walddk2: She made one more try with 4@S, got 5@C, then basically signed off in 5@H. Does not make much sense to me|pg||

nt|copeyj: 5cM 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ian|pg||
nt|copeyj: Stockdale/Brown are 5cM 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|copeyj: two of the pairs one would expect to be in contention|pg||
nt|copeyj: for selection|pg||

nt|copeyj: Sure - but I doubt you are a fan of missing games either|pg||
nt|copeyj: There was an alternative on this hand - cld double given the presence of 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All reasonable choices|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: I have no strong feelings|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

nt|copeyj: pass 3rd for me|pg||
pc|s7|nt|copeyj: NICE switch from Gross|pg||
nt|copeyj: attacking the entry|pg||
nt|idc: Influenced by style of opening bids of course - used to open a lot of balanced 11 counts and aggresive Multis & Lucas twos|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, very good shift|pg||
nt|idc: If you open with a wide variety of hands, takes the pressure off a little later on|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: but East didn't know the position - declarer could have had better spades and worse diamonds|pg||
