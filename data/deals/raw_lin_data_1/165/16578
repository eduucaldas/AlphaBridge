nt|by:  it is a very challenging kind of hand -- the shape misfit!  let's see EW handles this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|by:  if you can bid out the hand and still play 3N knowing what you are doing, you are very good bidders|pg||
nt|by:  the other table result was excellent for NCTU|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|by:  the NCTU system has 2@H FG, which *should* make it easier|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|by:  but note that the 3@S rebid, which indicates that 2@S is catchall, is about to lead them overboard|pg||
nt|by:  defining which bids are catchall is a very important part of constructive bidding theory|pg||
nt|by:  here, they are about to play 4@H like the other table, I think|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Unless there's something subtle about this auction I don't understand, I"d think east was done over 4@H|pg||
nt|by:  For those who just joined, this is the 18th National Taiwan University Cup, the longest running collegiate event in Taiwan, run by the eponymously named school's bridge club, and one of the most prestigious college events in that nation. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|by:  This is the semifinals contested between the schools who finished 1-2 in last year's National Collegiate Cup|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N might have stumbled by but with this lead, declarer figures not to lose imps here.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|by:  now perhaps declarer will put up the DT, takes three rounds of clubs pitching hearts, ruff a heart, and play by ear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem was Hsu's 3rd spade bid. I think most would bid 3NT|pg||
nt|by:  Which suit would have led, Ed?  it seems hard to tell since you don't know if EW had a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|d3|pc|sA|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|by:  All right, a 10-card fit and a 11-card minor hand, let's see what happens here|pg||
nt|jonky:  after some missed plays by East and North, the contract ended at -2, a push|pg||
mb|2S!|an|7-9 4+!h w/ short|nt|by:  let's see what raise structure EW uses, i remember that they this is some kind of invitational splinter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Chance for Shih to get 2NT in|pg||
nt|by:  with any shortness, which i always thought gives N too good a chance to show spades|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is normal here.  Do EW play a limited 1-bid system?  If not, I'd prefer a limit raise of some sort on west's hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  It's an unspecified minisplinter|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a reasonable choice.|pg||
nt|by:  so yes, it is what you ordered|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Would 2NT ask for the singleton I wonder|pg||
nt|othered1: If 1@H isn't limited, I'd fear that 4@H cold miss a good-fitting slam.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|by:  my understanding is that E was supposed to ask with 2!N|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  I don't know the rest of their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  if anyone from NCTU does, please speak up|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess if east isn't interested in bidding slam opposite any minisplinter, then 4@H keeps things simple and gives the opponents less information.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Chang's choice to just raise to 4@H in the other room was fair I think|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|lorderic: @S lead gives an overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wkc:  oops|pg||
nt|lorderic: S should bid 4@D after 3NT for a slam try|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what 3NT shows, but if it shows extra, S should move on to the slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree, pass seems a little underbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and if it shows min, then N should bid something else|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wkc:  and if it includes a wide range, then maybe they should discuss a little more about their system|pg||

mb|1D|nt|othered1: fi they play minisplinters, wasn't west's hand a maximum?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Gitelman-Moss do actually|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They use 2NT as an old-fashioned game raise with a balanced hand without support|pg||
nt|by:  that's a former canadian for you :P|pg||
nt|othered1: I do when I play standardish -- minisplinters get you to "air" games and slams.  There is a price, however.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|by:  Ok, guys, we have someone who said that they play 3@C as vague slam try, nothing showed|pg||
nt|by:  So not clear why E signed off|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: I wonder what minisplinter west could hold that would be right for slam and that west would recognize was the case.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very optimistic by Yang in the other room facing a 13-15 1NT (is my guess)|pg||
nt|by:  anyway, NS has somewhat better value judgment here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|by:  Well, if 13-15 I think you have to raise to game.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have to?|pg||
nt|jonky:  however, this 24hcps 1NT is still challenging|pg||
nt|by:  but this brilliant lead might set even 1NT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: it's a non-vul game, so here north's inaction over 1N is reasonable.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Invites don't exist any more I suppose|pg||
nt|by:  not after this beginning ... this is a problem with MUD|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|wkc:  if it's a 12-14 1NT, then N did bid aggressively|pg||

nt|wkc:  now they have a chance to get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: a raise to 3@S now would get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: W chooses an aggressive one|pg||

nt|lorderic: it's too risky due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree. in competative bidding, one should raise pd's suit as soon as possible|pg||

nt|othered1: 4@S found in CR is a phantom, but it easily could have been right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a phantom on a diamond lead, if you guess spades|pg||
nt|by:  in the other table, I think that 3@H may have been a mixed raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What is West supposed to lead?|pg||
nt|by:  the ace of spades?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is that obvious?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think diamond is much more likely|pg||
nt|by:  really?|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what 3@H in the CR meant.  If they play 2N as a raise, 1.5 quick tricks and good support seems just right.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA would be my last choice|pg||
nt|by:  Yes, HERE there is no spade bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Here, west may lead @D, since east didn't bid.  Had he bid @S, @SA is quite reasonable|pg||

nt|Walddk2: When I lead a singleton trump my partner always has Qxx|pg||
nt|othered1: This lead should permit east to simplify the defense with the return.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|by:  of you believe partner has some scattered cards, in which case a club should be better than diamonds?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|by:  and Roland, if your partner ALWAYS have the Qxx, clearly you shouldn't be leading them at all :P|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|by:  here, the @CJ is onside 3-3|pg||
nt|lorderic: anyone would open with E hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  so unless the NS defenders get to their heart tricks, 3N would make on bad defence|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@S/S is likely to be the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: about 20 mins left, they might finish 12 boards now.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lorderic: W must find a @H lead to set it, otherwise S can pinches @H on @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|wkc:  4@S opening is not my style|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lorderic: @S again choose to be aggressive by opening 4@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lorderic: opening with E hand is not my choice. but they will definitely bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|by:  I think that most people opens today|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lorderic: if E passes, the bidding could be p-1@D-1@H-2@C-2NT-p|pg||
pc|cK|nt|by:  i don't agree with it, but that's fashion|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lorderic: neither do i|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a weak hand with 4+ support|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|by:  I usually ask my students *not* to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|by:  typically|pg||
nt|by:  both have a spade stop|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h5|pc|s7|nt|wkc:  now she'll play a @C because she knows her contract is always making if @D split 3-3|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|wkc:  playing @C gives her another chance, like now|pg||
nt|by:  the usual weakness is a heart or a club, but if you misguess which one, the result can look really foolish.  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|lorderic: usually @S is not a great lead on this kind of auction. but for @S hand it's very difficult to pick from either @H or @C|pg||
pc|d8|nt|by:  and it would be really bad if you have to lead the @h8 from this holding, blowing up the suit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a @D ruff to set the contract|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|lorderic: on board  9, EW bid 3NT doubled, and N happily cashes 6 top tricks for -2|pg||
nt|by:  see?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|by:  :) you have to save your winners |pg||
nt|wkc:  oops, I mislooked|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|by:  I think that it is best for S to follow with the jack on the second round|pg||
nt|lorderic: i have no idea why @S did not draw another trump|pg||
nt|lorderic: like KC said the contract might go down if he get 2 @D ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|wkc:  I'll play @D right after I get a @C trick, now I only need @D split not worse than 4-2|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|h3|nt|by:  yes, much better that way|pg||
nt|lorderic: NTHU finally pick up 12 IMPs from board  20|pg||
nt|wkc:  so NTHU did set 3NT on board 20 to go back on track|pg||
nt|lorderic: but they are still  27.5 IMPs behind|pg||
nt|by:  declarer is ready to claim|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzxs: just a finesse|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|by:  Note how 4@S will be a very bad contract, and 3N will be terrible if NS can keep E off lead, otherwise it will score on the lucky @c position|pg||
pc|d5|nt|by:  this is a good start|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|by:  good play by declarer to give S a critical decision early.  a better shift would have been a spade, but he doesn't know this.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|by:  a good shift would be the @HQ here. but defenders just have to avoid catastrophes|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|lorderic: a grand slam here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lorderic: 2@D shows a weak 2 in major|pg||
nt|wkc:  let's see if NS could get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: precision-style 1@D opening|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|by:  that is very conservative by west|pg||
nt|by:  note that 7@SX is set six, which is better than letting 7@H play|pg||
nt|wkc:  5@S by S?|pg||
nt|by:  well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lorderic: 2@S is pass or correct and become the contract|pg||
nt|by:  if S hear 5@S by S, what could he bid other than 7@H?|pg||
nt|by:  I think for most opponents at this level who plays negative free bids, 3@S is probably best|pg||
nt|wkc:  I expect the same contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: lets see if EW could get their @h ruff to set it|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  since no one would ever be sure again what is trumps|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|lorderic: she must have good understanding on W overcall style|pg||
nt|lorderic: for me I would bid @C again on E hand, and pass by W|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|lorderic: good one!|pg||
nt|wkc:  nice bid|pg||

mc|9|nt|lorderic: he managed for 9 tricks, still a good 8 IMPs |pg||

mb|p|nt|by:  this hand gets passed out|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|by:  i am not sure that this is an advance|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|by:  i think as north, it is better to bid 1NT|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|by:  lead does not give anything away.  and the declarer has a hard job if the defenders don't give away anything further|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|by:  looking at the hands, you would take the @dA, and I guess come back a heart.  The hands are very tangled|pg||
nt|by:  it is not clear that single dummy what would have been the best defence|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|lorderic: thanks to KC, and all of you watching here!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|lorderic: not quite sure what 3NT is|pg||
nt|jonky: If 2@C GF, N should bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jonky: Then if S rebid 3@C, can go to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to show a 16-18 bal hand ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: another precision-style 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C could be longer @C than @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a tough decision on S hand|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lorderic: he is not sure which minor is longer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lorderic: beating 2@S is not enough for NTHU|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: since 2@C could be a wide range of hands, it's not good to waste so many spaces by bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know their thought haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: still a safe contract here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2NT would be kind of overbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  thanks eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: that is how they do in the whole match|pg||
nt|wkc:  I agree, he knows that they are misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2C means 54/45 minors |pg||
nt|lorderic: another aggressive 3NT, any chance here?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wkc:  it will be a quick one|pg||
nt|by:  alas|pg||
nt|by:  only makes it close|pg||
nt|wkc:  and a 10 point inv is absolutely overbid to me|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's true. but when you choose between playing in 4-2 trump or overbid, i choose the latter|pg||
nt|lorderic: pass 2@C/correct to 2@D could also be disaster|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
nt|lorderic: @S is thinking which suit split 33, @D or @S?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lorderic: since @S split 3-3 should be making 5, 13 IMPs to NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: so after the first half NCTU is ahead by 22.5 IMPs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lorderic: we might broadcast on the other QF|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lorderic: @S has to guess @C right and wish @D split 3-3 to take the contract home|pg||
nt|lorderic: duh... i means SOUTH not SPADE|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|lorderic: I will put a low club on this one|pg||
