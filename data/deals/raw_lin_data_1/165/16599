mb|p|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||

nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|gf|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
nt|peachy: E wants a diamond lead, I assume|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a challenging hand to make, but not impossible|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|peachy: But I believe Justin would make it.  Has to avoid giving too many natural spade tricks to the opponents|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|chilloncan: and bad choice of spade to ruff with. if he ruffed higher and save smaller...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: this 3D preempt is better than opening 5NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: other than that i dont see its charm. medocre suit, bad shape, and way too low a ratio of offense to defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this will be interesting|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: also you have a decent dummy for either major|pg||

nt|chilloncan: maybe S thinks he is down 50|pg||
nt|caitlin: with preempt then 3N, not uncommon to lay down an Ace to look at dummy|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the milne team are all under 30, indeed a couple of them are under 20 with smirnov the "senior" on the team at age 28|pg||

nt|sybarra: weak jump by N?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|andreasw:  milne trying for slam :)|pg||

nt|pelu: West are missing 3 keycards ; 2 Aces and @HK - can pd have 2 of them?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|peachy: this again will be a challenge when diamond development and entries make it a tangle|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: I expect defenders will prevail|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|marcsmith: North has to duck the first round of trumps, then I don't think declarer can make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA looks like weaker lead than @SK  -- that's typical of current treatment, but in the olden days Ace was the strong lead [for unblock or count]|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|marcsmith: now it's easy|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N is the system opening for Thompson|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 1N = (11)12-14  and conventionally covers some distributions that would surprise many|pg||
nt|tez: operation time:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: random decision for who declares 4@S  seems if East declares, no @H lead so extra overtricks|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|tez: if they play weak nt i belive you must bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson's other option was a limited 2@D opening which is unbal, but that's an ugly @D suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but with a transfer [seems normal]   North has natural @H lead|pg||

nt|marcsmith: surely not the systemic action on this???|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i think 2N= a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: This is another of their 3-9 two suiters, blacks this time|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hardly what I'd call a -suiter|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = limit raise, exactly 3@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Actually, According to their score books, the 4H made|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: surely not sound either|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes systemic, we have knowledgeable kib|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i initially forgot East was passed hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o 4@H on time makes more sense|pg||
nt|marcsmith: bizarre|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: 2NT likely inquiry|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: as pointed out - after pull last trump - unblock @C honor when Nunn flies Ace  |pg||
nt|marcsmith: think I'd rather open 1@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: nice stop here for ew|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mrdct: thin values, no fit, no source of tricks = no game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3@H presumably maximum with clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: @D10 may make it easier for Hans to find @C shift|pg||
nt|tez: @c now|pg||
nt|tez: declarer has aqjx in @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @DK will get @C shift too, but it is harder after that Trick 1 play|pg||
nt|tez: @d 1t won|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes --- i'm just saying @DT makes @C shift much easier than @DK|pg||

pc|d4|nt|peachy: the method gained them 5 IMPs in this match, here is another gain|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: that puts klinger back in the lead    2 imps with 3 boards to play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2 boards left|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: it will be interesting to see if defense is different at other tables when @DK is played at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14  covers many shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year there was a big discussion on BBO Forum [or r.g.b] about whether or not to use conventional runout after Weak 1N - DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the conclusion matched the arguments about 1M-1N  forcing vs semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each camp is absolutely sure their treatment is right and the other treatment is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and vice versa :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we really waiting for Jacobs' bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one runout scheme uses RDBL to force bid of 2@C   the other would bid 2@C as Natural [totally new concept]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner gets to rest the rest of the evening -- qualifying into semi-final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loser plays 32 more boards in the Quarter Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: in my book, leading from xxx is typically the worst, J10x not really so|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in this seat, some play RDBL=2 suit |pg||
nt|marcsmith: yet another dull game for NS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'd much rather lead from xxx than from Jxx|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahh  there ya go|pg||
nt|marcsmith: South was remiss there -- 3@H redoubled is where i'd like to play this deal|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and there's the flaw with the initial PASS  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=a) 7-9 3@S or b) 5-9 4@S|pg||
nt|peachy: I once read (I'd swear it was a Mike Lawrence book) that leading from xxx has the same effect on your defense as a sleeping pill would have on your attention span|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry  maybe "flaw" is too harsh|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marcsmith: you have to make the oppo pay for making stupid lead-directing doubles|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Tony Nunn out for blood with his half trick|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i should say the played well in both sets|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|marcsmith: 3@H-XX would make 9 or 10 for a nice little gain|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: @C ruff gains extra trump trick, but loses @H      i think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: @S shift -- just didn't occur to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D8 still looming large|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Sartaj just plugs away with major suit cards he eventually score all 3 trump tricks for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but surely @HK most likely to establish an extra trick if partner holds any more points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson still has 1N opener without @HQ |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's 1     now what Bill?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: remember  Thompson didn't have a weak bid available in opening seat [even if he wanted one]|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer just has to be careful not to get a spade ruffed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrdct: the weak NT working well for EW here as NS scramble to find a fit|pg||
