nt|psridhar: Hi re :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|motbocaj: Good evening all|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Ragnsell2011  for standings|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|motbocaj: Now I happen to know it is 9:30 in Bergen at the start of this set|pg||
nt|motbocaj: because they start the fisrt day at 10am and when I played in this a couple of years ago we turned up at 10am for the 2nd day as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S won the event in 2009, and funnily enough Marstrander won the event last year with his RHO, Malinowski|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|psridhar: 1N is what the doctor Ordered for E here; they hv opted for 2@d -may go down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: ew need to make 7 tricks for a decent score|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1N is tougher to defend and certainlly will be the choice of majroty i suspect|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 2@d may make now , South had to return the trump |pg||
nt|motbocaj: a low spade and the JH switch will do it -- tough though|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: they seem to have found it|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I overlooked the 9H though... |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|psridhar: wrapped up now i think|pg||
nt|psridhar: +90 to EW|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: needs to guess the @s postion though |pg||
nt|psridhar: win in hand and play the @s 10 -easy to see for us|pg||
nt|bobholl: K or 9 third that's the question|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: one clue is S is marked with llength in @s-both from bidding and from the low @s shift|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sK|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: -300 is as deadly as -200 and S is very ligth :)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: the pre-balancing was very light on high cards ....even with  a fit he is in for -300|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobholl: it will be earlier -500 than -100 @D 8 promoting|pg||
nt|motbocaj: although it's very unlikely at some stage the defence will need to get the stiff A@D unblocked or declarer could get a @H ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: bad prediction that -500 :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|motbocaj: he could just ruff a club with the @D6 to prevent a useful trump promotion|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pfbr: morning Roland :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: escaped with d1 now?|pg||

nt|motbocaj: might make 3NT  as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: even NT partial makes 120 at least for ew|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: East and South are both unhappy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|motbocaj: 14-14 in the final set of Kuy/Sch at aussie open...|pg||
nt|bobholl: take the profit :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 2@S a psyche I wonder or does it show the minors|pg||
nt|bobholl: misunderstanding i guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: was that 2@S intended as Psyche or some system bid for minors and W forgot?|pg||
nt|psridhar: this time Roland beat me to ti :)|pg||
nt|motbocaj: take it in 50's?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Good idea even at these colours|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you make 2@S you score 150|pg||
pc|d5|nt|motbocaj: could be deliberate if opps double of 2@S takeout|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|motbocaj: this way you get to play spades with the benefit of the lead :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|psridhar: this NS score will beat all partials across the field-EW can only do better than penlaties from EW or an unlikely game NS way|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|psridhar: slam time!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Artur is a co-owner of TGRs Bridge Club in central London, near Marble Arch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGR = The Great Rose, named after the late and great Great Britain player, Irving Rose|pg||
mb|6H|nt|psridhar: N will find out about @h king and @s ace via kcb-he only needs to know about his pd's holding in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess this is limit with 4 trumps|pg||
nt|motbocaj: he doesn't want a @D lead|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
mc|12|nt|motbocaj: he doesn't need the AK@S at all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This approach comes from rubber bridge, and he plays a lot of that at TGRs|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: 4min left of the round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No science, don't reveal anything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Take your money and cash in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The stakes are high|pg||
nt|motbocaj: Anyway while we are waiting.. we turned up at 10am on the 2nd day and had missed a few rounds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you were half an hour late on the Sunday, Tom?|pg||
nt|bobholl: next time his P @C and @D are interchanged and no @C lead i think 6@H is good practical bid|pg||
nt|motbocaj: The director sadly informed us that we would get 40 per cent for those|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably a profit :)|pg||
nt|motbocaj: but brightened as he pointed out we had only managed 44 the day before anyway|pg||

pc|cK|nt|psridhar: E will show a profit even if she takes 7 trikcs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A transfer would have kept E-W out of it, would it not?|pg||

nt|psridhar: about a 60% score i wd guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 102 is the last board of the tournament, so a long day ahead of us. Also broadcasts from India and England|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C with weak 2@D incorporated has the advantage of less bidding in between :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt it, because it is almost always a weak 2 in diamonds and you treat it as such when defending|pg||

nt|motbocaj: KIng tides in Auckland, widespread flooding where the sea is up over motorways|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 2 3NT put malinowsky back 3 places :)|pg||
nt|motbocaj: An old fashioned 2@D response on that last hand would allow a stop in 2@S, 1@S 2@D 2@H 2@S all pass|pg||

nt|psridhar: well South had the option to duck and wait for signal later|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please explain Smith, PS. I am pretty sure that most spectators don't know what that is|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  Smith Peter is where a high-low or low-high in declarer's suit tells partner|pg||
nt|psridhar: Smith signal relates to a defender's attitude to the opening lead..|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  about support or not support for the opening lead.|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play HL in the first suit of the leader you like the lead (MECKwell play it reversed)|pg||
nt|psridhar: u play high on declarers first suit to say u like the lead and vice versa|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  people play a variety of combinations|pg||
nt|motbocaj: I don't think a low @H switch would have worked, on the run of the minors south would have to discard the 10 & 8 of @H's anyway to keep Kx@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course u cant smith with a stiff :) i guess everyone understands that !!|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it becomes much more important if your primary signalling is count, or if your play to the opening lead was forced|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  people only use it against NT contracts, but I guess it could apply to suits|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes many play smith in suit contracts as well -very useful|pg||
