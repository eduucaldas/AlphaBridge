mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: maybe North should have bid 2@h instead of 3@c |pg||
nt|jchiu: with the west hand, i prefer one heart, since it is enough to double back in, especially when n/s bid clubs|pg||
nt|rv: he had super-max @CAK and @DQ, that might have prompted South to bid NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: North's 3@c is weaker action than 2@h, normally 2@h on 2@c would be game forcing, from passed hand it would only show super-max|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|jchiu: just a very fortunate game, but i do agree that two hearts by north is a stronger hand, and three clubs a few more clubs (still eight losers)|pg||

nt|lorderic: BTU is ahead by 7.5 IMPs, 12 boards to go|pg||

nt|jonky: instead of take out|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|jonky: Another slam|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree with rest of the panel on O/C with West hand in last deal|pg||
nt|jchiu: a reasonably good diamond slam, and again about diagnosing club shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rv: here some artificiality will help playing std methods|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jchiu: a somewhat sticky call, i would prefer to improvise|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: as Kuo did with 2he, which gives him a chance to force ... the hand is simply too good for 3di playing modern methods|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|rv: I like a bid of 2@h with South hand as conventional to cater to variety of strong hands with relay continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: if Shih can now force to game without eating much room, they sand a fine chance to reach 6di|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: North is much better off to bid 3@d to show @d fit and GF, not sure what 3@c meant|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rv: always show support with fit, helps partnership a lot:)|pg||
nt|jchiu: i certainly despise the relay continuation, and believe that Shih can do fine believing 2he is natural|pg||
nt|jonky: 3@C then 3NT may indicate better hand|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|jchiu: i would also bid 3di with Kuo's hand, just to shape out and let Shih indicate the number of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: all is well that ends well:)|pg||
nt|jonky: nice bidding|pg||
nt|rv: after reverse some play rebid of suit (2@s) is F1, 2n or 4th suit (whichever is cheaper) is lebensohl (for sign-off)|pg||

nt|wkc:  I don't know what 3NT shows, but if it shows extra, S should move on to the slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree, pass seems a little underbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and if it shows min, then N should bid something else|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wkc:  and if it includes a wide range, then maybe they should discuss a little more about their system|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|jchiu: all the signs in the closed room were on the wall|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jchiu: 16.17, local?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|jonky: should not cuebid 4@D with singleton in partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: North's 5@c in CR after partner gave a delayed raise is definitely ill-judged |pg||
pc|c5|nt|jchiu: partner's suit or not, cuebids here should not be mandatory, and surely it is ill advised with Qxxx opposite the splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzxt: yes to jchiu|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rv: this contract is hardly cold|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s would have been an easy make, E-W have only themselves to blame for reaching 5 level|pg||
nt|jchiu: asin this case, once north-south get in, two rounds of trumps would take care of the ruffing potential, and likely defeat teh contract; four spades, two ruffs, two hearts and two ...|pg||
nt|jchiu: diamonds for declarer|pg||
nt|eio: There are too many club losers. He can pick up @DK and discard one club, but missing two Aces is hard to handle|pg||

nt|eio: West though East had 5|pg||
nt|jchiu: if they play support doubles, Chen should know Lin only has two|pg||
nt|rv: many play X of 1@h to show 4@s and direct bid of 1@s on 1@h to show 5 cards|pg||
nt|jonky: W maybe think that X shows 3 spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jonky: E should bid 4@S to avoid giving information|pg||
nt|eio: Now East can even draw 3 rounds of trumps since he can set up a heart for a club loser|pg||
nt|rv: mixed raise generally shows 6-8/9, limit is Inv 9/10-11, anything less than 6 hcp is generally pre-emptive|pg||
nt|eio: Right, no matter where the singleton is, E is not interested in slam|pg||
nt|jchiu: well, i would count losers faster than points here|pg||
nt|rv: on major openings, folks generally have bids to differentiate these 3 kinds of raises below GF level|pg||
nt|jchiu: and this counts to seven and half, maybe eight on the light playing strength of 4441s|pg||
nt|jchiu: while useful to make some sort of distinction, it is much more important to understand the continuations. jonky makes a good pint|pg||
nt|eio: seven and a half should be ok, 9-card fit has been found|pg||

nt|by:  I think for most opponents at this level who plays negative free bids, 3@S is probably best|pg||
mb|6D|nt|lorderic: lets see if EW could get their @h ruff to set it|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  since no one would ever be sure again what is trumps|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: good one!|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: South doesn't have enough to X and then bid @ds (unless they play equal level conversion which is not very popular)|pg||
mb|3D!|an|not good raise|mb|p|nt|rv: 3@d by North is a wide-ranging raise, could be anything from 5/6-9 hcp, with more North will bid 2@s to show good raise (10+)|pg||
nt|jchiu: i would not pass with Lin's hand, since it is difficult to extract a heavy penalty while a fit makes 4he a favourite|pg||
nt|rv: Lin's action might fetch dividends here though|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rv: N-S heading towards danger area|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: South's 3@h was way too optmistic though North's 3@d is not a thing of beauty either|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jchiu: yes, north offered a nine-loser raise without an honour, in spite of the agreement|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: South has to cop most of the blame for this in my opinion|pg||
nt|jonky: Even 3@D will be penaltied|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Jonky, West may be slightly worried to X 3@D after 3rd seat opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: he has odds more in his favor to double at 3n/4 level:)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
mc|7|nt|rv: yes cashing @DA was clearly wrong|pg||
nt|jchiu: the defence did drop it by tapping their trumps at teh second trick, but it returned|pg||

nt|wkc:  another good score for NTHU|pg||

mb|2D|nt|by:  it is hard to get 14 IMPs, still |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lorderic: not quite sure what 3NT is|pg||
nt|jonky: If 2@C GF, N should bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jonky: Then if S rebid 3@C, can go to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to show a 16-18 bal hand ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: beating 2@S is not enough for NTHU|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lorderic: since 2@C could be a wide range of hands, it's not good to waste so many spaces by bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know their thought haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: of course|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzxs: still a safe contract here :)|pg||

nt|wkc:  it will be a quick one|pg||
nt|by:  alas|pg||
nt|by:  only makes it close|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lorderic: since @S split 3-3 should be making 5, 13 IMPs to NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: so after the first half NCTU is ahead by 22.5 IMPs|pg||
