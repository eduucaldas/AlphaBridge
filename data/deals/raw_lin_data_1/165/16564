mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mamos: hi everyone|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|mamos: Who is South ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is  Nygren|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again|pg||
nt|dburn: and I didn't know all that much about Dinah Caplan before this weekend, but she's been playing like Edgar Kaplan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know lizzy Godfrey too  but not her partner|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike and David|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are having a good weekend,  top spot after 14 rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
nt|dburn: good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: the club overcall to her left and that diamond bid from partner ought to discourage Kaye from thinking too hard about slam|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 2@H has already discoured her|pg||
nt|dburn: not enough - if it had, she'd just have bid 4@h without giving information away|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is she thinking of game?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing to stop p holding SK|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C checkback (?)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding for a 20 20 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: ... or something else, any guesses about 2@D|pg||
nt|mug: did North bid 2@D or 2@H operator?|pg||
nt|dburn: very law-abiding|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, partner could have it - but that still leaves a lot of losing clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt that K@C sitting under the club bidder?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: @cA, @sK and enough trumps is too much to hope for|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree that D bid too off-putting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: Hi John and David|pg||
nt|dburn: although East-West might illegaly have made nine tricks in spades also|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: declarer has some ways of going down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aternon|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn: even 4@h isn't completely safe, though it will make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|mug: this will make but there's a little to play, Sally Brock has to worry about bad breaks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Alice Kaye,http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=26518|pg||
nt|yo_yo: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=26518|pg||
nt|dburn: although it might have been a better idea to lead a club from dummy at the second trick|pg||
nt|dburn: this line is dangerous if West has long hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|mug: I think one heart finesse, then a club to the jack|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: cards on table more thought|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK from here - East can return a club to kill a discard, but declarer has enough tricks with hearts 2-2 and @sA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: two or three cards being fingered...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mug: East could be ducking from @HK-x-x-x|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|mug: perhaps it's simply too early in the morning to worry about bad breaks?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but not entirely of her own doing - her partner could have taken a trick more|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|jtr: I hate 3@h with East's hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, though, it will work just fine|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: its already 12 o'clock - should be awake by now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2S|an|  |nt|paulhac:  I do not think they are playing together|pg||
nt|henryb:  North would really like to bid 3@c natural, and not pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|paulhac:  I wonder what the range for the 2@S bid is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  No double, no trouble|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Somepairs play it as weak or strong others as an opening bid or better|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Declarer critical of North's cards ... transferring the blame early|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for scores - sorry I had a typo in the earlier URL|pg||
nt|henryb:  I hate MUD, because East now does not know whether West has 643 or 43|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  If it is 643 she should play low; if 43 she has to play the J|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Otherwise i like MUD|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|hT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  there is a good case for leading low from three small unless you have shown at least 3 by raising at some point|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulhac:  True it is all a matter of style and partnership agreement|pg||

nt|mug: this looks more interesting!|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C when clubs are 1-1 and you can ruff 3x@H in North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and oul N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 8|pg||
nt|dburn: if she'd played that way in six, though, I'm sure East would have unblocked @sK under the ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|mug: that's a good start for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have to open 1@C playing normal methods with North's 22HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: must play 2/1 game forcing, I guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep next what though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone for a michaels cue bid there?|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - wrong sort of hand to drive to the three level|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2 bids for the price of one?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are you a mini maxi man david?|pg||
nt|dburn: one and a half bids, if you don't play specific Michaels|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but david is right 3-level here is horrible|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not if partner has 4/5 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but even so, you might risk 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I have http://tinyurl.com/4vxjrjc|pg||
nt|dburn: no, but I would prefer to have some internal strength in both my suits before compelling partner to bid one at the three level|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and if your aunt etc...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: EW have nor real fit   values for game   |pg||
nt|dburn: if the majors were the other way round and they opened 1@h, I would bid 2@h|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|dburn: rather than putting this down as dummy in 2@s|pg||
nt|mug: she might have tried redouble on the way, just once in a while EW aren't playing in hearts|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D* would have been a lot, although Sally Brock may not have stood it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j for standings - now updated|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the results I think the adjustment represents capping the results of a round to +28IMP|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where will this all end|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good point yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eggy: The field is starting to widen a bit now|pg||
nt|eggy: but you can gain up to 28 imps per match|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eggy: or lose any amount - scoring is x imps/8 capped at 28 for the winners|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT, I should think|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 4@s|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: I guess she will go after @ss and get home here|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunate lie of cards for East-West, but game likely to be bid at most tables|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT with @H like this also makes|pg||
nt|dburn: better not try 4@h, though - that won't make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you play this mini or maxi michaels or ghestemM?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: so why didn't the 2nd pair receive a negative adjustment for their +53 in round one?|pg||
nt|mug: kibitzer makes a good point|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds pose threat for 4 of either major|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eggy: may get home playing clubs too I suppose|pg||
nt|mamos: or Clubs lol|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|dburn: not yet - North needs to shift to clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: or if I played, say, 3@c as hearts and diamonds I might do that (though probably would not)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 12|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eggy: if the defence lay off diamonds now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|eggy: It won't make much difference, but trying to make as many ruffs as possible looked a better prospect|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with 4@h also down on a club lead, this may not be too expensive|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: but if I just played Michaels, partner would need length in both minors before being able to compete over a raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: Best line in @ss is 2 finesses against South|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|nt|mamos: dont think East thought that through|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: so the advantage of showing a two-suiter would not really be much of an advantage at all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: or at least, she would have needed to shift to clubs had declarer worked out why South led West's suit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|c6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially when North has long @ds|pg||
nt|dburn: besides, if it is our hand for 4@h I would rather not tell the opponents how to defend it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Briony trying to make her little trumps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|d|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  In this country almost every table would bid 2@h-X-4@h-4@s|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Evidently Anne rosen considered it too strong for a weak 2|pg||
nt|idc: I think 4@H is down to looking for swings at this stage of the event - coming outside the top 2 is worth nothing|pg||
nt|idc: top 3 I meant|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N is limit or better, South has a clear accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Being reserve pair for a trip to Belfast might be considered as something|pg||
nt|idc: I guess so|pg||
nt|paulhac:  While aggressive if you plau your weak 2's as 3-9 (quite common) then it is a 1@H opener!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Back to the issue of whether 2@h is a preempt or a constructive hand with less than opening high card values|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|idc: Interesting that East passed 4@h - it seemed normal to me at the time but now I wonder if 4@s as a two-way shot is possible?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I prefer the latter but many do not.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps North could have tried slam over the double, the finesses were likely to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: the pair that got -31 got their full score. the pair that got +31 were adjusted to +28|pg||
nt|rmb1: The cap is per round (of 7 boards) not per session (of 2/3 rounds)|pg||
nt|mug: another possible slam |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a nice break in s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|dburn: on the East cards? no|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: on the South cards? maybe|pg||
nt|mamos: but South :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me too no|pg||
nt|yo_yo: def on the south cards for me|pg||
mb|1C|nt|dburn: 3NT will make, but 4@h won't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they will|pg||
nt|mug: ic|pg||
nt|mug: maybe she can bid 2@C transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|mug: a popular and effective method|pg||
nt|mug: I like transfers here as you can happily give up the natural 1NT, much better to pass with the 6-9 hands rather than let the next hand off the hook by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Unlucky 4@s here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is|pg||
nt|jtr: Might get doubled even|pg||
nt|dburn: depends what sort of style we play|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: natural 1NT over 1M-(dbl) is one of the worst bids in bridge in my view|pg||
nt|jcomyn: def again very good weak 2|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: some form of puppetry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: cruel game sometimes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: infact it is a cruel game most of the time|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s not a very satisfactory bid but understandable|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would not pass throughout whatever style we played, unless Trappist|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and this form may actually work|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: now not so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not thast it matters a great deal in 3nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: trappist as in monk?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mug: 3@D too timid|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mug: hi Bill|pg||
nt|jtr: Now will get a double surely?|pg||
nt|eggy: no|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: north had no way to show that diamond suit immediately over the double?|pg||
nt|dburn: that sort of thing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: Looks like it will end the same though|pg||
nt|dburn: though this lead will probably be good enough|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep david bird's lot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the monks would miss @H game too |pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps Kaye bid out of turn in the last match, and the Director told Youngs she had to pass throughout, and she thought it meant for the rest of the event|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i prefer to open 2 than reopen with 3|pg||
nt|dburn: but defending 2@s when you can make 5@h is... well, it is not a good way to hold on to second place|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she could have bid 2@h over 1@s also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who was it said "in quick, out quick"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: Tom was describing the merits of 2@C transfer instead of 2@D when N passed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings |pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
nt|jcomyn: why by the way. I did that the other night and pard had no trick. I won my 3 spades and that was all|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks cosy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: maybe they like to have six-card suits for these actions, but still |pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: a diamond would have been worst for the defence (apart from ace and another trump, which would have been fatal)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|eggy: To be honest, any lead should have been enough, once you see the dummy|pg||

nt|dburn: impossible|pg||
nt|dburn: three potential grand slams|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: 4@S not totally trivial here is it? let's say the defence start with three rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now declarer can't draw all the trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Jagger/Seale bid (and made) 6@C on  9 but we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but south ducks the @HA and now there is a heart ruff lurking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they wont be in 4S surely|pg||
nt|mug: South's duck is the key play in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4-0 trump break definitely causes a but of bother|pg||
nt|mug: let's see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of bothere even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would only this one is good-looking|pg||
nt|dburn: modern game may be to overcall 1@h rather than double|pg||
nt|dburn: but double covers more bases, especially facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wht do u think|pg||
nt|dburn: not all of them sound contracts, but...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose easier to start with a transer to @S|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but hard to bid all your suits and have partner believe them natural|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: double from south now i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: I would double, but I understand 1@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: East is Helen Erichsen, wife of Espen, West is Margaret Nygren (previously James and Courtney) wife of Martin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rubbitch|pg||
nt|mamos: now double :)|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that doubling now ought to be a better hand than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway u doint want to find the 4-4 fit here|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right to play hearts or clubs in a 4-4 even if partner has three spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 15+13 = 28  then how many for a void?|pg||
nt|mamos: this will surely get us to 6@h|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@d?|pg||
nt|dburn: not "surely" - North has a lot to discover|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like to see voidwood in action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hope it comes up|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who's he|pg||
nt|dburn: Easley Blackwood's somewhat vacant cousin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a jump to 5@D?|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  voidwood leads to 3-0 fits in my experience as I said to an international player recently its always unlucky when trumps break 8-2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hmmm i played in a 1-0 fit recently|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|jcomyn: end|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will have to put a lead-directing 3@C bid in to cause a problem for declarer in 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt or 4@S now ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont believe you|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you could do that, but I once had a partner who opened 1NT with three low clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: hard to stop in 5@h after 5@d  for Aces|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how helpful is slow bidding here?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, some pairs play 3@h over 2@h as forcing, and this kind of hand is why|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Do the panel prefer x of 1S?|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably inferring a diamond fit, but I still hate 3S|pg||
nt|dburn: not 3NT, surely|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@d OK, catering for partner having six hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where is this heading|pg||
mb|5D|an| |nt|athene: i expect we will get a diamond lead now rather than the club, so no problems|pg||
nt|mamos: undo!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well well who would have thought that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, south going for a singleton heart opposite perhaps and an immediate knockout with two ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: reasonable defence|pg||
nt|athene: or this might work with hearts 3-3 in the EW hands if north can win a trump trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is that voiidwood now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now they cant show their key cards|pg||
nt|dburn: no, that's just a void|pg||
nt|yo_yo: immediate 5@D is voidwood|pg||
nt|mamos: surely better to bid 4@s than 5@d   then after 5@c you can bid 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn: again, it's possible to play 5NT as RKCB in this kind of auction, but this pair probably don't do that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah just shoot 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South has already signed off once - she has enough to bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we girls dont do that sort of thing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah yes but then you ARE girls|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, that @dK is no good, but the black suit controls and the trumps are plenty|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but yes she will surely bid the small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: i try 6c|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Does the panel prefer 1@s or 2@c as a response to partner's opening 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly dont like 1s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting out of hand|pg||
nt|dburn: really?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@C means what|pg||
nt|mamos: 0nly 5-5   pretty lucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that a pass out?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: I believe so \|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely not|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: will check soon|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: The way she's bid it, east light as well have started with 2S I think|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they avoided the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but i see it made|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know why - perhaps North misunderstood what South was trying to do|pg||
nt|mamos: but it didnt do much good|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, 4@s might make - you can draw trumps despite the break, and everything else is favourable|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: yes diamonds on the right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is when you want to go home|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: left to declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if East has led, then the final contract is either clubs or diamonds, not hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|eggy: If 1C can be short (probable) then I prefer 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: ace of hearts, heart, north wins trump, club to ace, heart ruff|pg||
nt|mug: there was a very famous hand many years ago when an Italian led @CA from A-x-x-x in a similar situation|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mug: rather than @DA from A-x-x-x-x|pg||
nt|athene: on the subject of a 3@C bid over 2nt for the lead, you can often get away with very aggressive lead-directing bids in that sort of position|pg||
nt|rmb1: An Jagger/Seale bid to 5@D= on  10 - after 1@H(X)1NT :)|pg||
nt|mug: there was a lot of talk when @CA lead was the winner|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h, on the other hand, will not make|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dburn: and if the nine of spades held the first trick, then... well, perhaps declarer has gone home|pg||
nt|yo_yo: E still onlead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy: As on the previous hand, a double by S looks worth the effort|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kind of a say your prayers 4s|pg||
nt|dburn: and is about the only game that won't - even 3NT and 5@c would make|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sxhell shocked no doubt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well better than my 1-0 fit |pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah go on Kath dont be shy tell us how|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a shame - but there is still time for North-South to recover; they are in second spot at the moment and there are still boards to play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|jcomyn: p passed something or other|pg||
mc|8|nt|eggy: I don't think that Pauline Cohen is light bidder usually|pg||
nt|jcomyn: curious the 5-3 c fit nor the 4-4 s fit never mentioned|pg||

nt|jcomyn: been in worse|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mug: he said the longest suit was only likely to be good for one ruff, the second ruff might have been overruffed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: theres the strong nt again and s cant bid|pg||

nt|jtr: Close your eyes and bid 4@h|pg||
nt|mamos: great suit|pg||
nt|mamos: great suits|pg||

nt|bobholl: 3 :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ha ha true|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mug: perhaps Mrs Erichsen rated the hand too good for a 15-17 NT, hardly unreasonable|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C strong (4 card) raise (?)|pg||
nt|eggy: now if this hand is worth 3@C, even with the D fit, surely the last was worth 2S|pg||
nt|jtr: Double might get a 5@d run|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|dburn: reasonable auction from the other table, though|pg||
nt|mug: mixed raise I suppose|pg||
nt|jcomyn: god gave you 17 to open 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c worked very luckily as it happens|pg||
nt|jtr: Escaped undoubled in a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: 4@S scarcely justified but Mrs Brock does really need much justification to try a thin game in a ladies trial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and nhow game is out of the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I don't particularly blame S, You don't expect a run, or partner to have any tricks at all|pg||
nt|jtr: True|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: good lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this looks difficult to make|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy to see enough winners for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Fiona had a great win in a very strong field in tralee two weeks ago|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/65vok4m  for standings after round 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: but this one is OK too - you'll have a play for slam facing almost anything, and it would be a good contract if East had five little hearts rather than four|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Leading three pairs after 17 rounds are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what the best line is - maybe @sA, @hA, club to the ace, diamond to the queen, @dA, diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certianly is on that lead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|mug: can she pick the singleton @SJ?|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting point of theory is what the double of 3@C means|pg||
nt|athene: could be a) strong NT b) clubs c) t/o of spades|pg||
nt|mug: (a) seems pointless|pg||
nt|mug: (b) and (c) both have merit|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: in a lot of these situations i think it can be useful to have x showing takeout of the opps' announced fit|pg||
nt|mamos: +2 |pg||
pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|athene: otherwise you have to pass and wait and then the auction is way higher|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|dburn: which ought to work|pg||
nt|mug: indeed, but double to show clubs can result in a lot of profitable saves|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|athene: true - it might depend how "natural" your 1@C is|pg||
nt|dburn: Youngs trying to unblock spades, but in vain|pg||

pc|h8|nt|dburn: (first time for everything, I guess)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: we have plenty of them here too - the we-didnt-come-here to pass brigade|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with overcalling 4-card suits with good hands is it's really hard to move forwards thereafter, because you are always worried that you will end in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|eggy: I coming round to the view that opeing 1S is almost never the successful action with this shape|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially with such good @cs|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: still, no less an authority than Jeff Meckstroth says that when partner raises your six-card major, you should just bid game in it|pg||

nt|athene: ok, that's one problem :) another problem is your partner just gets you too high anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there yar and the end of the s fit i daresay|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East can infer the sixth spade opposite now and make the master bid of 4@S|pg||

nt|dburn: of course, you could try playing a diamond yourself - if West won it and didn't return the suit...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: even if she had misguessed, though, she was still making|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: Or 5@c for that matter|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Kaye can't unguard clubs with four in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, she can but should not|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: west enplayed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: well played Alice Kaye|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: last chance sasloon|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Rosen and Tesholme are just 3 points behind Kaye and Yoongs who were lying third and they have now overtaken them comfortanbly as Kand Y are N/S in the other vuegraph room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  16 top tricks. can they reach 10 no trump :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|an| |mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Good hand for old fashioned gerber|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Not sure what the hurry was by north|pg||
nt|idc: One other ploy for North was to transfer to spades and later use RKC - opposite AK A A you could happily bid 7NT|pg||
mc|13|nt|idc: And if one of those was missing, 6NT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Kaye and Youngs are staging a comeback so it looks as though it will go to the wire in the last match|pg||

nt|dburn: most unlikely|pg||
nt|mug: alright, final board of the match|pg||
nt|mug: possible 3NT N-S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no they cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a finish wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe not but they should|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everybody's 7nt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: and if your aunt etc|pg||
nt|mamos: now  a real test of nerve|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but East didn't know the position - declarer could have had better spades and worse diamonds|pg||
nt|eggy: they can't?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many play 2NT as full value in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|mamos: 7NT +3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont cue bid!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter i mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gerber for me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but most hate gerber in UK|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|jcomyn: me too in ireland|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I'm not playing this in NT|pg||
nt|mug: close call whether to pass or raise to two|pg||
nt|mug: five-card suit and tens are god, stiff @SK is bad|pg||
nt|rmb1: Next round follows shortly - vugraph will shut down and restart briefly|pg||
nt|athene: non-vul, there is less reason to go for game like a rabid wolverine|pg||
nt|mug: tens are "good" rather, I dare say being NV tipped the scales, or perhaps they open 14|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: board being played upside down ... difficult for an old operator like me ... I like sitting South-West|pg||
nt|jcomyn: be the holy 4-card majors|pg||
nt|jtr: The Kraken wakes|pg||
mb|3N|an| |nt|mug: just tell us the tricks at the end of the hand operator, it isn't going to be very exciting|pg||
nt|mug: but @SJ was overtrumped|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: I'll muddle along, Tom|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Maybe the North hand is a bit strong for that|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a bit strong even for a natural 2NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: and it is certainly too strong for this sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: tx all nothing here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone know what 3@S means?|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think theyll bid this|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|dburn: neither is South - 2NT was diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: Poor East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well she was forced to bid|pg||
nt|dburn: but still, it may help them to stay low|pg||
nt|yo_yo: puppet to 3NT i am told, |pg||
nt|dburn: well, North could add one for the road, but that's always risky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: minor suit slam try another suggestion|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this wilkl be costly if not|pg||
nt|mamos: i wish|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they might had had a better try without their 2 awful boards, knocks confidence that|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but surely 2D is also D|pg||
nt|dburn: it did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely you just look for aces and kings on the N hand and not take this kind of risk|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and this has good chances, so Teshome and Rosen have recovered from a somewhat shaky start|pg||
nt|jtr: I thought tht might happen|pg||
nt|dburn: good shot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yeah yeah yeah|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ohhhh v goood|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: thx everyone, good luck to all the players|pg||
nt|eggy: A double too far|pg||
nt|jcomyn: when your are told to bid you bid - wont be your fault|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: that took courage!|pg||
mc|13|nt|jcomyn: S might easily hold Qx in H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: KQx|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: evryone very complimentary|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but when partner jumps to 6NT and you have an ace, it's a good bet that she has the other three|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont be mean david clap the girl on the back|pg||
nt|dburn: I did|pg||
nt|mamos: North may have thought things so bad she had little to lose but it was brave|pg||
