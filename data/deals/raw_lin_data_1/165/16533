mb|p|nt|viren169: Morning all|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: Perhaps all weak balanced hands open 1@C, 1@D is unbalanced (or 18-19) |pg||
mb|2H|nt|viren169: Hi Robin|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Hi Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: Strange opening by Cook|pg||
nt|viren169: Is it systematic?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought the same apart from lack of majors|pg||
nt|viren169: better!|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Sorry folks - still early in Lodon|pg||

nt|eggy: I'm sure that most will be familiar with Hether Dhondy - stalwart of the English womens team for many years and Olympiad winner|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|viren169: probably better to bid 3@D with East's hand|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|rmb1: 3@H sounds like more hearts and less values|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what???|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but surely nhot 1D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: ew might sacrifice|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|eggy: orry David palyed with Zia, not Forrrester who played with David Herman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: v ery interesting hand with anythin g likely to happen|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: South will just wait and show her suit in the play|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D over 1N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pays sometimes to lurk in the bushes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jim Griffin|pg||
nt|viren169: the Vul probably kept her at bay!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: ew went very tamely there although E might think she has good defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: she might also think she does not have an awful lot of playing strength in spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: Lizzie godfrey has represented England on and off since the 80s although she now lives in the Pyrennees and plays many major French events as well|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a fabulous place to live|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no but that 2nd suit makes a lot of tricvks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tlc: as long as declarer attacks hearts first, there will be 9 tricks...an early spade finesse and this will go down|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: well, East at the other table took your advice, and she pushed her opponents to the five level where they went down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rmb1: One doesn't want to bid 5 card suits vulnerable when everyone in watching|pg||
nt|viren169: Upside down signals?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this c ould easily play 1NT fromn either side if w had not opened|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|nt|tlc: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|eggy: Her partner Dinah Caplan is an experienced player, but has not, to my knowledge,much high level duplicate history|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c9|nt|dburn: well, that would have endplayed East if West's weak two bid were based on a three count, but it might have been safer to throw spades on those diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another slam Roland would be proud of - played by West to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good slam...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nikce breaks in majors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D can win in many ways|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially with slam on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Kx of diamonds lad from pd will probably best 3N. and sometimes E will elect to make a TO double and EW will get to wrong game|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes i meant in general, not on this specific deal|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: there was an american movie a decade or two ago called "Heathers"|pg||
nt|dburn: not an obvious choice for West now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|viren169: A of @D and still need to find the Q@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you rebid - just 4@S ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no too good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|viren169: tough bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a noise|pg||
nt|viren169: Unless you have a gadget or two to cover these types of hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just allow space for e to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you suggest John|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chilloncan: not a comfortable choice for E there either, as X has warts, but so of course do 3N and 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that is surely that|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East is there... now it will be hard to stay out of slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is unfairly unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: of course, one of the ways 3@d can lose is by pushing East-West to something they can make but would not have bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W could go on here, needs only AKQxxx    Axx  xx Kx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: even with s 4-1 rest lie nice|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is certainly true david|pg||
nt|dburn: but West might barely have done something over 4@s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: 6@H is better than 6@S as the cards lay|pg||
nt|rmb1: It has to be a @S lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: Tough lead to find. I fancy this to make.|pg||
nt|rmb1: and it sounds like @S are 4-4 in which case its dangerous to lead|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W apparently wanted to confirm a commentator's earlier statement that this field is conservative|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are al;l women not conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: lots of oh s on 2 D from N and amusement|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Doesn't need to find @DA just @SQ - likely to play for @S length with N after trump break|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|viren169: Lighter dble has been suggested?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tom Townsend|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|viren169: Morning Tom|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tlc: dinah did well to avoid and aggressive t/o dbl over 2@s...there was no good resting spot had she done so|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that finding West with HKJ represents the best chance doesn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mug: a fascinating deal|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some one might run from a lightner double - even to the making 6NT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|lml: hi|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|viren169: or run back to 4M!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mug: Nicole Cook might have doubled 6@H for a spade lead, then again it would be silly to drive opps into 6NT when Christine Duckworth was going to lead a spade from five anyway|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eggy: here probably :)4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some (ladies) pairs still playing a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: decent result for East-West at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: very true - in what|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: important match, that - 4th against 2nd, with 4th having the better of it so far|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eggy: Something of an underbid, but just as well I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good judgement I daresay|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like a normal spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: HATE it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: looks like the obvious 1-off|pg||
nt|viren169: some good players also play weak NT! |pg||
nt|mug: as I recall Sandra (and Brian Senior) and Holland/Brunner were the only pair playing weak NT in the English Premier League|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with weak NT in the right hands!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eggy: could well be the limit in that lead|pg||
nt|lml: East has an unfitting 5 count|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: not a very enterprising final pass, but the form of scoring apparently dictates cautions for these players|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: whats the besat advice lads for those playin weak. I have a class and it is diffiult to explain whast not to do|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|eggy: I suspect a few will punt 3NT with the West hand|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: its a pretty big punt unless east shows a bit more|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for that matter, E might have doubled 1S. and certainly N was close to a game try with 5 LTC (Losing Trick Count)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: Send me an email and I will send you pros and cons for both!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mug: I don't think what NT range you play is going to make much difference to your results below expert level|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d7|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h7|nt|lml: but there is a school that bidding 3NT is never having to say your sorry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eggy: well just needs a card plus some help to bring the clubs in|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: why n ot a diamond back to ace and a trump?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|tlc: indeed? even after 1@c-1@d?|pg||
nt|viren169: Tom, Dont some of the the Italians players weak NT?|pg||
nt|mug: there was a debate in English Bridge, I was for the Strong NT, the outcome was 87% for the Weak NT|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|mug: no Gad|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The leading three pairs guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: this is a hand where east could have led from 3 suits|pg||

nt|viren169: They just happen to be  1 and  2 in the world currently.|pg||

nt|mug: declarer still needs to find a trick or two from somewhere though|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: what do you call a 3-3 fit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|viren169: looks like 3rd and 5th throughout|pg||
nt|dburn: sub-Moysian|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|mug: spade to the jack now, perhaps?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tlc: a spade lead was the best lead, but this should lead to down 1 if everyone is careful|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eggy: Well East won't switch to a small heart now anyway|pg||
nt|mug: best now is a heart to break up the pressure on partner|pg||

nt|viren169: Nice hand now|pg||
nt|chilloncan: with a bad spade holding and shortish, unspectacular hearts for the planned sequence X-then-2H, W might well have considered the alternative agenda of an initial 2H followed by a X ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if the chance arises|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double or 1@H?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of competition here i darsay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I was thinking about whether I would open 1NT or 1C|pg||
nt|tlc: not if down 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: yes my bid too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thought you never open 1nt on 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support double|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D anyone?|pg||
nt|mug: a hand for all seasons|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gad y|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: do you like 1NT with Qx and Qx.  We do but I like more in the doubletons and less in the long suits|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a big fan of slightly offshape NTs, but not with 5@C-4@s..rebids are too easy|pg||
nt|mug: must expect 5@D to be close, but wouldn't mind defending a lot of doubled spades either given the option |pg||
nt|viren169: redbl now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 3@D would have been an underbid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mug: as the cards lie NS can make slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D by North instead of 2@D or 3@D by South instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly go on now|pg||
nt|mug: South is worth game in diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: Getting into the grey area now...|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|eggy: I'm not a fan, but probably in the miniority|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yesd hard to see where 11 tricks come fromn|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D ought to be forcing|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a slam try?|pg||
nt|viren169: should be slam try (at least!)|pg||
nt|mug: well partner appears to have five diamonds, make a few diamond tricks and ruffing, and some more tricks from the majors, what's the problem?|pg||
nt|mug: now North can try 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: oops what?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|viren169: Cook would prefer to hear 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eggy: anyway, I imagine all roads lead to ROme|pg||
nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we all know if u are in slam the KJ108 will be in the E hand|pg||
nt|lml: either hand will do|pg||
nt|tlc: and the club's off|pg||
nt|mug: you can take a horse to water etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: Erichsen in other room bid 3@D on first round as North|pg||
nt|mug: not that I'm comparing any of our last trialists to members of the equine species|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D looks about right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: given the auction I think they did well to get to 5D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: why not?|pg||
nt|dburn: three spadess, four hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant count any more at my age|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|mug: but North's hand was pretty good relative to what she'd show already, she could afford to show her spade control, the six good diamonds were huge|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Cook was going to drive to game whatever!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it's about a 17% slam, plus mb some sqz chances|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1N on the N hand cashes in when pd has a moderate hand with 5 hearts. it has the downside of possibly burying spades. whenever N would be reluctant to pass a 1N response to 1S, but ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also reluctant to raise, a 1N opener is recommended. here that is not the case, i think, so it is a very close decision for N|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c3|nt|mug: "ladies" I meant, not "last"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|dJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|tlc: a claim coming soon|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D or 2@D on the first round depends a bit on doubling style|pg||
nt|mug: I think I prefer Helen's choice of 3@D but 2@D was not a mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D allow you to bid the spots of the cards afterwards. 4@S was clear cut.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: now shes thinking about slam :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|eggy: unless she plays for the D7 again|pg||
nt|viren169: and now 6@D was likely to be reached.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: and another sheinwold speciality n- what is the bridge term for an 8-card suit - \trumps|pg||
nt|eggy: The scoring is x imps, capped to 28imp per match for the winning pair|pg||
nt|jcomyn: v interesting|pg||
nt|tlc: I don't believe I've ever seen this format in the US|pg||
nt|eggy: sorry that's x imps divided by 8|pg||

nt|eggy: Don't tell Roland!|pg||
nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|lml: she had to hold on to dummy's hearts|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe thats too tough single dummy|pg||
nt|lml: when West returns a diamond she has to rise ace and then there is a kind of winkle|pg||
nt|mug: I think 5@C exclusion was in order over 3@D|pg||
nt|mug: or simply void showing, in either case reaching the decent slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another lively hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: spades usually win, but not this time|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty but too tough|pg||
nt|tlc: except lizzie can unblk the Q@d|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|rmb1: Last board of the round, the vugraph will shut down briefly between rounds|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@C over 4@S would achieve the same result|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@C?!?!|pg||
nt|dburn: not the best game at the other table|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mug: a bit wet to pass, but in accordance with the classical rule of 500|pg||
nt|rmb1: Constructive weak two (?)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am not passing that s hand|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal 3@C to me by Cook|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|lml: the 9 sets up I believe but I need to look at it|pg||
nt|eggy: Wasn't dummy entryless though?  I thought a winkle was only for overcoming blocked suits|pg||
nt|tlc: good hand to be playinggood/bad 2NT...|pg||
nt|lml: yes if east gets in she has to give dummy a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS found an 8 card minor fit anyway|pg||
nt|mug: yes a lot of pairs like the two tier weak twos these days, 2@S showed about 8-11|pg||
nt|mug: the heart fit went begging|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any game is wonderful, but five of either minor will make|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lml: anyway one for the blog|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what about that 6-3 h fit. I dont like 2S on the w hand|pg||
nt|dburn: here, West probably should have rebid 2@d (or opened 1@d if intending to treat the hand as a minimum, but...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 3NT on a 6-5-1-1 distribution a bit hairy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: not for the table :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that the heart switch may have kyboshed that, but interesting anyway|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tlc: hope heather has her guessing shoes on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  in my opinion west should not pass|pg||
nt|dburn: West probably ought to bid on here - if 3NT were the right contract, partner would have bid it earlier|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south also might have raised to 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 'in the tank'|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: not easy to find heart fit after 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West could have balanced with a double, but would be normal to have diamond shortage for that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1S allowoing space|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S then 2@S shows 12+|pg||
nt|mug: you miss hearts anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why quibble about 1 pt|pg||
nt|mug: on a free run you do anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  notice if south raised to 2@h it might continue 3@c(?) pass 3NT(?) and now more difficult for west to remove?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: reluctant pass|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: there are a few downsides to 2H though|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right, I guess - maybe partner has something like @hK10x, @cA and @dQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case 3NT is better than five of a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but the odds seem to favour bidding - not least because slam might make|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: well i asm not sitting on a 6-card major and say nothing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  with K10x @h and Ace of @c then maybe east would bid 3N over 2@c?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed some guess for a great deal of imps|pg||
nt|lml: is there a reason to finesse or just intuition|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|lml: west has more spade so fewer vacant spaces?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a very good day you make 3NT without the club suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's close here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mug: no extra shape and a stray jack, I'm happy to call it 11|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eggy: Would have done well to get it right I think, so early in the play|pg||
nt|mug: Jagger could hardly bid|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no law says she cant|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mug: 5NT would also have been a legal call, not very sensible though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is why i go fo the odd 1100|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|dburn: true, but if you can make 3NT without the club suit, you can probably make five of a minor also|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: the reason to finesse is weak|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|mc|8|nt|dburn: still, tough problem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But Kaye could not know that 5m would be better|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like east's bidding here but maybe they just need to discuss this |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back soon|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sometimes you need bad results to sort things out|pg||
