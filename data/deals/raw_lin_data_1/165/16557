nt|jcmax: If he had opened there would have been a danger of the pair getting to 3@H which would have been one level too high|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
nt|tez: flat 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in doubt now as the 1@H response is not Polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3NT very much looks like fast arrival to me, meaning partner I have a really bad hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-6(7)  and 1@H therefore 8+, but maybe only 7+ for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
nt|serhat: exciting on a dia lead!|pg||
nt|jcmax: W definitely found the best elad!|pg||
nt|serhat: so 4s was better|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|3for3: defense can build 2@H's and take 3 aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: And also note how important it is he chose a low @D and not the 10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||
nt|tomi2: this will be no fun for west|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|nagini: why so big cl?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: good stop|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: normaly after 1x pass pass the bid are: dbl 8/12 , suit (also 1Nt) 12/16, dbl 16+|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vbman: getting worse|pg||
nt|tomi2: 690 is usualy not the score you expect to lose lots of imps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: stil I think South might have tried another double|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct A|pg||
nt|3for3: if decaler ducks this, the defense have spades to go after as well...|pg||

pc|c7|nt|tez: if you have not good second suit..you must look to second suit..dont play trump quickly|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|tomi2: underleading @SQ to make partner play a clubwould be the best defense here but its hard to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right. Another issue is, what dio we lead from J108x  J107x  J10xx. I think the concensus is Jack from the first one, low from the other holdings. Any views, Sabine?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus discard @d..down 3|pg||
nt|jcmax: It really depends. If you have reasons to assume there is at most a doubleton in dummy then a low one clearly would be best even from the first holding.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say declarer has Qx in dummy and A9xx in his hand. he will almost certainly put up the Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 7h here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
nt|nagini: eee|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we predict they will bid 7N?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is an artificial game-force|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think so..|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0549.JPG North|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry wrong link, this was south|pg||
nt|jcmax: Especially in an undisturbed relay auction. That's what it looks like anyway.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|nagini: a race for snowman?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
nt|jcmax: When the opponents play relays I strongly feel with a hand like N's one should get involved in the bidding especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kwiecien asking, Jagniewski telling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would get in with 2@D?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0569.JPG east|pg||
nt|3for3: df wanted declarer to run the 9 of @C through south.  It plays well :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: They certainly know their system, so the best chance you have is make some noise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 3 maybe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0542.JPG west|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I'd prefer 3@D personally|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, because 2@D will not hurt their relays|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then it makes no sense|pg||
nt|serhat: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D doesn't really disturb that much and the relays may still be on. But after 3@D it will be back to natural and good judgment.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|egezzer: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tez: smith echo was need here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|pfbr: Morning, Roland@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS must take their 5 tricks now|pg||
nt|nagini: @h|pg||
nt|3for3: they needed better signalling between the first heart and the club played, as to whether the ten was falling |pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Kwiecien can claim before the lead :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have sen that before|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C,4@D cuebids 4NT RKCB 5C=0 5@D=@SQ?. 5@S probably =yes I have|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5nt now should ask for kings, but I am not 100% sure about their methods|pg||
nt|tez: where is T of @h..its important for defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: this will be tough to get right ruff high and double finesse|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0541.JPG this is Vainikonis|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least they spend a lot of time in the BBO practise rooms, so they know their system :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|tomi2: wil he play now for some miracle-squeeze?|pg||
nt|po-s: 6c most likely asking for CQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe 5@S already showed one king and with none he would bid 6@S|pg||

nt|nagini: 1 NT IS EASIER THEN 2 NT:)|pg||
nt|othered1: How did that go for 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: false renonse in the previous board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the real question is did North have to back in after 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very good evaluation by West|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you need enough entries for making this finese and later taking advantage of the @C trick. this way he sould not cash and finesse because @D back would kill the 4th club ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: the way he played he would have lost to QTxx onside|pg||
nt|3for3: easy from here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: some danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|jcmax: This looks like a fairly normal 3NT for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcmax: Easy to bid, easy to play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now a pretty straightforward 3NT with an easy ride when diamonds come in for five tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: but 3NT was a likely make so I guess yes|pg||
nt|tez: dbl|pg||

nt|3for3: double with a side void, kinda strange|pg||

nt|3for3: Hi Sabine!|pg||
nt|tez: imposible dbl ofcourse:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: expected him to open 1@C on this|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tomi2: and even more important ;) http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0546.JPG this is our vugrapg operator Monika|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: Welcome Sabine:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: doing good work indeed, tx to her|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT response to a takeout double is constructive, around 6-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: east can cuebid 5@H now I think or should this show one ace more?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|trotto: w @sJ moglbys gdyby to dziad mial miec piki lub @s stopera|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision by N - passed partner - no hope for game|pg||
nt|nagini: juniors lying?:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S competitive - with interesting hand DBL|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@H i mean|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Hej Anita @H|pg||
nt|3for3: the danger of bidding 2@S is you are setting up partner to save in 4@S, when your hand has lots of defensive potential|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! i am wondering why N bid 2@D here instead of a straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whereas a suit response can be 0|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N definitely looks like the contract he wants to play.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D apparently in their methods is forcing, but where does it lead?|pg||
nt|serhat: He might be thinking leading a H!?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcmax: Can slam really be on? and if the answer to that is no, then a bid like 2@D on another day may give away too much information to the opponents.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: To our less experienced viewers. So do not respond 1NT on   Kxx  xxx  xxxx  xxx   2@D is the call, 0-8 with at least 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|3for3: i dont think declarer would have even made 4@H here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: Notus on the board now with a swing|pg||
nt|jcmax: The one thing worrying me with the E hand would be that partner didn't take action over 1@H very well knowing that he is short in @H.|pg||
nt|serhat: can Kwieccien claim 10 for this too pls?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||
nt|vbman: yessss|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping N will finesse again, then Vainikonis would have to do something in @D to get an entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vbman: he can still go wrong easily|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if he had to cross in @D he could have finessed first, then west could win the queen, cross to partners @DA and get a ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: two major kings some quacks and dia ace wont be with west but its easy when wee see all hands|pg||
nt|vbman: quack=queen or jack|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|viren169: North is kicking himself for not bidding 5@C|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H |pg||
nt|Gerben42: in theory you can also play in @C but less obv.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with @HK 4th its hard to play this one though but you want to be in it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: assume a @S lead you play directly @H to 10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here np with AQJ@C in the dummy, but in other situation it is important|pg||
nt|serhat: but after his discards he could still claim 10!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is easier to play than to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: excellent 6@S here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D MULTI (6 cards in one major)|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt look like it will be too difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And these guys know the percentage play in spades, cashing the ace first|pg||
nt|serhat: I guess they will bid 4h|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|nagini: NS play Mozart im mjrs:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s @s and minor weak hand i think|pg||
nt|nagini: minimulti 6 + mjr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends how many hearts Kalida bids next, 2 or 3|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h now?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which would be wrong at matchpoints|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
nt|jcmax: Transfer bids over 1@C openings are becoming increasingly popular.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
nt|jcmax: Against 4@H EW can get a @D ruff, but only at the expense of a natural trump trick. Declarer however may misguess trumps and then 4@H could go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: without key card Blackwood, one might get to a grand slam here :)|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Kalida is taking easy as not Vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say E had bid a preeemptive 3@D instead of 2@D (if available), then declarer may very well decide to play a @H to the K.|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to bid 4h now|pg||
nt|serhat: cant let 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Russyan did enough by doubling and bidding 2NT. I would have passed 3@H I must confess|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I am surprised he didnt bid 4h over 2nt|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a very poor contract|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: at first trick W small dimond and E 8 od dimond|pg||
nt|tez: i thk he won from dummy and played @d to ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't think N's action is clear at all here. give partner Jxxx, Q, Axxxx, KJx and he definitely should pass 3N!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Peplonski insisted on @H then RKC, 3, thanks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcmax: So roland at matchpoints, if the Q loses to the K, what is the correct play in the 2nd round of the suit?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Notus comeback|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been misunderstanding in closed room |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: If he had that hand, Sabine, he might have raised 3@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: And certainly that hand would be more consistent with his bidding than his actual one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After all his partner bid them three times|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: ty at kibitz for the informations|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Finesse again|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcmax: Well, you do stop @D twice and 9 tricks are easier than 10. 4H would go down on @D6-1|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|nagini: :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|serhat: If he was happy to play 3h I understand but after 3nt if he doesnt want to play 4h I dont understand his reason!|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|cA|pg||
mc|10|nt|tomi2: wow|pg||
