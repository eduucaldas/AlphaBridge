mb|p|nt|doctorone: here is what I was talking about. Facing 15 17 I dont think W has to move, especially NV|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: he showed more than he had, yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|legend114: In any event, 4H was a great save against 3S!|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|doctorone: Good board for EW !|pg||
nt|hedyg: W's 1@d was maximum, thus the 2NT scrambling for a minor bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|doctorone: ok|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|hedyg: the stayman in CR with the W hand is doubtful imo|pg||

nt|legend114: unlucky slam in CR. I expect the same result in the OR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|hedyg: this is a better writeup of the Viking @c: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
nt|doctorone: not sure about Regis' double|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 1NT is 14-16 in red|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are not sure?????????|pg||
nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: didnt he just deny 4@ss?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might have tried 4@h|pg||
nt|legend114: me neither Bachar. I am always wary about begative doubles with a void|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i can see 12 tricks in @S, not in @C though|pg||
nt|doctorone: It seems that Regis is convinced that his P has 4 cards in @ss, in which cas 4@h previous round looks right :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: to me 4@H looked right whatever N had|pg||
nt|hedyg: since you dont want to leave 3NT|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: N should realise that AK@H are not of great use to his pd|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|doctorone: true, but he hqs q good @c complement an a singleton on the other hand|pg||

nt|cedrict: 4@H NS looks to be the contract|pg||
nt|cedrict: 2 @C tricks lost in the nature :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|cedrict: voyons si sur ouvre 1@S ou 1@C|pg||
nt|stc: a good start for LCF|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H!|nt|cedrict: long ago we obened theses hands 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: NS play strong club|pg||
nt|cedrict: routine 3@C opening for Teylouni :)|pg||
nt|cedrict: easy 4@S but 5@S is in danger|pg||
nt|stc: and the first slam of the segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: 6 NT is the only slam makeable. But can we find this?|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: 6@s bye S should also make|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|cedrict: down 3 = 150|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: Yes despite the 4-1 split|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|vdoubleu: How high will N/S bid here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N does NOT guarantee a stopper |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it was systemic with values an no better bid|pg||
nt|cedrict: 5@H could be in danger :( :)|pg||
nt|stc: are they heading to the to the loosing 6@c ?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vdoubleu: 4@s/unbeatable|pg||
nt|me argent: they DONT want to push these boys 2 much|pg||
nt|daman: this is going to be a cool +170 for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C East in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: yes if they awaken the sleeping giant    they may create misery|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: We do not have the datum from OR on 1st brd, but somehow (?) they made 6|pg||
nt|me argent: wold is conflicted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but since scoring is BAM EW must bid again  each board is just win/lose/draw|pg||
nt|cedrict: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: 4@h was alerted by south|pg||
nt|cedrict: first misunderstranding.... cue-bid for one.... final contract for N$|pg||
mb|p|nt|cedrict: I dont know if they would have made 5@H..... but I know 4@S will not be a success :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cedrict: maybe down 4 ?|pg||
nt|cedrict: lets see if the stop at the safe level|pg||
nt|stc: bridge is not a fair game....|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: No way to make this|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|cedrict: dur de se concentrer pour chuter le moins possible...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: tough to bid 4@S now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: BAM is Board-A-Match  aka Point-A-Board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference of 10 or 1000 gives same 1 board|pg||

nt|me argent: not really played by different positions|pg||
nt|me argent: both got @H lead|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Played by E in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: right other side of table in other room |pg||
nt|me argent: a more effective lead in CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: Does it make now?|pg||
nt|cedrict: A@S and 4 rounds @D bur is this the normal play ?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|po-s: two dia losers - how did one disappear|pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: I was just gonna ask same Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally unrelated   Tiger Woods began day with 3 stroke lead now trailing by 2|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I see 5 losers in OR|pg||
nt|collarosp: NS must have some sort of discussion actually...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|daman: he lost 2@Ds and 2@Ss|pg||

nt|daman: in the CR?  wasn't watching|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|stc: NS may disturb them with @hs|pg||

nt|stc: 10 if they cash @d early|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: Sry 11|pg||
nt|stc: in  fact 11 always|pg||
nt|stc: with S hand at this vuln and state of the match I bid something(probably 2@h)|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: East has some doubt about the 2@d agreement|pg||
nt|stc: after such a long hesitation...|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: the 3 other players are just joking about the tempo|pg||
nt|stc: he may feel forced to make a more radical bid|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|me argent: since 3nt cold not great result for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but same contract in other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: and  a push |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes but here, Wold stole Helgemo's bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: So that lead-directing overcall worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you want team rosters [and carryover at start of day]  check out bottom of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/results/2010/03/4/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams have decimal totals because of carryover calculated from Day 1 and Day 2  [field cut each day]|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Some specs were suggesting 1)That S might have opened 2N  or 2) over 3@s, South might haved Xed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners site doesn't include results from last round/match of Reisinger/National Swiss prior to break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to get those results|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more problems -- they are playing a subsitute bd 4 here, so I don't have it.  I asked to have another pair of players but the directors said no.  in other words, the bd 4 at this ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: the board you see is the board being played as bd 4 in all the other matches;  i don't know what happened to require a substitute bd here|pg||
nt|daman: the specs tell me Stansby needs to be 8th or higher to win the PoY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 10 teams in the final|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 39 teams entered the event;  after one day reduced to 20; after yesterday reduced to 10 for the finals|pg||
nt|me argent: tough event |pg||
nt|ahollan1: National Swiss reduction even more drastic|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Probably the toughest, because of the deep cuts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not -- site just showing top 10  but 36 teams in the final of the Swiss|pg||
nt|daman: well    I think we are up todate on the PoY  with the help of the specs    Stansby   Sontag   and Brogeland are the only 3 in the running     when Moss DNQ in the Reisenger he was ...|pg||
nt|daman: eliminated     I thought he could drop down to the NA Swiss    not so|pg||
nt|me argent: most of teams cut are 1st class|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Brad Moss, that is.   Mike is playing in the Reisinger today|pg||
nt|daman: vraiment|pg||
nt|USBF:  Reisinger standings after 10 rounds:  1.Cayne 19.72; 2.Smirnov 159.34; 3.Bathurst 17.77;  4.Rosenthal 17.28; 5.Jacobus 16.25;6.Gordon 16.19;    7.Fleisher 15.00; 8.Moss 14.34; 9.Strul 14.1110. Jacobs 13.65;|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: problem may not be with convention -- but the decision to use it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Stansby would NOT open 4@D in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: a couple of minutes until rd 3|pg||
nt|daman: I always thought that you would not have an outside Ace when you tried Namyats|pg||
nt|me argent: conventions are there to be used and more importantly be abused|pg||
nt|daman: if partner had a red Ace and the @C King     it would be most unfortunate|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I think that w/Namyats, players can play it either way, the same sort of thing as in Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each partnership defines which holdings are valid for Namyats|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Michaels used to be reserved for either very weak or very strong hands, but now players use it for all distributiuoonal hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think George Rosenkranz write-up was probably the most restrictive|pg||
nt|me argent: i put namyats rgt up there with playing transfers when using the weak nt|pg||
nt|me argent: well maybe not as high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I was incorrect about Board 5|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The defense got a diamond ruff, so...|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Another win there for Rosenthal.|pg||
nt|me argent: cannot start next round until all teams finished |pg||
nt|me argent: hostage to slowest table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein went for 800 twice -- or was it 3 times |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the real problem is that players mill about and don't come to their table right away.  now 3 mins are already gone from the clock this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told players DO get to compare with teammates between rounds -- what does panel think of this "barometer" type situation?|pg||
nt|daman: I think they got +800 and went for 800|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, they are comparing after each round as of now|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: The overalls will now change radically after this last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for many of US|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cayne having won all 3 boards to the (then) leaders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't remember who brought it up earlier, but  race for Player of the Year will go to Lew Stansby if Team Fleisher finishes in top 8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: still waiting, altough the round clock for the next round is at 22 (starts at 27)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|kit: North is passed hand, presumably has A@H, K@D, Q@S, so no K@C|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: I think Piekarek and Smirnov have played every session in this event; certainly every session in the past two days|pg||
