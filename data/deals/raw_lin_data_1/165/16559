mb|3S|nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: I would prefer to defend 3@S as North|pg||
nt|ady: 3 spades  tough and go    4 definate losers     4 hearts now over the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not a lot wrong with 4@H, it's on a finesse more or less|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mamos: hi everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
nt|mamos: Who is South ?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|an|4|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is  Nygren|pg||
mb|3D|an|  |nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Mike and David|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
nt|dburn: good morning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C checkback (?)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding for a 20 20 hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|rmb1: ... or something else, any guesses about 2@D|pg||
nt|mug: did North bid 2@D or 2@H operator?|pg||
nt|dburn: very law-abiding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi John and David|pg||
nt|dburn: although East-West might illegaly have made nine tricks in spades also|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has some ways of going down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aternon|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mug: I think one heart finesse, then a club to the jack|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: thinking..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: cards on table more thought|pg||
nt|dburn: should be OK from here - East can return a club to kill a discard, but declarer has enough tricks with hearts 2-2 and @sA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: two or three cards being fingered...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|mug: East could be ducking from @HK-x-x-x|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps it's simply too early in the morning to worry about bad breaks?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|dburn: yes, but not entirely of her own doing - her partner could have taken a trick more|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate 3@h with East's hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|hA|nt|rmb1: its already 12 o'clock - should be awake by now|pg||

nt|mug: this looks more interesting!|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C when clubs are 1-1 and you can ruff 3x@H in North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and oul N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mug: that's a good start for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have to open 1@C playing normal methods with North's 22HCP|pg||
mb|2D|an|gf|nt|dburn: must play 2/1 game forcing, I guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep next what though|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but even so, you might risk 2@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eggy: I have http://tinyurl.com/4vxjrjc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: EW have nor real fit   values for game   |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: rather than putting this down as dummy in 2@s|pg||
nt|mug: she might have tried redouble on the way, just once in a while EW aren't playing in hearts|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D* would have been a lot, although Sally Brock may not have stood it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j for standings - now updated|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the results I think the adjustment represents capping the results of a round to +28IMP|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|jcomyn: where will this all end|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: The field is starting to widen a bit now|pg||
nt|eggy: but you can gain up to 28 imps per match|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eggy: or lose any amount - scoring is x imps/8 capped at 28 for the winners|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT, I should think|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jtr: I guess she will go after @ss and get home here|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunate lie of cards for East-West, but game likely to be bid at most tables|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT with @H like this also makes|pg||
nt|dburn: better not try 4@h, though - that won't make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mug: so why didn't the 2nd pair receive a negative adjustment for their +53 in round one?|pg||
nt|mug: kibitzer makes a good point|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds pose threat for 4 of either major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: may get home playing clubs too I suppose|pg||
nt|mamos: or Clubs lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|dburn: not yet - North needs to shift to clubs|pg||

pc|d5|nt|eggy: if the defence lay off diamonds now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eggy: It won't make much difference, but trying to make as many ruffs as possible looked a better prospect|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with 4@h also down on a club lead, this may not be too expensive|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|mamos: dont think East thought that through|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps North could have tried slam over the double, the finesses were likely to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: the pair that got -31 got their full score. the pair that got +31 were adjusted to +28|pg||
nt|rmb1: The cap is per round (of 7 boards) not per session (of 2/3 rounds)|pg||
nt|mug: another possible slam |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a nice break in s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|dburn: 3NT will make, but 4@h won't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they will|pg||
nt|mug: ic|pg||
nt|mug: maybe she can bid 2@C transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|mug: a popular and effective method|pg||
nt|mug: I like transfers here as you can happily give up the natural 1NT, much better to pass with the 6-9 hands rather than let the next hand off the hook by bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|jtr: Unlucky 4@s here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure is|pg||
nt|jtr: Might get doubled even|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: natural 1NT over 1M-(dbl) is one of the worst bids in bridge in my view|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: some form of puppetry|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: cruel game sometimes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: infact it is a cruel game most of the time|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@s not a very satisfactory bid but understandable|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and this form may actually work|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not thast it matters a great deal in 3nt|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mug: 3@D too timid|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mug: hi Bill|pg||
nt|jtr: Now will get a double surely?|pg||
nt|eggy: no|pg||
nt|eggy: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: north had no way to show that diamond suit immediately over the double?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|eggy: Looks like it will end the same though|pg||
nt|dburn: though this lead will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: Tom was describing the merits of 2@C transfer instead of 2@D when N passed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings |pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
nt|jcomyn: why by the way. I did that the other night and pard had no trick. I won my 3 spades and that was all|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks cosy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe they like to have six-card suits for these actions, but still |pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: a diamond would have been worst for the defence (apart from ace and another trump, which would have been fatal)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|eggy: To be honest, any lead should have been enough, once you see the dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mug: I don't think pass was a crime, but 3@D was|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c9|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: As you say, it can be a hard life|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|athene: if north, in their partnership style, passes a wide range of hands over the double, then there is a case for lebensohl next time i suppose|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jtr: Find a better partner is my advice|pg||

nt|jcomyn: my pazrtners dont|pg||
nt|eggy: I refer you to my honourable friend's reply above John|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not totally trivial here is it? let's say the defence start with three rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: now declarer can't draw all the trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Jagger/Seale bid (and made) 6@C on  9 but we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but south ducks the @HA and now there is a heart ruff lurking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they wont be in 4S surely|pg||
nt|mug: South's duck is the key play in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4-0 trump break definitely causes a but of bother|pg||
nt|mug: let's see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of bothere even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i would only this one is good-looking|pg||
nt|dburn: modern game may be to overcall 1@h rather than double|pg||
nt|dburn: but double covers more bases, especially facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wht do u think|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|athene: double from south now i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: I would double, but I understand 1@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: especially if s bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: East is Helen Erichsen, wife of Espen, West is Margaret Nygren (previously James and Courtney) wife of Martin|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rubbitch|pg||
nt|mamos: now double :)|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that doubling now ought to be a better hand than this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway u doint want to find the 4-4 fit here|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: end|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north will have to put a lead-directing 3@C bid in to cause a problem for declarer in 4@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt or 4@S now ?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|eggy: Do the panel prefer x of 1S?|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably inferring a diamond fit, but I still hate 3S|pg||
nt|dburn: not 3NT, surely|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@d OK, catering for partner having six hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: where is this heading|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: i expect we will get a diamond lead now rather than the club, so no problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well well who would have thought that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, south going for a singleton heart opposite perhaps and an immediate knockout with two ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: reasonable defence|pg||
nt|athene: or this might work with hearts 3-3 in the EW hands if north can win a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Does the panel prefer 1@s or 2@c as a response to partner's opening 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly dont like 1s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting out of hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eggy: The way she's bid it, east light as well have started with 2S I think|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they avoided the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but i see it made|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know why - perhaps North misunderstood what South was trying to do|pg||
nt|mamos: but it didnt do much good|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, 4@s might make - you can draw trumps despite the break, and everything else is favourable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|eggy: If 1C can be short (probable) then I prefer 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: ace of hearts, heart, north wins trump, club to ace, heart ruff|pg||
nt|mug: there was a very famous hand many years ago when an Italian led @CA from A-x-x-x in a similar situation|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mug: rather than @DA from A-x-x-x-x|pg||
nt|athene: on the subject of a 3@C bid over 2nt for the lead, you can often get away with very aggressive lead-directing bids in that sort of position|pg||
nt|rmb1: An Jagger/Seale bid to 5@D= on  10 - after 1@H(X)1NT :)|pg||
nt|mug: there was a lot of talk when @CA lead was the winner|pg||

mb|4C|nt|jcomyn: we have plenty of them here too - the we-didnt-come-here to pass brigade|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with overcalling 4-card suits with good hands is it's really hard to move forwards thereafter, because you are always worried that you will end in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|eggy: I coming round to the view that opeing 1S is almost never the successful action with this shape|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially with such good @cs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bu surely when p game forces you bid your hand out|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe she will now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but i agree compl;etely withg 1c opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, no less an authority than Jeff Meckstroth says that when partner raises your six-card major, you should just bid game in it|pg||
nt|mug: this is typical|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that's one problem :) another problem is your partner just gets you too high anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there yar and the end of the s fit i daresay|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East can infer the sixth spade opposite now and make the master bid of 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it might be if they bid a slam now - but someone will deny a diamond control|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jtr: Really West?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, Meckstroth doesn't have much of a record in the Lady Milne trials|pg||

nt|jcomyn: fascinating|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: 4@C interpreted as a cue bid (as it should be in my opinion), 4@H denying a diamond control. Nygren not on the same wavelength|pg||
