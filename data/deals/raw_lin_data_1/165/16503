nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Nigel Kearney|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Youngest in this event is 14 I believe, Dave Thompson's son, Jamie|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: that's right|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Exciting hand to start|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: Upper limit 25?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@h is too high as there is a trump promotion on the third diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: not going so well in this stage, but did well to make the final|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: yes iyt's u26|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most of them in their early 20's I think|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: there are about 5 under 20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C probably shortage|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I am guessing South has shown a spade shortage and heart support|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Will South make another move?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think they both have shown shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not after no diamond cue bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: braun is 18|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|nigel_k:  Aces are not the problem here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT is ill-advised when you have a useless doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, small doubleton and void as well|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They can beat this double dummy as Nigel said but that is a very difficult defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second round of diamonds overtaken by Ginnan, and a 3rd played|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  Should be down one since dummy suggests a trump trick must be needed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That will promote @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Henbest trying to whos KQ doubleton by leading the queen followed by the king|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that partner can't know that you also have the king when you lead the queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: whos = show  sorry|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But West does know that North has @hA and K|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  So if !Q is singleton there is no defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I recommend that you only do that with AK doubleton where partner can't get in the way|pg||
mc|12|nt|Walddk2: IF you normally lead A from AK, lead K and then A with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and vice versa if king is your normal lead from AK|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Is 2@C alerted because it can be 3, or because they play Gazzilli?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: sry i can't read lucy's handwriting from here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  I think West would bid 2@s if it was not Gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Do they really play Gazzilli. If so, I am impressed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: I have said on many occasions. Gazzilli will be mainstream in 10 years (except for USA where everything is disallowed)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I still like a semi-natural 2@c rebid but play 2@d Bart over it|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: think she played K@C sing us she can see AK@S in other side :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they had to put her in dummy if they wanted to set up East's diamonds, so I don't think you can deduce anything from that|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can,not have much more |pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: i think she simply miscounted her tricks (she had one turned the wrong way)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Well the defence could have played a low diamond on the second round and unblock them later|pg||

mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I doubt North is finished bidding|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  So bidding 2@c over 1@s would have been better as you would know North has long hearts when they bid them again|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nigel_k:  The way it has gone, North will expect South to have a takeout shape|pg||
