mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|jonky:  3NT would fail only facing @D lead|pg||
nt|jonky:  since the clubs split 2-2|pg||
nt|by:  and @Hk was on|pg||
nt|by:  but with E being 11-13, I doubt it ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: a good tactic is to compete as vigorously as you can immediately over an ambiguous opening, like east's 1@D.  But south has too good a hand to preempt.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|by:  three rounds of diamonds for a @H pitch is too much to ask of south since 1@d did not deny diamonds?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: irght|pg||
nt|othered1: right,that is.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: wsouth is simply trying to make 8 tricks here, and will succeed|pg||
nt|jonky:  @H return is more likely|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting that in the CR, east passed the junky hand and NS got to the three level, down, on their own.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|othered1: had east been able to open a natural @C, or rebid 2@C, EW m ay have pushed NS up a level here, too.|pg||

nt|wkc:  hi everyone, welcome back to Taipei, Taiwan for the SF of 18th NTU cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back everyone!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  2@S shows @S and a minor, and 4@C shows @C and @H|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzxs: welcome all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: This is a re-match of last year's University Cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: the is the second half of NTU cup SF|pg||
nt|lorderic: NTU cup is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: for your information, here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
nt|lorderic: sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  hello everyone, welcome back to the QF segment 2/2 of 18th NTU cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS is playing precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: NCTU defeat BTU and advanced in the finals last time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: BTU has 7.5 IMPs carryover in 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's a huge carryover imo|pg||
nt|lorderic: the very first board in CR is a disaster for EW, 3NT is much better|pg||
nt|lorderic: can't blame W bid leaping michaels to show 2 suits|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a maximum opening hand (14-15) with spades|pg||
nt|lorderic: at the other SF match, another BTU team is leading NCCU by 49.5 IMPs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lorderic: welcome back everyone!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lorderic: In the second half of QF we broadcast NTHU vs BTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: if both BTU teams win, that will be a battle of the same in the final|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lorderic: same school|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: for those who is new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU is ahead by 7.5 IMPs, 12 boards to go|pg||
nt|wkc:  E need to lead a @H to set 3NT, which needs a little imaginary|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU is known as Bridgeclub in national Taiwan University, the largest collegiate bridge club in Taiwan|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|lorderic: a @H lead would set 1NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wkc:  looks like the declarer is heading to one off|pg||

nt|lorderic: here comes a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 12 top tricks so 6NT by N is also cold|pg||
nt|wkc:  or 6NT(by N) I hope|pg||
nt|lorderic: yup|pg||
nt|lorderic: 6@H/@S/NT is cold for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: this is a 3-day collegiate event|pg||
nt|lorderic: looks like a flat 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lorderic: For those new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: N is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to bid 4N|pg||
nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|lorderic: with such a huge hand perhaps it's better to open a strong 2@C instead of 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: Sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lorderic: @S lead gives an overtrick|pg||
nt|wkc:  W might think about open 2@C, but 1@S then bid @H describe his hand better|pg||
mb|6S|nt|wkc:  oops|pg||
nt|lorderic: S should bid 4@D after 3NT for a slam try|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what 3NT shows, but if it shows extra, S should move on to the slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree, pass seems a little underbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and if it shows min, then N should bid something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and if it includes a wide range, then maybe they should discuss a little more about their system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: for your information, CGU has 4.5IMP carryover for this 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@D by N didn't work much, so they get to @S slam easily|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back KC!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wkc:  hi eric|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lorderic: S could double 5@C to ask for a @C lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: N lead his singleton @C anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lorderic: on this lead NS should easily get 5 top tricks for -1|pg||
nt|lorderic: if NS cashed 4 top hearts, could be -2 if E decide to keep clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|lorderic: prevent from an overtrick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wkc:  now the declarer has a @S+@CAQ squeese for 13 tricks, but it doesn't work this time|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|12|pg||
qx|c15|st||md|1SAT74HKDQ9643CA83,SJ6HQJT7D2CJT7652,SKQ3HA632DAKT5CK9,S9852H9854DJ87CQ4|sv|n|nt|wkc:  a good 4@S for EW, but not easy to reach there|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS might reach 3NT on this if N bid aggressively|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a slam for NS|pg||
nt|lorderic: as I know, EW used to play in a highly artificial system called MOSCITO|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like they didn't play that in this event|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|wkc:  and it's a grand slam, lets see if they could reach there|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  12-14?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lorderic: NS could make 3@S and EW could make 4@D on this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like NS is playing weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2NT should be a lebensohl here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 7@D is almost a lay-down|pg||
nt|lorderic: can make 7NT with dropping @SJx|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|wkc:  if it's a 12-14 1NT, then N did bid aggressively|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D opening from S is precision, could have longer @C than @D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lorderic: it's unlikely for west to bid 4@D after 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance to get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: a raise to 3@S now would get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: W chooses an aggressive one|pg||
nt|wkc:  South should bid 3@C right after pn's overcall, because things like this happens everyday|pg||
nt|lorderic: Do they play strong club Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1N shows 13-15|pg||
nt|lorderic: N hand to me is only an invitational one|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is some kind of checkback|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzxs: but west wanna to do that haha|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's too risky due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree. in competative bidding, one should raise pd's suit as soon as possible|pg||
nt|lorderic: now 5@C is kind of risky while Vul |pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: they both lead 014th|pg||
nt|wkc:  this is going to go down quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  now they make another mistake and get an "expensive" sacrifice|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzxs: NS they play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|lorderic: with everything unfavor to declarer, I expect this will go down 2 or 3|pg||
mb|4N|nt|wkc:  X = "pn, please don't bid again"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@D is real @D and 3@D shows a fit in @D|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|lorderic: N knows they have all the keycards... what's next?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: that's a good news for NCTU... because 2NT goes down also|pg||
nt|wkc:  now N knows they have all the keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: he just settled in 6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wkc:  W wants to use J(from QJ) to indicate a @H shift|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think it's better to tell your pn that fact by bidding 5NT, instead of 6@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: he does not know how many @H S have|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lorderic: if @S has a hand like Axx Kxx Qxxxx Ax then 7 is not playable|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|lorderic: i mean SOUTH not SPADE|pg||

nt|wkc:  will S bid 1@D with that hand, I mean I think he might open 1NT with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: EW can make 3NT, but i don't think they would get there|pg||
nt|wkc:  a 20 points 3NT for EW, but I think it's a little hard too reach there|pg||
nt|wkc:  looks like a @S vs @H drama again here|pg||
nt|lorderic: how about Axxx Kxx Qxxxx A?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D!|nt|lorderic: an off-shape 1NT opening|pg||
nt|wkc:  then you could throw away your @H w/ @CK|pg||
nt|wkc:  and maybe he|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: it looks like NS don't play pre ?|pg||
nt|wkc:  he'll raise @S after 1@S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lorderic: 4@H is the par, but if S open 1@H and W takeout|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wkc:  he tries his best for 3NT :P|pg||
nt|lorderic: hmm... seems like NS here does not play precision as the other pair do|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: EW might bid 4@S after 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: good decision for north not raising 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: hand is too weak and @HKQx is better for defense|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is now thinking for a sacrifice|pg||
nt|lorderic: otherwise N should open 1@C with 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is glad to see no X here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lorderic: no double, no trouble|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lorderic: although 4@H/4@S both go down 1, I don't think it is a bad sacrifice|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lorderic: if either makes that would be huge IMPs for not bidding 4@S|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|lorderic: 4@H is a great contract... only before you see the cards lie|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lorderic: E could play a low @S to drop singleton @SK in S, or ...|pg||
nt|wkc:  now E is thinking which is more likely, N has singleton @SJ or S has singleton @SK|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like south meant 2N as lebensohl, strongly requesting a 3@C rebid by doubler then a weaker bid than a direct suit.  Here, north seems to have taken it as either better minor ...|pg||
nt|othered1: or "scramble" with two places to play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: But east rode to the rescue.|pg||
