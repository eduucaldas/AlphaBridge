pc|cT|nt|othered1: EW were likely going plus against 2@H -- but not clearly enough to sit the double.  And with  that friendly lead, 2@S will be a m atter of overtricks.|pg||

nt|snigill: now he shuld pick up diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: I would have doubled 1@H to begin with, then let it up to partner.  Double only shows a 1@H response I would have been happy to make if north has passed|pg||
nt|peachy: is a little weak for it but still|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not, because I think it sets up a force|pg||
nt|snigill: since club lead is from length|pg||

nt|snigill: 2 spades is xfer and 2 nt probably something in clubs for a possible 3 nt|pg||

nt|snigill: 4 clubs is quite an optimistic bid|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: As to the lead, with long trumps I would lead from length, but perhaps trying for ruffs with the baby trumps was just as good|pg||

nt|athene: very interesting decision for south now|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: sure, you might have a lot of tricks if partner has the right hand, but you could easily be off AA or @CAK|pg||
nt|athene: and i don't see how you can investigate without risking ending up in 5@D or something instead of 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt = a|pg||

nt|pelu: 6@D = average - 3 NT 20%|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 4@D|pg||
nt|othered1: some may have methods over 2N to show majors (I would double for that purpose).  That may work less well than the overcall.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the 3@S bid does help south a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you give east a really good spade suit (@SAQJ) that means the @SK is working AND partner has everything else|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes of course 6NT makes and 6@D is down on a spade ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: and even when they both make, you want to be in notrumps at mp|pg||

nt|athene: easy @SA lead in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: Barry Crane had a motto "if opps bid slam and i have an ace, there is no lead problem"|pg||
nt|athene: just holding a slam to 12 tricks can be worth quite a bit|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is if u have A + KQ|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course there are situations where it looks tempting to try to set up a trick|pg||
nt|athene: if you think people won't be in it, you have to try to beat it|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if NS were left unimpeded if 6@D won't be reached more often.  Here a threat of @S ruff loomed.|pg||
nt|athene: if you have stoppers in two suits you might decide the chances of their running 13 tricks is low enough you can try to beat|pg||
nt|pelu: now No 1 aganist No 2 (EW)|pg||
nt|athene: if east hadn't led the @SA, i wonder what declarer would have done|pg||
nt|athene: winning line is just to cash everything and squeeze east in the majors|pg||
nt|pelu: auto squeeze - and no risk|pg||
nt|athene: a spectator suggests the @SQ lead :) well, if east does that, good luck to him!|pg||
