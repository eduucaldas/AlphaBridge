pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||
nt|nagini: a feeling in fingers counts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|3for3: a @D lead can cause problems for declarer...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: South, I think, even lives in Germany right now, working as a Bridge teacher|pg||
nt|tomi2: E/W play transfers over their 1@C opener, even undoubled|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Good judgment by South to pass|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: Ciech. had a tough rebid with 5-5 inv.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the xfer at 1 level it is usefull to receive the lead from tha hand with points|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt now may be|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt.np|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond lead breaks the late entry to dummy.  declarer will fail..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
nt|3for3: not too late to shift to the diamond, and give him a problem|pg||
nt|3for3: not obvious to lead into AKQJxx of a suit though|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s to 3@d|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps they play 3@S as forcing|pg||
nt|tez: ''2@d''|pg||
nt|3for3: north can infer diamonds are as you see them...partner might have led a stiff if he had one|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D should not be some slamtry, both players were limited and made a non forcing bid to start with|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, 5@d might be only one down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: possible to make game here having Ax in both suit|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||

pc|d5|nt|Walddk6: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from snow-brushed central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|nagini: closer and closer...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42: evening|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vbman: l also very much appreciate the german national team|pg||
nt|tomi2: the main aim from all teams is to finish top 8 here in this round robin|pg||
nt|tomi2: thank you :)|pg||
nt|vbman: any co?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  As you can see declarer has no choice but to play for @sK onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but no communication to play this line having a loser in @d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|3for3: too late for diamond shift...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: with the 9-12 teams having similar advantage while the 13-16 teams will have to work hard, if they don't want to play in 2nd devision next year|pg||
nt|vbman: blew some tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: the "Katok" team basicly consists of players from Belarus and Lithuania, but they were welcome to join the polish league system and made their way throught the lower leagues and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: are constant members of 1st devision|pg||
nt|vbman: they have polish nationality?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tomi2: east tried not to joker around in teams, thats good. a small heart would have cut declarer from the club tricks, but he took the safer way for -1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tomi2: its always difficult for "outsiders" to identify the teams, because neraly all of them have companies as sponsor, so their teams are called so|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|tomi2: no, but they are member of polish bridge federation|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I suppose doubleton king with East is also possiblee|pg||

nt|vbman: he wont bid any less than 4h|pg||
nt|tomi2: but we won't see them live this weekend since the matches are played in 2 diffrent cities, and we have the North-East teams here|pg||
nt|jcmax: As it did this particular South :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Some players believe in the rule hcp + number of spades >= 15, otherwise don't open in last seat.|pg||
nt|serhat: true but I think S had a good hand|pg||
nt|nagini: flat one|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: teams from south and west, lke Wroclaw, play among themselfes in another city|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish 1@C by North now I assume. 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: winner are always winners|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nagini: riski 3 cl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but right time for it|pg||
nt|tomi2: what I find interesting is that both NS pairs, using the same methods, chose different bids on every of the first 4 hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he had opened there would have been a danger of the pair getting to 3@H which would have been one level too high|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
nt|tez: flat 3NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in doubt now as the 1@H response is not Polish|pg||
mb|2N|nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3NT very much looks like fast arrival to me, meaning partner I have a really bad hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-6(7)  and 1@H therefore 8+, but maybe only 7+ for them|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
nt|serhat: exciting on a dia lead!|pg||
nt|jcmax: W definitely found the best elad!|pg||
nt|serhat: so 4s was better|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|3for3: defense can build 2@H's and take 3 aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: And also note how important it is he chose a low @D and not the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||

nt|jcmax: It really depends. If you have reasons to assume there is at most a doubleton in dummy then a low one clearly would be best even from the first holding.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say declarer has Qx in dummy and A9xx in his hand. he will almost certainly put up the Q.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 7h here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
nt|nagini: eee|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we predict they will bid 7N?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is an artificial game-force|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think so..|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||

nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
nt|jcmax: When the opponents play relays I strongly feel with a hand like N's one should get involved in the bidding especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kwiecien asking, Jagniewski telling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would get in with 2@D?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, because 2@D will not hurt their relays|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then it makes no sense|pg||

nt|egezzer: Nice to see here that Konrad Araszkiewicz and Dariusz Kowalski. Impossible to watch for me them until in 12th World Championship Verone 2006(Open Pairs) and played very well ...|pg||
nt|egezzer: actually|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  would he like to have bit of rest now? :-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SKQJ and 5 hearts with west|pg||
nt|tomi2: with semi-friendly clubs and the marked @D finesse 6NT should make. @C10 is dropping, so the 9 will be a trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: I think with side king + SQ he wouldm bid his king, but having shown DK already he only bid 5S|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D could have been a singleton|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|po-s: I meant having cued diamonds already...|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't know their agreements on 3NT, it could promise a flat hand, then 4@D would be the king for sure|pg||
nt|po-s: problem with trumps 4-1 as he has both a club and a heart loser|pg||
nt|po-s: but lucky this time|pg||
nt|tomi2: Jagniewski avoided problems in trumps by bidding 6Nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think he forgot to cash @CA|pg||

nt|othered1: How did that go for 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: false renonse in the previous board|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the real question is did North have to back in after 3N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very good evaluation by West|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then you need enough entries for making this finese and later taking advantage of the @C trick. this way he sould not cash and finesse because @D back would kill the 4th club ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: the way he played he would have lost to QTxx onside|pg||
nt|3for3: easy from here :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3: some danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|jcmax: This looks like a fairly normal 3NT for NS|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now a pretty straightforward 3NT with an easy ride when diamonds come in for five tricks|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: but 3NT was a likely make so I guess yes|pg||
nt|tez: dbl|pg||

nt|3for3: double with a side void, kinda strange|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi Sabine!|pg||
nt|tez: imposible dbl ofcourse:(|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: expected him to open 1@C on this|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|tez: Welcome Sabine:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vbman: doing good work indeed, tx to her|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT response to a takeout double is constructive, around 6-10|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tomi2: east can cuebid 5@H now I think or should this show one ace more?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|trotto: w @sJ moglbys gdyby to dziad mial miec piki lub @s stopera|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision by N - passed partner - no hope for game|pg||
nt|nagini: juniors lying?:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S competitive - with interesting hand DBL|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@H i mean|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Hej Anita @H|pg||
nt|3for3: the danger of bidding 2@S is you are setting up partner to save in 4@S, when your hand has lots of defensive potential|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! i am wondering why N bid 2@D here instead of a straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whereas a suit response can be 0|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N definitely looks like the contract he wants to play.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D apparently in their methods is forcing, but where does it lead?|pg||
nt|serhat: He might be thinking leading a H!?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcmax: Can slam really be on? and if the answer to that is no, then a bid like 2@D on another day may give away too much information to the opponents.|pg||

nt|trotto: sry , wrong|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|sT|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|vbman: must be careful after cl opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To our less experienced viewers. So do not respond 1NT on   Kxx  xxx  xxxx  xxx   2@D is the call, 0-8 with at least 4 diamonds|pg||

nt|3for3: i dont think declarer would have even made 4@H here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: Notus on the board now with a swing|pg||
nt|jcmax: The one thing worrying me with the E hand would be that partner didn't take action over 1@H very well knowing that he is short in @H.|pg||
nt|serhat: can Kwieccien claim 10 for this too pls?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||
nt|vbman: yessss|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping N will finesse again, then Vainikonis would have to do something in @D to get an entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vbman: he can still go wrong easily|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if he had to cross in @D he could have finessed first, then west could win the queen, cross to partners @DA and get a ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: two major kings some quacks and dia ace wont be with west but its easy when wee see all hands|pg||
nt|vbman: quack=queen or jack|pg||
nt|tomi2: in the CR they found the great opening lead under @D aces but did not manage their ruff|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H |pg||

nt|Gerben42: assume a @S lead you play directly @H to 10|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D MULTI (6 cards in one major)|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt look like it will be too difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And these guys know the percentage play in spades, cashing the ace first|pg||
nt|serhat: I guess they will bid 4h|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nagini: NS play Mozart im mjrs:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s @s and minor weak hand i think|pg||
nt|nagini: minimulti 6 + mjr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends how many hearts Kalida bids next, 2 or 3|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which would be wrong at matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
nt|jcmax: Transfer bids over 1@C openings are becoming increasingly popular.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
nt|jcmax: Against 4@H EW can get a @D ruff, but only at the expense of a natural trump trick. Declarer however may misguess trumps and then 4@H could go down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: without key card Blackwood, one might get to a grand slam here :)|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Kalida is taking easy as not Vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say E had bid a preeemptive 3@D instead of 2@D (if available), then declarer may very well decide to play a @H to the K.|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to bid 4h now|pg||
nt|serhat: cant let 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Russyan did enough by doubling and bidding 2NT. I would have passed 3@H I must confess|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I am surprised he didnt bid 4h over 2nt|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a very poor contract|pg||
