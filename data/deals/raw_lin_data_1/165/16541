nt|roghog: I like to play 1@C-1@D-1@H as artificial, forcing. Solves lots of problems|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|baldjean: South may have ideas though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: the defence might be able to set up five tricks by attacking spades in time|pg||
nt|athene: coming to three spades and one in each red suit|pg||
mb|3C|an|Alert|mb|p|nt|athene: if declarer tries to set up nine by way of four diamonds, one spade, two hearts and two clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|baldjean: knows*|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south had to rebid 2@S because 3@D would have shown extras|pg||
nt|athene: now the fifth diamond gets lost but that might be ok - Eva might lead a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: @DK or @DJ quite possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: @DK better than jack, trying to snag a stiff queen in north's hand perhaps|pg||
nt|baldjean: that's very helpful|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: good evening|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roghog: Croeso|pg||
mb|4C|an|Alert|nt|athene: let's hope 4@C is forcing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, maybe it's keycard in clubs|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|roghog: Precision EW, it seems. Shields-Denning in action?|pg||
nt|athene: yeah, looks like it in view of 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: Oh, sorry. This is the English room...|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugrapha4: 4@c appears RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|jbgood: surely not better minor:)|pg||

nt|roghog: Hmm, that would be imaginative|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: when opps bid and raise a suit, you definitely don't need a stop in it, because it will be 4-4 :)|pg||
nt|athene: or not, of course, here|pg||
nt|athene: not much point playing this because there is no chance for 13 tricks safely, i don't think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roghog: WBU is another Welsh team, so they have to play each other first|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if NS have definite lebensohl agreements re 3@C on this auction? if not, i would be very worried as south|pg||
nt|athene: as i haven't shown any values and i have a monster|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i suppose you can throw a spade on this and then run the trumps|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: and hope for something weird|pg||
nt|athene: but just claiming 12 looks like a simpler way to live life|pg||

nt|athene: ok last board now|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Last boardthis segment|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|athene: north decides if opps are going to open 1@D and bury *his* 6-card suit... he will return the favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this will likrly end in 3nt, but I would not like to have to play it|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roghog: rolling towards 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: guess at trick 1 in hearts|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugrapha4: Return for seg 2 inabout 25 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 11:15 ESDT for next 16 boards|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|jbgood: not so strange - but lie very unfriendly|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: west can see all the suits are lying poorly for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: he has the blacks over dummy; his partner has the diamonds over declarer (he hopes) :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: not completely safe as south could have a very strong hand but still a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps a case for the spade jack?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the jack is possible as it will clear up the suit for west|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess on this bidding north really can't have a spade fit so a small spade is unlikely to be misread|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to use up the @SA for the small extra chances given by leading a club from hand|pg||
nt|athene: also if north has @CQx and ducks a club off dummy, as she surely will, you score a huge goal|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: doesnt matter now, but if S had some other spade holding|pg||
nt|roghog: unpleasant one to play. may try a @D to the 10 at some stage|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely play on clubs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: west might just cash out - he doesn't know how good declarer's diamonds are|pg||
nt|athene: just give north the @DJ and the situation is urgent|pg||
nt|roghog: risky not to cash out|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but perhaps with only ace-empty in diamonds, east would duck the king - does winning right away there say you have the diamonds wrapped up?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: this is something that many players find it hard to get used to - just tackling a suit from whichever hand you happen to be in at the time, because using up an entry to reach the ...|pg||
nt|athene: other hand can cost in lots of ways|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks all|pg||
