mb|p|nt|frankaus: Brown the top seed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|caitlin: @C-@D-@H does not promise 5 hearts|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all - welcone 2/4 X 16 boards AUS seniors summers final|pg||
nt|pelu: EW easy make 3NT, but not 4@h - a strange bid by Milne - for me a 100% X|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: 3@SX look like -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: Zollo seeded 4 making the final by running 2nd in stage 2 of the 6 team round robbin yesterday|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|chilloncan: welcome back, folks. free beer in the foyer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|pelu: no need to play @cK|pg||
nt|caitlin: a @S lead with continual spades would have been worst lead, pumping declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|frankaus: Brown won the the stage 2 match V Zollo by 31 IMPS and receives 15.5 imps carry forward|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: not sure why N bid 1S on thatr minimum in the face of a call  y W which presumably showed spades|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|pelu: @h9 a nice surprise for S|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||
nt|caitlin: so @S lead would have been best for opponents:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: some may regard the 2D bid as the most curious of all|pg||

nt|frankaus: Zollo - Januszke based in Adelaide|pg||
mb|1H|nt|caitlin: Goes to show one that optimum bidding not always necessary:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: Brown - Kanetkar based in sydney|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: fine auction all around|pg||
mb|d|nt|frankaus: NS based  in Adelaide - EW in Sydney |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: Brown an insurance industry executive - Kanetker a medical doctor|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: until 5S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: bizarre call at these colours|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: @SJ would kill 3NT, now decl has a - very small - chance|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chilloncan: pd is short in Ds, OK. but do u rally expect to make 5S? and isnt your defense against 5D reasonable to say the least?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: and bear in mind that EW have shown no serious fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: S has lots of defense but N's @CKQx kills 5@D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: N can count that his pd has an entry and besr defense i to set up the @S-suit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S will get away with his call as D is cold but it so easily could be a phantom|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugrapha3: sorry everyone i lost i have lost trck of card play|pg||
nt|frankaus: the mirror layout met chalenge declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|marcsmith: EW can make 2C NS a couple of either major |pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: Klinger won the South-West Pacific Teams which finished a couple of hours ago and is the top qualifier to the National Open Teams finals|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: this match is from the top section of the draw, whereby the loser gets a second chance|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW could be in trouble here but vulnerability is on their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable vulnerability = bid 'em up!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|mrdct: 3NT for NS is touch and go|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marcsmith: heart lead a spade switch is best for the defence -- not obvious to find tho|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: only has 8 obvious tricks but the defence could falter and present a @s trick for delcarer before getting to their 5 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can Thompson find the double hook in @C for the make??|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|nickf: Can we have the player names please?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|mrdct: if delcarer plays on @s himself it will need to be a low @s to the 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: although actually low to Q will also work if he drops the J on the 2nd round of @s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: what he doesn't want to do is cash @d first as that could very easily set up the 5th defensive trick|pg||
nt|mrdct: choosing to win is hand looks like he's planning to go after @s immediately|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marcsmith: the south hand is going to get mangled when declarer runs the clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if you were here last set, i must correct bad info i gave|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the matches are 32 boards  so this is the final segment of the match|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c8|mc|11|nt|ahollan1: the winner here moves on to the Semi-Final, the loser gets a 2nd chance  [but i think the other match is win or go home]|pg||

nt|pelu: green against red - many would open 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and bad choice of spade to ruff with. if he ruffed higher and save smaller...|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: this 3D preempt is better than opening 5NT|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|chilloncan: other than that i dont see its charm. medocre suit, bad shape, and way too low a ratio of offense to defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this will be interesting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|chilloncan: also you have a decent dummy for either major|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: strange bidding in OR - same start, but on the X east bid 2@d - and then West 5@D over 4@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe S thinks he is down 50|pg||
nt|caitlin: with preempt then 3N, not uncommon to lay down an Ace to look at dummy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: with n7 in front  - ducking is an unnecessary  risk IMO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nicely done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are only a few of us in the room so if there's something special you want to discuss -- just holler|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: Alex Smirnov is a regular on the german open team and the welland team in US nationals|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i believe 2@D=artifiicial game force|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mrdct: he has been a regular visitor to the main australian summer events in recent years - particularly Youth Week|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4+ hcp, no good suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickf: -------------------------------------------------->   Can you please put the player names in?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: south worth a raise now given that he passed 1st round|pg||
nt|mrdct: north has quite a good hand with some game prospects even opposite a very weak hand|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a heart lead or switch forces declarer to guess the clubs, but he can afford a wrong guess on a spade continuation|pg||
nt|mrdct: but he will anticipate that communication will likely be a problem|pg||
nt|mrdct: even more so with dummy a 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the players in the NOT [national open teams]  qualified for the event via a 14-round swiss event called the SWPT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Klinger won that event after gaining the lead in round 3 or 4 [and never looked back]|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to back 5@D contracts   you won't see that often -- especially in non-imp games|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marcsmith: now he has to guess the clubs again|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mrdct: at the risk of some differing views, i would say that EW have been quite easily the top pair in Victoria for the past 5 years or so|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: a @h raise from east will no doubt propel west to game at these colours|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the milne team are all under 30, indeed a couple of them are under 20 with smirnov the "senior" on the team at age 28|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @S and @C/@D  [ASPRO]|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marcsmith: presumably 1@S shows four spades and a negative double would deny four|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or  transfer lebensohl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   i think Thompson is supposed to bid 3@C unless holding a really strong hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 2@H likely now from South|pg||

pc|h4|nt|marcsmith: now 3@D from north and another game try with 4@C by south seems sensibel|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Milne v Tishler is also close in the early goings   15-12|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D because  1st/2nd seat 1N is weak|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: slam in either major looks like an easy make -- not so easy to bid perhaps tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead might beat 6@S but 6@H is solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: the problem with 6@S is that you have to ruff a club. If North then ducks the first round of trumps, declarer may be tempted to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought EW played 15-17 NT throughout |pg||
nt|ahollan1: blast 3N?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did Bill Jacobs think the hand was too good  ...  or have they changed System since the 2009 Team Playoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N response with 11 HCP and 3 quick tricks suggests system change|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh I'm told they now play the Fantunes system  that exlains sooooo much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, 1@C was a one round force, usually 14+ HCP|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|marcsmith: North has to duck the first round of trumps, then I don't think declarer can make 12 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N is the system opening for Thompson|pg||
