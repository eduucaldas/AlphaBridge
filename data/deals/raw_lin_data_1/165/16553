nt|casenjo:  the majority of low level doubles at imps are takeout|pg||

nt|athene: when you have two aces and partner opened at the 1-level you expect to beat 5 of something :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: that lead may let it make |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: perhaps they play dbl as 4+ spades, a popular toy these days|pg||

nt|athene: heart lead was definitely a possibility|pg||
nt|casenjo:  with ace of trump, i like to lead my singleton|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|casenjo:  e-w easily makes 3D or 3H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

nt|casenjo:  as done at other table|pg||

nt|athene: (the point being, when the minor can be as short as 2, responder can't raise it even with 4-card support, so there is much more need for a general minor-oriented takeout bid)|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you might get away with 3nt if south plays it|pg||
nt|athene: if east just shows both majors|pg||
nt|roghog: or even 5@c by S|pg||
nt|athene: but south won't be rushing to declare the notrumps after east showed majors haha|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: usually these hands play better with the overcaller on lead - but not here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5C by South looks quite good on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: some would bid 3@s showing a singleton (on the way to 3 NT or 5 minor)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@h for e-w here - interesting that NS are the ones who have to sac, despite having 24 hcp between them|pg||
nt|casenjo:  well, now how does e-w find the heart fit?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: south can transfer to clubs - but what is his follow-up? 4@D splinter goes past 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S if a splinter, yes, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: ouch :)|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i don't like the 3 spade bid with a decent second suit|pg||
nt|athene: not the dummy Eva wanted to see|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  yes, and you never know what's happening at the other table, if e-w got too high, it might just be an imp or 2|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|athene: that might be a sensible agreement to have, yes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: but as many have pointed out, no good idea to make N declarer on this one|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even reasonable to expect partner to read it as such without agreement, after east showed majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: but you might equally well think it shows a stop in spades and concern about hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: just logic, yes|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure that diamond lead at trick 2 was such a good idea|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|athene: if north had the ace she was surely going to play it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|athene: and dummy has no entry so there is no chance of getting the club loser away|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and it just meant declarer lost a tempo and also lost the chance to lead a spade from dummy |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  club losers gets pitched on diamond and ruff out club loser setting up side suit for an easy grand to play|pg||

nt|casenjo:  a fun hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|casenjo:  with 21 HCP and partner opening, there should be some fireworks|pg||
nt|athene: if she can find out north has six spades and the @CK and @HA and @SQ - well, you don't need anything else much|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: start the cue's |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: in standard lebensohl, 2nt then cue shows a stopper and 4 in the other major|pg||

nt|casenjo:  or 6 clubs, same heart guess|pg||
mb|3D|nt|casenjo:  Michael, would you have shown the long spades or bid 3 hearts?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|roghog: works well here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I know they play ACOL, so I like the spade rebid|pg||
nt|casenjo:  my way of thinking, if in 6 clubs, with west void in clubs, they are probably long in hearts, and why didn't anyone bid spades?|pg||
nt|sybarra: lightner X operating|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: the problem with these auctions that bypass blackwood is, it can be hard to find out about the trump honours|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lightner type double, wants to ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hard to see any way you could miss 4@H, assuming a modicum of sanity|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes 5nt grand slam force gets bid somewhere along the line|pg||
nt|casenjo:  south might have correct to hearts, keeping west off lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|casenjo:  another reason to show extra long spades|pg||
nt|casenjo:  looking at the AK, you don't need too many honors|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps south has just decided that it is right and proper for her partner to hold the @SQ and she is going to assume that :)|pg||

nt|casenjo:  i play if dummy can win the next trick, my card is 100% suit preference|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i don't think it ought to be pick-a-slam at this point, after they agreed spades|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|casenjo:  that should really turn south on|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: opponents asking about bidding|pg||
nt|casenjo:  nicely bid, easy to play|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|casenjo:  6 spades was bid and made at the other table, so this will be a nice pick up for either side|pg||
nt|athene: if there is the slightest question-mark over trump solidity, a singleton trump won't be a good lead|pg||
nt|casenjo:  North is forced in one line of play, being short on dummy entries and should makethis|pg||
nt|athene: "always lead a trump against a grand slam" is one of the sillier mottos anyway, i think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: he can claim 11 now|pg||
nt|casenjo:  but if north goes down, EW has a bid pickup|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will surely spend a long time over this|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of hand that can take an age to think about|pg||
nt|athene: because you are just trying to maximise your %|pg||
nt|casenjo:  if North goes after a heart ruff, she will go down|pg||
nt|athene: it's not like a situation where there is only one chance and you play for it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|athene: she has to decide how many spades to cash before trying to ruff a club|pg||

nt|casenjo:  hello Nigel |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a line that involves drawing trumps right away has one definite advantage over a line that doesn't :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Hi All - Am I late as I was told it started 5 minutes ago|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Years ago Alan Truscott put in a hand I defended, where  i did NOT over-ruff the dummy and it was the only way to beat the contract (I was stubborn since it was my male partner at that time that had said "women liketo ruff" :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: EW decided on this strange 2nt contract in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: what is 2nt?|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose objectively they were right in that NS did have 5 top tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: Hi William|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  I think it is good enough to double then bid hearts|pg||
nt|casenjo:  i like double|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: neither east nor west really has very much defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfortunately, its at the 5 level when back to you |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|yorkbeach:  not sure whether leads are always 4rd and 5th or just in partner's suit|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes if spades 3-1 and @DJ in hand would make a big difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzxu: S 10 on A not 8|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of heart losers now and nowhere to put them|pg||
nt|casenjo:  only 25% of my high cards are in hearts, partner rates to be weak when south opens, so I would rather find her long suit |pg||
pc|d5|nt|roghog: not sure what their jump overcalls are, but N expected a tad more|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hT|nt|casenjo:  good technical play|pg||

pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  I just rate the overall playing strength as too much for a simple overcall|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  weak|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I will overcall with up to 18 HCP but excellent honour sequences and a void plus 16 HCP make this too good for 1@h|pg||
nt|casenjo:  agree, I can have as much as 17, but this is a powerful 16, too good to overcall and double|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  I should have the Alexes card somewhere|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Director asked tocheck 22 as well|pg||
nt|casenjo:  the problem with the finals, is that these players are very tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose in 3nt you just plod away at diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: although an attack in either black suit does give you a bit of concern|pg||
nt|athene: you might be losing 3 in the suit attacked along with @DAK|pg||
nt|roghog: Precision 1@c expected|pg||
nt|athene: there are a lot of different methods after 1@C - 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H might be natural forcing 1 round, natural non-forcing, or artificial 20+ hcp|pg||
nt|davidstern: They of course wont know it but 3NT is best spot here|pg||
nt|davidstern: Some play 1@H very strong|pg||
nt|davidstern: after 1@C:1@D|pg||
nt|roghog: I like to play 1@C-1@D-1@H as artificial, forcing. Solves lots of problems|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are some big balanced hands that they do not open 1@C but see no reason to suppress the hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: EW have lots of hcp between them but how good is 3nt going to be on the heart lead?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  they have played a lot of bridge and hard as you try, you keep replaying  them in your head after the session|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: this is a situation where, as east, you really want just a slightly better spot card in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog: may need some undo-ing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bidding does not look right - South's 2@D is a Multi where hearts is the long suit if the hand is weak|pg||
nt|athene: ok, are we assuming this was a multi auction? 2@D from west, 2@H from east, 3nt from west? seems a bit ugly|pg||
nt|jbgood: operator, perhaps you could just score the board and go on with the next one?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: even something like A9xx or A8xx can turn into a double stop if partner has a bit to offer|pg||
nt|athene: or the defenders crash some cards|pg||
nt|casenjo:  those spots can't get worse|pg||
nt|athene: but A432....that's not getting the job done|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with A432 you really want west to declare the notrumps |pg||
nt|casenjo:  so often, we see finals,even events like the Bermuda Bowl and Spingold with the best teams playing each other, but not at their best game|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: with e.g. @HQx or @HJxx|pg||
nt|casenjo:  with 26 highs, can e-w stay out of game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|casenjo:  not a friendly hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|athene: ok, good decision to avoid notrumps|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: still you have to lose two spades, heart, diamond i think|pg||
nt|athene: unless you can do something cute|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It looks like this contract has a loser in each suit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|casenjo:  yes, not a makeable game on this hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s4|nt|athene: not sure there is much point doubling 3@D - on these puppet auctions, south never gets to play it|pg||
nt|athene: it just helps north with the play|pg||

nt|athene: ok last board now|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Last boardthis segment|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Last board,restart at 13:45 EDST|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: approx. 30 minutes time|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|othered1: unfavorable vul sac in CR is a winning position, since NS are on for 5@H, |pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|athene: north decides if opps are going to open 1@D and bury *his* 6-card suit... he will return the favour|pg||
nt|othered1: so far the same.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: this will likrly end in 3nt, but I would not like to have to play it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roghog: rolling towards 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: guess at trick 1 in hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: It odes look like getting out for 200 is very good|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha4: Return for seg 2 inabout 25 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 11:15 ESDT for next 16 boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|jbgood: not so strange - but lie very unfriendly|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: west can see all the suits are lying poorly for declarer|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: he has the blacks over dummy; his partner has the diamonds over declarer (he hopes) :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: not completely safe as south could have a very strong hand but still a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps a case for the spade jack?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the jack is possible as it will clear up the suit for west|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess on this bidding north really can't have a spade fit so a small spade is unlikely to be misread|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|othered1: now a difficult @C shift to beat it 2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so 48 boards produce a gap of 2 imps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't want to use up the @SA for the small extra chances given by leading a club from hand|pg||
nt|athene: also if north has @CQx and ducks a club off dummy, as she surely will, you score a huge goal|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: doesnt matter now, but if S had some other spade holding|pg||
nt|roghog: unpleasant one to play. may try a @D to the 10 at some stage|pg||
nt|athene: he will surely play on clubs|pg||
