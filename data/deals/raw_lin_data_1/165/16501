nt|othered1: if it was a standard redouble, 2@D is forcing.|pg||

nt|vugraphzvs: north didn't ask what it was|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: north and east are screenmates|pg||
nt|othered1: and given that west has a sound opening bid, surely it's expected to be forcing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: in standard play, you're right.  But the fact that east alerted the redouble means that there's a difference of opinion here and maybe redouble has some connotations we're in the ...|pg||
