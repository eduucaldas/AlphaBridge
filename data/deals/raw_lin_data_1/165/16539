nt|Walddk2: After rd 9, not updated after 10|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: west will open and thereafter players styles will influence events|pg||
nt|jtr: Disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|delberto:  note South's disciplined pass|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H might slip through on the wrong lead   |pg||
nt|jtr: I am not keen on 5-card suit overcalls but would here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: but very likely with AK@D   not to go wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the minors come into their own|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|ady: that a poor sedicion after east passed 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: west trying to teach them a sharp lesson - ie bidding game when a partscore was likely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: sedicion is a poor decision:)|pg||
nt|delberto:  I was wondering what a sedicion was :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|jtr: I dont really see the point of 3@h though|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|delberto:  well...she might have interpreted 3H as a mild try|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: mind you if east had Q@H in addition  would likely have passed 2@S   and then competed|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: Must be some sort of try|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: Exactly  That is what she should have|pg||
nt|delberto:  coz East might bid 3S with no game aspiration|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello David and Paul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and John|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill:  at our club that hand would have ended yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  our club is on the international date line|pg||
nt|viren169: Nice easy p/s to start the proceedings off |pg||
mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|drorp: some cuebidding here, eventually stopping at 4 or 5 spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: A K @H is missing..|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@d is not a Jacoby 2NT response, would this 2NT be something else?|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like some form of bergen|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@D shows extras and the diamond suit, if i understand it correctly|pg||
nt|djneill:  thanks Dror|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@S is asking for shortness|pg||
nt|viren169: off to the races... and minus score!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzxj: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: N need AK @D and K@h as well as K 1s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: might go on now|pg||
nt|drorp: i think his hand is a 5@C bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Does anyone have an agreement that 2@C is natural on this auction?|pg||
nt|toobad: v ambitious|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S was enough by west|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|vugraphzxj: and he did|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@D should be around 15 points generally|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h lead is pretty well marked, given all this minor jazz|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: S showing Q @S beacuse if the 6th card|pg||
nt|drorp: well, he assumes that his p has a heart cue because it seems like it in the point count, not it will be on zeligman to find the lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|famus: whts 5@s?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|drorp: 2+q, as he knows they have a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When South shows 2+@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Not i|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzxj: need @H lead here not easy at all|pg||
nt|djneill:  let's end this hand like at my club, Ace lead always|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I bet no @H lead|pg||
nt|famus: probably the 6th @s |pg||
nt|drorp: i think a heart lead is marked on the hand... when you have 4 small diamonds...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|drorp: if you don't take them now, you never will|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: well done|pg||
nt|drorp: it will be ptiched on diamonds, not hard to see with 4 diamonds in hand|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't in this auction, though there are some positions where it should be natural|pg||
nt|jtr: Usual confusion using mud in partner's suit|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi Robin|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: but when it is the only cue bid, you more or less have to use it as a cue bid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulhac:  And what would 3@C be?|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp: he chose not to, i'm not sure why, maybe because that way it would be much harder to find the grand slam if it fits|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can cue-bid @dQ I believe, if South indeed showed @d|pg||
nt|famus: ya-and end at 5@s|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|famus: with no @h noise|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all gone very quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: more incorrect preditions to come!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|drorp: and you must remember, his p showed supposedly 15+ pts, so by counting points it was almost not possible that he doesn't have atleast @HK|pg||
nt|viren169: ...c...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: another p/s here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Did you predict that before or after the final pass :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: Note: It was done after the event!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Might play low from dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... my fingers are not as fast as yours!|pg||
nt|toobad: should|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulhac:  Did well to stop in 2@S at the other vuegraph table|pg||
pc|sK|nt|drorp: i can understand Zack's view, don't agree with it though, especially if you can bid 3@D with 13 counts because of shape and a 6th spade|pg||
nt|famus: so let him bid the slam|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - West gave East quite a lot of rope for that 2@c overcall (majors)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|dburn: which was just as well, since East had quite a lot of old rope|pg||

nt|viren169: I think I would have tried a @C there|pg||

nt|rmb1: "Might" and "should" are not predictions|pg||
nt|viren169: what about 'would' and 'should'|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|famus: cud cost them the match|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 6@C MAY WELL BE BID HERE IN RAGE|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   for e/w    can they get there?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|roswolf: yes - |pg||
nt|delberto:  looks like 6C should be bid I think|pg||
nt|delberto:  a good start to the auciton with 3C being forcign to game|pg||
nt|ady: needs to cu hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jtr: Done|pg||
nt|ady: now they must get to 6 |pg||
nt|delberto:  yes ..4h next and East might think of a grandy|pg||
nt|roswolf: they may get to the grand if they get too excited although missing 1 keycard they shouldnt|pg||
nt|ady: rkc will reveal only 2 controls  so east should know tostop in 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the auction in the other room was quite pedestrian|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S     shows 2controls and queen of agreedsuit|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
nt|delberto:  this has been a good auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok sensible auction|pg||
nt|jtr: Missed at the other table|pg||
nt|ady: stoppedin 5 in cr so a swing back for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: and in bridge that is usually winning bridge|pg||
nt|jtr: West having rebid 2@s hsould bid 4@h over 3@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point david|pg||
nt|delberto:  a 2S rebid is very sensible|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jtr: Well, with 2/1 i think you can afford to show your shape|pg||
pc|dA|nt|delberto:  but as you say...the auction went wrong after that|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c for us is 5+-5 no strength defined|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C rebid dubious   but if playing 2 over 1  it is common now to bid that way on that shape without promising extras|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|jtr: Touche|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: another part score here|pg||
nt|rmb1: The club finesse was still worth an overtrick but declarer was not going to play it|pg||

nt|rmb1: 6@C ?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@H anyone?|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Nicole is wearing a fetching all-black ensemble|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|rmb1: That will scare North into "soundness"|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|dburn: weak no trump here, unlike the other table - and here North-South may start doubling|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jtr: They started|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dburn: or at least South might|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play a pass by North as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: looks like a NT partial|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess a doulbe would be take out|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe North's double of 2@d would be takeout and her pass is forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Presumably double by North would be take-out|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rmb1: 2@D GF (?)|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W may well reach 6@C on a free run|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: seems like flat boards, makes it much harder for herbst team to get back in to the match|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|drorp: the herbests on the other room, knowing their aggressivness, might end up in 3NT here, so it could be a swing|pg||
nt|famus: they need a swing--cos they have another bad board coming up at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: the other room let 3nt makes..but they stay out slam so its 28 now|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@D?|pg||
nt|toobad: i was expecting 4d then 4h |pg||
nt|viren169: and on hearing 4@H... off to the races we go.|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: Disappointing|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pc|c9|nt|rmb1: 1NT= was good for EW on  23, the open room went -5 in the same contract (apparently)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|viren169: wow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: wanted an honor to drop|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  North is considering the @hQ dump to get South in - if West had the @hJ, West would have not played @h this way|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Defence lead spades and switched to clubs, then declare took @SA to take @D finesse and roof fell in|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|dburn: and so is this defence|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|drorp: covering the @C wasn't good, now he has an entry to cash the heart and develop the 2nd spade trick|pg||
nt|drorp: without covering the @c 1NT might've been down after the excellent @C switch|pg||
nt|djneill:  right|pg||
nt|viren169: Maybe there was no roof there in the first place.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: trump back after taking the K of @C was best.|pg||
nt|rmb1: No harm in cashing 4 @H before playing @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  so West should not have covered on the board maybe|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|nt|drorp: declearer always had an entry for the 4th heart, but he was now enabled to make the 2nd spade trick aswell|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: 6@S ?  not enough entries to play @D twice and @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|drorp: yes declearer made a mistake by playing Q@C from hand, would be better to play low and win with the ace, to make sure he has an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|drorp: sorry, from dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Cook did remarkably well not to bid over 2NT - no doubt she was waiting for three of a minor to come round before bidding hearts|pg||

nt|rmb1: North looks close to balanced 12 count - sure many would open at favourable|pg||
pc|s4|nt|drorp: after a spade lead and duck, a diamond switch is necessary|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, 2@c ought to be natural - 2@h is a cue bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzzk: she thought about the alert for a bit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As long as West discards on the first trick|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, but that creates 5 potential losers|pg||

nt|drorp: last chance to pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: lol|pg||
nt|famus: hmmm...danger zone|pg||
nt|drorp: he will either pass or bid 4@H|pg||
nt|drorp: or maybe 3@S? :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  Zeligman likes 3@s|pg||
nt|famus: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I bet he pass|pg||
nt|drorp: he kinds gave away his hand with the 3@C bid, the question to me is, is 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: good question|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@h cannot be forcing unless 3@c is forcing, no?|pg||
nt|famus: is it?? dont think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: but he knows there is missfit and partner is about 10-13 hcp|pg||
nt|drorp: it's matter of agreement... i think 3@C defentley shows extras and is 90% forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I think its nf|pg||
nt|djneill:  and is 3@c forcing if 2@h is nonforcing, was 1@s forcing?|pg||
nt|drorp: 1@S and 2@H are defenitley NF :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@d is forcing in my book, on someone |pg||
nt|drorp: Barel will take his time here... i think he'll bid 4@H, that's my feel|pg||
nt|djneill:  what's the worst that could happen|pg||
nt|famus: this is goin the 4@h route-- i think--too much thinking is obviously the forc--non forc thoughts|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: deep thinking|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@H might go undoubeled|pg||
nt|drorp: and it does have 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be a good time for an aggressive Zelig double|pg||
nt|drorp: spade 5 hearts and 2 clubs, and a some possibilities to make a 9th trick through a diamond ruff or some club developing|pg||
nt|famus: he has 9 alright|pg||
nt|djneill:  @hJ itself is a great filler card, problem is of coruse it will be used to ruff, but not so bad if partner AKxxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: he can duck the @C then finesse..but still 4@h will go down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: somnething odd here|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of breaking xfers over 2N|pg||
nt|rmb1: Capel+Feldman recover from 1NT-5 by bidding 6@C= on  24|pg||
nt|rmb1: Always breaking to 4M wastes alot of space but ensures the "declarership"|pg||

nt|famus: small from dummy|pg||

nt|drorp: at the other table north passed 3@C, good decision and 3@C made a bit more easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: 3@C is good result for birman team|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: and there is some more on the next boards|pg||
nt|viren169: and convert 3N to 4M or cue... depending on style|pg||
