mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: its just ana agreement I have with some partners. with nat nonforcing I simply lead a club vs 1nt and with a good hand I double and lead a club|pg||

nt|tomi2: they will end up in 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C  1@D  ;   1NT   18-20  ?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the other room made 3NT without @S stopper|pg||

nt|juror1: Buongiorno Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello Slawek :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp2: sorry for problems, Kalita played 7 of spade the result is -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, lead a card and claim|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SA was led which blocked the suit, small @S would be -1|pg||
nt|nagini: :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|nagini: 2 dias was misterious|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sfoxa:  danger!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't agree with pass by West - the DBL means only points, for sure not long @h|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C would be forced|pg||
nt|nagini: he will manage:)|pg||
nt|vbman: so 1 nt is weak?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Nige Kearney|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nigel|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this contract is much safer|pg||
nt|vbman: or 15-17?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12-14 balanced hands are opened 1@C|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like this 3@S bid with this flat hand and a known 8 card fit only|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|serhat: hi All|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  N knows partner has maximum hand with @h|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: west will need to decide what ace partner has|pg||
nt|vbman: and the rebid after 1 red suit is?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: passed hoping in 2 @s tricks - difficult to think North void in @S !|pg||
nt|tomi2: with 12-14 they start a "rescue" sequence and try to find a ceah major fit before 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: only nuclear weapon against this transfers:)|pg||
nt|tez: hi Danny welcome:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|jcmax: Good morning everyone!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|serhat: hi Sabina|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: But you bid a major over 1@D (0-7) if you have 12-14. Can be 3 cards|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nagini: on this level they rarely bid without a reason|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D is not natural. it may include "any 0-6 hand"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  next time it does no harm, but now E has the lead as described in a bridge book|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vbman: oh so thats the famous polish club|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nagini: mostly playing against them askin for drink:)|pg||
nt|nagini: friends will be friends|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|tomi2: neither 1@C nor 1@D must be alerted in poland|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like a strip hand...but since clubs behave, no problems whatsoever|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s was not enough|pg||
nt|3for3: if the jack didnt fall, declarer would be able to trump 4th club, and perhaps throw in the opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: nie ma sensu raczej|pg||
nt|serhat: -3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In theory, this is a good save (only 500) but it matters little when their team-mates were pushed to 5@H at the other table|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nigel_k:  This one looks like it was lucky to escape undoubled|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with seven @C the pass at 3@H is dangerous - in this sequence 4@C can be a strong hand, but only long suit - and with K@S sgl can pass at 4@S ...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s7|nt|jcmax: Still a couple of imps :)|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Yes indeed, Kursat, very appropriate when we are in Poland :)|pg||

nt|tomi2: E/W are members of the Polish seniors team, having won lots of medals in the last years|pg||

nt|tomi2: Lasocki used to be a top player in the 80's and 90's playing with Gawrys|pg||
nt|3for3: solid suits abound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the last round of the championships, 2 segments of 12 boards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will anyone open here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: at all level it is possible dont guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: ah yesss|pg||
nt|3for3: another 4@S EW|pg||
nt|jcmax: 4th hand has a 12 count, but only a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|serhat: may be S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very close at the top. 252, 250, 250. Unia one of the teams on 250|pg||
nt|jcmax: That might dissuade some players from opening|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tomi2: North is a sponsor from Lithuania who plays in Poland very often|pg||
nt|tez: i thk it will be end 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|tomi2: 3@D is probably invitational. North has support a single but minimum and no aces. this time 3@D is the best spot for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they use DBL for @h and 1@h for @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: so there is no mistake in saying that poland is one of the top nations of bridge|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nagini: happy Appy:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: well done finding the 5-3 fit in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|tomi2: here you see the reason why support doubles were invented originally. I read somewhere that Rodwell was also fan of bidding 3 card suits if there is no other good bid available and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: he did not like to play in 3-3 fits when partner raised him with 3 cards in competive situations|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt now may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|juror1: welcome Tezcan Sen of Turkey|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt.np|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  Opposite a weak NT game is unlikely and Qxx in opponents suit is bad|pg||
nt|vbman: can bridge teaching supply a living in europe?|pg||
nt|tomi2: remember, this is the Polish Premiere LEague, so it starts with a round robin event, but they will play KO matches afterwards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland keep recruiting new players through hard work by a lot of people. The Polish junior players are extremely good, and they have lots of them|pg||
nt|3for3: diamond lead breaks the late entry to dummy.  declarer will fail..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tomi2: yes, especialy in Germany, we have lots of wealthy old people playing Bridge in their local clubs, who want to be better then their friends|pg||
nt|3for3: not too late to shift to the diamond, and give him a problem|pg||
nt|3for3: not obvious to lead into AKQJxx of a suit though|pg||
nt|tez: i would bid 4@s to 3@d|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps they play 3@S as forcing|pg||
nt|tez: ''2@d''|pg||
nt|3for3: north can infer diamonds are as you see them...partner might have led a stiff if he had one|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's our point of view|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

pc|sA|nt|vbman: carry over?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|tomi2: the guys were always happy to play events in Turkey, like Istanbul 2004 or other open events!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tomi2: there will be carry over but not significant, most important is, that the top 4 teams need to win 1 match only to get to semifinals|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if they lose they get a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|vbman: and u bet they do very well, burrying opponents|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5-8 teams first need to win among this group and then against one of the 1-4 losers|pg||
nt|vbman: seems fair enough|pg||
nt|tomi2: but any of the first 8 teams may become Polish champion while the teams ranked 9-16 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
pc|sK|nt|3for3: too late for diamond shift...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tomi2: with the 9-12 teams having similar advantage while the 13-16 teams will have to work hard, if they don't want to play in 2nd devision next year|pg||
nt|vbman: blew some tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: the "Katok" team basicly consists of players from Belarus and Lithuania, but they were welcome to join the polish league system and made their way throught the lower leagues and ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: are constant members of 1st devision|pg||
nt|vbman: they have polish nationality?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: east tried not to joker around in teams, thats good. a small heart would have cut declarer from the club tricks, but he took the safer way for -1|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|tomi2: its always difficult for "outsiders" to identify the teams, because neraly all of them have companies as sponsor, so their teams are called so|pg||

nt|vbman: he wont bid any less than 4h|pg||
nt|tomi2: but we won't see them live this weekend since the matches are played in 2 diffrent cities, and we have the North-East teams here|pg||
nt|jcmax: As it did this particular South :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Some players believe in the rule hcp + number of spades >= 15, otherwise don't open in last seat.|pg||
nt|serhat: true but I think S had a good hand|pg||
nt|nagini: flat one|pg||
mb|2C|an|precision|nt|tomi2: teams from south and west, lke Wroclaw, play among themselfes in another city|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish 1@C by North now I assume. 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nagini: winner are always winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: riski 3 cl|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but right time for it|pg||
nt|tomi2: what I find interesting is that both NS pairs, using the same methods, chose different bids on every of the first 4 hands|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 1 N tried to support partner with 3@S, in board 2 south started with a double and ot 1NT|pg||
nt|nagini: hard to stop before 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: most of the teams we see this weekend are from Warsaw|pg||
nt|vbman: so how long does it last and how many times is it held in a year?|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he had opened there would have been a danger of the pair getting to 3@H which would have been one level too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 5@c is not so bad|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: true Dany :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: you start with 2 weekends rond robin, this is the 2nd one, and then several KO matches. The finals will be held in may|pg||
nt|vbman: no 3h will be the limit|pg||
nt|tomi2: the winner will represent Poland in the next European Champions Cup|pg||
nt|tez: flat 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|tomi2: in 3 N went directly to the major game not trying for 3NT and in 2 they tried to invite balanced instead of going towards a @D contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am in doubt now as the 1@H response is not Polish|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzywka praktyczna|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well bid|pg||
nt|tez: double dummy play..|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for bridge players it is important to have good gadgets after 1ANY pass pass|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: 2@H after dbl 17+|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3NT very much looks like fast arrival to me, meaning partner I have a really bad hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-6(7)  and 1@H therefore 8+, but maybe only 7+ for them|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nigel_k:  3NT needs partner to have something in hearts, but making 11 tricks in diamonds needs a lot more|pg||
nt|nagini: want to play hearts? not a good idea:)|pg||
nt|vbman: oh my|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@S by Vainikonis tends to promise 5 spades in Poland|pg||
nt|tomi2: they like to make "heavy" 1@S bids on 4 spades and some points|pg||
nt|serhat: exciting on a dia lead!|pg||
nt|jcmax: W definitely found the best elad!|pg||
nt|serhat: so 4s was better|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2: wow thats some double swing|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3@C hit the jackpot here|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not penalty for sure|pg||
nt|vbman: so north hand is close to 1sp or a q|pg||
nt|tomi2: east should pass as long as he is not doubled and later think of correcting to 5@D|pg||
nt|3for3: declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|3for3: defense can build 2@H's and take 3 aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: And also note how important it is he chose a low @D and not the 10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: i would bid 3@c with west hand..you?|pg||
nt|tomi2: while this 2@S bid may be standard in USA or France, this is a 1@S bid in Polish methods|pg||
nt|tomi2: this will be no fun for west|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: underleading @SQ to make partner play a clubwould be the best defense here but its hard to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right. Another issue is, what dio we lead from J108x  J107x  J10xx. I think the concensus is Jack from the first one, low from the other holdings. Any views, Sabine?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: duking the D risk Q@D @d ruff losing after the K@D|pg||
nt|vbman: taking the low road resulted well|pg||
nt|vbman: if they played in nt it wd be a 15 point difference|pg||
nt|vbman: operator what are ns talking now?|pg||
nt|tez: if pikus discard @d..down 3|pg||
nt|jcmax: It really depends. If you have reasons to assume there is at most a doubleton in dummy then a low one clearly would be best even from the first holding.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say declarer has Qx in dummy and A9xx in his hand. he will almost certainly put up the Q.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|nagini: felt it|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: my asistant says ''we say "side suit first" :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: most of the breaks will be because most Polish players smoke - so they need a short time in such 12 board matches|pg||
nt|serhat: nice 7h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: even if he went down it would gain lots of imps since NS made 4@S over there|pg||
nt|pfbr: "assistant" :)|pg||
nt|nagini: personally I would choose  pepsi a pd|pg||
nt|vbman: smoking kills|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand is easy in polish club, you open 1@C and start counting your points. For EW here 1@C is a limited opening, so Jagniewski had to guess or count his points first before ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: opening|pg||
mb|1D|nt|tez: in vuln normal 3@h opening|pg||
nt|nagini: one condition only: as my sponsor:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: light openung|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the best movement for the players was "4-board BAM swiss" so they had to wait for the other results and couls smore every 4 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: players was talking about previous board|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think with wests hand you should not force your partnership to the 5th level if you start the match leading in the 25 VP margin|pg||
nt|nagini: eee|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nagini: pepsi has a feeling in fingers:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad controls isnt worth 12|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, but I by today's standards, it's pretty sound -- a couple of 10's, and a couple of honor tricks make up for the acelessness.|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, if you can get them to take a phantom save, vul, it does have its merits.|pg||
nt|tomi2: you already need a good dummy to cause s relative flat score compared to passing 4@H with those two major aces|pg||
nt|jcmax: Shall we predict they will bid 7N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good correction to 5@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if partner cannot open 2@S, probably the suit is insufficient|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bridge_one: 2@D of course is multi - long @h or @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: if 4@H was making you need to escape for -3 maximum to have a relatively flat board|pg||
nt|tomi2: while you need a huge dummy to turn a bad baord into a good one - but this will not bring you more VP tan you already have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is an artificial game-force|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: but it riscs going down more or going down while 4@H was not making - in those scenarios you lose imps. so IMO bidding can win very seldom but lose very often|pg||
mb|4H|nt|tomi2: the players don't know the running score but they know the score after 12 boards|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think so..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Effective double by north.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be worried about @C now|pg||
nt|othered1: He can hold this to -1 with the right view on the minor suit positions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes but might take a wrong view on the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Rdbl is to give the A in @D - cab be usefull for the lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0549.JPG North|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry wrong link, this was south|pg||
nt|jcmax: Especially in an undisturbed relay auction. That's what it looks like anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: a race for snowman?:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0550.JPG this is north|pg||
nt|jcmax: When the opponents play relays I strongly feel with a hand like N's one should get involved in the bidding especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kwiecien asking, Jagniewski telling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would get in with 2@D?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: and they already had one board where they might expect to win imps and one where they might lose, wo it was not unlikely that the result was still 25-x at that point|pg||
nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0569.JPG east|pg||
nt|3for3: df wanted declarer to run the 9 of @C through south.  It plays well :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: They certainly know their system, so the best chance you have is make some noise.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even 3 maybe?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0542.JPG west|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcmax: I'd prefer 3@D personally|pg||
pc|hA|nt|3for3: north needed to stay off hearts until south lead them.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, because 2@D will not hurt their relays|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: Agree.  I wonder if the lead will give him an idea of the shape of the hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And then it makes no sense|pg||
nt|serhat: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D doesn't really disturb that much and the relays may still be on. But after 3@D it will be back to natural and good judgment.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|egezzer: Hi everyone |pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|tez: smith echo was need here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pfbr: Morning, Roland@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NS must take their 5 tricks now|pg||
nt|nagini: @h|pg||
nt|3for3: they needed better signalling between the first heart and the club played, as to whether the ten was falling |pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Kwiecien can claim before the lead :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2: I guess this was a puppet stayman sequence, 3@C asked for majors, 3@D= at least one 4 card major, 3@H=spades 3@S=fit 3NT is forcing then showing interest in slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have sen that before|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|vbman: so does anyone think the current score must be told to the players?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: not ruffing high is a pretty extreme position here|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@C,4@D cuebids 4NT RKCB 5C=0 5@D=@SQ?. 5@S probably =yes I have|pg||
nt|tomi2: 5nt now should ask for kings, but I am not 100% sure about their methods|pg||
nt|tez: where is T of @h..its important for defence|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will be tough to get right ruff high and double finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0541.JPG this is Vainikonis|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: at least they spend a lot of time in the BBO practise rooms, so they know their system :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: wil he play now for some miracle-squeeze?|pg||
nt|po-s: 6c most likely asking for CQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe 5@S already showed one king and with none he would bid 6@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: sorry no finesse needed|pg||
nt|Gerben42: another big swing to Unia|pg||
nt|othered1: Compared to the auction in the othe room, the one here looks perfectly normal.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or was the ugly 1N opening very specialized?|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: a weak one I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: -2?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white on red|pg||
nt|egezzer: hi Jakub|pg||
nt|egezzer: Nice to see here that Konrad Araszkiewicz and Dariusz Kowalski. Impossible to watch for me them until in 12th World Championship Verone 2006(Open Pairs) and played very well ...|pg||
nt|egezzer: actually|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  would he like to have bit of rest now? :-)|pg||
nt|tomi2: @SKQJ and 5 hearts with west|pg||
nt|tomi2: with semi-friendly clubs and the marked @D finesse 6NT should make. @C10 is dropping, so the 9 will be a trick|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|po-s: I think with side king + SQ he wouldm bid his king, but having shown DK already he only bid 5S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: 4@D could have been a singleton|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0506.JPG here you can see Olanski as well|pg||

pc|c8|nt|tomi2: http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0501.JPG and the older guys are EM|pg||
nt|tez: wd Danny:)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|po-s: I meant having cued diamonds already...|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't know their agreements on 3NT, it could promise a flat hand, then 4@D would be the king for sure|pg||
nt|po-s: problem with trumps 4-1 as he has both a club and a heart loser|pg||
nt|po-s: but lucky this time|pg||
nt|tomi2: Jagniewski avoided problems in trumps by bidding 6Nt|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I think he forgot to cash @CA|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps finesse is better nas there is a possible squeeze left|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|3for3: Hi Sabine!|pg||
nt|tez: imposible dbl ofcourse:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: expected him to open 1@C on this|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: and again the same start ended up in two different contracts, NS were in 5@C in the CR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H xfer (with @H he would dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|tomi2: and even more important ;) http://www.polbridge.pl/images/stories/galerie/wyniki/2011/110107_liga/1/IMG_0546.JPG this is our vugrapg operator Monika|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: Welcome Sabine:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: doing good work indeed, tx to her|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT response to a takeout double is constructive, around 6-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: east can cuebid 5@H now I think or should this show one ace more?|pg||
mb|r|nt|trotto: w @sJ moglbys gdyby to dziad mial miec piki lub @s stopera|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision by N - passed partner - no hope for game|pg||
nt|nagini: juniors lying?:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S competitive - with interesting hand DBL|pg||
nt|tomi2: 6@H i mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: Hej Anita @H|pg||
nt|3for3: the danger of bidding 2@S is you are setting up partner to save in 4@S, when your hand has lots of defensive potential|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! i am wondering why N bid 2@D here instead of a straightforward 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whereas a suit response can be 0|pg||
nt|jcmax: 3N definitely looks like the contract he wants to play.|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@D apparently in their methods is forcing, but where does it lead?|pg||
nt|serhat: He might be thinking leading a H!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Can slam really be on? and if the answer to that is no, then a bid like 2@D on another day may give away too much information to the opponents.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|trotto: sry , wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@d give the return @h (otherwise 2@D)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|vbman: must be careful after cl opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To our less experienced viewers. So do not respond 1NT on   Kxx  xxx  xxxx  xxx   2@D is the call, 0-8 with at least 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|3for3: i dont think declarer would have even made 4@H here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: Notus on the board now with a swing|pg||
nt|jcmax: The one thing worrying me with the E hand would be that partner didn't take action over 1@H very well knowing that he is short in @H.|pg||
nt|serhat: can Kwieccien claim 10 for this too pls?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: Russian coul have ducked the heart to cut the communication here|pg||
nt|vbman: yessss|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping N will finesse again, then Vainikonis would have to do something in @D to get an entry for the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vbman: he can still go wrong easily|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if he had to cross in @D he could have finessed first, then west could win the queen, cross to partners @DA and get a ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: two major kings some quacks and dia ace wont be with west but its easy when wee see all hands|pg||
nt|vbman: quack=queen or jack|pg||
nt|tomi2: in the CR they found the great opening lead under @D aces but did not manage their ruff|pg||
nt|vbman: smoke break?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|d8|pg||
mc|11|nt|vbman: ah there u go|pg||
nt|3for3: the club ruff will set up 2 trump tricks for the opps, so -800|pg||
nt|3for3: sorry the heart ruff|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H |pg||
nt|Gerben42: in theory you can also play in @C but less obv.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with @HK 4th its hard to play this one though but you want to be in it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: assume a @S lead you play directly @H to 10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here np with AQJ@C in the dummy, but in other situation it is important|pg||
nt|serhat: but after his discards he could still claim 10!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is easier to play than to bid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|3for3: excellent 6@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D MULTI (6 cards in one major)|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt look like it will be too difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And these guys know the percentage play in spades, cashing the ace first|pg||
nt|serhat: I guess they will bid 4h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|nagini: NS play Mozart im mjrs:)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@s @s and minor weak hand i think|pg||
nt|nagini: minimulti 6 + mjr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends how many hearts Kalida bids next, 2 or 3|pg||
nt|serhat: 4h now?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which would be wrong at matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
nt|jcmax: Transfer bids over 1@C openings are becoming increasingly popular.|pg||
nt|tez: 1@h MEANS Ý HAVE 1s2S|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: N's 2@S response doesn't promise anything extra, it just confirms the possession of 4 cards in @S|pg||
nt|tez: @s's i mean|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D =shortness..|pg||
nt|jcmax: Against 4@H EW can get a @D ruff, but only at the expense of a natural trump trick. Declarer however may misguess trumps and then 4@H could go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
nt|nagini: classic polish bluff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
nt|jcmax: without key card Blackwood, one might get to a grand slam here :)|pg||
nt|serhat: I think Kalida is taking easy as not Vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's say E had bid a preeemptive 3@D instead of 2@D (if available), then declarer may very well decide to play a @H to the K.|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to bid 4h now|pg||
nt|serhat: cant let 3nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Russyan did enough by doubling and bidding 2NT. I would have passed 3@H I must confess|pg||
nt|serhat: to be honest I am surprised he didnt bid 4h over 2nt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
nt|vbman: push board|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
nt|tomi2: am quite suprised that Russian did not bid 2@D after 1@S - that is a GF relay promising at least 3 card support in @S and enough for game|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: At IMPs you will play as safely as possible to make your contract, hence @SA is correct play|pg||
nt|tez: he didnt show void|pg||
nt|Walddk2: at matchpoints, however, you must try to make as many tricks as possible, so finessing the queen is the right play|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, surprising, since partner's ace of @D could have been the K@S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
nt|tomi2: skipping the 2@D relay often indicates a) not such good 3 card support and/or b) a better heart suit|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rest assured that Jagniewski will cash @SA at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is a very poor contract|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: at first trick W small dimond and E 8 od dimond|pg||
nt|tez: i thk he won from dummy and played @d to ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't think N's action is clear at all here. give partner Jxxx, Q, Axxxx, KJx and he definitely should pass 3N!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: Peplonski insisted on @H then RKC, 3, thanks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcmax: So roland at matchpoints, if the Q loses to the K, what is the correct play in the 2nd round of the suit?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: Notus comeback|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been misunderstanding in closed room |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he had that hand, Sabine, he might have raised 3@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: And certainly that hand would be more consistent with his bidding than his actual one!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After all his partner bid them three times|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: ty at kibitz for the informations|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Finesse again|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, you do stop @D twice and 9 tricks are easier than 10. 4H would go down on @D6-1|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|nagini: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|serhat: If he was happy to play 3h I understand but after 3nt if he doesnt want to play 4h I dont understand his reason!|pg||
