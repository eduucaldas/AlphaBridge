nt|iceking: it starts every 100-200 year or so so should start again 2110-2210 |pg||
nt|iceking: nothing we need to worry about |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvs: whibley has been living in australia for about 18 months and milne just moved here a few weeks ago to study in australia|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is the only game with a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Lockwood stole the heart suit|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure that passing first time is going to make Milne's life any easier|pg||
nt|athene: now when (if) he bids 2@D he sounds like a man just balancing|pg||
nt|iceking: w hand rather strong i think i would have overcalled 2@D here|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he should bid 2@S her|pg||
nt|athene: here|pg||
nt|iceking: might need to make stronger move then 2@D here|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be michaels, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: good hand with hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|iceking: S should also raise 1@S to 2@S here dont see any reason passing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The unsual 1@H opening let E-W off the hook I think|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i would be totally happy inventing this at the table, but what else can it be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: tricky first hand of the day for milne|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: i suppose one problem is that if EW play ghestem, where a cue of a major is top and bottom, then 2@S might be taken as specifically hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they had been left to their own devices they would likely get to game and go down|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D hope pd understands it as good hand with @H and @D |pg||
nt|athene: yes, 3@D is not at all a bad shot|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose logically this has to be red suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: N/S though are cold for 4@S it seems |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but then whenever you invent some esoteric bid and think "this must mean X", partner takes it as Y, Z or W|pg||
nt|athene: partners refuse to show any creativity except when you really don't want them to :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, Whibley might or might not have worked out what 3@D meant, but he was passing anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: S problem here was his pass on 1@S not well though out bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: becouse if pd raises 2@S to game what does he have? 5-6@S unbal hand his hand fits that well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, pass shows three spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i think south actually has enough to bid 2@S and not be too worried|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: i assume pass denies 3 hearts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: butler here Bessi imps across the field |pg||
nt|iceking: trap passing at 1 level with 4@S is just nono in bridge i think|pg||
nt|iceking: and at this vul its a crime |pg||
nt|bessi2: i must agree|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|athene: well, maybe west should not double with only a singleton|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with the double imo|pg||
nt|athene: it's important to discuss these things - does west's double invite partner to pass with the most spades he can reasonably have (i.e. four decent ones)?|pg||
nt|iceking: sure he could have made the value bid of 3@D still should not be punished like this |pg||
nt|athene: if so, you shouldn't double with a singleton at the 1 level|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: 3@d value bid you say... a little underbid that is|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: It will make most of the time|pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you are going to gain a bit or lose a lot when you go for that sort of penalty|pg||
nt|athene: the best you are hoping for is +100 against +100 in 3nt-1|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|Walddk2: South will either lead a spade or a club and both are bad leads for the defence|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed 3nt will role home at most table probably|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: bidding should end here|pg||
nt|athene: it's interesting what west's double of 3@C would mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: is it responsive i.e. a double of hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: or just showing a club card|pg||
nt|athene: clearly it would be nice for west to double hearts for takeout, showing his hand pretty much perfectly|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt many play dbl here anything else then something in @C|pg||
nt|athene: quite a few good pairs these days play that double of artificial raise counts as a double of the suit shown|pg||
nt|athene: similar to e.g. 1nt pass 2@D X = t/o of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you don't have to play this way but there are some advantages in certain situations|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that north opened 1@H rather than 2, also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Leigh Gold|pg||
nt|iceking: 1-2-3 all options|pg||
nt|lethal666: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: i think 2@h shows both M for NS|pg||
nt|bessi2: i seriously dislike 3 though|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 though only for some maniacs|pg||
nt|athene: in england at one time there was a trend for very weak weak-twos in some situations and people ended up having to open light one-bids with 9 and 10 counts|pg||
nt|athene: which sort of takes away much of the purpose of weak-twos|pg||
nt|bessi2: south must be worried about pd not having opening values otherwise he would have bid 4@h long ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A weak 2 at red should be quite sound|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: S has a very fitting hand he knows all his hcp are working|pg||
nt|athene: well, we know NS open light in third - see south's opener a moment ago|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|lethal666: Most of the juniors in Australia either play donkey 2's, which are 2c= stg 2d= 4+D & 4+S, 2h= 4+H & 4+ S & 2S= 4+S&4+C, and can be very weak, so dont have a weak 2 option, or they ...|pg||
nt|lethal666: play 2D as a very weak 2 in a major and 2H & 2S as good weak 2's|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he can't open 2@H if it shows both majors for them|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: whibley "i assume it was you thinking about 4@d" milne gave no response|pg||
nt|lethal666: Yes, If they are playing Donkey, then he would need 4 S as well, to be able to open|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: SW are on one side of the screen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: sounds good this donkey convention|pg||
nt|iceking: good def here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: whibley enquires about NS 1NT range|pg||
nt|lethal666: Can be very destructive holding xxxx Kxxx Qx xxx and open 2H Not Vul. Oponents find it very hard to find their Major suit fits|pg||

pc|s8|nt|iceking: east maybe though should have gotten this right|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: sensible of north to shift to the spade giving the guess|pg||
nt|iceking: S took long time over 4@C and as north has AK of @H he should have @S ace |pg||
nt|athene: he can see there is a danger declarer may get the clubs and diamonds going|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: and even if south gets in, he can't attack spades without resolving a guess|pg||

mb|1C!|an|2+|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|4+ !h|mb|1S|mb|p|an|denies 3!h|nt|athene: some people open 1@D on hands like that West, with the idea of rebidding 2@C over 1major response|pg||
nt|athene: clearly, though, that is evil|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|iceking: yes very popular specially in usa |pg||
nt|athene: and these players are far too young to have acquired evil habits like that|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: they have OTHER evil habits, like Donkey Twos :) but just not that one|pg||
nt|lethal666: that method is not played in Australia|pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: "to teach opponents a sharp lesson it is necessary not only to double them, but also to beat them"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lethal666: This may require Declearer to beat himself|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like 590 here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: better get that heart in the bag to hold it to -590|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: might hook @s twice|pg||
nt|iceking: he knows w has at least 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: west has only 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think u play him for stiff spade|pg||
nt|athene: and not a small stiff spade|pg||
nt|lethal666: MIchael Whibley moved to Victoria last year from New Zealand and is regarded as one of the best Juniors in Australia.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|iceking: they playing support dbl so with 1-2-4-6 shape sure w would never pass @S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceking: 1@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: if so he wld be unbalanced and wld have a) opened 1@D and b) more likely rebid over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: best the defence could do is play a heart and east play ACE|pg||
nt|athene: saying "i don't have @HAK, so i MUST have spades for my double"|pg||
nt|athene: that might or might not work|pg||
nt|athene: it's a fairly common ploy at top level, though, to try to get declarer to misplace the HCP|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will surely play ace of @s now|pg||
nt|iceking: If south thinks about the bidding here he should lay down @S ace now|pg||
nt|athene: then he can go for diamonds trying to get the heart away|pg||
nt|athene: ruff, overruff, club ruff, next diamond stands up for 690|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 690 now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|iceking: still a good score 590|pg||
nt|iceking: and well done figure this one out|pg||
nt|iceking: even it looks easy to us,, its always harder at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: south's nickname is peddles and he is somewhat of an outdoorsman|pg||
nt|athene: West might be wondering whether to try to give his pd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: according to the bulletin he has slept in a tent 200 nights in the last year|pg||
nt|athene: might be only way to beat if east had a trump left and only the @HA and no more diamonds|pg||
nt|lethal666: Alex and Nathan are doing really well here, They might have considered themselves lucky to make this stage based on their teams preformance. But they are showing the number one ...|pg||
nt|lethal666: pair here that they can play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: perhaps they play trump peters so with 3 trumps and a diamond ruff coming, east wld have played high low in trumps|pg||
pc|h3|mc|10|nt|iceking: Been asked how old these players are|pg||
nt|iceking: youth isnt that 25 and under|pg||
nt|lethal666: I believe both are about 23|pg||
nt|athene: west tries to get the best of both worlds - save the overtrick and still perhaps deliver a diamond ruff if east has both @HAK and leaves him on lead|pg||
nt|lethal666: 25 or under i believe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvs: i'm guessing but starting form south i'd say 25, 23, 22, 24|pg||
