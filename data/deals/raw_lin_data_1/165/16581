nt|wkc:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|lorderic: a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lorderic: This is a re-match of last year's University Cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: the is the second half of NTU cup SF|pg||
nt|lorderic: NTU cup is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||

nt|lorderic: sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
nt|lorderic: the two BTU teams get into final|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: so we are sure that the champion would be BTU|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|wkc:  hello everyone, welcome back to the QF segment 2/2 of 18th NTU cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS is playing precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: NCTU defeat BTU and advanced in the finals last time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lorderic: BTU has 7.5 IMPs carryover in 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's a huge carryover imo|pg||
nt|lorderic: the very first board in CR is a disaster for EW, 3NT is much better|pg||
nt|lorderic: can't blame W bid leaping michaels to show 2 suits|pg||
nt|lorderic: here's the website of the event: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a maximum opening hand (14-15) with spades|pg||
nt|lorderic: at the other SF match, another BTU team is leading NCCU by 49.5 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: welcome back everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: In the second half of QF we broadcast NTHU vs BTU|pg||

nt|wkc:  E could bid 3@C to ask|pg||
nt|lorderic: Kitty has 2.5 IMPs carryover in this 24-board knockout|pg||

pc|d4|nt|lorderic: for those who is new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU is ahead by 7.5 IMPs, 12 boards to go|pg||
nt|wkc:  E need to lead a @H to set 3NT, which needs a little imaginary|pg||
nt|lorderic: for the correction: it is a 28-board knockout|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lorderic: BTU is known as Bridgeclub in national Taiwan University, the largest collegiate bridge club in Taiwan|pg||

nt|wkc:  maybe not today|pg||

nt|lorderic: here comes a slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: a partscore here|pg||
nt|wkc:  E hand is too good for a white-vs-red 2@H preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 12 top tricks so 6NT by N is also cold|pg||
nt|wkc:  or 6NT(by N) I hope|pg||
nt|lorderic: yup|pg||
nt|lorderic: 6@H/@S/NT is cold for EW|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lorderic: this is a 3-day collegiate event|pg||
nt|lorderic: looks like a flat 4@H|pg||
nt|lorderic: actually NS can make 5@D here|pg||
nt|lorderic: but it's almost impossible to get there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lorderic: For those new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: N is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to bid 4N|pg||
nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: with such a huge hand perhaps it's better to open a strong 2@C instead of 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: Sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
nt|lorderic: usually i don't preempt with so many side cards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lorderic: but it's ok to do while NV and a passhand pd|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lorderic: @S lead gives an overtrick|pg||
nt|wkc:  W might think about open 2@C, but 1@S then bid @H describe his hand better|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wkc:  oops|pg||
nt|lorderic: S should bid 4@D after 3NT for a slam try|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what 3NT shows, but if it shows extra, S should move on to the slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree, pass seems a little underbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and if it shows min, then N should bid something else|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wkc:  and if it includes a wide range, then maybe they should discuss a little more about their system|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lorderic: for your information, CGU has 4.5IMP carryover for this 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@D by N didn't work much, so they get to @S slam easily|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back KC!|pg||
nt|lorderic: it did cause some bidding problem for S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wkc:  hi eric|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lorderic: S could double 5@C to ask for a @C lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: N lead his singleton @C anyway|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lorderic: on this lead NS should easily get 5 top tricks for -1|pg||
nt|lorderic: if NS cashed 4 top hearts, could be -2 if E decide to keep clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|lorderic: prevent from an overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wkc:  now the declarer has a @S+@CAQ squeese for 13 tricks, but it doesn't work this time|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|lorderic: if W draw another trump would bring the contract home|pg||

nt|jonky:  Then the fourth club may produce an extra trump trick|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|wkc:  in CR, W bids 4@D over 2@D, which is a little strange to me|pg||

nt|lorderic: NS might reach 3NT on this if N bid aggressively|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a slam for NS|pg||
nt|lorderic: as I know, EW used to play in a highly artificial system called MOSCITO|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like they didn't play that in this event|pg||
nt|lorderic: it worth a try. he knows he doesn't have 5 quick loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and it's a grand slam, lets see if they could reach there|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  12-14?|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|lorderic: NS could make 3@S and EW could make 4@D on this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like NS is playing weak NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lorderic: 2NT should be a lebensohl here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 7@D is almost a lay-down|pg||
nt|lorderic: can make 7NT with dropping @SJx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wkc:  if it's a 12-14 1NT, then N did bid aggressively|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D opening from S is precision, could have longer @C than @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: it's unlikely for west to bid 4@D after 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance to get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: a raise to 3@S now would get there|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lorderic: W chooses an aggressive one|pg||
nt|wkc:  South should bid 3@C right after pn's overcall, because things like this happens everyday|pg||
nt|lorderic: Do they play strong club Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1N shows 13-15|pg||
nt|lorderic: N hand to me is only an invitational one|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is some kind of checkback|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@D looks strange to me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzxs: but west wanna to do that haha|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's too risky due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree. in competative bidding, one should raise pd's suit as soon as possible|pg||
nt|lorderic: now 5@C is kind of risky while Vul |pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: they both lead 014th|pg||
nt|wkc:  this is going to go down quickly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wkc:  now they make another mistake and get an "expensive" sacrifice|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: NS they play precision|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3NT could usually be the best contract if E has 6 cards @D and @S stopper|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lorderic: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|lorderic: with everything unfavor to declarer, I expect this will go down 2 or 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wkc:  X = "pn, please don't bid again"|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lorderic: 2@D is real @D and 3@D shows a fit in @D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|lorderic: N knows they have all the keycards... what's next?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lorderic: that's a good news for NCTU... because 2NT goes down also|pg||
nt|wkc:  now N knows they have all the keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: he just settled in 6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wkc:  W wants to use J(from QJ) to indicate a @H shift|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think it's better to tell your pn that fact by bidding 5NT, instead of 6@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: he does not know how many @H S have|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lorderic: but this time 4@D is the best since neither 5@D nor 3NT could be made|pg||

mb|3C|nt|lorderic: EW can make 3NT, but i don't think they would get there|pg||

nt|lorderic: how about Axxx Kxx Qxxxx A?|pg||
nt|lorderic: FYI, LI Na just advanced in Australian Open Wumen Final|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|lorderic: an off-shape 1NT opening|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: it looks like NS don't play pre ?|pg||
nt|wkc:  he'll raise @S after 1@S|pg||
nt|lorderic: 6@H could be made here if @D played correctly|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: EW might bid 4@S after 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: good decision for north not raising 3@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lorderic: hand is too weak and @HKQx is better for defense|pg||
nt|wkc:  W is now thinking for a sacrifice|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lorderic: if either makes that would be huge IMPs for not bidding 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@H is a great contract... only before you see the cards lie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lorderic: E could play a low @S to drop singleton @SK in S, or ...|pg||

mb|1N|nt|wkc:  2@H is inv or better, and now W might pass because of misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: i don't agree with this 4@S. 2@S rebid is enouth for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: would you double 4 @S ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: they are heading to slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  notice that the bidding here helps S to find a @D lead|pg||

nt|wkc:  oops, we did miss something :(|pg||
nt|lorderic: for everyone new to here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|lorderic: a flat 4@H here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wkc:  NS could make 6m, but it's hard to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: on board  3 CGU overbid to 4@S. another 5 IMPs for NCTU|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: looks like on both table CGU overbid a lot|pg||
nt|lorderic: wondering if NS will get to 4@S on this hand?|pg||
nt|lorderic: S make a typical usunual 2NT shows both minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzxs: yes, but today is not their day :(|pg||
nt|lorderic: from N point of view, if S has a hand as good as xx x KQxxx AKQxx then a slam is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@S in 4ht seat shows 11-12 HCP with 6 cards @S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzxs: go for 3N now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: since W didn't open, i don't think it is a good decision for E to bid 3NT here|pg||
nt|lorderic: I think 3@H shows a GF hand with long hearts|pg||
nt|lorderic: personally i would bid 4@H after 1NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: the slam is unlikely|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzxs: just guess :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: i would open 3@C with W hand. some might say the clubs are not good enouth Vul|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS slightly overbid on previous 3NT|pg||
nt|lorderic: looks like they are not as aggressive as the other NCTU pair |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: making 7 with this lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: 2 pass hands play 3N here.|pg||
nt|lorderic: a @D lead will set the contract immediately|pg||
nt|lorderic: this is another chance for them to overbid again|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU-96 bid and made the game on board  3, 10 IMPs and take the lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: N takes some time for the lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lorderic: on a @S lead E could make 3NT if he plays @C correctly|pg||

nt|lorderic: even if they stop at 4@S still 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: from EW hands 4@S is typical|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: i usually play A from AK to ask for attitude, K for count|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: overbid wins this time|pg||
nt|wkc:  what will you open with S hand, eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: this one could be a huge score|pg||
nt|lorderic: N managed to make 6 on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@H to show @H + minor is typical to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lorderic: 3@H shuts everyone's mouth|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  EW has a not-easy-play 3NT, but not after 3@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lorderic: I would not overcall 1@H Vul with such a bad suit|pg||
nt|wkc:  same here|pg||
nt|lorderic: but this one works well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lorderic: it's a good try here. don't need much for 4@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  it's too risky to bid over 3@H for both E and W|pg||
nt|wkc:  again, if you are gonna to raise pn's suit, raise it right away|pg||
nt|wkc:  don't let opps have a chance to show their hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS might not find the best 3NT after this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: NCTU picks up another 6 IMPs on board  5 and is ahead by 14.5 now|pg||
nt|lorderic: and they have an potential 13 IMPs on board  11|pg||
nt|lorderic: board  12 i mean|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lorderic: Director said the boards might be cut in the second half due to the slow-play|pg||
nt|wkc:  a throw-in could make it only one off|pg||
nt|lorderic: N jump to 5@D, not a bad choice but not successful in this board|pg||
nt|wkc:  on board15, BTU finds 7@D and grab 13 IMPS, gj|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  2@S-2 by E on board 16 in OR, so another 8 IMP to BTU|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|lorderic: BTU picked up 11 IMPs on the misdefend board  4|pg||

nt|wkc:  NS makes their 4@H in OR by EW's misdefence and grab 11 IMP on board 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wkc:  well, I think maybe a @D shift by E is better than a @S back|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|lorderic: now E can make this if she reads everything correctly|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lorderic: the best play here is to play a club back|pg||
nt|lorderic: to establish @C suit and then play on trump coup|pg||
nt|lorderic: with a @D return, ruff with @SJ, play @S8 to draw all trumps|pg||
nt|lorderic: and get back to hand with @HA for the clubs|pg||
nt|lorderic: a @H return would be more complicated|pg||
nt|lorderic: W cannot draw all trumps and cash all @C and @D trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: E claim draw all the trumps and all good|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: now they're waiting for TD|pg||
nt|lorderic: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|lorderic: ... on the @H return by S, W should win with @HA and play a club|pg||
nt|lorderic: if N ruff, E can overruff and draw 2 more round of trump, pinch @H on @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: declarer just have  3S 1C 1D|pg||
nt|lorderic: if N refuse to ruff, throw a @H and keep playing @C will do|pg||

mc|8|nt|wkc:  now @S return could prevent a throw-in|pg||

nt|lorderic: another highly competitive bidding coming|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a big misfit. could they stop at the right place?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lorderic: it is reasonable that EW settle in 2|pg||

nt|lorderic: it "was" the closest|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lorderic: the problem is that his void is in pd's suit|pg||

pc|s4|nt|lorderic: finally both agree with 3NT|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lorderic: i totally disagree with this 5@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: overbid again?|pg||
nt|lorderic: after 2@C, E has a minimum hand|pg||
nt|wkc:  the declarer has a chance to find his 9th trick by squeezing E's minor, but lots work need to be done|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is also not my style|pg||
nt|wkc:  not an easy one, for both declarer and defenders|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|lorderic: 3@H and 4@C almost tell everything he has|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: how do you think at West seat ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: W hand worth a slam-try, but void in @C is kind of useless|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs:  6 @D8 costs 16 imps |pg||
nt|wkc:  EW reach 6NT/W on board 5 in OR to take them back on the track|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lorderic: another problem for W is perhaps the trump|pg||
nt|lorderic: E can easily have every side control ... @DK, @SQ, but no @HJ|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
nt|wkc:  oops, now he has his 8th trick|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|wkc:  he's short in entry to dummy before the last round|pg||
nt|lorderic: now declare can make this one by winning the spade, cashes @Hs and @Ds|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|wkc:  I think they play gladiator, so 2@H means 5 card @H and inv power|pg||
nt|wkc:  but maybe I'm wrong|pg||

nt|by:  here, the @CJ is onside 3-3|pg||
nt|lorderic: anyone would open with E hand?|pg||
nt|wkc:  3 boards to go, 7 boards to compare, and BTU is heading by 34 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  so unless the NS defenders get to their heart tricks, 3N would make on bad defence|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@S/S is likely to be the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: about 20 mins left, they might finish 12 boards now.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lorderic: W must find a @H lead to set it, otherwise S can pinches @H on @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3NT by S and a @H lead is what NCTU need now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lorderic: but a @S lead will give defensive side first 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lorderic: note that 4@H by E is also a reasonable contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: i'm not sure what double here shows|pg||
nt|lorderic: S open 1@D and wish to bid 2NT shows 18-19|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wkc:  4@S opening is not my style|pg||
nt|wkc:  maybe to stop the 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|lorderic: since S pass they cannot get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|lorderic: still NS can make 5@D if defender don't cash their tricks|pg||
nt|lorderic: however N hand is too weak to respond|pg||
nt|lorderic: if N bid 2@H (or 2@D if they play transfer here), they might get to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: @S again choose to be aggressive by opening 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lorderic: opening with E hand is not my choice. but they will definitely bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|by:  I think that most people opens today|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if E passes, the bidding could be p-1@D-1@H-2@C-2NT-p|pg||
nt|wkc:  if 3@H is ask for the stopper, I would definitely bid 3NT even after X. This might be all what pn want|pg||
nt|lorderic: which is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  i don't agree with it, but that's fashion|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: S knows that N hand is too weak to make a negative dbl after 1@S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lorderic: a pass here is fine|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lorderic: neither do i|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a weak hand with 4+ support|pg||
nt|wkc:  @SK ask for the count|pg||
nt|lorderic: they finally settle in 5@D|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|by:  I usually ask my students *not* to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|by:  typically|pg||
nt|by:  both have a spade stop|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lorderic: N can play for 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wkc:  now she'll play a @C because she knows her contract is always making if @D split 3-3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lorderic: nicely shift by Shih|pg||
nt|wkc:  2 shows even, and so E needs to which Ace W has|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wkc:  playing @C gives her another chance, like now|pg||
nt|by:  the usual weakness is a heart or a club, but if you misguess which one, the result can look really foolish.  |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|lorderic: usually @S is not a great lead on this kind of auction. but for @S hand it's very difficult to pick from either @H or @C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|by:  and it would be really bad if you have to lead the @h8 from this holding, blowing up the suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wkc:  now a @D ruff to set the contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wkc:  and 2@H bid helps him to figure it out|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lorderic: on board  9, EW bid 3NT doubled, and N happily cashes 6 top tricks for -2|pg||
nt|by:  see?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|by:  :) you have to save your winners |pg||
nt|wkc:  oops, I mislooked|pg||
mc|9|nt|by:  I think that it is best for S to follow with the jack on the second round|pg||
nt|lorderic: i have no idea why @S did not draw another trump|pg||

nt|jonky:  4@C splinter is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|jonky:  Then West may double 4@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  ya, somebody would say that E hand is too far away to reach a slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  but another good advantage of bidding 4@C is to help pn to decide where to go|pg||

nt|wkc:  BTU reaches 6@D on board 18, nicely done|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lorderic: a grand slam here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: 2@D shows a weak 2 in major|pg||
nt|wkc:  let's see if NS could get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: precision-style 1@D opening|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: 4@H by W is typical, although 4 quick tricks outside|pg||
nt|lorderic: likely to be another flat board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|by:  that is very conservative by west|pg||
nt|by:  note that 7@SX is set six, which is better than letting 7@H play|pg||
nt|wkc:  5@S by S?|pg||
nt|by:  well|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@D shows a better @H fit hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|lorderic: 2@S is pass or correct and become the contract|pg||
nt|by:  if S hear 5@S by S, what could he bid other than 7@H?|pg||
nt|by:  I think for most opponents at this level who plays negative free bids, 3@S is probably best|pg||
nt|wkc:  I expect the same contract here|pg||
nt|lorderic: a really aggressive 4@S here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: lets see if EW could get their @h ruff to set it|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  since no one would ever be sure again what is trumps|pg||
nt|lorderic: double? ;)|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: 3@C bid by S buy the contract|pg||
nt|wkc:  and looks like it's a good score for NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: S could make this one by guessing @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: obtain 7 IMPs if 3@D makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: she must have good understanding on W overcall style|pg||
nt|lorderic: for me I would bid @C again on E hand, and pass by W|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: a huge hand in N|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lorderic: not quite sure what 3NT is|pg||
nt|jonky: If 2@C GF, N should bid 2NT|pg||
nt|jonky: Then if S rebid 3@C, can go to slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to show a 16-18 bal hand ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: another precision-style 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C could be longer @C than @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a tough decision on S hand|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS has 13 trick for 7NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lorderic: pass 3@Hx is a great choice |pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: he is not sure which minor is longer|pg||
nt|lorderic: but it's really difficult to get there, even in small slams|pg||
nt|lorderic: i don't think opening 1@S with 25 HCP is a good idea|pg||
nt|lorderic: too many strength so that it is possible 1@S-all pass|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lorderic: beating 2@S is not enough for NTHU|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: since 2@C could be a wide range of hands, it's not good to waste so many spaces by bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know their thought haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: still a safe contract here :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: much better than 3NT at the other table|pg||
nt|wkc:  a @H shift now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2NT would be kind of overbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  thanks eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: that is how they do in the whole match|pg||
nt|wkc:  I agree, he knows that they are misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2C means 54/45 minors |pg||
nt|lorderic: another aggressive 3NT, any chance here?|pg||
nt|lorderic: oops|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wkc:  it will be a quick one|pg||
nt|by:  alas|pg||
nt|by:  only makes it close|pg||
nt|wkc:  and a 10 point inv is absolutely overbid to me|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's true. but when you choose between playing in 4-2 trump or overbid, i choose the latter|pg||
nt|lorderic: pass 2@C/correct to 2@D could also be disaster|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
nt|lorderic: @S is thinking which suit split 33, @D or @S?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lorderic: since @S split 3-3 should be making 5, 13 IMPs to NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: so after the first half NCTU is ahead by 22.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: this would set 3@H a lot|pg||
