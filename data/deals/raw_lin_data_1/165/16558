pc|cT|nt|ady: doubt this will make Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: perhaps south has to try 2@s but does not have the security of being sure that she wont run into troubole when north has a misfiitti9ng minimum 11 count|pg||
nt|dburn: why not? two clubs, four hearts, two diamonds...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: even three diamonds|pg||

nt|ady: recent fashion  opening 1NT with a singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's becoming increasingly popular to open off-shape 1NT's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4441  5422  6322|pg||
nt|ady: natural lead of a spade |pg||
nt|rmb1: Its a good place to hide 4441 with stiff honour but can lead to some odd contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 5431  even|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Contract is 4@S by S?|pg||
nt|garnetts: last board Looks to me as if NS have pushed to a very agressive 4@S --well its more likely them rather than EW :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Let her open 4@S, all pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then lead a card and claim when the hand is over|pg||
nt|mamos: This is Board 3|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|jcomyn: slam anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another slam Roland would be proud of - played by West to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good slam...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nikce breaks in majors|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3D can win in many ways|pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially with slam on|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Kx of diamonds lad from pd will probably best 3N. and sometimes E will elect to make a TO double and EW will get to wrong game|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes i meant in general, not on this specific deal|pg||
mb|2C|an| |mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chilloncan: there was an american movie a decade or two ago called "Heathers"|pg||
nt|dburn: not an obvious choice for West now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks like inverted raise|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT   coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: A of @D and still need to find the Q@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you rebid - just 4@S ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no too good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|viren169: tough bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a noise|pg||
nt|viren169: Unless you have a gadget or two to cover these types of hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just allow space for e to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you suggest John|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: not a comfortable choice for E there either, as X has warts, but so of course do 3N and 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that is surely that|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East is there... now it will be hard to stay out of slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is unfairly unlucky|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dburn: of course, one of the ways 3@d can lose is by pushing East-West to something they can make but would not have bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W could go on here, needs only AKQxxx    Axx  xx Kx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: even with s 4-1 rest lie nice|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is certainly true david|pg||
nt|dburn: but West might barely have done something over 4@s|pg||
pc|d4|nt|viren169: 6@H is better than 6@S as the cards lay|pg||
nt|rmb1: It has to be a @S lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the race to Dubai|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|viren169: Tough lead to find. I fancy this to make.|pg||
nt|rmb1: and it sounds like @S are 4-4 in which case its dangerous to lead|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chilloncan: W apparently wanted to confirm a commentator's earlier statement that this field is conservative|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are al;l women not conservative|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: lots of oh s on 2 D from N and amusement|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like the lead of the Q@D--normal to lead low in my view |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Doesn't need to find @DA just @SQ - likely to play for @S length with N after trump break|pg||
pc|d2|nt|viren169: Lighter dble has been suggested?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tom Townsend|pg||
nt|mug: good morning|pg||
nt|viren169: Morning Tom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: grand when p has the 10|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tlc: dinah did well to avoid and aggressive t/o dbl over 2@s...there was no good resting spot had she done so|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that finding West with HKJ represents the best chance doesn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mug: a fascinating deal|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some one might run from a lightner double - even to the making 6NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: must take here |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: play east to have the ace--the lead has cost --and guess what I am not sympathetic |pg||
nt|garnetts: When east has the heart ace I meant the lead costs --a low diamond gains in all cases |pg||
nt|bobholl: still thinking ? :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes probably thinking why didn't I lead a low diamond :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: little to think about now|pg||

nt|lml: hi|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s4|nt|viren169: or run back to 4M!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mug: Nicole Cook might have doubled 6@H for a spade lead, then again it would be silly to drive opps into 6NT when Christine Duckworth was going to lead a spade from five anyway|pg||

mb|p|an|forcing|nt|garnetts: I like 3@D non forcing |pg||
nt|bobholl: you could play lebensohlish here than 2nt :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is usual when 1NT is doubled for the doubling side to play pass as forcing over two of either minor |pg||
mb|2H|nt|eggy: here probably :)4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some (ladies) pairs still playing a weak NT|pg||
nt|dburn: decent result for East-West at the other table|pg||
mb|d|an|to|nt|jcomyn: very true - in what|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: important match, that - 4th against 2nd, with 4th having the better of it so far|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eggy: Something of an underbid, but just as well I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good judgement I daresay|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like a normal spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: HATE it|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like the obvious 1-off|pg||
nt|viren169: some good players also play weak NT! |pg||
nt|mug: as I recall Sandra (and Brian Senior) and Holland/Brunner were the only pair playing weak NT in the English Premier League|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The South hand is worth 4@D non forcing but it will be taken differently --its in between forcing and non forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Nothing wrong with weak NT in the right hands!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: could well be the limit in that lead|pg||
nt|lml: East has an unfitting 5 count|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: not a very enterprising final pass, but the form of scoring apparently dictates cautions for these players|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should perhaps redouble to show a good 2@H bid --pass to show two and 2@H average |pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: whats the besat advice lads for those playin weak. I have a class and it is diffiult to explain whast not to do|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess a push difficult :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|viren169: so 3@D should be some values|pg||
nt|mamos: Its difficult to believe NS were on sound ground here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eggy: I suspect a few will punt 3NT with the West hand|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: its a pretty big punt unless east shows a bit more|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for that matter, E might have doubled 1S. and certainly N was close to a game try with 5 LTC (Losing Trick Count)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|viren169: Send me an email and I will send you pros and cons for both!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mug: I don't think what NT range you play is going to make much difference to your results below expert level|pg||

nt|mug: although given the choice I would teach beginners strong NT as it's easier to play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings|pg||
nt|garnetts: For all that they have done well |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not much of a 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|tlc: indeed? even after 1@c-1@d?|pg||
nt|viren169: Tom, Dont some of the the Italians players weak NT?|pg||
nt|mug: there was a debate in English Bridge, I was for the Strong NT, the outcome was 87% for the Weak NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT bid here by NS in the OR--cannot think why |pg||
mb|1D|nt|mug: no Gad|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2@S by EW looks a real possibility |pg||
mb|2D|nt|eggy: I may be wrong, but I think that's what Lizzie told me a couple of weeks back|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chilloncan: on that lasthand W opened 2D in the other room, which turned out to be a big success. have to say the call would not have appealed to me with a terrible suit and excellent ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: playability in both majors, with an unpassed partner and vul to boot|pg||
nt|bobholl: double 2@D or pass in N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|viren169: Ummmmmmmmm|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: they don't play lebensohl :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|mug: so my original answer was accurate|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|mug: good board for the STRONG NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: They just happen to be  1 and  2 in the world currently.|pg||
nt|mug: North didn't know about West's diamonds, and led them|pg||
nt|mug: declarer still needs to find a trick or two from somewhere though|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|mug: spade to the jack now, perhaps?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|tlc: a spade lead was the best lead, but this should lead to down 1 if everyone is careful|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eggy: Well East won't switch to a small heart now anyway|pg||
nt|mug: best now is a heart to break up the pressure on partner|pg||

nt|bobholl: are you sure ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: double or 1@H?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of competition here i darsay|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 1nt or 1@H in S|pg||

nt|garnetts: 1NT for me |pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: yes my bid too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: thought you never open 1nt on 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support double|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D anyone?|pg||
nt|mug: a hand for all seasons|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gad y|pg||
nt|garnetts: every time |pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: do you like 1NT with Qx and Qx.  We do but I like more in the doubletons and less in the long suits|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a big fan of slightly offshape NTs, but not with 5@C-4@s..rebids are too easy|pg||
nt|mug: must expect 5@D to be close, but wouldn't mind defending a lot of doubled spades either given the option |pg||
nt|viren169: redbl now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 3@D would have been an underbid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: as the cards lie NS can make slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D by North instead of 2@D or 3@D by South instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly go on now|pg||
nt|mug: South is worth game in diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: Getting into the grey area now...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might even get the lead right here too |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobholl: with 15 and 2@S i prefer 1@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: win and four rounds of hearts ?  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|eggy: I'm not a fan, but probably in the miniority|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yesd hard to see where 11 tricks come fromn|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D ought to be forcing|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a slam try?|pg||
nt|viren169: should be slam try (at least!)|pg||
nt|mug: well partner appears to have five diamonds, make a few diamond tricks and ruffing, and some more tricks from the majors, what's the problem?|pg||
nt|mug: now North can try 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: oops what?|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is your rebid over 1@S Bob?  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: Cook would prefer to hear 4@H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eggy: anyway, I imagine all roads lead to ROme|pg||
nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will she|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we all know if u are in slam the KJ108 will be in the E hand|pg||
nt|lml: either hand will do|pg||
nt|tlc: and the club's off|pg||
nt|mug: you can take a horse to water etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: Erichsen in other room bid 3@D on first round as North|pg||
nt|mug: not that I'm comparing any of our last trialists to members of the equine species|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D looks about right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: given the auction I think they did well to get to 5D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: why not?|pg||
nt|dburn: three spadess, four hearts and a club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh yes true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant count any more at my age|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|mug: but North's hand was pretty good relative to what she'd show already, she could afford to show her spade control, the six good diamonds were huge|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Cook was going to drive to game whatever!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2  in best minor :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it's about a 17% slam, plus mb some sqz chances|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1N on the N hand cashes in when pd has a moderate hand with 5 hearts. it has the downside of possibly burying spades. whenever N would be reluctant to pass a 1N response to 1S, but ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: also reluctant to raise, a 1N opener is recommended. here that is not the case, i think, so it is a very close decision for N|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|mug: "ladies" I meant, not "last"|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|tlc: a claim coming soon|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D or 2@D on the first round depends a bit on doubling style|pg||
nt|mug: I think I prefer Helen's choice of 3@D but 2@D was not a mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D allow you to bid the spots of the cards afterwards. 4@S was clear cut.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: now shes thinking about slam :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D lead 1@D 1@C and 5@H|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|eggy: unless she plays for the D7 again|pg||

nt|eggy: The scoring is x imps, capped to 28imp per match for the winning pair|pg||

nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|lml: she had to hold on to dummy's hearts|pg||

nt|lml: when West returns a diamond she has to rise ace and then there is a kind of winkle|pg||
nt|mug: I think 5@C exclusion was in order over 3@D|pg||
nt|mug: or simply void showing, in either case reaching the decent slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another lively hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure how much it mattered but a 4th heart throwing dummy's last diamond must be better then leaving a loser there |pg||

nt|dburn: not the best game at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mug: a bit wet to pass, but in accordance with the classical rule of 500|pg||
nt|rmb1: Constructive weak two (?)|pg||

nt|viren169: looks like a normal 3@C to me by Cook|pg||

mb|3C|an| |nt|lml: the 9 sets up I believe but I need to look at it|pg||
nt|eggy: Wasn't dummy entryless though?  I thought a winkle was only for overcoming blocked suits|pg||
nt|tlc: good hand to be playinggood/bad 2NT...|pg||
nt|lml: yes if east gets in she has to give dummy a heart|pg||
nt|mamos: is the East hand upgrade?   downgrade ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: NS found an 8 card minor fit anyway|pg||
nt|mug: yes a lot of pairs like the two tier weak twos these days, 2@S showed about 8-11|pg||
nt|mug: the heart fit went begging|pg||
nt|dburn: not that any game is wonderful, but five of either minor will make|pg||
mb|3D|an| |mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lml: anyway one for the blog|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but what about that 6-3 h fit. I dont like 2S on the w hand|pg||
nt|dburn: here, West probably should have rebid 2@d (or opened 1@d if intending to treat the hand as a minimum, but...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well 3NT on a 6-5-1-1 distribution a bit hairy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 9pts in one suit downgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: not for the table :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I think that the heart switch may have kyboshed that, but interesting anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: hope heather has her guessing shoes on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  in my opinion west should not pass|pg||
nt|dburn: West probably ought to bid on here - if 3NT were the right contract, partner would have bid it earlier|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south also might have raised to 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 'in the tank'|pg||
nt|garnetts: not with the standard of card play I usually watch it aint--they need at least 30 --and thats not being sexist either applies to men and women |pg||
nt|garnetts: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|viren169: not easy to find heart fit after 2@S|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps West could have balanced with a double, but would be normal to have diamond shortage for that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1S allowoing space|pg||
nt|mug: 1@S then 2@S shows 12+|pg||
nt|mug: you miss hearts anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why quibble about 1 pt|pg||
nt|mug: on a free run you do anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  notice if south raised to 2@h it might continue 3@c(?) pass 3NT(?) and now more difficult for west to remove?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: reluctant pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: this may of course get through |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: you get out the wrong side of the bed this mornin|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chilloncan: there are a few downsides to 2H though|pg||
nt|dburn: could be right, I guess - maybe partner has something like @hK10x, @cA and @dQxx|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case 3NT is better than five of a minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but the odds seem to favour bidding - not least because slam might make|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to find their 3@S tricks fast|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: well i asm not sitting on a 6-card major and say nothing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  with K10x @h and Ace of @c then maybe east would bid 3N over 2@c?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: indeed some guess for a great deal of imps|pg||
nt|lml: is there a reason to finesse or just intuition|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: west has more spade so fewer vacant spaces?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On a very good day you make 3NT without the club suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: It's close here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: always do get out of bed in a bad mood --its age related |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|mug: no extra shape and a stray jack, I'm happy to call it 11|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eggy: Would have done well to get it right I think, so early in the play|pg||
nt|mug: Jagger could hardly bid|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no law says she cant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: 5NT would also have been a legal call, not very sensible though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is why i go fo the odd 1100|pg||

nt|dburn: true, but if you can make 3NT without the club suit, you can probably make five of a minor also|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: the reason to finesse is weak|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cT|nt|garnetts: North has made it easy--East might have overtaken as it was her best chance  |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: still, tough problem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But Kaye could not know that 5m would be better|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i like east's bidding here but maybe they just need to discuss this |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back soon|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sometimes you need bad results to sort things out|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: this is the one your grannie always gets right|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eggy: and now N gets squeezed|pg||
nt|lml: I was just reading a story somewhere where the fellow just loved to finesse|pg||

mc|8|nt|garnetts: Cannot remember when two aces in the same hand took the last two tricks |pg||
