pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: if you're going to defend like that, I'm going to put the king on the diamond return|pg||
nt|ady: quiet right|pg||
nt|dburn: Godfrey considering what to do about 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: but should probably give up on the idea and just draw three ending in dummy, then play diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: not much to do if trumps go 4-1   will need QX diamonds onside|pg||

mb|d|nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybve even 7D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: That lead should make the play easier for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: I'm not certain of EW agreements for the 2NT rebid, but if it shows this hand i doubt it is a usual treatment|pg||
nt|rmb1: A @H lead can establish a third trick for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: if north leads the @@CJ declarer won't know it's safe to lose the lead|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if the lead is something like a strong @C10...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit good for 1D methinks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eggy: Probably not in these days of Key Card Blackwood|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: true DQ missing|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||

nt|dburn: West may open with something that will surprise South|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 opening|pg||
nt|jtr: Quite a lead now for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: this  seems a nasty hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: game on 15 missed at other table, so at least a few cross-IMPs for North-South|pg||
nt|ady: this could get passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: quite a contrast, in fact - Godfrey bid 4@h over a raise to two, while Jagger passed|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Worth a punt at 4@h i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if 3@h were not forcing you could do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: a splinter says West|pg||
nt|dburn: but if it is, you might as well bid four and hope|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|jtr: 3@h doesnt seem to get you anywhere unless it is passable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Cleaver switch|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|dburn: you could pass 2@s, of course, but why should that be a good contract?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Godfrey was not in on the joke|pg||
nt|dburn: too clever|pg||
nt|ady: that was the danger of the club switch|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: no way this can get home|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, you shouldnt  lead the 2 with Jxxx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: but well done by Kelly to call for a low club quickly - don't let them know you have a guess|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|cT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|jtr: This auction seems normal enough|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but West has a normal 2@s opening, and it's not easy for East-West to get a plus after that|pg||

nt|rmb1: Current standings at http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|eggy: true, but this looks pragmatic, it would need a lot of black cards for slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the HAK a waste of good cards|pg||

nt|jtr: I wonder why there is a further adjustment to N/S's score|pg||
nt|ady: I knew Dihan Caplan  many years ago  from the 60's     mice to see her playing so well|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: I am told she is 78 years old|pg||
nt|dburn: becuse if you win a match by more than 28 IMPs, you score only 28|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Great stuff, well done!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jtr: Oh i see|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jtr: And they are the only pair to have done so?|pg||
nt|dburn: I believe so|pg||
nt|ady: takes a heart lead to defeat 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Yes, they have overachieved twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If hyou are not going to sell out below 4M anyway, bid 4@C now, or 3NT, or whatever|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jtr: Thanks Simon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C fine but I prefer 4 myself in order to steal that extra level|pg||
nt|ady: west showing her major 2 suiter|pg||
nt|dburn: choice of bids, really - you should probably bid 4@d rather than 4@c if it shows majors|pg||
nt|dburn: because if you bid 4@c, at least North can bid 4@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, but she can double 4@D|pg||
nt|dburn: Caplan with no inverted raise or other conventional way to show the South hand|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure if she could bid a natural 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: west only 2 down in 6@S    so if they mis judge if n/s get to 6@D   still better than n/s being allowed to play 5@D|pg||
nt|jtr: 2@c is sensible enough in that context|pg||
nt|ady: tricky hand |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@s by North now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Close :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow  Pragmatic 6@c:)|pg||
nt|ady: surely 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D|pg||
nt|dburn: well, yes, but why would South not correct to diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes to David's comment|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe something about protecting the king of spades from the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (that's safe with three Davids at the table)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: but surely partner wouldn't jump to six clubs with two low spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: this a very poor result for n/s|pg||

nt|jtr: Not that she will care|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: To the audience. If your first name is David, you have a good chance of becoming a vugraph commentator. We have 19 of them already|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h3|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: wrll Lizzie do jump to 6@C with 1 low hearts    so could have done with the same in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: probably right to put in the ten, which would have brought good news and bad|pg||
nt|dburn: now, it's all bad|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - maybe that worry about protecting the spade was justified|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   Lizzie jumped to 6@C with 2 low hearts    could have done the same with 2 low spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|dburn: not that I understand 6@c very much at all, mind you|pg||

nt|jcomyn: agreed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely 4d is obvious|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Evidently not although it would have been my choice|pg||

nt|paulhac:  If West had bid 4@D and North bid a slam wpould we not lead the A@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but h more obvious since p known to hold both majors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|djneill:  ok South jumped to 4@s to show a minimum hand, fast arrival|pg||
nt|djneill:  not many losers, but are there 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Things lie pretty well here and the lead doesn't hurt.  Still, declarer has some decisions to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  double finesse in diamonds seems to be the simplest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|othered1: well you still have some entry considerations|pg||
nt|djneill:  that avoids the need for too many ruffs, or possibly even the @c guess if the @h can be used to pitch one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Hasan A. Zaidi|pg||
nt|famus: hi all--merry merry xmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rashed and Hasan!|pg||
nt|famus: hi Ed|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Ed, taking two diamond finesses and the @s finesse means 3 entries, but luckily both diamonds are onside which avoids one of those requirements|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're thinking of pitching @C on @H, are you going to win @HA and finesse J?  GIB would, but GIB peeks.|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting stuff, this, but the final contract is not at all bad|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@C a heart raise?|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 2@c was clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise 3@c would be hard to explain|pg||
nt|athene: i've not met that convention :)|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 3@C might be a game try in hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: now thats really treading on dangerous mines|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it's all that easy to explain anyway, but...|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will they try for slam, only missing 1 key card, but not enough tricks |pg||
nt|jtr: ah I thought east is a sponsor|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill:  in these types of hands, I usually try to think about plays which have to be done no matter what, like the diamond finesse, rather than think too deep|pg||

nt|dagold: but 5@d is tough to beat (and bid!)|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe unbeatable |pg||
nt|jcomyn: stilkl with opps bidding majors might get there|pg||
nt|dburn: which was a remarkable thing to do - if it had lost to the jack, the defenders could have taken a club ruff|pg||

nt|othered1: 4 isn't my style.  Would rather bid 2 than 4, but 3 looks OK|pg||
nt|dagold: that is not a second seat 4@d in my book, as opened in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still what a foul hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an oul 3NT|pg||
nt|eggy: something must have gone wrong with the play that we saw I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: yes sry missed a trick in hearts near the end .... they were 1 down|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed..numerous undos required|pg||
nt|rmb1: I think -1 was more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is not ideal but closer to the mark|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so where do they end up|pg||
nt|dagold: still, they may end up overboard if Anne bids 3@h as well she might|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as well she will|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: even at the 3-level, you have to push to get into the auction when short in preemptor's suit.|pg||
nt|djneill:  East might infer partner has a singleton @s so not many @s losers|pg||
nt|djneill:  are we going to see another double-finesse in 5@h|pg||
nt|dagold: well facing akjt to seven and out|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: she should pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: North will keep bidding until they reach (at least) 4M|pg||
mb|1N|an|minors|nt|dagold: she might have passed over the double though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  4@S would appear to be bid often although I would be surprised if more than 1 person made it|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT might help East locate @SQ|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True but maybe they would go wrong in clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is why i think the s bid is daft|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Aggresive certainly|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: 4@h making much less likely now|pg||
nt|toobad: no game making?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a good way to go foir a large number|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Maybe E/W will get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 4@C = @H support and long clubs; ofter played as 4-6|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 4N, probably implies two places to play.   so when east converts @C to @D, h e also shows @H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|famus: good if they restrict it to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: @D+@H now|pg||
nt|dagold: NS off the hook|pg||

nt|dagold: a horrible double by north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely W should pass 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings|pg||
mb|2S|nt|famus: 5@hs i         mean|pg||
nt|dagold: can go one off now though|pg||
nt|dagold: at least|pg||
nt|dagold: or make if south makes the mistake of playing the club queen|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 3@h is forcing fo them|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps the lead of the 8 will give her a clue though :)|pg||
nt|dagold: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: also dont know why E bid after the double. surely NS in trouble|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rmb1: you can pitch all the spades on the clubs|pg||

nt|dagold: take ruffing finness|pg||
nt|dagold: lose just 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: club queen an error|pg||
nt|dagold: oh sorry|pg||
nt|dagold: no ruffing finnese in hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: ace wrong!|pg||
nt|dagold: so 1 off it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: to gain a fortuitous (and undeserved) 2 imps against 1 pair at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  Zack is in auto-double mode|pg||
nt|djneill:  honor location is critical, and all those honors behind the takeout bode well|pg||
nt|toobad: home now|pg||
nt|eggy: or in this case, all the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: dont think he can avoid -2--too much work|pg||
nt|djneill:  shortened @h forces the heart play from that side, rather than @hA and another|pg||
nt|othered1: agree and -2 may take some careful play at that|pg||
nt|famus: and the sing @d doesnt help|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eggy: 3 I should say|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|djneill:  if North keeps playing @s this might make by default with North's @hK skewered, handling problem is those diamonds with the pending ruff|pg||
nt|famus: yep|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|djneill:  and North will probably infer South has a singleton @d after West's takeout|pg||
