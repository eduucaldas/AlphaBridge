mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|jonky:  3NT would fail only facing @D lead|pg||
nt|jonky:  since the clubs split 2-2|pg||
nt|by:  and @Hk was on|pg||
nt|by:  but with E being 11-13, I doubt it ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: a good tactic is to compete as vigorously as you can immediately over an ambiguous opening, like east's 1@D.  But south has too good a hand to preempt.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|by:  three rounds of diamonds for a @H pitch is too much to ask of south since 1@d did not deny diamonds?|pg||

nt|othered1: wsouth is simply trying to make 8 tricks here, and will succeed|pg||
nt|jonky:  @H return is more likely|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: This is a re-match of last year's University Cup|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  hello everyone, welcome back to the QF segment 2/2 of 18th NTU cup|pg||
nt|lorderic: NS is playing precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: NCTU defeat BTU and advanced in the finals last time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: BTU has 7.5 IMPs carryover in 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's a huge carryover imo|pg||
nt|lorderic: the very first board in CR is a disaster for EW, 3NT is much better|pg||
nt|lorderic: can't blame W bid leaping michaels to show 2 suits|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a maximum opening hand (14-15) with spades|pg||

nt|wkc:  E need to lead a @H to set 3NT, which needs a little imaginary|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lorderic: BTU is known as Bridgeclub in national Taiwan University, the largest collegiate bridge club in Taiwan|pg||

nt|by:  I foresee another 1@d ...|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: I think it's right to bid on south's hand, but that's a matter of style.|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably all roads lead to slam or a significant penalty, however.|pg||
nt|jonky:  1@D is better than 2@C opening|pg||
nt|by:  CF Chang, a former junior international, is the conservative straight man in the partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate a canape 11S on east's hand, if someone holds a gun to my head and forces me to open, but 1@D and 2@C are lucky to survive the auction with such junk.|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Spl. GF|mb|p|nt|othered1: Doyou know what 3@C is?|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: 12 top tricks so 6NT by N is also cold|pg||
nt|wkc:  or 6NT(by N) I hope|pg||
nt|lorderic: yup|pg||
nt|lorderic: 6@H/@S/NT is cold for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: this is a 3-day collegiate event|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lorderic: For those new here, this is a collegiate event in Taipei, Taiwan|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: N is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to bid 4N|pg||
nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|lorderic: with such a huge hand perhaps it's better to open a strong 2@C instead of 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: Sorry that we only have chinese version|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lorderic: @S lead gives an overtrick|pg||
nt|wkc:  W might think about open 2@C, but 1@S then bid @H describe his hand better|pg||
mb|6S|nt|wkc:  oops|pg||
nt|lorderic: S should bid 4@D after 3NT for a slam try|pg||
nt|wkc:  I don't know what 3NT shows, but if it shows extra, S should move on to the slam|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree, pass seems a little underbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  and if it shows min, then N should bid something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  and if it includes a wide range, then maybe they should discuss a little more about their system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: for your information, CGU has 4.5IMP carryover for this 24-board knockout|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3@D by N didn't work much, so they get to @S slam easily|pg||
nt|lorderic: welcome back KC!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wkc:  hi eric|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lorderic: S could double 5@C to ask for a @C lead|pg||
nt|lorderic: N lead his singleton @C anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lorderic: on this lead NS should easily get 5 top tricks for -1|pg||
nt|lorderic: if NS cashed 4 top hearts, could be -2 if E decide to keep clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|lorderic: prevent from an overtrick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wkc:  now the declarer has a @S+@CAQ squeese for 13 tricks, but it doesn't work this time|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Ed and all :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|by:  I think if 1@d-1@h-1@s-3@d is a mild slam try with diamonds, that makes things easiest|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!D fit inv+ or maybe asking for stopper|nt|by:  i mean, 3@d is natural and carries slammish overtones.  hard to do today|pg||
nt|by:  it might be that the overcall makes it easier|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|by:  how could north bid less than 7 after partner freely bids spades :P|pg||
nt|by:  and showed 2 keycards and @DQ :P|pg||
mb|4H|nt|by:  ...... wow, these kids are lively|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts a challenge to N for next bid |pg||
nt|by:  north must be looking at her high cards, and wondering where everyone's bid was|pg||
nt|by:  but what about a simple RKC?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or checking back of cards for same deck?|pg||
nt|jonky:  If 2@H promise no 4 spades, then 4NT now would be RKCB for @D|pg||
nt|othered1: if it's clearly for @D only, RKC looks good.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S!|an|2 keycards w/ trump Q|nt|othered1: I have had no luck with a style that would force me to negative double with values like north's or forever deny 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can actually make 7 sp in case they get confuse|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|jonky:  And if no keycards are missing, North can bid 7@D directly|pg||
nt|othered1: but has south promised real @D length?|pg||
nt|by:  i guess she is checking for 7NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 nt also    |pg||
nt|by:  can partner possibly have two diamonds on this auction?|pg||
mb|7D|nt|by:  i guess S thinks that his @HK is a trick|pg||
nt|sybarra: and right S is!|pg||
nt|othered1: goo d decision by south.|pg||
nt|by:  i wonder what 7@HX goes for|pg||
nt|othered1: Taking all the pressure off of north.|pg||

nt|lorderic: NS might reach 3NT on this if N bid aggressively|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a slam for NS|pg||
nt|lorderic: as I know, EW used to play in a highly artificial system called MOSCITO|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lorderic: NS could make 3@S and EW could make 4@D on this board|pg||
nt|lorderic: seems like NS is playing weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2NT should be a lebensohl here|pg||
nt|lorderic: 7@D is almost a lay-down|pg||
nt|lorderic: can make 7NT with dropping @SJx|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|wkc:  if it's a 12-14 1NT, then N did bid aggressively|pg||
nt|lorderic: 1@D opening from S is precision, could have longer @C than @D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lorderic: it's unlikely for west to bid 4@D after 3@S|pg||
nt|wkc:  now they have a chance to get there|pg||
nt|lorderic: a raise to 3@S now would get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: W chooses an aggressive one|pg||
nt|wkc:  South should bid 3@C right after pn's overcall, because things like this happens everyday|pg||
nt|lorderic: Do they play strong club Peter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 1N shows 13-15|pg||
nt|lorderic: N hand to me is only an invitational one|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C is some kind of checkback|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzxs: but west wanna to do that haha|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's too risky due to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lorderic: agree. in competative bidding, one should raise pd's suit as soon as possible|pg||
nt|lorderic: now 5@C is kind of risky while Vul |pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: they both lead 014th|pg||
nt|wkc:  this is going to go down quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  now they make another mistake and get an "expensive" sacrifice|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzxs: NS they play precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: thanks Peter|pg||
nt|lorderic: with everything unfavor to declarer, I expect this will go down 2 or 3|pg||
mb|4N|nt|wkc:  X = "pn, please don't bid again"|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@D is real @D and 3@D shows a fit in @D|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: that's a good news for NCTU... because 2NT goes down also|pg||
nt|wkc:  now N knows they have all the keycards and @DQ|pg||
nt|lorderic: he just settled in 6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wkc:  W wants to use J(from QJ) to indicate a @H shift|pg||
nt|wkc:  I think it's better to tell your pn that fact by bidding 5NT, instead of 6@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: he does not know how many @H S have|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||

nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lorderic: and take the lead by 3.5 IMPs|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|wkc:  I agree, I would open 2@H when red vs white|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a better description of his hand|pg||

mb|3N|nt|wkc:  2@H is inv or better, and now W might pass because of misfit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: would you double 4 @S ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: they are heading to slam|pg||
nt|wkc:  notice that the bidding here helps S to find a @D lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: only liked it to 4@D in CR.  These bids work better when you're boosting the opponents; less well when it's your hand.|pg||

nt|sybarra: south is red v white,  should not be too bad of hand |pg||
nt|othered1: Slam is not cold and you still need to find the @DQ and east did open the bidding.  If east doesn't own up to major 2-suiter, could be misguessed|pg||
nt|sybarra: but N might not be thinking of slam|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: yes, but today is not their day :(|pg||

nt|lorderic: any miracal?|pg||
nt|lorderic: this one looks like a flat 4@H|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: however, while N had 4 cards trump (likely after S overcall @C), a finesse in @S is necessary|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: a gambling 4@H by N|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: hopefully he will made it :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wkc:  for the last board, W should duck @HA. He knows that the declarer have the hand like KQx KJx(x) KJ Axxx(x) for his 1NT opening and pn's @S8 lead|pg||

nt|lorderic: here's the website: https://sites.google.com/site/ntucup2011/|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wkc:  so he should know that the 5th @D is declarer's 9th trick bur dummy is short in entry|pg||

nt|by:  here, the @CJ is onside 3-3|pg||
nt|lorderic: anyone would open with E hand?|pg||
nt|wkc:  3 boards to go, 7 boards to compare, and BTU is heading by 34 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|by:  so unless the NS defenders get to their heart tricks, 3N would make on bad defence|pg||
nt|lorderic: 4@S/S is likely to be the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: about 20 mins left, they might finish 12 boards now.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lorderic: W must find a @H lead to set it, otherwise S can pinches @H on @C|pg||
nt|lorderic: 3NT by S and a @H lead is what NCTU need now|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lorderic: but a @S lead will give defensive side first 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lorderic: note that 4@H by E is also a reasonable contract|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|d|nt|lorderic: i'm not sure what double here shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  4@S opening is not my style|pg||
nt|wkc:  maybe to stop the 3NT bid?|pg||
nt|lorderic: since S pass they cannot get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|lorderic: still NS can make 5@D if defender don't cash their tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: @S again choose to be aggressive by opening 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lorderic: opening with E hand is not my choice. but they will definitely bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|by:  I think that most people opens today|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: if E passes, the bidding could be p-1@D-1@H-2@C-2NT-p|pg||
nt|wkc:  if 3@H is ask for the stopper, I would definitely bid 3NT even after X. This might be all what pn want|pg||
mb|5D|nt|by:  i don't agree with it, but that's fashion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: neither do i|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lorderic: 3@S shows a weak hand with 4+ support|pg||
nt|wkc:  @SK ask for the count|pg||
nt|lorderic: they finally settle in 5@D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|by:  I usually ask my students *not* to lead a spade here|pg||

nt|by:  both have a spade stop|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|wkc:  now she'll play a @C because she knows her contract is always making if @D split 3-3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lorderic: nicely shift by Shih|pg||
nt|wkc:  2 shows even, and so E needs to which Ace W has|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|wkc:  playing @C gives her another chance, like now|pg||
nt|by:  the usual weakness is a heart or a club, but if you misguess which one, the result can look really foolish.  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|lorderic: usually @S is not a great lead on this kind of auction. but for @S hand it's very difficult to pick from either @H or @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|by:  and it would be really bad if you have to lead the @h8 from this holding, blowing up the suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|wkc:  now a @D ruff to set the contract|pg||
mc|10|nt|wkc:  and 2@H bid helps him to figure it out|pg||

mb|p|nt|lorderic: a grand slam here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lorderic: 2@D shows a weak 2 in major|pg||

nt|lorderic: precision-style 1@D opening|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|by:  that is very conservative by west|pg||
nt|by:  note that 7@SX is set six, which is better than letting 7@H play|pg||

nt|by:  well|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@D shows a better @H fit hand|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lorderic: 2@S is pass or correct and become the contract|pg||
nt|by:  if S hear 5@S by S, what could he bid other than 7@H?|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lorderic: 3@C bid by S buy the contract|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: not quite sure what 3NT is|pg||
nt|jonky: If 2@C GF, N should bid 2NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzxs: maybe he wants to show a 16-18 bal hand ?|pg||
nt|lorderic: another precision-style 1@D|pg||
nt|lorderic: 2@C could be longer @C than @D|pg||
nt|lorderic: that would be a tough decision on S hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: pass 3@Hx is a great choice |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lorderic: he is not sure which minor is longer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lorderic: beating 2@S is not enough for NTHU|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lorderic: since 2@C could be a wide range of hands, it's not good to waste so many spaces by bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: don't know their thought haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: of course|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: still a safe contract here :)|pg||
nt|lorderic: much better than 3NT at the other table|pg||
nt|wkc:  a @H shift now?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lorderic: 2NT would be kind of overbid|pg||
nt|wkc:  thanks eric|pg||
nt|lorderic: that is how they do in the whole match|pg||
nt|wkc:  I agree, he knows that they are misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: 2C means 54/45 minors |pg||
nt|lorderic: another aggressive 3NT, any chance here?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wkc:  it will be a quick one|pg||
nt|by:  alas|pg||
nt|by:  only makes it close|pg||
nt|wkc:  and a 10 point inv is absolutely overbid to me|pg||
nt|lorderic: that's true. but when you choose between playing in 4-2 trump or overbid, i choose the latter|pg||
nt|lorderic: pass 2@C/correct to 2@D could also be disaster|pg||
nt|wkc:  you're right|pg||
nt|lorderic: @S is thinking which suit split 33, @D or @S?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lorderic: since @S split 3-3 should be making 5, 13 IMPs to NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: so after the first half NCTU is ahead by 22.5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lorderic: this would set 3@H a lot|pg||
