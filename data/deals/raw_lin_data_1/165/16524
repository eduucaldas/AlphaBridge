pc|d2|nt|kareno: What does he need for a jump-shift?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra2: no clue but what a monster!|pg||
nt|enelya: The scores coming through are the comparison with the other table. However, the event is actually scored against predetermined datums with a C/F from Stage I. Current VP scores are ...|pg||
nt|enelya: Milne/Whibley 380.5, Howard/Lockwood 202.5, Hollands/Harrison 66, Reynolds/Wu 18. +/-1 IMP is worth +/-1 VP.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrnye: unlikely to get this one right|pg||
nt|mrnye: presumably 2NT was 'jacoby' and 3S showed no shortage|pg||
nt|mrnye: 4C was a cubid and 4S showed a minimum|pg||
nt|kareno: One pair to qualify?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: one from this grouping |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and one is dropped out |pg||

pc|dT|nt|mrnye: so South should have no reason to continue, unless he figures that 3S showed extras|pg||
pc|d7|nt|enelya: The scores coming through are the comparison with the other table. However, the event is actually scored against predetermined datums. Current VP scores are Milne/Whibley 260.5, ...|pg||
nt|enelya: Howard/Lockwood 98.5, Hollands/Harrison 100, Reynolds/Wu 21. +/-1 IMP is worth +/-1 VP.|pg||
nt|enelya: That includes Carry Forword from previous stage|pg||
nt|kareno: This looks like one of those movements invented by people who don't need to do anything but play bridge in life :)|pg||
nt|enelya: That'd be me :D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrnye: so after this stage is completed, the leading pair will join Howard/Henbest in the team and the pair coming 4th will drop off|pg||
