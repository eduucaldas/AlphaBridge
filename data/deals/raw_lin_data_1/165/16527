mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mug: hello again|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|eggy: Teshome and Rosen both played in the England team in Pau in 2008, although with other partners|pg||
nt|dburn: much debate as to whether to open 1@h or 1@d with hands like West's|pg||
nt|dburn: the danger is that you might lose the heart suit if you treat the hand as minimum with diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|dburn: which is what has happened|pg||
nt|eggy: think that if you open 1D, you have to be prepared to reverse into hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although East might have saved the day by bidding 3@h anyway, but that is murky|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely after partner bids 2@s you should bid 3@h|pg||
nt|eggy: even though minimum in points|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|eggy: But it's more tricky if ypu have to do it at the three level|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - if you're going to open 1@d, you should be prepared to reverse|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C checkback (?)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: ... or something else, any guesses about 2@D|pg||
nt|mug: did North bid 2@D or 2@H operator?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|rmb1: ok|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|dburn: that lead might not work too well|pg||
nt|eggy: I'mm retty sure she would have bid 2H, but perhaps lost her nerve when the bidding returned a level higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  And surely South, who has defense ONLY against spades should not double 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not "surely" - doubling what's in front of you is often a good idea|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  On the other hand she will now be -550|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mug: this will make but there's a little to play, Sally Brock has to worry about bad breaks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mug: I think one heart finesse, then a club to the jack|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|mug: East could be ducking from @HK-x-x-x|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps it's simply too early in the morning to worry about bad breaks?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|dburn: yes, but not entirely of her own doing - her partner could have taken a trick more|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|rmb1: its already 12 o'clock - should be awake by now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mug: she knows East has @CQ after West showed up with @DAK and @HK and played the clubs accordingly|pg||
mc|11|nt|mug: West passed as dealer, dog which did not bark etc|pg||
pg||
qx|o9|st||md|3S85HJT87DCT986542,SKJ32HAQ542DK52C7,SAQ74H9DAQJ6CAKQ3,ST96HK63DT98743CJ|sv|e|nt|chessmaste: A club to the nine was an odd play, but did not cost this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: feisty hand coming up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cold 6@C, very tough to bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In my youth I might have opened the South hand 3@C - good job North is the dealer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll open the N hand 1@C and hope it won't be passed out|pg||
nt|roswolf: would lead to the cold slam though mark|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is horrible with a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may have a gadget|pg||
nt|chessmaste: What should South respond to 1@C?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is 1@C can be 2|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: It's too good for 3@C imo|pg||
nt|roswolf: OH no a wet 3@C|pg||
nt|chessmaste: An inverted 3@C but it may work well as now North will iamagine the pointed kings might be onside |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, Jagger may go for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: WES6T MAY REGRET THE DOUBLE REDOUBLE LOOKS OBVIOUS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I really like her 1@C|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose you might redouble, but you probably don't intend to sit for 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as did Gross in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: catherine is a very thoughtful bidder|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I hate to tell you but it was obvious to open 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Despite the 22 hcp this is not good for a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|dburn: so you could just bid six clubs - even if it needs a couple of finesses, they will probably work|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree mark|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north redouble east will bid @D AND CARNAGE MIGHT ENSUE|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 6@C looks very reasonable now|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j for standings - now updated|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not clear how many 3@D doubled will go down - or that South would stand it|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w now 2nd n/s still 4th|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kelsey would have called 3@S 'daisy-picking'|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3@S - clever attempt to attract a red suit lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north effectively bid the slam all by herself|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Which is a fair shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gross-Brock stopped in 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C was a lazy bid over the double|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|chessmaste: May cost some IMPs too|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Claim now|pg||
mc|13|nt|roswolf: yes it might - this is difficult to assess on the form of x-imp scoring|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: sorry losing 1 trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
pg||

nt|mug: this looks more interesting!|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C when clubs are 1-1 and you can ruff 3x@H in North|pg||
mb|1C|an|could be 2|mb|p|mb|3C|an|very weak 0-5 with 5+ clubs|nt|mug: that's a good start for NS|pg||
nt|rmb1: Have to open 1@C playing normal methods with North's 22HCP|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: must play 2/1 game forcing, I guess|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn: but even so, you might risk 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|dburn: rather than putting this down as dummy in 2@s|pg||
nt|mug: she might have tried redouble on the way, just once in a while EW aren't playing in hearts|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D* would have been a lot, although Sally Brock may not have stood it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j for standings - now updated|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the results I think the adjustment represents capping the results of a round to +28IMP|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mug: so why didn't the 2nd pair receive a negative adjustment for their +53 in round one?|pg||
nt|mug: kibitzer makes a good point|pg||

nt|roswolf: another fiery hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|roswolf: 5@D perhaps!?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt looks optimistic|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If West had not had a double I would risk 2@D with the North hand - and possibly even after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would prefer to show where I live|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't care for 1NT at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D !? 3nt!?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 'I only had 8 points' said the Walrus|pg||
nt|roswolf: the carpenter says you only had diamonds!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well they might survive now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing 3@D next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: can north resist 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She endplayed herself when she bid 1NT|pg||
nt|dburn: with those fine black-suit guards, who could possibly bid anything else?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, on a spade lead....|pg||
nt|dburn: she ought probably just to bid five diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades might get blocked on a good day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You should not worry too much about what 2@D shows, just bid it|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I assume it shows diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well south steered the boat into port|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Single-handed|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|roswolf: despite the squalls from north|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some specs suggest that you can make 6@D. I know, but you won't at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anything is possible from our vantage point|pg||
nt|dburn: and if she tries to cahs a heart now, she won't make it at all|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

nt|mug: perhaps North could have tried slam over the double, the finesses were likely to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: the pair that got -31 got their full score. the pair that got +31 were adjusted to +28|pg||
nt|rmb1: The cap is per round (of 7 boards) not per session (of 2/3 rounds)|pg||
nt|mug: another possible slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|dburn: 3NT will make, but 4@h won't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they will|pg||
nt|mug: ic|pg||
nt|mug: maybe she can bid 2@C transfer to diamonds?|pg||
nt|mug: a popular and effective method|pg||
nt|mug: I like transfers here as you can happily give up the natural 1NT, much better to pass with the 6-9 hands rather than let the next hand off the hook by bidding 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: natural 1NT over 1M-(dbl) is one of the worst bids in bridge in my view|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|dburn: some form of puppetry|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|dburn: and this form may actually work|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: 3@D too timid|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|mug: hi Bill|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: north had no way to show that diamond suit immediately over the double?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|eggy: Looks like it will end the same though|pg||
nt|dburn: though this lead will probably be good enough|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rmb1: Tom was describing the merits of 2@C transfer instead of 2@D when N passed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings |pg||
nt|athene: ah right |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: maybe they like to have six-card suits for these actions, but still |pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: a diamond would have been worst for the defence (apart from ace and another trump, which would have been fatal)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eggy: To be honest, any lead should have been enough, once you see the dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mug: I don't think pass was a crime, but 3@D was|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: if north, in their partnership style, passes a wide range of hands over the double, then there is a case for lebensohl next time i suppose|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mug: a bit to the play in 5@D mind you, let along 6@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|dburn: maybe, but after a diamond lead and a heart to the ace, it would not be clear to shift to ace and a spade|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is what north will be claiming anyway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn: because partner might have started with @sQx|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mug: she's only going to make 10 tricks, that will improve partnership spirits|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: yes, +130 is a much better score than +150 |pg||
mc|10|nt|mug: no point using up your energy on pointless overtricks|pg||
nt|mug: just make the contract and move on|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|roswolf: good raise!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H sound spade raise. What would 2NT be I wonder|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Okay 4@S - they start with three rounds of clubs and you ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some call it Truscott or Jordan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For a start they don't start with just oner club|pg||
nt|chessmaste: You go to dummy with a trump and play the @H J, which holds|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now what?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: south overbidding here i think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a wee bit pessimistic|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT, on the other hand, is not|pg||
nt|roswolf: now game should be bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The issue here is that responder has four spades, not three|pg||
nt|dburn: it should - but possibly by North|pg||
nt|roswolf: commentators should always hedge their bets david!:)|pg||
nt|dburn: although Jagger may content herself with only 4@c - she has seen her partner bid before|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 4@C will help South a lot|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S not totally trivial here is it? let's say the defence start with three rounds of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now declarer can't draw all the trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Jagger/Seale bid (and made) 6@C on  9 but we don't have the auction|pg||
nt|athene: but south ducks the @HA and now there is a heart ruff lurking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but they wont be in 4S surely|pg||
nt|mug: South's duck is the key play in 4@S I think|pg||
nt|athene: 4-0 trump break definitely causes a but of bother|pg||
nt|mug: let's see what happens|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of bothere even|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: double from south now i guess|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: especially if s bids|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|mug: East is Helen Erichsen, wife of Espen, West is Margaret Nygren (previously James and Courtney) wife of Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: end|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: north will have to put a lead-directing 3@C bid in to cause a problem for declarer in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: Do the panel prefer x of 1S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i expect we will get a diamond lead now rather than the club, so no problems|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well well who would have thought that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, south going for a singleton heart opposite perhaps and an immediate knockout with two ruffs|pg||
nt|mug: reasonable defence|pg||
nt|athene: or this might work with hearts 3-3 in the EW hands if north can win a trump trick|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Does the panel prefer 1@s or 2@c as a response to partner's opening 1@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly dont like 1s|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|eggy: If 1C can be short (probable) then I prefer 1S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pass|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: ace of hearts, heart, north wins trump, club to ace, heart ruff|pg||
nt|mug: there was a very famous hand many years ago when an Italian led @CA from A-x-x-x in a similar situation|pg||
mc|10|nt|mug: rather than @DA from A-x-x-x-x|pg||
nt|athene: on the subject of a 3@C bid over 2nt for the lead, you can often get away with very aggressive lead-directing bids in that sort of position|pg||
nt|rmb1: An Jagger/Seale bid to 5@D= on  10 - after 1@H(X)1NT :)|pg||
nt|mug: there was a lot of talk when @CA lead was the winner|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another gripping mix of distribution and feminine je ne sais pas|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have just bid 3@S as south since the pass shows something extra in my methods|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|dburn: well, they might make a game if they were in one|pg||

nt|dburn: what with the rather fortunate spade position - but you need to guess well|pg||

nt|dburn: crikey - they did make game at the other table|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: Pabis-Ticci wasn't it? there was a lot of muttering, i know that|pg||

mb|p|nt|mug: he said the longest suit was only likely to be good for one ruff, the second ruff might have been overruffed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: theres the strong nt again and s cant bid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|mug: perhaps Mrs Erichsen rated the hand too good for a 15-17 NT, hardly unreasonable|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C strong (4 card) raise (?)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: reasonable auction from the other table, though|pg||
nt|mug: mixed raise I suppose|pg||
nt|jcomyn: god gave you 17 to open 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: 4@S scarcely justified but Mrs Brock does really need much justification to try a thin game in a ladies trial|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and nhow game is out of the question|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcomyn: Fiona had a great win in a very strong field in tralee two weeks ago|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/65vok4m  for standings after round 1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: but this one is OK too - you'll have a play for slam facing almost anything, and it would be a good contract if East had five little hearts rather than four|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Leading three pairs after 17 rounds are guaranteed selection for the Lady Milne Trophy to be played in Northern Ireland on 15th-17th April.|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear what the best line is - maybe @sA, @hA, club to the ace, diamond to the queen, @dA, diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mug: can she pick the singleton @SJ?|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting point of theory is what the double of 3@C means|pg||
nt|athene: could be a) strong NT b) clubs c) t/o of spades|pg||
nt|mug: (a) seems pointless|pg||
nt|mug: (b) and (c) both have merit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|athene: in a lot of these situations i think it can be useful to have x showing takeout of the opps' announced fit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you have to pass and wait and then the auction is way higher|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: which ought to work|pg||
nt|mug: indeed, but double to show clubs can result in a lot of profitable saves|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|athene: true - it might depend how "natural" your 1@C is|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mug: I'm trying to work out whether ruffing in with @SJ could every gain|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: loos as though Dhondy agrees with me|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: (first time for everything, I guess)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps if East held @SK86?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reward for bravery and the questionable opening bid|pg||
nt|mug: bit early in the afternoon to work it out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mug: the thing is, if Margaret hadn't ruffed in, perhaps Sally would have played East for singleton @SK instead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|mc|10|nt|mug: finally a nice job in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: do we know what the double was?|pg||

nt|dburn: well, it was odd in the middle - declarer led a low club from hand for one reason or another|pg||
nt|roswolf: another magical mystery tour perhaps|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: east passed!!incroyable|pg||

nt|henryb:  Hi guys|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: hi henry|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Walddk2: I think you are in a minority of one, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: not for the first time:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We keep teaching our students that you must have tolerance for all unbid suits unless you are very strong (18+)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: So we are happy to see that Kaye passed 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the italians dont|pg||
nt|henryb:  what is double here? I do not think this is the right hand for it, anyway. It should show a trap pass with much better diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: still, double would have simplified matters on this occasion, it is true - though it would complexify them on others|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well i suppose i have to say well done|pg||

nt|vugraphzzk: double not alerted|pg||
nt|athene: raaa can do|pg||
nt|athene: east, classically, has a pass over the 1@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: but more and more people these days seem to overcall 1@H on hands like that|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: sporting stuff at the other table, but 4@s came close to making|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can she guess the s situation|pg||
nt|mug: horrible imo but some players can't bear to pass|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no way surely|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: we have plenty of them here too - the we-didnt-come-here to pass brigade|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with overcalling 4-card suits with good hands is it's really hard to move forwards thereafter, because you are always worried that you will end in a 4-3 fit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: still, no less an authority than Jeff Meckstroth says that when partner raises your six-card major, you should just bid game in it|pg||
nt|mug: this is typical|pg||
nt|athene: ok, that's one problem :) another problem is your partner just gets you too high anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there yar and the end of the s fit i daresay|pg||
nt|mug: perhaps East can infer the sixth spade opposite now and make the master bid of 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|dburn: mind you, Meckstroth doesn't have much of a record in the Lady Milne trials|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate it|pg||
nt|mug: or should that be mistress bid, perhaps not |pg||
nt|jcomyn: careful|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|eggy: Would he bid 2S with this S hand though?|pg||
nt|mug: now @HAK and a spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mug: just losing two hearts and @SA|pg||
nt|mug: not so good, South will score her @HJ now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

pc|dK|pc|hJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just desserts i'm afraid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: that diamond shift, though reasonable, has assisted the war effort|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rmb1: Jagger/Seale did not bid 4@S on  12, with the auction starting the same way, but without Brock's aggression|pg||

nt|athene: non-vul, there is less reason to go for game like a rabid wolverine|pg||
nt|mug: tens are "good" rather, I dare say being NV tipped the scales, or perhaps they open 14|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: board being played upside down ... difficult for an old operator like me ... I like sitting South-West|pg||
