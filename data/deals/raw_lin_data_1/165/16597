mb|4H|nt|pelu: 3@SX look like -500|pg||

nt|caitlin: a @S lead with continual spades would have been worst lead, pumping declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|frankaus: Brown won the the stage 2 match V Zollo by 31 IMPS and receives 15.5 imps carry forward|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chilloncan: not sure why N bid 1S on thatr minimum in the face of a call  y W which presumably showed spades|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: @h9 a nice surprise for S|pg||
nt|caitlin: true enough|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: director at the table|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ace and ten of spades came on the table on the same time|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: S knows spades are 53 and so played clubs this way as E rebid diamonds|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@SX in open room|pg||

nt|caitlin: E-W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha3: and ten was a penalty card|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so had to be played immediately|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: this 3D preempt is better than opening 5NT|pg||
