mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: heart partscore for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Director called|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Brock's partner did not see the 1H under the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: contract stands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very easily done|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: 6D or 6NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i sympathise|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|rmb1: 3@H by E|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: maybve even 7D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rmb1: That lead should make the play easier for declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: should E  have offerered the bid back, would you?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eggy: I'm not certain of EW agreements for the 2NT rebid, but if it shows this hand i doubt it is a usual treatment|pg||
nt|rmb1: A @H lead can establish a third trick for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: if north leads the @@CJ declarer won't know it's safe to lose the lead|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: but if the lead is something like a strong @C10...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit good for 1D methinks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eggy: Probably not in these days of Key Card Blackwood|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true DQ missing|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eggy: There's a Phil King method that includes a strong 2 in diamonds, otherwise it looks a bit of an underbid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: pity North didnt try to open 1@C in 4rd position|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The Italians use an artificial 2@H reverse, ambiguous|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: question is do you really want to play in 1D even if e is weak and has to pass|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|rmb1: Club finesse and "bid up p" :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|mamos: its been suggested that  North might have made a try here  |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eggy: I'm told that their opening 2NT is 18-19 so 2NT rebid is probably a number of v strong hands not suitable for 2C|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  3N is a better contract. the clue is that E-W have almost all the quacks|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, and their auction did give them a chance to reach it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  quacks, specs, are queens and jacks|pg||

nt|jcomyn: AK|pg||
nt|eggy: not that she needed the @C finesse after T1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i see little wrong in bidding 3d along the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: sorry 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Whatever it's faults, this is one area where the "blunt tool" avoids accidents I suppose|pg||
nt|rmb1: Perhaps South should contrive to make 9 tricks so North doesn't feel so bad|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dilemma for East there  , is there an etiquette?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|rmb1: 10 points all round and 5-4 @D beats 5-4 @C fit|pg||
nt|eggy: For the weak in the knees, East's bid is routine for Gitte (any position and vul)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS 5th and needing every imp|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzzk: w thinking |pg||
nt|yo_yo: or maybe she thought it was a passout too|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eggy: Reflects the respective styles of EW I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: about what i wonder|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: what is being shown i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: She is , frankly, the most, erm, imaginative player I know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: "fearless" ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eggy: Susan is a touch conservative sometimes and Fiona not at all so|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Heather Dhondy a very sympathetic player|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzzk: neither prob sa the 1H nor possibly the dealer marking|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sarah just aint budging|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sorry Teshome|pg||
nt|eggy: and who can blame her?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: thoought it had gone pass pass whne they pushed it back through|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: well she knows p has a 6-card C suit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Good lead for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: excuse spelling |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Current standings at http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|eggy: true, but this looks pragmatic, it would need a lot of black cards for slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the HAK a waste of good cards|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: werll she sees so much of hanlon and mcgann thats is not surprising|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: that looked like a bonus trick|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulhac:  Probably needs to cash a spade and underlead the A@C to beat it|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzzk: 3 made .... not sure how to enter that yet    sry|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: so far the previous round has appeared in scoring page about half way through the next one|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  decent 6@s. needs !q third or shorter or diamond guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: so I hope we will have up-to-date standings soon at: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, they have just been updated|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|paulhac:  Good judgment to show the minor splinter|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or a red suit lead or a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Mind you, huge changes in scores from round 15 - I wonder if there s a glitch somewhere|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Is it a splinter or an artificial raise?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Simon do we know whether 3@C was a splinter or bergen|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: Slam is pretty decent here, since you can try to ruff out the @hQ before trying a @d finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: but I'll be surprised if they reach it|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Card says 10-12 spl I assume Art, 3D 7-9 spl|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surely if 3@c was a Bergen Raise, Brown's 3@d would be asking where the stiff was|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Alternatively you could cash A and K@D and take a heart finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  and if 3@h showed short clubs, Brown should cue 4@d, not 4@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  or just bid 6@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: may just be 10-12, card not easy to read|pg||
nt|henryb:  since KQxx in either red suit and a stiff club makes it cold|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I am told that it was definetly Bergen (by someone who should know!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: card says 3@c 10-12, 3@d 7-9, spl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|idc: One thing I notice from the updated scores is Rosen & Teshome up to 3rd - they started badly but have been crawling their way back|pg||

nt|djneill:  Israel is the place to be on christmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Ed|pg||
nt|eggy: This could be a bit trickier|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 10 made|pg||
nt|eggy: The leaders play almost no method at all|pg||
nt|eggy: Three top pairs pulling away a bit at the moment.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone have abid for the w hand |pg||
nt|paulhac:  At the other table E/W got to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: opening that is|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Pass?|pg||
nt|mamos: well   6@S here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: last hand went  down the other way up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: 2 down, maybe @S ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Change of partners for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing we have an opening bid for 2 minors but not majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: 4d now ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep the pikers out|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is x for takeout|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I seems pessimistic if West now passes|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|jcomyn: well 4S looks but tricky good|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H by N?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odd|pg||
nt|eggy: I've been sent to the other room - have fun and see you later|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aw gee whiz|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Catherine Seale did well to put West to the test|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely 4d is obvious|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Evidently not although it would have been my choice|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Jagger considering a slam. 6@D needs a heart lead to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not easay to get there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: bergen raise?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an| |nt|rmb1: No @S raise by W?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odder|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: e was away from table|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: More than a little in the play I'd have said|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course thats why its tricky|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/65vok4m  standings after round 2|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Alon playing with his father in the first set|pg||
nt|djneill:  interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David Birman now playing with Fohrer in the open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  If West had bid 4@D and North bid a slam wpould we not lead the A@S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that singleton again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: maybe but h more obvious since p known to hold both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok South jumped to 4@s to show a minimum hand, fast arrival|pg||
nt|djneill:  not many losers, but are there 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Things lie pretty well here and the lead doesn't hurt.  Still, declarer has some decisions to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  double finesse in diamonds seems to be the simplest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|othered1: well you still have some entry considerations|pg||
nt|djneill:  that avoids the need for too many ruffs, or possibly even the @c guess if the @h can be used to pitch one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Hasan A. Zaidi|pg||
nt|famus: hi all--merry merry xmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rashed and Hasan!|pg||
nt|famus: hi Ed|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Ed, taking two diamond finesses and the @s finesse means 3 entries, but luckily both diamonds are onside which avoids one of those requirements|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're thinking of pitching @C on @H, are you going to win @HA and finesse J?  GIB would, but GIB peeks.|pg||
nt|dburn: sporting stuff, this, but the final contract is not at all bad|pg||
nt|athene: was 2@C a heart raise?|pg||
nt|dburn: no - 2@c was clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise 3@c would be hard to explain|pg||
nt|athene: i've not met that convention :)|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 3@C might be a game try in hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: now thats really treading on dangerous mines|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it's all that easy to explain anyway, but...|pg||
nt|rmb1: Will they try for slam, only missing 1 key card, but not enough tricks |pg||
nt|jtr: ah I thought east is a sponsor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|djneill:  in these types of hands, I usually try to think about plays which have to be done no matter what, like the diamond finesse, rather than think too deep|pg||
nt|jtr: sorry|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: gppd [;au|pg||
nt|othered1: good play|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Have to alert penalty doubles inEngland|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@c  is a rather odd effort|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: in OR|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Searle back pedalled as she maybe did not have her first bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcomyn: oh well 4-3 better than 6-5 any time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|famus: planning to pitch @cs now|pg||
nt|djneill:  unfortunately if there is no need to ruff a diamond, it presents a losing option in the way to play spades!  double-finesse against East|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 2D a lot better than 2H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eggy: Well all doubles not for take out, in fact|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rmb1: 5@C 0 (or 3) of 4A+@HK.  5@D asking for @HQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Criss cross squeeze unless south leads a @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: depends on the @S play. After taking @HAce |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|djneill:  another attraction to the double finesse is that it puts West on lead after one losing finesse, safeguarding the @c|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer concerned about 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: but as long as East has both aces, that isn't really a worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  updated after round 5|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Gold|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: of course, there's no guarantee that west has the @DK|pg||
nt|dburn: even if West had four hearts to the jack, declarer could draw trumps and play a diamond|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzzk: discussion on bidding before lead |pg||
nt|rmb1: Is it good enough to switch to @C when in with @HA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  yes if East had the @dK, West could always get back to East's hand with it for the @c through|pg||
nt|dburn: but ought to have started with the ten from dummy, not the two|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eggy: Hello David|pg||
nt|dagold: Good evening (from St Moritz)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|dburn: unless she was going to finesse the eight, of course|pg||
nt|jtr: yes true|pg||
pc|hK|nt|djneill:  if kibs believe the @s should have been played Ace and another, then imagine East with KJx (or West with Kxx or Jxx)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink the lines are equivalent ignoring issues like entries and other considerations outside the trump suit|pg||
nt|famus:  Well zack didn't get to hear Dan--tuff choices|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|djneill:  that is a good one, I was not sure about that, always assumed 75% was optimal|pg||
nt|rmb1: Anyway a club so we can not reveal any lack of criss-cross squeeze technique by declarer or me|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  In my methods East is not good enough for 3@c: just a maximum 2@c bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  Also, 4@d over 3@c should be key card in clubs|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Its a 3@C bid for me but I open much lighter than you do Henry|pg||
nt|idc: I like the auction - certainly this is a good start for reaching 7@c |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: Oh, spoke too soon|pg||
nt|paulhac:  3@C shows 3good clubs and 13-15 in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  the reason not to bid 3@c is that 3@c aims at 3NT, and your hand is high cards light for what partner will expect|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Sorry 6 good clubs:)|pg||
pc|dT|mc|13|pg||

nt|djneill:  @sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: N is calling to TD about hesitation|pg||
nt|famus: hesitation on @s10 obviously:)|pg||
nt|famus: if there was any|pg||
nt|djneill:  this may be a variant of the Sominex coup|pg||
nt|djneill:  North puts East to sleep then calls hesitation|pg||
nt|famus: can u describe that coup for us Dan?|pg||
nt|djneill:  I am kidding of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: ok we comntinue now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these are not nice fitting hands at all|pg||
nt|dagold: but 5@d is tough to beat (and bid!)|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe unbeatable |pg||
nt|jcomyn: stilkl with opps bidding majors might get there|pg||
nt|dburn: which was a remarkable thing to do - if it had lost to the jack, the defenders could have taken a club ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: does anyone at Yc now the scores?  Session 5   not overall on web|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|dburn: oh, OK - maybe it didn't really go like that|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other room Henig/Cohen stopped in 4@H+1|pg||
nt|toobad: 4s has chances NS|pg||
nt|eggy: It always seems to me if a slam like that makes on a crossword squeeze, everyone says how brilliant declarer was, wihout questioning why on earth they were in it in the first place ...|pg||
nt|eggy: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: always difficult to wriggle, imo  unless very practised|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|eggy: but that I suppose, is how life works|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hardly now|pg||
nt|dagold: now 2@d-2@h-3@d is quite likely...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: On  17 in the other room, North did not open and (so) EW got to 3@S-1 |pg||
nt|yo_yo: this looks current|pg||
nt|mamos: no way of telling imho that you will make things better   1NT might have been two off  West unlikely to better that|pg||
nt|mamos: West should know long Clubs opposite  she has aces  ..... how many Kings are working in East|pg||
nt|mamos: unlikely to be no play for Grand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she doesnt know about the ;7th @C though|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jcomyn: dont think so|pg||
nt|rmb1: instead we are left with questioning (as politely as possible) why they were in it in the first place|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: there may be a pass in there somewhere|pg||
nt|mamos: she should do  (know about Clubs)  |pg||
pc|dT|nt|dagold: as expected|pg||
nt|dagold: the normal auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agreed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odder|pg||
nt|athene: did it go 1@H 2@C 2@H 3@C 3@S 3N uncontested?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing mousy about that|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine so|pg||
nt|athene: that does seem a slightly weird auction because if 2@C is GF, most would rebid 2@S with east anyway even with min|pg||
nt|athene: and if 2@C isn't GF, 3@C isn't forcing, and then 3@S is a bit of a happy bid|pg||
mc|13|nt|yo_yo: a quiet 4@C might have got there|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|henryb:  no. because then you would open 2@c. Perhaps a forcing 1@d?|pg||
nt|idc: The leap to 6@c is the sort of lazy bid that happens at the end of a long weekend|pg||
nt|idc: Just goes to illustrate how important mental stamina is in bridge|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  1@C is natural or 151-17NT. They open 2@D with 18-19 so rebid 2NT after opening 1 minor with agood hand|pg||
nt|paulhac:  In the minor|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|idc: Both these pairs may have relaxed a little - the maximum IMPs you can gain each match in crossimping is 28|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: So while both are above average, no realistic chance of a top 3 finish|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulhac:  True but the top pairs can also lose 28!|pg||

nt|othered1: 4 isn't my style.  Would rather bid 2 than 4, but 3 looks OK|pg||
nt|dagold: that is not a second seat 4@d in my book, as opened in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still what a foul hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an oul 3NT|pg||
nt|eggy: something must have gone wrong with the play that we saw I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: yes sry missed a trick in hearts near the end .... they were 1 down|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed..numerous undos required|pg||
nt|rmb1: I think -1 was more likely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: then maybe the long clubber can take control|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|djneill:  agreed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: grand slams never easy|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: 3@d is not ideal but closer to the mark|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so where do they end up|pg||
nt|dagold: still, they may end up overboard if Anne bids 3@h as well she might|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as well she will|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: even at the 3-level, you have to push to get into the auction when short in preemptor's suit.|pg||
nt|djneill:  East might infer partner has a singleton @s so not many @s losers|pg||
nt|djneill:  are we going to see another double-finesse in 5@h|pg||
nt|dagold: well facing akjt to seven and out|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: she should pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: North will keep bidding until they reach (at least) 4M|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dagold: she might have passed over the double though|pg||
nt|paulhac:  4@S would appear to be bid often although I would be surprised if more than 1 person made it|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT might help East locate @SQ|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True but maybe they would go wrong in clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is why i think the s bid is daft|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Aggresive certainly|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 4@h making much less likely now|pg||
nt|toobad: no game making?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: its a good way to go foir a large number|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Maybe E/W will get to 3NT now|pg||
nt|rmb1: This url should work http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j - how it works is magic!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 4@C = @H support and long clubs; ofter played as 4-6|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 4N, probably implies two places to play.   so when east converts @C to @D, h e also shows @H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|famus: good if they restrict it to -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: @D+@H now|pg||
nt|dagold: NS off the hook|pg||
nt|dagold: a chance missed|pg||
nt|dagold: a horrible double by north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely W should pass 3H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4voxw2j  for standings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner only bid 2H, just bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 5@hs i         mean|pg||
nt|dagold: can go one off now though|pg||
nt|dagold: at least|pg||
nt|dagold: or make if south makes the mistake of playing the club queen|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 3@h is forcing fo them|pg||
nt|eggy: perhaps the lead of the 8 will give her a clue though :)|pg||
nt|dagold: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: also dont know why E bid after the double. surely NS in trouble|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: you can pitch all the spades on the clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: I agree pass is best I think but easy with sight of the hands|pg||
nt|dagold: now she can make i think|pg||
nt|dagold: pitch heart|pg||
nt|eggy: It didn't apparently|pg||
nt|dagold: take ruffing finness|pg||
nt|dagold: lose just 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: club queen an error|pg||
nt|dagold: oh sorry|pg||
nt|dagold: no ruffing finnese in hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: ace wrong!|pg||
nt|dagold: so 1 off it seems|pg||
nt|eggy: to gain a fortuitous (and undeserved) 2 imps against 1 pair at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  Zack is in auto-double mode|pg||
nt|djneill:  honor location is critical, and all those honors behind the takeout bode well|pg||
nt|toobad: home now|pg||
nt|eggy: or in this case, all the diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no @C ruff so this wont take long|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: dont think he can avoid -2--too much work|pg||
nt|djneill:  shortened @h forces the heart play from that side, rather than @hA and another|pg||
nt|othered1: agree and -2 may take some careful play at that|pg||
nt|famus: and the sing @d doesnt help|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eggy: 3 I should say|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|djneill:  if North keeps playing @s this might make by default with North's @hK skewered, handling problem is those diamonds with the pending ruff|pg||
nt|famus: yep|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  and North will probably infer South has a singleton @d after West's takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: you don't mean make|pg||

nt|dagold: but should play ok|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eggy: Horrid|pg||
nt|dagold: this is a likely scenario and often it will be 100's maybe doubled if south has a spade trap|pg||

nt|yo_yo: if south had opened 1@C  they maybe get there|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulhac:  All will depend on how the trump suit is played|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the late great Mr Monty would shoot you if you opened with that rubbish|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulhac:  Pointed out that running the 8@S at the first opportunity is also an alternativr (may even be better)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Percentage play is low to the jack, then ace next|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Says Professor Burn|pg||

nt|drorp: the contract had a small guessing problem on the 2 way heart finnese, but no more, seems like a flat board as even without the heart lead it seems natural to finnese in @H against ...|pg||
nt|drorp: the one who has the spade void|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Dror, does that affect the odds of the 2-way finesses signficantly?|pg||
nt|drorp: pretty much, especially if u get to explore some of the other suits aswell and see that diamonds are 4-3 to some direction and clubs at worst 5-3 to some direction...|pg||
