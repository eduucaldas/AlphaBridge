pc|s2|nt|psridhar: the inverted raiser if he rebids 3@C it normally shows a min hand NF-here Kris was keen to show that type and helped NS escaoe the 3-3 fit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wd hv preferred a bid of 2@D in S hand with a weak hand-probably Mars thought less chances of 2@h getting Xed|pg||

nt|rodal f: A good round EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: low level NT partials are difficult to defend, unless you have a good lead, it is wise to compete /disturb that 1N at MPs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with that --1NT was a good bid --I think North should compete--2@D or dbl?  |pg||
nt|psridhar: of course safety vs penalty is necessary - here 2@d looked safe from N seat|pg||
nt|psridhar: partner made a t.o X, he shd be able to deal with 2@D |pg||
nt|psridhar: however Ekren was understandably worried about his @C holding sitting 'under' the 1@C opener|pg||
nt|garnetts: Fine if the dbl is shpe suitable--not if partner can have for example AKxx  Kxxx xx Kxx|pg||
nt|psridhar: agree David u do run that risk|pg||
nt|garnetts: But at pairs I would certainly bid--maybe not at imps --also these days 1@C is fairly meaningless|pg||
nt|psridhar: i suppose these players are not  worried about taking risks|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyway I am old fashioned enough not to like unsuitable dbls --not to my taste|pg||
nt|psridhar: from the lead of @H i guess Ekren was thinking along the David's example hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: chose a @h lead when he held a decent 4 card @d suit|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: If he tries 4NT then 5NT to show interest in 7 then west should bid it with the K@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Giorgio:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t think this can lead to 7nt!|pg||
nt|april7: but how to find out about K of @S, asking for aces and then for specifik Kings|pg||

mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hello also my friends commentators|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now 5nt?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A "betong rule" no blackwood:) Thx Tor Ivar.|pg||
nt|april7: critical point!!!|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@C was a cue bid and 5@S implies the A@D --so is a grand slam try|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: dbl at 5@C give the advantage to know if the control is first round or not - my opinion is to pass|pg||
pc|c3|mc|13|nt|bridge_one: probably 5Nt over 5@S asking for a H in @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: asuming the field will not stop short of slam, EW cannot do worse|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: quick round, 6min left|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not easy to bid as mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|sybarra: so we can all make coffee  or whatever|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in my opinion  - with that solid 8-card suit and @sK - why not 5nt?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 5nt wd hv helped|pg||
nt|psridhar: even 6nt wd fetch some MP |pg||
nt|april7: if it asks for @H honours!!!|pg||
nt|psridhar: but 6@H ......|pg||
nt|garnetts: well lets look at the auction--say east bids 4NT RKCB--then 5NT to show that all five key cards are in place--then with the spare k@S  west can either bid 7@H or maybe 6@S in case ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: 7NT can be bid |pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 5Ny means trump problems when all cue are made |pg||
nt|psridhar: 6@H making 7 is abt the worst result u can get |pg||
nt|rodal f: Running results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Ragnsell2011 and the A-group: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Ragnsell2011A|pg||
nt|garnetts: Quite a lot of interest about the 2@S rebid being shown--I like 2NT or 3@C so agree with the specs--mraginally prefer 2NT |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. when he can bid 3 @c or 2 nt with such a good hand (I prefer 3 @c)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think isn't so important to give immediatly the force of hand after a positive bid of partner - the reopen at 5@C is very clear about the hand of East, and with a slowest auction ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: by west they would find the grand slam easy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: it´s rather easy if you put a @s among the @h and open 2nt:)|pg||

nt|psridhar: i think Weast shd describe his hand and East shd control /decide the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt giving balanced hand isn't my preferred bid with a sgl e 4@C|pg||
nt|psridhar: what east bids is irrrelevant as long as he faciltitates W describing his hand|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-15|nt|rodal f: One and two playing.|pg||

mb|3C!|an|!d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|vugraphztc: 3nt seems overly aggressive againt a possible 12 count|pg||
