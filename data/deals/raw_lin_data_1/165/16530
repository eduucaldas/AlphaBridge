nt|Walddk2: Hello Geoffrey and Ian|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all|pg||
nt|eggy: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|idc: We'll be watching a 7 board set, Boards 22-28|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be feisty if south is allowed to open a weak nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|idc: 22 displayed while operator fills in details, but we may begin with any board|pg||
nt|roswolf: really operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Brock passed|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|idc: Quite a good 14 count for South - wouldn't be unreasonable to upgrade it & treat as 15|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: doesnt matter here of course|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|othered1: south can make this, but it's tough to read the position, possibly at the cost of down several more in a normal spot|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|c5|nt|eggy: Will take strong nerves to throw the clubs|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|idc: Indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzj: Sorry got lost in the play ... will put in the result|pg||
nt|eggy: but will be end played anyway, so maybe she should have once East started discarding them|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello David and Paul|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and John|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  at our club that hand would have ended yesterday|pg||
mb|1C|an|alert|nt|djneill:  our club is on the international date line|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|mb|2C|an|alert|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|drorp: some cuebidding here, eventually stopping at 4 or 5 spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: A K @H is missing..|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@d is not a Jacoby 2NT response, would this 2NT be something else?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@D shows extras and the diamond suit, if i understand it correctly|pg||
nt|djneill:  thanks Dror|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@S is asking for shortness|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzxj: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: N need AK @D and K@h as well as K 1s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: might go on now|pg||
nt|drorp: i think his hand is a 5@C bid|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Does anyone have an agreement that 2@C is natural on this auction?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzxj: and he did|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@D should be around 15 points generally|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h lead is pretty well marked, given all this minor jazz|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: S showing Q @S beacuse if the 6th card|pg||
nt|drorp: well, he assumes that his p has a heart cue because it seems like it in the point count, not it will be on zeligman to find the lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|famus: whts 5@s?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|drorp: 2+q, as he knows they have a 10 card fit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  When South shows 2+@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Not i|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzxj: need @H lead here not easy at all|pg||
nt|djneill:  let's end this hand like at my club, Ace lead always|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I bet no @H lead|pg||
nt|famus: probably the 6th @s |pg||
nt|drorp: i think a heart lead is marked on the hand... when you have 4 small diamonds...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drorp: if you don't take them now, you never will|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: well done|pg||
nt|drorp: it will be ptiched on diamonds, not hard to see with 4 diamonds in hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't in this auction, though there are some positions where it should be natural|pg||
nt|jtr: Usual confusion using mud in partner's suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: but when it is the only cue bid, you more or less have to use it as a cue bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  And what would 3@C be?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|idc: but I'm not, so I won't|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that looks an underbid to me by west opposite an unpassed pard|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|othered1: If I bid Landy on east's  hand, partner with equal length would bid @H, playing several tricks less well than @S|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||

pc|cK|nt|idc: But other than that, West marked with two Aces and @sJ, so South likely to have @cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||

nt|djneill:  North can cue-bid @dQ I believe, if South indeed showed @d|pg||
nt|famus: ya-and end at 5@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|famus: with no @h noise|pg||
nt|jcomyn: all gone very quiet|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3C|an|alert|nt|drorp: and you must remember, his p showed supposedly 15+ pts, so by counting points it was almost not possible that he doesn't have atleast @HK|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Did well to stop in 2@S at the other vuegraph table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|drorp: i can understand Zack's view, don't agree with it though, especially if you can bid 3@D with 13 counts because of shape and a 6th spade|pg||
nt|famus: so let him bid the slam|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - West gave East quite a lot of rope for that 2@c overcall (majors)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: which was just as well, since East had quite a lot of old rope|pg||

pc|s6|nt|roswolf: 3rd and 5th leads?|pg||
nt|othered1: double by south certainly is possible, especially if you know opponents tend to respond on anything.  But NS will go nicely plus  with that lead|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: might make south think a bit about her card|pg||
nt|roswolf: indedd|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: not a nice hand to play|pg||
nt|idc: I'm of the school that prefers a raise to 2@h on the West hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|idc: not that 2@h would be a bed of roses to play either|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes now declarer can be endplayed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Must read to cash @D there to get full penalty|pg||
nt|eggy: Do any partnerships "demand" 4 hearts - even if they do 2H is surely right with Aces and shape|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|othered1: south can duck here|pg||
nt|idc: Note that if dummy wins and leads 9, South can simply duck|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: another part score here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: weak no trump here, unlike the other table - and here North-South may start doubling|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jtr: They started|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: or at least South might|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play a pass by North as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: looks like a NT partial|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess a doulbe would be take out|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe North's double of 2@d would be takeout and her pass is forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Presumably double by North would be take-out|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|drorp: seems like flat boards, makes it much harder for herbst team to get back in to the match|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|drorp: the herbests on the other room, knowing their aggressivness, might end up in 3NT here, so it could be a swing|pg||
nt|famus: they need a swing--cos they have another bad board coming up at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: the other room let 3nt makes..but they stay out slam so its 28 now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: birman is running 38-0 this set|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|famus: wanted an honor to drop|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is considering the @hQ dump to get South in - if West had the @hJ, West would have not played @h this way|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: and so is this defence|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|drorp: covering the @C wasn't good, now he has an entry to cash the heart and develop the 2nd spade trick|pg||
nt|drorp: without covering the @c 1NT might've been down after the excellent @C switch|pg||
nt|djneill:  right|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|djneill:  so West should not have covered on the board maybe|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|roswolf: unusual start for some players|pg||
nt|idc: three 10s and favourable vul, seems fine|pg||
nt|idc: East's 2NT may be minors, or some play as any two-suiter|pg||
nt|othered1: is 2N here specific to minors?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: west has an unappetising choice|pg||
nt|eggy: depends on their method - |pg||
nt|eggy: still S has done very well so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: do they know their method - especially their continuations|pg||
nt|idc: SOuth will do whatever is in their system to compete in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: south's not acting seems funny to me.|pg||
nt|idc: or maybe she won't - my prediction rate quickly settling at its usual 0%|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe they don't  have methods like "unusual/unusual" in this position|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think anything could happen here and the red card may be used too|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|idc: Heh, they do say that you should pass as soon as you suspect a misfit|pg||
nt|roswolf: not what east expected i daresay|pg||
nt|eggy: or south I imagine|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: this could be horrible if north ducks her aces appropriately|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||

nt|jtr: Brock must have enjoyed 2NT|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|drorp: yes declearer made a mistake by playing Q@C from hand, would be better to play low and win with the ace, to make sure he has an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|drorp: sorry, from dummy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: Cook did remarkably well not to bid over 2NT - no doubt she was waiting for three of a minor to come round before bidding hearts|pg||

nt|drorp: not sure what Zack is thinking about... maybe he's not sure what 2@H is|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: yeah...I think he must pass...partner didnt duble the 1st time|pg||
nt|dburn: East still trying to bid clubs to show clubs|pg||

nt|djneill:  3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: 3NT has some chance if the defense isn't accurate|pg||
nt|dburn: and West still refusing to believe her|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|drorp: after a spade lead and duck, a diamond switch is necessary|pg||
nt|dburn: here, though, 2@c ought to be natural - 2@h is a cue bid|pg||
nt|jtr: This should play ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: she thought about the alert for a bit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  As long as West discards on the first trick|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, but that creates 5 potential losers|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: i.e. it was a late alert|pg||
nt|jtr: But she cant ruff i agree|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Still makeable if she ruffs but tougher|pg||
nt|jtr: Ruff and play a @c?|pg||
nt|jtr: Now the tempo is with declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about this at all - I don't see how she can make if she doesn't ruff, and I'm not sure what happens if she does|pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: doent matter--a pitch wud be there either way|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Yes, operator please start from scratch|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  maybe the 6th heart though is itself a good thing, South could have had 5, maybe a countertry|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcomyn: some experience in action here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: now a decision from barel, can he beaware of the misfit and bid a mild 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxj: dangerous ..|pg||
pc|d4|nt|famus: 3@hs|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@C puts them in dangerzone, now pass by zack would be best|pg||
nt|drorp: or they're in trouble|pg||
nt|drorp: and with doubles aswell|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: hard to pass I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi david |pg||
nt|dburn: unwilling to open a weak two bid with four hearts - or maybe not playing weak two bids at all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: Hi John|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzxj: now pass is best:)|pg||
nt|drorp: last chance to pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: lol|pg||
nt|famus: hmmm...danger zone|pg||
nt|drorp: he will either pass or bid 4@H|pg||
nt|drorp: or maybe 3@S? :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  Zeligman likes 3@s|pg||
nt|famus: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I bet he pass|pg||
nt|drorp: he kinds gave away his hand with the 3@C bid, the question to me is, is 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: good question|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@h cannot be forcing unless 3@c is forcing, no?|pg||
nt|famus: is it?? dont think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: but he knows there is missfit and partner is about 10-13 hcp|pg||
nt|drorp: it's matter of agreement... i think 3@C defentley shows extras and is 90% forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I think its nf|pg||
nt|djneill:  and is 3@c forcing if 2@h is nonforcing, was 1@s forcing?|pg||
nt|drorp: 1@S and 2@H are defenitley NF :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@d is forcing in my book, on someone |pg||
nt|drorp: Barel will take his time here... i think he'll bid 4@H, that's my feel|pg||
nt|djneill:  what's the worst that could happen|pg||
nt|famus: this is goin the 4@h route-- i think--too much thinking is obviously the forc--non forc thoughts|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: deep thinking|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@H might go undoubeled|pg||
nt|drorp: and it does have 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be a good time for an aggressive Zelig double|pg||
nt|drorp: spade 5 hearts and 2 clubs, and a some possibilities to make a 9th trick through a diamond ruff or some club developing|pg||
nt|famus: he has 9 alright|pg||
nt|djneill:  @hJ itself is a great filler card, problem is of coruse it will be used to ruff, but not so bad if partner AKxxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: he can duck the @C then finesse..but still 4@h will go down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: somnething odd here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I won!|pg||
nt|dburn: this all seems rather unllikely|pg||

nt|jtr: E/W bidding i imagine|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Have we got the wrong board|pg||
nt|jtr: But South's silence seems odd|pg||
nt|dburn: no - just a pass missing by South at the start of the auction, I guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|djneill:  trump lead would be bad if Barel void and pd Qxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: intresting play..must be very carefull|pg||
nt|famus: yes-got to take@sa AND PULL A @C|pg||
nt|famus: small from dummy|pg||
nt|drorp: must take A@S now or he can't see it i think|pg||
nt|drorp: at the other table north passed 3@C, good decision and 3@C made a bit more easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: 3@C is good result for birman team|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: and there is some more on the next boards|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulhac:  South afraid to open 2@S with 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like a good result for E/W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|famus: he has to pitch a @d on @sA and pull a small @c for the second @d pitch later|pg||

nt|djneill:  in which case, better not to set up the @dJ|pg||
nt|drorp: this 6 more imps to birman team probably ends the match, 4 boards to go, other table already played 3 of them, and birman team had decent/good scores there aswell|pg||
nt|famus: but to set up @dj is after the 5th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: yes|pg||

nt|idc: I can live with flawed weak twos at times (e.g. xxxx @hs or in 3rd seat) but vul in 2nd seat with KJxx in other major is too much for me|pg||

mb|p|pc|h2|nt|othered1: Levin-Weinstein use the F convention on BBO (and elsewhere)|pg||

nt|othered1: could west have made this if she didn't ruff the @H at trick 3?|pg||
nt|idc: Ishe had tried to steal a @c trick, defenders can continue @c when SOuth gets the @d|pg||
