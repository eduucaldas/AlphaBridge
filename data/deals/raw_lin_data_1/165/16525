mb|p|nt|viren169: Morning all|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Who will open the bidding?  S or W?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: south influenced by the adverse colours|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|dburn: not quite clear what East ws influenced by, but whatever it is, she should take less of it|pg||

nt|roswolf: a common feeling!!|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Hardly East's fault that West elected to pass |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dburn: West had the world's most obvious pass - she had opened in third seat, and a 2@c response by a passed hand does not show four clubs and a nine count|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but 2@S clearly was not too attractive|pg||

nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: well, they need to be applied below the seven level, it is true|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: slam is well in the contemplation of this e/w and wont be easy to play|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: better play it in notrump rather than spades, mind|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not easy to play in hearts by East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: need to applied to game level  because  of bad breaks in majors|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@H was the contract i was thinking of|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, you'd make 6NT David, I'm sure|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Notrumps not realistic when you have a 5-4 and 5-3 in the majors|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobholl: 6@S X down on @H ruff (lightner)|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps, but it is not impossible that West could count five spade tricks, five hearts and @cAK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|nt|dburn: of course, she might discover that @sQ was missing and stop in five spades, down|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: you might make 6NT  but first you have to bid it with 2 good major suit fits and then not an automatic make|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: heart ruff was obvious|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I think some pairs now rebid 2NT with West's hand, having agreed it may contain four card spade support |pg||

mb|1H|nt|rmb1: Another slam Roland would be proud of - played by West to avoid the ruff|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a good slam...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nikce breaks in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|viren169: A of @D and still need to find the Q@S|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you rebid - just 4@S ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no too good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and thats that|pg||
nt|viren169: tough bid over 1@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: make a noise|pg||
nt|viren169: Unless you have a gadget or two to cover these types of hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just allow space for e to bid again|pg||
nt|rmb1: What do you suggest John|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 2NT|pg||
mb|6H|nt|viren169: East is there... now it will be hard to stay out of slam.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is unfairly unlucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: even with s 4-1 rest lie nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 6@H is better than 6@S as the cards lay|pg||
nt|rmb1: It has to be a @S lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|viren169: Tough lead to find. I fancy this to make.|pg||
nt|rmb1: and it sounds like @S are 4-4 in which case its dangerous to lead|pg||
nt|viren169: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Doesn't need to find @DA just @SQ - likely to play for @S length with N after trump break|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tom Townsend|pg||

pc|hA|nt|tlc: dinah did well to avoid and aggressive t/o dbl over 2@s...there was no good resting spot had she done so|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that finding West with HKJ represents the best chance doesn't it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mug: a fascinating deal|pg||
nt|rmb1: Some one might run from a lightner double - even to the making 6NT|pg||

pc|h3|nt|lml: hi|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|viren169: or run back to 4M!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mug: Nicole Cook might have doubled 6@H for a spade lead, then again it would be silly to drive opps into 6NT when Christine Duckworth was going to lead a spade from five anyway|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: Here East would rebid 3@H, then West 3@S (or 4@C) - but still not easy to get to slam unless West gets out the driver|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: might get to high unless Q@S lead against 4@H|pg||
nt|dburn: scary opening bid, but she will survive|pg||
nt|ady: have stopped safely|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a safe level|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11-14 is the preferred range i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: still, North may well lead a spade against a game - against a part score, a trump probably safer|pg||

nt|Walddk2: On board 3 in the other room, Catherine Seale is in 6@H|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Easly Blackwood wrote an excellent book on opening leads - devoting a whole chapter to why leading from QJx was poor |pg||
nt|dburn: so far so good, but I hope South has encouraged clubs, otherwise that spade might get played anyway|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chessmaste: Perhaps West would have run to 6NT - and she would make that |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: e/w likely to get to 3NT     may find it tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy to make 3NT if West plays it|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: @D lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's true, Mark, but you won't get a spade lead if you don't double so perhaps you should risk it|pg||
nt|dburn: not when West has opened the suit, I don't think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I agree totally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Scary :)|pg||
nt|dburn: you might get a spade lead if you don't double - perhaps partner will have enough of them to figure it out anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: 7@C could cost|pg||
nt|ady: now the club suit can produce 3 tricks if west gets it right|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it could - if declarer knows it's second best from a bad suit, no harm in playing @cA next|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: South should probably shift to diamonds - after all, partner almose certainly has five of them|pg||
nt|ady: south's switch best|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: Still, three club tricks might not be enough now South has played a diamond|pg||

nt|viren169: Tom, Dont some of the the Italians players weak NT?|pg||
nt|mug: there was a debate in English Bridge, I was for the Strong NT, the outcome was 87% for the Weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: no Gad|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eggy: I may be wrong, but I think that's what Lizzie told me a couple of weeks back|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|viren169: Ummmmmmmmm|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: this is a hand where east could have led from 3 suits|pg||
nt|mug: ah unless you mean Fantunes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: but they play a specialized system|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: I guess they are no longer represent Italy!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mug: so my original answer was accurate|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
nt|mug: good board for the STRONG NT here|pg||
nt|viren169: They just happen to be  1 and  2 in the world currently.|pg||
nt|mug: North didn't know about West's diamonds, and led them|pg||
nt|mug: declarer still needs to find a trick or two from somewhere though|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|viren169: looks like 3rd and 5th throughout|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mug: spade to the jack now, perhaps?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|tlc: a spade lead was the best lead, but this should lead to down 1 if everyone is careful|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|eggy: Well East won't switch to a small heart now anyway|pg||
nt|mug: best now is a heart to break up the pressure on partner|pg||

nt|roswolf: club preemption may help n/s here|pg||

mb|3D|nt|roswolf: or even game perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: my guess is 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: south may try 4@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C would be my choice|pg||
nt|ady: but north has nothing really to add|pg||
nt|chessmaste: So, 4@C - 4@D - does South try 4@H?|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|d|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i dont like these kind of doubles just gives opps more bidding space|pg||

mb|1C|an| |nt|mug: double or 1@H?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of competition here i darsay|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|lml: I was thinking about whether I would open 1NT or 1C|pg||
nt|tlc: not if down 4|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|an|3 spades|nt|jcomyn: thought you never open 1nt on 5-4-2-2|pg||
nt|rmb1: Support double|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D anyone?|pg||
nt|mug: a hand for all seasons|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gad y|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: do you like 1NT with Qx and Qx.  We do but I like more in the doubletons and less in the long suits|pg||
nt|tlc: i'm a big fan of slightly offshape NTs, but not with 5@C-4@s..rebids are too easy|pg||
nt|mug: must expect 5@D to be close, but wouldn't mind defending a lot of doubled spades either given the option |pg||
nt|viren169: redbl now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: 3@D would have been an underbid|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mug: as the cards lie NS can make slam in diamonds|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@D by North instead of 2@D or 3@D by South instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly go on now|pg||
nt|mug: South is worth game in diamonds|pg||
nt|viren169: Getting into the grey area now...|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|eggy: I'm not a fan, but probably in the miniority|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yesd hard to see where 11 tricks come fromn|pg||
nt|mug: 4@D ought to be forcing|pg||
nt|rmb1: and a slam try?|pg||
nt|viren169: should be slam try (at least!)|pg||
nt|mug: well partner appears to have five diamonds, make a few diamond tricks and ruffing, and some more tricks from the majors, what's the problem?|pg||
nt|mug: now North can try 4@S|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Cook would prefer to hear 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: anyway, I imagine all roads lead to ROme|pg||
nt|eggy: Though I expect that RW prefers 6H|pg||
nt|tlc: seems like 12 tricks are available|pg||
nt|lml: yes but it does need quite a favorable trump position|pg||
nt|lml: and probably the club finesse|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -KJ108 not the best for slam|pg||
nt|eggy: so a little worse than 34%|pg||
nt|tlc: yes,, but the right way to play the suit in abstensia|pg||
nt|lml: no its a bit too good for a Roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzk: Pause as declarer put her hand down thinking she was dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if you get hearts right I still think you need the club finesse.|pg||
nt|lml: you can't ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|tlc: y, u would...but all is well|pg||
nt|eggy: easily good enough with the cards as they are!1or a club diamond squeeze|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but will she|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: yes it does all work but they are in the right place|pg||
nt|eggy: which also works a a Show up squeeze here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we all know if u are in slam the KJ108 will be in the E hand|pg||
nt|lml: either hand will do|pg||
nt|tlc: and the club's off|pg||
nt|mug: you can take a horse to water etc|pg||
nt|rmb1: Erichsen in other room bid 3@D on first round as North|pg||
nt|mug: not that I'm comparing any of our last trialists to members of the equine species|pg||
nt|viren169: 3@D looks about right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: given the auction I think they did well to get to 5D|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mug: but North's hand was pretty good relative to what she'd show already, she could afford to show her spade control, the six good diamonds were huge|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Cook was going to drive to game whatever!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eggy: quite e few x squeeze chances too, but I think we agree in principle - it's a rubbish slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: reminds me of the sheinwold explanation of the rule of eleven - the number of tricks you make when you bid slam|pg||
nt|eggy: They were more conservative in those days :)|pg||
nt|tlc: i think it's about a 17% slam, plus mb some sqz chances|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|tlc: a claim coming soon|pg||
nt|mug: 3@D or 2@D on the first round depends a bit on doubling style|pg||
nt|mug: I think I prefer Helen's choice of 3@D but 2@D was not a mistake|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@D allow you to bid the spots of the cards afterwards. 4@S was clear cut.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: now shes thinking about slam :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||

nt|tlc: lol|pg||
nt|lml: she had to hold on to dummy's hearts|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe thats too tough single dummy|pg||
nt|lml: when West returns a diamond she has to rise ace and then there is a kind of winkle|pg||
nt|mug: I think 5@C exclusion was in order over 3@D|pg||
nt|mug: or simply void showing, in either case reaching the decent slam|pg||

nt|viren169: 3@C?!?!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mug: a bit wet to pass, but in accordance with the classical rule of 500|pg||
nt|rmb1: Constructive weak two (?)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am not passing that s hand|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a normal 3@C to me by Cook|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the 9 sets up I believe but I need to look at it|pg||
nt|eggy: Wasn't dummy entryless though?  I thought a winkle was only for overcoming blocked suits|pg||
nt|tlc: good hand to be playinggood/bad 2NT...|pg||
nt|lml: yes if east gets in she has to give dummy a heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: NS found an 8 card minor fit anyway|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy to find heart fit after 2@S|pg||

nt|jcomyn: whats wrong with 1S allowoing space|pg||
