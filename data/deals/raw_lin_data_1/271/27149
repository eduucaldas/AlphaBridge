nt|fluffy: if it was needed|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|idc: Interesting slam chances - 6@c ok by either hand but best by North when you can perhaps guess on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  @H lead here holds south to 11 tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|2C!|an|4+D no major|nt|pdjourdain:  though he can make 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: 2@c is not what I'd expect, maybe a diamond bid with 2@d being the inverted minors one?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|fluffy: ahh they play transfers over 1@c, but 1@s as diamonds its not avaible for some reason|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@c is probably natural, but also denying 3@d raise|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  On heart lead has to play @D as 3-3 to make 12.|pg||
nt|fluffy: kibitzer explains 1@s is transfer to 1NT so never strong, and 1NT is the inverted raise|pg||
nt|fluffy: @d3-3 or an unlikelly miracle of @cA stiff wich is not going to happen on the bidding|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|idc: If the bidding in other room is to be trusted West doubled a 4@h bid by South|pg||
nt|idc: Nothing wrong with the odd psychic lead directing dbl but N-S would have been happy to see @hK in East after they stopped in 5@c|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|fluffy: 3@h is probably a club raise, otherwise biding 3@d, notice that 2@c denied 4cM|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Having tried to sign off in 3NT, South is pretty suitable for slam now|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|fluffy: Rees missed an oportunity to double 3@h not only is this bad for west guess, it might also induce west to lead a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: since the lack of double|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  An odd chance is East with @DJ10 and @CAx as he has to ruff two winning @Ds|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:  No, as he can still make six even on a heart lead, particualrly if East has doubled|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes, if he doubled things change|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fluffy: but without the double I would insta play low heart from dummy|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fluffy: if opponent leads a heart instead of a spade with no clue from the bidding, he is likelly leading for a reason IE @hK|pg||
