mb|4C|nt|fluffy: shields doesn't supect that he has very easy 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: because his partner just showed 10+, not his powerhouse|pg||

nt|fluffy: could be brutal to score a slam after you passed out 3NT, certainly haven't seen it ever|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  especially to bid it in a suit unmentioned previously |pg||
nt|fluffy: but now I see it, 6@c is not making|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cs bad break produce too few tricks I think|pg||
