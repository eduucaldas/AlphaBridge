nt|vugraphzce: yes it was David :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: "many ways to nine tricks" says Kamil|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubting Jan -- very dangerous position to take|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: I am sorry -- but it was "the Kamil way" to nine tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: the right way -- the wrong way -- the kamil way|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: 2@H = @hs and a minorsuit|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Again, no penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  What do these guys need to double a weak 1NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what range 1N opener?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told 14-16|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  East could fear the 2@S take-out, and decide to show his distribution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW use Penalty DBL only if average of opening range <=14|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|ady: has the look of -100|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: going back to last statement -- it is very important when playing different conventions over opponent's 1N  to define exactly when the opening is weak vs strong|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|pc|s8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: some use average of range, total of range [13-15=28], top of range or bottom of range  -- but make the effort to define something!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  If the opponents play in-between (like 14-16), I discuss it with my partner before we start playing|pg||

pc|d4|pc|c5|pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: or maybe @S2 was discouraging |pg||
nt|Psyck: 2 unlikely as would give North 5|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: indeed so. Still early for counting in England|pg||
nt|mdgraham: particularly on the morning after an England rugby win|pg||
nt|thorvald:  I think it is interesting that the tournament is lead by Barel - Zack but with only 0.55 imp pr board on average, so with 5 rounds left still up to 8 pairs that can win this tournament|pg||
nt|Psyck: Zia-Boya are not placed at a position one would expect them to be|pg||
nt|thorvald:  This is imp pairs, but as we only have results from 2 tables it is set up as a team match - 8 other boards to compare with|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Hmm, perhaps North thought that South thought that north had shown both majors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: it could be a "fast board" -- 3 boards left after this one -- 18 minutes left of this round|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  4@s shows a five card suit in my book|pg||
nt|nilsland:  some play that 4N in these situatiomns is invitation to slam and not RKC|pg||
nt|ady: declarer should play spades early  to cater for 4-1 split|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: E asks if S is going to think for a long time -- and now E leaves -- restroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so it might not be a "very" fast board :)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|thorvald:  After 3 @s you can use 3NT from North as serious/unserious slam try. So it seems ok to let 3@s be any 3-card support, and a jump to 4@s show - I regretted opening 1 NT|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Now, I was surprised to see north bid 2@H here only|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room(s) and voice commentary available without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ady: 1NT overcall with flat 15  dangerous    would rather double    at least still only at the 1 level when partner is weak|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Anyway, Bakhshi's 2@h bid worked out just fine - well bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told by very reliable source -- Bakhshi could NOT DBL for penalty|pg||
