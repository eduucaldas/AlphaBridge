nt|W I T H:  right, especially with KQ in @C and Qx in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: here you will see just one more example of that theory, 20+11 without fit is no slam|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fluffy: south is overbidding IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|W I T H:  a lucky overbid|pg||
nt|fluffy: is this the muppet convention? I m not familiar with it, but I know there is something where 3@h denies 5@s or 4@h and 3@d shows 4+ hearts or something|pg||
nt|fluffy: yes this is the muppet thing|pg||
nt|W I T H:  the danger of bidding 2NT is that you will never have a chance to show your @D|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@c is probably natural, and north will surelly realice his hand is wonderful for slam... but in diamonds|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|W I T H:  hard for S to imagine his p holds 6 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|adonis18:  with a @s lead 6@c comes down to less than 16%|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the normal meaning of 4@d here is to show a cuebid in support for clubs, remmeber that after denying 4c Major south thinks you will 90% have support for clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|W I T H:  oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they had a disagreement somehow|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps 4@d kickback?|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: kickback is the best RKC optio by a good amount|pg||
mc|12|nt|fluffy: for 4NT to be taken as natural south must have though 4@d was kickback (key card blackwood in clubs)|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: bid were optional |pg||
nt|fluffy: and as I said at the start.... bid north's hand as 23 and your troubles are gone|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: w'ere waiting for the next round to start|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this problem stems from opening NTs with good suits in offshape hands....  its rarely correct to open 2NT (or2@C-2@D//2NT) with a good 6-card minor|pg||
nt|fluffy: I disagree Walter, not because 2Nt is great, but because of lack of alternatives, I would rather show 23 balanced than a big hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|fluffy: but there is obvious many examples where you are right :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is not something extremelly clear, you can convince me the other way around without much effort|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand is worth mor than 22 definitely|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: there is still a few tables that are playing the current round|pg||
nt|Henryb:  FWIW, K-R says 22.1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm surprised its not a bit more...  eally banging the KQ and Q9 becaue i know it LOVES the AK109xx|pg||
nt|Henryb:  As do you and I @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzas: we'll start the next round soon|pg||
nt|Henryb:  If you swapped the two queens for the @hA, it would be over 24|pg||
nt|Henryb:  the two short queens|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 24.35|pg||
nt|fluffy: and what about just @cAQ instead of KQ?|pg||
nt|fluffy: protected doubleton queen gotta be good|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 23,3|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Which high card do you want to take away? the @sJ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 22,50 substracting @sJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: none, but means KQ vs AQ its only 1.2 HCP, I would have said 1.5 or so|pg||
nt|bigtrain: short suit...  would have a  bigger impact with length|pg||
