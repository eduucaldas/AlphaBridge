mb|p|mb|1N|nt|CopeyJ: The auction next door I imagine 2@S after the 1@C-1@H-2@H start was probably a relay, asking Townsend for more information. Townsend decided his hand was more suited to NT than @H|pg||
nt|dburn: similar deal to the first of the set, but this time they have 12 facing 13, and game is a rather better proposition|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|dburn: Spears taking a similar view, rebidding 1NT rather than raising hearts|pg||

nt|dburn: the latter, and quite right too|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead   looks as though will be flat|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he did what I would have done - usually a recipe for disaster|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: that allows partnership to find extent of @H fit  and when 52 -- extent of @S fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|dburn: 6@h is OK - about the same as 6NT - but Gold will be perplexed by all this|pg||
nt|dburn: and try 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6@S not a terrible single dummy contract -- but looking at EW hands ....|pg||
nt|dburn: that is not OK, but Forrester may correct anyway|pg||
