nt|JanM:  Zia taking his cross ruff tricks before they disappear - so, 3 side aces, one trump trick and 4 ruffs. |pg||
nt|Psyck: thats a reasonable estimate|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: EW at this table in  2 at the moment -- the leaders (Barel-Zack) are sitting EW in the closed room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Psyck: that have caught up half way with half the boards played|pg||
mb|d!|mb|r|nt|jesperdall:  1NT = 7-15 hcp ? :)|pg||
nt|JanM:  DBL probably a 4 card Major, longer minor|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Excuse me, 7- 17 hcp!|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Now E alerts the DBL -- saying it shows a Minor and a Major |pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Woolsey|pg||
nt|JanM:  Wonder why N didn't RDBL to start going after them?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and Boye Brogeland has got the chance to change his bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|JanM:  Ah, now he can RDBL, after getting the information about the DBL. Maybe if DBL was penalty his RDBL would be running|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: E didnt alert the DBL before N had bid PASS -- then E alerted -- and N changed the bid to a RDBL|pg||
nt|JanM:  Looks as if 2@c is down 1 or 2 and 2@d (if E runs) isn't any better|pg||
nt|JanM:  E may be thinking about running to his partner's Major - 2@s doesn't seem to be an improvement on 2@c|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Predictions, Ladies and gentlemen: How many tricks?|pg||
nt|JanM:  The fact that E thought about running might have helped N decide not to lead a trump|pg||
nt|Psyck: looks like at least 6 losers|pg||
nt|JanM:  Now a spade shift?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|JanM:  Well done|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Psyck: yes nice def, maybe two down now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|JanM:  Declarer can now lead a heart to dummy to play clubs, but does he know it's right to play the K? I guess so|pg||
nt|Psyck: can get 3@c & a @s more|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: a lot of photographers at the table|pg||
nt|JanM:  If declarer doesn't get tapped out here, he can give up a spade and eventually take his 7th trick with the @s9, holding it to -1|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Yes but I think the xx in @D made 1C more attractive even so|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and he was right :)|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think the 4-4 in majors made 1@c more attractive: someone, perhaps Ron Anderson, wrote that one should avoid opening 1N with both majors|pg||

nt|JanM:  He has a good hand and partner did bid 1@s freely, so should have some values, and he hadn't yet shown 4 @ss, would have bid 2@s with 3 of them|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  What does PASS by Zia in 3rd hand show, I wonder?|pg||
nt|JanM:  But also made it easy for EW to find hearts - Let's see, after 1@s, West would DBL and N bid some spades and EW would still probably get to hearts and possibly, as here, too high|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  Auch!|pg||
nt|JanM:  Oops - the problem might have been that not only was Zia light, but the DBL of 1@h showed 4 or more spades, so they might have had a 9 card fit. Still, it's a lot easier to take 4 tricks than to take 10|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: I will keep the room open --- there is still an appeal that might have some effect on the final result|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: but lets see -- the closed room is the only table not finished yet|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  looking at the results - Jan, did West consider doubling on board 25?|pg||
nt|JanM:  From what we saw this round, it seems very likely that first and second won't change from last round. We don't know about lower places|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: not at all|pg||
nt|JanM:  Brogeland and Zia will likely manage to finish last - I'm hoping that means Zia has saved up all of his luck for the Vanderbilt in three of weeks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: at board 25 Michel Bessis passed in normal tempo all the times he had the chance|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Still recuperating from the last section - who said bridge is boring? ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: It didnt seem to me that he considered double|pg||
nt|Psyck: he didnt want to be defending 3@s instead of 3@h i guess|pg||
nt|JanM:  Doubled contracts on 4 of the 8 boards seems like enough!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Still, Zia passed a forcing bid at  25...|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: One table is still playing -- Askgaard-Bjarnarson against Welland and Sabine Auken|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 32  Zack was down 1 in 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so it will take a minute or two before we have the result -- and still -- there is an appeal that might effect the final result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in this room 32  was 4@DXW +710|pg||
nt|Psyck: As mentioned earlier, the operator will let us know the final standings here soon.  They will also be put up here after a while: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Tur...|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: still one table playing|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  While waiting, we are discussing board 25 - should West have doubled 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so still we are going to wait for the final result.|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: My best guess:|pg||
nt|vugraphzce:  1: Michael Barel - Yaniv Zack|pg||
nt|vugraphzce:  2: Thomas Bessis - Michel Bessis|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: and then the rest is much more difficult to predict|pg||
nt|Psyck: there was certainly a good case to double on 25, you have reason to hope 3@s if they run there would also go down & at that vul, you need to do something...|pg||
nt|JanM:  All Jans think alike - I agree that the top 2 are almost certainly Barel-Zack and Bessis-Bessis, but who knows about the rest|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  No matter who wins, it's been a pleasure to look over the shoulders of some of world's best players - and best BBO operators! Thx, Jan.|pg||
nt|JanM:  Yes, thanks all!!|pg||
nt|Psyck: Thanks everyone, it was a good show.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes well done Jan and Soeren!!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  And Thx to my fellow commentators - well done!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Israeli pairs won  Cavendish, Slava Cup Pairs [held this week in Moscow] and Copenhagen Invitational   what is next conquest?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and danish bridge federation!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Christina Lund Madsen and Flemming Boegh , exellent work|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bbo vugraph back in denmark next weekend|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jesperdall:  I have +6 imps for EW on the first board|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 2@d = multi -- showing either @hs or @ss|pg||
nt|JanM:  In 3rd seat favorable, Brogeland would probably open 2@d (multi) with the N hand, but not in second I think. So NS may have trouble getting into the auction - uncomfortable for S to DBL 1@c with only 2 hearts, and N doesn't have enough to bid |pg||

nt|vugraphzce: yes|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|JanM:  Definitely a confused auction|pg||

nt|JanM:  Will they be able to stop here? I don't think they can make anything higher.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Multi-confusion - highly entertaining!|pg||
mb|p|nt|JanM:  And I suppose I'll have to withdraw my objection to 2@d if it pushes EW into a silly contract, but I still think in second seat it's a little too pushy|pg||
