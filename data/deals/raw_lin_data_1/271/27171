nt|KingCur: But remember this is a butler scored tournament|pg||
nt|KingCur: so results from other table are only one of the results you score against|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: there are 8 results on every board...|pg||
mb|3D!|an|10+ !H fit|mb|4S|nt|KingCur: W probably blasting in his @S suit now|pg||
nt|adriaantje: other table decided to sacrifice against 6@H on this board, which was not a fortunate decision as 6@H was not on (but W may as well have though 6@S may have been on)|pg||
nt|KingCur: but 6@S a good safe against 5@H... :)|pg||
nt|KingCur: save*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: it was kind of a safety.. if 6@H was on it will loose many imps|pg||
nt|adriaantje: that's true|pg||
nt|KingCur: I'd bid 5@C now with N, to give S a decision should opps bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: ten Kate might be thinking about slam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|KingCur: obviously, N is unaware of the huge fit in @H|pg||
mb|5S|nt|KingCur: 3@D usually showing 4 or 3card support, after all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: 11 tricks in @S is quite a good nr of tricks.. I am sure some will only make 10|pg||
mb|6H|mb|6S|nt|adriaantje: south probably extremely tempted to try 6@H now, which doesn't seem crazy|pg||
nt|KingCur: tough decision now for S: he obviously has a huge fit, but also an aceless hand|pg||
nt|KingCur: tactical aspect though, is that non vulnerable opps will often go for safety against a vulnerable slam|pg||
nt|KingCur: as they have done|pg||
nt|adriaantje: in imps, certainly|pg||
nt|adriaantje: MPs would make that an other story but we're not playing (watching) that today|pg||
nt|KingCur: yes, at matchpoints, this is a very different decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|KingCur: not sure if the pass by N indicates anything|pg||
nt|adriaantje: ('an other story' translated too literally from Dutch)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: it's forcing :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzae: so probably willing to bid on :)|pg||
nt|KingCur: very often, a double is used to show you're not looking at a first round control in the opponent's suit bid|pg||
nt|adriaantje: if N leads the @HA now he'll be baffled :)|pg||
nt|adriaantje: although it doesn't cost him a trick|pg||
