nt|vugraphzce: I am not a "gamble" -- so I'll not put any money on |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzce: 2nt = minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|jesperdall:  Good question - surely he and Boye have too much pride for that position|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: 3@C=to play|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @C getting a lot of screen time today|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: Kamil limited by failure to make competitive bid in @H over 2N|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Double was take out, I guess - I would have bid 4@h as south|pg||
nt|nilsland:  North will double again|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: Information: The players have put the board on the table with N as Kamil and S as Fleisher|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he does not know S has 6H, but S will then bid 4H|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so its "turned around" in this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: just for your information :)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzce: so it is Marty Fleisher declaring 4@h in this board|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nilsland:  4D was "pick a major"|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Surprised to see that bid|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West is sorry it wasnt spades :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what do you think about 4@C instead of Baldursson's 3@C|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Pressure bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my thought is that Baldursson KNOWS that opponents have a @H fit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  This will make even if declarer takes the finess|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jesperdall:  Perhaps he hoped to buy it at the three level|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  How, Mats?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he hoped -- but was it reasonable to hear 3@C-all pass|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nilsland:  by an endplay Jesper|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|chmitty: it'ssuggested that West wins the 1st @s trick with the Ace !|pg||
nt|chmitty: would be nice indeed|pg||

nt|chmitty: :)|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzce: 2@h showing 5+@cs and 4@hs|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jonsson's sequence is encouraging  [as opposed to pure signoff]|pg||

nt|OleBerg:  If not, the declarer has all side tricks, and simply sets up hearts|pg||
