nt|yorkbeach:  a cross ruff looks best|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to ruff hearts otherwise|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and a lack of entries to set up and enjoy the long @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North follows to the third club, declarer will have the option of discarding a diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is slightly worried that South is short in @c will be overruffing, though North's known heart length increases the chance South has longer clubs|pg||
