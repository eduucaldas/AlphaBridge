nt|fluffy: the actual names are Lantaron-Goded and Nowosadzski-Kalita|pg||
nt|fluffy: nowosadski and Lantaron-Goded won the envent last year playing on the same team|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow some excitement, starting with a redoubled contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fluffy: ruffina diamond in dummy will mean 5@h, 2@s, 2@d 1@c for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|fluffy: all that declarer needs to do now is to be sure that north doesn't win the club defensive trick to give them a ruff|pg||
nt|fluffy: on the previous board they bid and made 7NT with a vey natural bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@d was jsut natural and forcing (6+@d slam try)|pg||
nt|fluffy: and Goded decided that @dKQ was a very suitable support so bid a 3@h value showing implying fit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|fluffy: the redouble of 3@h meant first round control of hearts (thus no @hAQ lose from the start) and next blackwoood|pg||
nt|fluffy: 5NT was not specific king ask as many pairs play now, but 'Extra trick' ask, and Goded showed 2 extra tricks (2 Kings) enough for 7NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer's comunication is a bit messy here|pg||
nt|fluffy: maybe he will need to do a club finese to bring the contract home|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: this is because the second spade trick cannot be made |pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|fluffy: if declarer ruffs a diamond in dummy he is locked down there|pg||
nt|fluffy: and needs to tap himself in clubs to draw trumps|pg||
nt|fluffy: that works however, because @cQ is third|pg||
nt|fluffy: so all in all I think there is no line that goes down now|pg||
nt|fluffy: he might eventually score @c10 instead of @sK that's all|pg||
nt|fluffy: Lantaron is finding a way to make the contract if south has @cKQxx, bu I think there is none|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps tapping himself|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fluffy: he goes strainght for the finese|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|fluffy: will pitch second spade on the club|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually 2 spades when @cJ wasn't covered|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: and now 3@s does actually show 6 cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fluffy: with only aces Goded is happy to be able to play in a suit contract rather thn NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: as you can see declarer will cash the 3 aces fom dummy quickly probably|pg||
nt|fluffy: @dA, @hK @cA @hA|pg||
nt|fluffy: pitching the diamond|pg||
nt|fluffy: and then perhaps tackle clubs|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fluffy: PATTON is a mixed scoring between BAM and IMPs, where half of the VPS each match come from BAM scoring (whoever scores more wins the board) and half of them come from a IMP scale ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: table|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is meant to show both majors|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|fluffy: I know that playing with Goded (my father) we have had a lot of troubles mixing 2@d and 2@c over 1@c|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: here Goded has a lot of diamonds so can't go wrong|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|fluffy: to make this declarer needs to guess hearts and go for ruffing 2 in hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: actually not, if he tries heart finese he can survive also|pg||
nt|fluffy: discarding the club from hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: and ruffing a club in hand and a heart, while north ruffs with his trump trick(s)|pg||

nt|fluffy: I think declarer could survive here with a first round club finese, but that would be so rare|pg||
nt|fluffy: or probably not|pg||
nt|fluffy: he needs to play hearts from dummy twice and also spade's second round (guessing)|pg||
