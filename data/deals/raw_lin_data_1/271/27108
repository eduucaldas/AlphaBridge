nt|vugraphzce: Nice to hear you Steen :)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  only 31 i think but still|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But there is an endplay against East, that should be easy to spot and set up|pg||

nt|dkkello:  http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling4473.html|pg||
nt|sommer: EW are playing relaisprecision|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Or you can make the diamond go on the fourth spade, as the defence cannot attack diamonds|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  What is south considering? Didn't his partner encourage in clubs?|pg||
nt|smoller:  I kib suggests that it might have been better to use @SQ at trick one - might tempt South to return spade to kille the entry to diamonds|pg||

nt|smoller:  yes a rowoke or Sout discarding a heart on the 3rd trump|pg||
nt|smoller:  *revoke|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Declarer is not in a hurry to test the hearts, as he can always pitch a diamond if they break|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Perhaps he is just relaxing, doing the "let NS have some more time to think about the previous board"|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  It does work sometimes|pg||
nt|smoller:  It sure does|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Perhaps it is working as we write!|pg||

nt|OleBerg:  The chance to solve hearts is around 58%, so the slam is quite sound|pg||
nt|sommer: at how many tables will 6 @H be bid, you guess? 5/10?..or more|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|adonis18:  8/10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't remember now -- maybe 4@D asks controls|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Actually, not bidding 6@H is as bad as bidding a grand on a finesse (At IMPs)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But like Poul, I believe it will be missed at a few tables|pg||
nt|sommer: 8/10 sounds good to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confirmed  4@D ask and 4@S = 4 controls  A=2 K=1|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  not easy to find out 5-4 in hearts with natural bidding so I think 4/10|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcf: 6-4-2-1, 4 controls|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|pelu:  1@S - 2@H then S know 5-4 in @h :)|pg||
nt|adonis18:  natural bidding: 1@s - 2@h:)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  After 1@S-2@H South will know, but you are right, it may not be that easy still|pg||

mc|12|nt|OleBerg:  If North RKC's and gets the reply of missing an ace and the queen, he will know the fourth heart is crucial|pg||

nt|vugraphzce: results after round 15 of 19: http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub14/Turneringer/Stilling4473.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: so EW is  1 at the moment -- and NS dropped from  1 this morning to  6 at the moment|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  I expect 6@s to be bid all around, having a solid fit and 30 hcp in aces and kings|pg||
