mb|p|mb|1C|an|2+|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  4@S is best|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: And 1-1 perhaps after 15 and 16. Slam on 15 is not easy to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Some would bid 3@S or 3@D (mini-splinter) now.|pg||
nt|simonr: E/W did not mention @S in the other room after a Stayman sequence when East showed the|pg||
nt|brolucius:  3@S can be used on a near-minimum distributional raise, with 3@H covering stronger hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius:  Or you can use three of a red-suit as a mini-splinter.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pdjourdain:  At the other table it appears Pownall, who opened 1N did not realise West had shown spades|pg||
nt|simonr: Opening 1NT with a singleton is becoming more common these days |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgehands.com/M/Mini-Splinter.htm|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  The auction 1N-2@C-2@H-3N shows spades if 2@C is 4-card Stayman|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some do not like to splinter with an ace or king|pg||
nt|brolucius:  An amazing mistake by Pownall. Many intermediate books mention the inference that the Stayman bidder must have one major when he goes to 3NT next.|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  If you are going to open 1Nt with a singleton, I prefer the singleton to to be the K or Q|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  A singleton K or Q will not be pulling full weight in a suit contract but is likely to be useful in NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: Or possibly upper end of 9-11|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|pdjourdain:  I prefer a transfer 1@H from south as the hand is too good and spades too weak for a Multi, I think|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius:  I am told that 1@S and then 2@S is weak, to play. In standard, it shows more like 8-10.|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@c and 3@d show a maximum with the corresponding Major (Next suit = asks for SPL, 3M = No SPL.).|pg||
nt|brolucius:  To allow West to distinguish 2 clubs from 4 (with East), some pairs signal with 2nd and then 3rd best from 4.|pg||
nt|brolucius:  The @C3 is hard to read and might be from three cards.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But this E-W pair plays 3rd and 5th leads against suit contracts|pg||
nt|brolucius:  By playing a precise method (2nd then 3rd) West can often read the position. When he cannot, he will reflect that South has 6 spades to East's 2, so is likely to be shorter in clubs.|pg||

nt|brolucius:  Fine board for Gold-Forrester.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N!|nt|brolucius:  Gold did well to bid so strongly with his weak trumps. He was greatly helped by the opposition bidding in spades, suggesting that Forrester's values would be well placed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is a weak distributional takeout for the black suits|pg||
nt|simonr: 2@D is game forcing |pg||
nt|brolucius:  2NT is a better description than a double, really, although both interventions could end up being helpful to N/S. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would only bid with the West cards at favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  If they reach 6@D then a spade lead reduces North's good trumps, helping East|pg||
nt|simonr: Any thoughts on Forrester's 5@D bid in the other room|pg||
mb|3D|mb|5S|nt|vugraphzbf: E taking all the time to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Last Train?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last Train it is, David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Says nothing about diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A hand too good to bid 5@H and not good enough to bid slam|pg||
nt|brolucius:  That means that he is making the only available bid, as a slam try, with no reference to his diamond holding.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  Maggie Pierce wishes Wales good luck in going for the Alan Pierce Trophy|pg||
nt|brolucius:  North's 6@C (at the other table) cannot have been a grand-slam try, presumably, with such weak trumps. It must have been offering a choice of slams.|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Forcing pass by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: N alerts Souths pass, S does not.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius:  A double by South would advise North not to bid on. A pass is more invitational.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  play will not be so quick this time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if there is a trump loser, one option (and a winning one as the cards lie) is to hope that the defender with short @d has a  doubleton trump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then you can play a second round of trumps with the jack, unblock the @d and draw trumps ending in dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is assuming that West finds the @c switch upon winning the @hK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if he does not knock out the the @cK entry, declarer can draw all the trumps before unblocking the @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the alternative is to ruff a @c in dummy, playing for a 4-3 @c split|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on the surface that looks a better chance than short @h and short @d in the same hand|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: Very unlucky board for England next door, but Shields and Kurbalija may well replicate the result|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: When you open 1@S with the south hand, you are pleasantly surprised when partner responds two game forcing hearts|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 7@S is actually better than 7@H when you look at the N-S cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius:  The grand slam is slightly better than a 3-2 trump break because single 10 or J can be picked up in the East hand. Maybe 7NT is better. |pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Very difficult to reach 7@S and fails as well I think as nothing breaks|pg||

mb|5D!|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Kurbalija probably can't believe what he is seeing opposite when he has this mountain, but I would bid 7 now, looking at AK AK in the blacksuits and partner has bid this way, must ...|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: Surely 7 something is coming|pg||

nt|Walddk2: For cricket fans. Stumps day 1: Australia 237-9d, India 5-0|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Still a bit tricky though as it might be a singleton lead and declarer is wary of drawing two trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Will he try to duck a trump into the safe hand? May suffer a spade ruff, as you say, but only when @CA is onside.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|brolucius:  An alternative meaning is Kickback Blackwood.|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:  When a slam is on a trump finesse they all keep out because of keycard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S shows 4-card support for hearts and a maximum|pg||
nt|brolucius:  At the other table Forrester doubled a 4@S bid by East. He plays this as asking for a DIAMOND lead (the higher of the other two suits). |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think Townsend bid his cards very well. He showed a maximum, then co-operated with 5@C. Then there is no more to add, when @CK rates to be a wasted card|pg||
