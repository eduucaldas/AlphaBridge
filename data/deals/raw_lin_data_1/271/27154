nt|sartaj1: If spades are 3-2, declarer will aim for four spade tricks, three clubs, a heart , a diamond and a club ruff on the board|pg||
nt|sartaj1: If they are 4-1, he needs to build a heart trick. So I'm predicting early two rounds of spades when declarer gets on play, followed by a quick claim|pg||
nt|sartaj1: While the @D 8 was clearly meant to discourage, it is not so clear for North. South might have @DJ8 or @D98|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: the heart shift here by matt seemed like the best chance to shoot the contract|pg||
nt|sartaj1: Its an aggressive move but the vulnerability (and match score I guess) are tempting. Pass would be very disciplined|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks not to make but might induce 5@d|pg||
mb|4D!|an|splinter|mb|5D|nt|sartaj1: While West has only nine points, the hand shape will be well suited to whatever partner bids. And the two aces provide enough defence to cover any penalty ambitions partner might ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: not to x5@h = few imps ?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, West in the other room didn't know if partner had anything ... partner might be sacrificing.  So it was normal to pass out 5@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: still nothing from appeals committee|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose East could have doubled, but it's a little speculative|pg||
nt|Super Nova: 3c? or not going to try for the major fit?|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: it was vunerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless you think the players should know before the start of the set (so they can change strategy), then it doesn't seem to matter|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: so is this lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: To me, I would prefer them to take their time, and allow the final set to commence|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: appeal result is in +6 extra imps to mcGann|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So a weighted score ... a very common outcome of appeals like this|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: score is now 62 to McGann|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: when it's close, with a game swing in the balance, I certainly believe they should know, anyway why does it take so LONG?|pg||
nt|Super Nova: Right. It can be a little wierd when a major event is decided by an appeal.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the appeals committee wants to get the result right|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: players all know at this table|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the players want to go home ... they might even have flights booked|pg||

mc|11|nt|bjacobs: no idea|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But the difference is now 16 imps, 8 boards to play|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: in certain 4 card holdings would the 8 deny an honour and did system card match explanation|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sartaj1: Hugh McGann duplicated declarer's nice line of play on B13 in the other room, card for card. Good technique|pg||

nt|sartaj1: E-W play 15-17 notrump in third and fourth seat|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sartaj1: Leading from Axxx type holdings is usually not recommended versus no-trumps, thus the @S lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its possible that 3NT might be sided the other way at the other table|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but besides that it looks like another flat board|pg||

nt|ritong: still, game is possible|pg||
nt|serhat: because E hasnt got 10@s:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: That's the key point: having game opposite a passed partner is a very narrow target, and the risk of 1NT is obvious|pg||
nt|serhat: or 10 @H or |pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: 1NT red with opp passed hand it sticking ur head out and in France we  tho U know what happens next :)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Whatever you think of this discussion, the take-away point is that there IS a difference when partner is a passed hand: it does change the nature of the calculation|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol again...now we have a discussion and the advice was to let go |pg||
nt|serhat: 2-2  now|pg||
nt|serhat: :)|pg||
