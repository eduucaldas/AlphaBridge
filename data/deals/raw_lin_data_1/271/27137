mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|beauch:  South might be tempted to double|pg||
nt|BuzzyBee: these matches have shown some very difficult high level decisions, and the players have not got all of them right    this is a very tricky area|pg||

nt|beauch:  illegal to double your our pd :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: our operators this session http://livebridge.net/bbo/session.php?eventid=1008&sessionid=6|pg||
nt|beauch:  this will be very messy if doubled|pg||
nt|BuzzyBee: This is a problem with the transfer response - if you are obliged to show that @S suit before the @D, then partner can hardly visualise the hand|pg||
nt|beauch:  tough problem 4/7|pg||
mb|p|nt|beauch:  perhaps i expect everyone will pass this|pg||

nt|mrdct:  this has no play now, so a possible good board for cornell|pg||
nt|timb: 5@D in the other room too|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so both NS pairs have done well to not compete to 5@h|pg||
nt|timb: Both West players made a negative double of the 1@H overcall. I have a view that one should not make negative doubles on "swans" (7411 shapes).|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  the awkward thing here is that both north and south could make the slam try|pg||

nt|ritong: i will be impressed if they do|pg||
nt|mrdct:  as will I!|pg||
nt|ritong: for instance, here, 4@d sounds like a cue|pg||
nt|mrdct:  looking at both hands, 7@d is better than 7@s as 7@d can deal with any 3-1 trump break, whereas 7@s needs trumps 2-2, stiff !Q or good guess|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  3@h probably showed @s so in due course they will probably work out that they are missing @SQ|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the key for NS now will be if @d can be suggested as an alternative trump suit which is probably a stretch|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  maybe not now!|pg||
nt|ritong: it is horribly difficult to land in a secondary suit when a trump is established, like @ss seem to be here|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if 5@d is natural, south can just about bid 7@d himself now|pg||
nt|ritong: hence " i will be impressed if they do"|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  perhaps one thing worry south is if north has 3@s there could be a @S ruff on the opening lead in 7@d|pg||
