mb|1S!|nt|CopeyJ: auction next door, N opened 1@H, south bid 2@D showing 3@H and at least a good raise|pg||
mb|2C|nt|CopeyJ: North bid game :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: I think 1@S from Anderson is like a forcing NT response, showing 0-4@S|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: and now he will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  That explains why W bid 2@C rather than X|pg||
nt|brolucius:  If 1@S was natural, West would (of course) have doubled for take-out.|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I imagine - perhaps a case for 3NT to protect the clubs|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi David|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius:  Unusual method if they cannot find a 4-4 spade fit. No cost here because hearts is OK.|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I think Anderson thinking about 3N because of the @C holding|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: and there we go|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Quite a popular method this 1@S response, it is called Kaplan Inversion, quite often used over 1@H opener in a 5cM base|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|brolucius:  Forrester can guess his partner has a blizzard, with 15 points in his own hand. Unattractive opening lead.|pg||
nt|gsper:  It would seem to fit better with Flannery, so you don't miss @S in this undignified fashion|pg||
nt|brolucius:  That's probably the best lead. Declarer will be nervous of finessing into the dangerous hand in spades.|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Anderson can build a club trick.|pg||
nt|gsper:  There are expressions of disgust at the mention of Flannery|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: This is a nice line - building a slow @C trick as number 9 without the risk of letting E in|pg||
nt|gsper:  A bit unfair, I think, though I don't use it myself|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Reese used to regard Flannery as the worst convention ever conceived.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|gsper:  Reese had a number of opinions I don't underwrite|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius:  Indeed, but I agree with him about Flannery.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gsper:  About 4th suit, for example|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius:  That was only in the infancy of the 4th suit.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Gold used to play Flannery in his last partnership with Townsend, and maintained it scored well for them over the years. I have never played it, so can;t comment for myself|pg||

nt|gsper:  That would have been a top at pairs. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|gsper:  That would have been a top at pairs|pg||
mb|d!|nt|CopeyJ: X = 4+/4+ @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|CopeyJ: 2@D denies values and asks for Forrester's longer (better) minor|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: if Gold had values he would have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Major?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Major!|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius:  Forrester is able to pass because 2@D was limited.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gsper:  I will leave you now. Carry on the good work!|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: They open most 11s first in NV I think, so doubt Forrester was concerned about missing game anyway|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: But yes the fact that 2@D limited makes it almost impossible, David|pg||
nt|brolucius:  South can read West for 4-4-4-1, so tries a trump lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius:  Clap, clap!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Northern Ireland found a fine defence to the thin game here next door - they led a @D (robson putting up the King to try and encourage a continuation) and switched to @C to collect ...|pg||

nt|yo_yo: any idea what 2NT means?|pg||
nt|dburn: I think it may have multiple meanings, one of which is a 3@h rebid with three spades|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: 1@D is unbalanced unless 5@D332 17-18|pg||
mb|1H|nt|CopeyJ: Agree, David, a nice starter|pg||
mb|3D|nt|CopeyJ: South will probably make a takeout double now|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|brolucius:  3@D pre-emptive. 2@H would show a sound raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius:  Competitive double, suggesting a doubleton heart and the other two suits.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: North should bid 3@S I guess, and that should go down really|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: NI led @CK next door, which rather sped up affairs|pg||
nt|brolucius:  East bid only 2@D at the other table. |pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Easier to bounce to 3@D when you are almost certain of 9+ card fit|pg||
nt|brolucius:  South has probably done enough with his double at that level.|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: definitely|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: QXX@D an appalling holding|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Suspect it is Forrester thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: west asking about bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|brolucius:  He has to remember that North was forced to show his spades at the three-level (or not at all).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: 4@D can make but may well go down in the real world, losing 1@S 1@C 1@D 1@H|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: I think this is a sensible auction|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: As has been mentioned, 3NT playable but not sure anyone did anything wrong - Frances Hinden also mentioned possible 3@D rebid with E hand, David|pg||
