nt|ahollan1: 2@C set up game force|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  Yes, 2@C did indeed|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: and 2N = no slam intersest, right Ole?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  This will work out very well if a club is lead - for NS I mean|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  North could have staymanned with 2@D|pg||
nt|smoller:  this is a little shaky on a diamond lead, but he may well get a club lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  I think I would have investigated majors with the North hand. Anyone else?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Bjarnarson understandably bypassed his heart suit, holding 4333 and fillers|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h7|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: what @H suit :)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But then again, if South will not investigate, North might not want to either.|pg||
nt|smoller:  4@H may well go down after a diamond lead, if declarer finesses in heart, E/W can take a surprise ruff in clubs|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  The heart discard gives away any chance of defeating 3NT, I predict (beware!)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|jesperdall:  Declarer will test the hearts and fall back on a spade finesse as his last resort|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Which is unnecessary here|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Declarer has 8 tricks now, so he can top the hearts and rely on a spade-finesse if the @HQ doesnt drop|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|smoller:  He can try to drop @SQ (succesfully) before finessing heart|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|smoller:  yes 11 trick, agreed|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Better to play for the drop on hearts than in spades, right?|pg||

nt|smoller:  not the best fit in the world, but 3NT seems to be on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = game force, no singleton/void  not 5+@H/@S|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  1C = 16+|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  1@H = gameforce and natural|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  1@S = Relay|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  2S = Single-suited hearts, at least 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   looking at baldursson-jonsson from last set|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H could also be BAL 13+ hcp|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  North is also limited to 8-11 here|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, 4+0+3+2 looks possible, just making|pg||
nt|smoller:  a low hart is best, but unlikely|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Yes, I skipped that, as I was lagging due to my rambling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: funny  we had that come up yesterday when responder was passed hand and then always just 5+@H|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But you said it yourself; the other variation is 13+, not likely on a passed hand :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jesperdall:  However, note that NS have managed to conceal the declaring hand completely|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  There you go!|pg||
nt|smoller:  good lead, and then attack clubs|pg||
nt|thorvald:  West figured out that South probably had 0-1 @hs otherwise he would have gone to 4@h|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Now, to succeed, East must win this and lead a CLUB to set up a 5th trick before declarer gets the diamonds going, right|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Some of the players playing the system reverses som replies to 1@C, like having 1@S showing hearts, making it even more likely to conceal declarers hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|thorvald:  Declarer can play K - should not be wrong|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Yet, not clear that clubs must be returned now|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  But with that last name, perhaps he'll strike gold...|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Declarer had to drop a @c so probably best suit for defence|pg||
nt|smoller:  maybe Souths discard tipped him off|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  It is definately an advantage to have concealed declarers hand|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  (On this board)|pg||
nt|smoller:  We can all see it, Ole :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm still trying to decide play from dummy to trick 1|pg||
