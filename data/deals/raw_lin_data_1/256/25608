nt|gracelin: declarer can see 8 tricks when clubs break and is working on the 9th.|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good play by Shan to follow small smoothly|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have expected him to play DQ, since even if he guessed Diamond correctly, to let West exposes him to 4 fast H losers as mentioned|pg||
nt|gracelin: To let West in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Helness led a club and declarer went up with the queen|pg||

pc|s5|nt|gracelin: good shift, not putting all eggs on one basket by playing partner to hold AQxx of H. |pg||
nt|gracelin: East can see declarer doesn't have 9 fast tricks or he would not ducked a D to West.  So no hurry for H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fantoni is a known slow player.  So if any specs want to go toilet, this is the time.|pg||
