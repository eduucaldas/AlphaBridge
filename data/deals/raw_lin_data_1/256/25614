pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess so.  The earluer spade lead from declarer could be from Qxx, so north has to give an honest signal in case partner has Axx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland well clear now, thrashing the Dutch world champions in our other featured match|pg||

nt|agumperz:  i have known brad since he was 18|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and this bid shows he has finally grown up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would also be a 2@H opening for Fantunes, 10-13|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|gracelin: 4D instead of a direct 4H is to set up a force, not really slam minded.|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|agumperz:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best defence yields 1100, club switch|pg||
nt|agumperz:  bidding 5@H when holding 4 points in spades was probably ill-advised.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  joe was expecting no spade wastage|pg||

nt|agumperz:  probably true|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|h3|nt|gracelin: 6S canbe made if declarer tries to establish a club trick by ruffing finesse, rather than wrking on Diamonds.|pg||
