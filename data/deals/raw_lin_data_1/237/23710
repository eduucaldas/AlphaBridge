nt|kingcur: NS may get to 4@S here|pg||
mb|3N!|an|Gambling 3NT|mb|p|nt|kingcur: but E is first, and opens a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|kingcur: Chris ten Kate contemplating whether to pass|pg||
nt|kingcur: but he moves to 4@C|pg||
mb|4C!|an|Pass/Correct|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kingcur: and N awakens|pg||
nt|kingcur: 4@C pass or correct again, and E's pass indicating he has clubs|pg||
nt|kingcur: Kreuning doesn't have an easy hand, but N likely to come to help should he bid 4@D|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kingcur: but he bids 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kingcur: a contract that W passed without blinking an eye|pg||
pc|c7|nt|alfredog: kreuning will kreun again|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kingcur: not doubling often a good decision: 3NT may have made things hard enough for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: and NS may have 5@H or @S to make|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|s3|nt|kingcur: but Kreuning already saying: "good we weren't doubled"|pg||

nt|kingcur: that's exacly why W should never dbl 5@D, every likely the worst possible contract for NS|pg||
nt|kingcur: very*|pg||
