nt|mamos:  14-17|pg||

pc|h4|nt|tomi2: ok,that was my try to find out, who "all" might be :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  it should be quick :)  declarer has little choice butt to try @c|pg||

nt|lechcold: EW maj¹ 4 lewy, ale nie s¹ w stanie ich wzi¹æ|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No hurry, North|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: North is O.Herbst |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think 8 showed even yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Defence is easy - for us...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking..|pg||
nt|ady: can only duck once though or declarer could make 3 clubs 4 diamonds and 2 major suit aces|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos:  seems sensible to duck unless already clear to him to continue Spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not discard 3 x @S from South, bridge is an easy game|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - the the even number is hardly 2!|pg||
nt|ady: small spade discard seems ok   would not throw from a doubleton|pg||
nt|mamos:  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm running|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: South thinking...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  If North had ducked, 9 tricks wer possible|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and still possible. Maybe South will regret his @d-discard|pg||
nt|mamos:  although declarer surely likely to play South for @dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N thinking|pg||
nt|mamos:  i dont understand why  South didnt discard Spade to give count|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Would 4 diamonds to the Queen really be your first discard-choice?|pg||
nt|mamos:  no I agree but surely more @d length in South might even imagine 5 wirth @c 4-0|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blum1956: In fact, it is hard to bid 3NT, but it makes as EW cannot take both a club and an extra diamond trick|pg||

nt|400 volt: But when you see norths hand a grand slam invitation makes sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|400 volt: A kib just asked why you may underlead the ace when your LHO bids a @S stopper. You expect him to have the K (when you have the A). And because your LHO bid a suit  (this time @H) ...|pg||
nt|400 volt: the declarer can discard his loser in @S soon. So you could try to get partners @S Q if the dclarer guesses|pg||
