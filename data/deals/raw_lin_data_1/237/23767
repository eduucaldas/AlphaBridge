mb|d|mb|p|nt|bt: on the first hand some very aggressive stuff by ew gained them a possible swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: links to running scores  under  http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/12Dublin/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|bt: ns has nice hands but no fit|pg||
nt|bt: i think 4@C by south describes his hand nicely here|pg||
nt|bt: 3@D, 3@S or 4@C are his options|pg||
nt|bt: all perfectly acceptable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS is possible too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but unlikely at these colors|pg||
nt|bt: pass is very unlikely, not even with fredin that is a penalty double|pg||
nt|bt: who knows though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  if Fredin had real @C stack -- he might have just bid 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@H South -- EW never in the auction|pg||
nt|bt: 4@H is normal but unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: partner has AT MOST 2@H and EW bidding a lot with very little HCP  so not unexpected that @H break poorly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe strage that @D are 33 :)|pg||
nt|bt: when he is thinking this long he might pass|pg||
nt|bt: but might not north be 5233 with a good hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but here is another bidding|pg||
nt|bt: we all see a pass is correct, but fallenius does not see all hands|pg||
nt|bt: maybe we have the quickest toilet break in bridge history?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this sequrnce is for me a penalty double|pg||
nt|bt: 2nd board|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: everyone is still at the table :)|pg||
nt|bt: this sequence is for 99% of todays bridge players a T/O double|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|bt: at the other table board one was a win for bulgaria and this is a potential one for sweden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would that be takeout?   EW have bid and raised 1 suit, South has bid 2 suits and North has bid 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it just shows good hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: please explain "a good hand" as opposed to "a penalty double"|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and sweden have missed their 2nd best contract - 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: penalty dbl =  i have trump tricks    good hand = i have points not shown by 1@S but no clear bid|pg||
nt|bt: 4@S is not bad at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: yea but you cant have it both ways|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bt: penalty and a good hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree   i just think Fredin's DBL says  i have good hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hand that is pure penalty  may just bid 3N|pg||
nt|bt: we see declarer has a lot of tricks, unfortunately he does not know diamonds are 33|pg||
