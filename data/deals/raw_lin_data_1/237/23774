pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||

pc|c4|nt|geot: and Norway can't really complain about bad luck on board 1, because East's @H opening was on a 10 count with 10 to five hearts. He got punished hard.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h = 0-11hcp w 4@h or 4@s|pg||

mb|3C|an|6-9 4 plus diamonds|nt|star6ija: easy to be made when we see all the cards|pg||
nt|geot: +140 is a fine result for N/S on board 2. E/W has 8-9 tricks in diamonds. Depending on the lead.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4+ @d, 6-9|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jbgood: (3 @c)|pg||
nt|geot: 3@D = good raise in hearts I guess.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  at this vul, EW will stretch as much as possible to get to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: this pass requires trump lead...otherwise declarer can prevail|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: so even transfer bids have their disadvantages - opps can cue in the suit transferred to:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|geot: Diamond lead would have been better, but still that club finesse could have been taken.|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|star6ija: ok...we have to catch them...due to wrong seating in the venue|pg||

nt|andyv:  12-14 NT|pg||

nt|jbgood: Hoftaniska managed to get out for minus 1 on   4 - so a push|pg||
mb|2D|an| 4|mb|p|nt|star6ija: the right decision taken by Upmark to pass for penalty brought 5 more IMPs to Swedes with Tsonchev - Marashev going down 1 on 4 @h in board 3|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: now double on 2@H ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bobholl: on 3@H even :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: doubled partscore lead trump |pg||
nt|oleberg:  North believes south has shown a genuine fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the NT can be 5-3-3-2, 5-4-2-2 (but not in the majors) and 4-4-4-1 besides three run  of the mill 4-3-3-3 and 4-3-4-2|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|oleberg:  The lower the partscore, the faster you lead a trump|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: already 8 tricks |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: EW playing French Standard -- their convention card doesn't hint at why 2@C alerted|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|star6ija: another chance for Sweden here as far as 3 NT can be made|pg||
nt|geot: N/S in a quite standard 3NT here. Only eight top tricks from start, but nine already if he had tried the spade 8 in trick one|pg||
nt|geot: on a low spade lead which is pretty normal|pg||
nt|jbgood: some might even lead the 10|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: good idea if prd has 5 of them|pg||
nt|baardolav: Double dummy, you need to play 2round of club AK and 4 round of diamond and then a heart for input... |pg||
nt|geot: but declarer did not try the eight and is now looking for his ninth trick. |pg||
nt|geot: he can just set up a heart trick? Lose three hearts|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oleberg:  Five discards will take it toll on North|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: king may take the trick|pg||
nt|geot: may get problems getting to his hand to play more hearts and later collect the heart trick|pg||
nt|geot: Best defence would be (seeing all the cards) to win the ace and switch to a club|pg||
nt|baardolav: @h Ace and club give a big problem?|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: then 2 clubs, spade ace , three diamonds and then a club :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: (dd of course)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive he need some sort of endplay if defence is correct|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: if S keeps at least 4@D can be 1 down and a push|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs stunned the Gold passed|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand E's pass either|pg||
nt|xenya: too refined for my taste|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|geot: If he goes down, which not at all is unlikely now, he will really regret not trying the spade 8 in the first trick.|pg||
nt|geot: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: chatting 0 the old rule of eleven|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jbgood: W thaought he was trying to bluff a trick for the @h king - with nothing in his hand'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oleberg:  But if he keeps 3 diamonds, two hearts and two spades, it will be down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@dX was played in OR for -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  N opened 1@h and E was able to bid @s and then double @ds for further takeout.  W was only too happy to leave it in.|pg||
nt|geot: On a club switch from West instead of that 1H10, declarer can still win|pg||
nt|baardolav: everything solved... with a @c can win with ace, spade to ace and jack of @h|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: Mihov will take 10 here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  lead is 4th from JTxx or better|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|geot: yes, and he can also duck the club, then fly ace on a spade back, and set up the clubs with two entries to dummy in diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: will in that case depend on East holding the Q of hearts|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oleberg:  Which seems like the obvious cards to keep|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: good example of a simple, straightforward auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1N opener here caused some unexpected problems.  Hard to imagine that EW don'|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5@C/@D (332)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an| |nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 12-14 HCP  and exact shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 1 trump round and trump @D|pg||
nt|baardolav: sorry 7@s only|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|ahollan1: vP has a lot of information, but still doesn't know if the hand belongs in @S, @D, NT  OR at what level|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: 7nt with no heart lead|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  ok, maybe they don't play xfers in this sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  A little timing is needed, but he should get it right|pg||
nt|bobholl: but with 52 cards seen much easier|pg||
nt|oleberg:  Declarer will have to fall back on the diamonf-finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H wrongsided|pg||
nt|xenya: still making i think|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|ahollan1: 3@S forces 3N|pg||
nt|baardolav: If I count right geot?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|andyv:  @d lead was best for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = strong slam interest in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bablisok: iyi açýþ|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: 5@C = maximum [in context]  3 keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in response to 4@D  'slave' can also describe  bad or medium hand for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Verhees held same hand with @DQ instead of @CQ   i wonder if he bids the same way or treats the hand as 15+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg:  Or else, there will simply not be enough tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: last spade can cause damage to swedish pair|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  so now we can take back what we thought of E's pass on board 7 as it appears he did double for a push board.|pg||
nt|star6ija: still they haven't chance to avoid the trouble|pg||
mb|5H|an| |mb|p|nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4 round of @d, even with @c swith will put E in @H-@c squeeze|pg||
nt|geot: 7@S can always be won on a diamond ruff, but are there communication for a double squeeze in NT. Definitely a heart lead will break all chances in NT|pg||
nt|geot: Yes the double squeeze works without a heart lead|pg||
nt|geot: You may ask why South did not double 4@H in this sequence?|pg||
nt|geot: Lets say a club or a spade lead in NT, declarer cashes A of clubs, enter dummy with the @SJ and cash the club king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: yes - he should have done as he had no pass cards left|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about 5@H :(|pg||
nt|star6ija: switch*|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: possibly Ask Specific Kings  with 5@S denying  [the keycard response already identified @SK]|pg||
nt|geot: then back to hand and run the winners and there is a double squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|baardolav: the 13th trich on... 3 of heart|pg||
nt|baardolav: trick*|pg||
mb|6C|nt|geot: Here an eventual NT contract will be played by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: And South knows what to lead:)|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|oleberg:  A club-finesse at trick two would have made it as well, but thats a tough stand to take|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: i don't think @D lead would beat  4@H -- declarer has time to pitch @D loser on a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened west hand 2@H  then   2@S-4@H-4@S-end|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... a heart seem safe even for me... but 7@s it is|pg||
pc|hT|nt|geot: Good contract|pg||
nt|larsarthur: good lead|pg||
nt|geot: and the same contract as at the other table|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|geot: on the heart lead the double squeeze chances are gone, so declarer will go for a diamond ruff.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  can he get back to his hand to play the @cs?|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: @S ruff?|pg||
nt|xenya: to get back to hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: A very good grand slam... need to ruff e diamond before pichting the @h on @c K, |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much better to be in 6@S even if declarer can guess 13 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|star6ija: how many @ss Nystrom will bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: over 3@S from North:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 NT over 3 @s? interesting|pg||
nt|geot: as we can see, 3NT does not work this time|pg||
pc|s4|nt|baardolav: can be 2 down if make the heart ace as entry for @d finesse|pg||
nt|geot: So how should he play it? Play AK diamonds, or close his eyes and enter the @H ace and take the diamond hook|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbgood: and Nybo knows he gives away a spade trick - but is not afraid of the diamonds running|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead would have been awful for declarer, no entry to his diamonds at all....but that is of course just double dummy stuff for the defender|pg||
