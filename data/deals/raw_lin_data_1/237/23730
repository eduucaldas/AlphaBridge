mb|p|nt|amarko: likely 3nt E  cannot be defeated or W  as it happens|pg||
nt|othered1: From my old=fashioned perspective, the 5@D opening on last board got what it deserved.  Side aces and high preempts opposite unpassed hands often cause problems.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cc469: if W got his club ruff and continued @Ds would have come to an extra @S trick in E hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: A start of 1D-1S-2D-2H (or similar)-3D .. *may* have got them to the slam|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|amarko: wrong sided  but ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the match comes down to this :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Knowing 2@C is for majors, slight overbid imo, 3@H and pass or 3NT would have some play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: a bit of a one sided match which surprised somewhat|pg||
nt|bebechira: great job Luke.. :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks Gary and Frank...|pg||
nt|othered1: Intersting that east didn't start with 1@D, given the quality of the suit.  But I"d open 1@C,too.|pg||
nt|bebechira: many thanks Steve and Ed :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: -1 and thanks all. Enjoyable close match.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wygbe1: 3n is clearly the best contract, with 4h down if the defense could manage a club ruff, but the 33 clubs make this contract easy as well|pg||
