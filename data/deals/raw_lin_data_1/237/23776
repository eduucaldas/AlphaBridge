nt|ahollan1: final board of the match   round 5 begins in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 1@C forcing  14+ hcp, 4+@C or 15+ bal, 2+@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: OK, Hungary scored up the normal 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as score reflects -- this has been a very tight battle|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|gulyas: 4@S is not a good save|pg||
pc|c2|nt|geot: Good result by E/W in the OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|geot: But fairly normal as long as West get heart support |pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D means @Hs I assume, so why no supp x? interesting|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so NS play no supp x-s|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton is the system lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: I wonder how they will find this fit|pg||

nt|jkotor: ruff high, play low @d, and makes|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|gulyas: 1@D showed @Hs, was not alerted by the operator|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: Vigorous discussion between Madala and Bocchi during and after that hand.|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, so Italy wins by 2 imps, thats 16-14? maybe 15-15|pg||
nt|gulyas: ok, 15-15 I am told - now we just need the declarer's decision on this bd from the OR to get the final result|pg||
nt|gulyas: next round starts in abt 25mins (17:40 CET)|pg||
nt|gulyas: the format is a double round robin: first, 2 groups play a RR for abt a week (17 rnds)|pg||
nt|gulyas: then the top 9 teams from both groups advance to RR2|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play each other, but taking the results from the advancing teams along, only playing the other 9 teams|pg||
nt|gulyas: final result is determined by total VPs|pg||
nt|gulyas: all right, the result shows online as here, so I assume that means the director let the score stand, Italy may appeal|pg||
nt|gulyas: small correction from Roland: 18 rnds, including a bye|pg||
nt|gulyas: so the final result is 15-15, appeal pending (maybe)|pg||
nt|gulyas: certainly an entertaining match, come see us again in 20 mins for rnd3|pg||
nt|gulyas: made the 4@H call easy after the reopen|pg||
