nt|vugraphzhp: But the outside laughs are due to people focussed already on tonight's football match|pg||
nt|kingcur: this table finished now, but we will remain in the air to update you on other table's results|pg||
nt|alfredog: after gaining th elead with k of diamonds he could have played A of clubs and club 8 back|pg||
nt|kingcur: BBN2 of course in for a bad result on  18, 11 out we now see|pg||
nt|kingcur: rest of the scores coming soon, brb|pg||

nt|kingcur: Helmich-Hop went one off in 6@S, after strong opening by W, 3@D in N, 3@S in E and 4@H in S|pg||
nt|kingcur:  21 being played in 3N at other table, and one is inclined to think declarer will bring in 13 tricks there as well|pg||
