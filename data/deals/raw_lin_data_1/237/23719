nt|wygbe1: its possible to make 6 nt or 6d, but kind of absurd - must guess to drop the spade king offside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes as a friend just pointed out to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish having a long think|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: To easy hahaha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the sub-moysian 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: without a spade lead should make, since declarer will eventually lay down the spade ace and get good news - on spade lead must guess to duck if east declares - really bad contract ...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weak 2|pg||
