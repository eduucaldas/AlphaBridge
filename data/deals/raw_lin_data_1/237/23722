nt|swanson: East can make this with a double heart finesse now, I believe.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|sK|nt|swanson: Most pairs in my part of the world use transfers at the four level here, so East would bid 4@H to play 4@S.|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ish thinking|pg||
nt|swanson: We use them as long as the interference is 4@C or less.|pg||
nt|swanson: The actualy line by East is quite reasonable.  An early heart finesse would risk a ruff when there were essentially 10 top tricks.|pg||

nt|wygbe1: its possible to make 6 nt or 6d, but kind of absurd - must guess to drop the spade king offside|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes as a friend just pointed out to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ish having a long think|pg||

nt|bebechira: after a shaky start Noble in the lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bebechira: and a good lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|amarko: think 2@S shows 6  but underwiight opening|pg||

nt|bebechira: fantastic job Luke :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: To easy hahaha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the sub-moysian 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: without a spade lead should make, since declarer will eventually lay down the spade ace and get good news - on spade lead must guess to duck if east declares - really bad contract ...|pg||
nt|wygbe1: though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a weak 2|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|wygbe1: can make by playing for black suit squeeze against north, getting lucky when spade q drops|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|amarko: wrong sided  but ???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the match comes down to this :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Knowing 2@C is for majors, slight overbid imo, 3@H and pass or 3NT would have some play.|pg||
