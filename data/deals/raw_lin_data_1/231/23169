mb|d|nt|kit: this is a negative double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: Hampson will probably drive it into 5@C|pg||
nt|kit: might bid 4@H along the way, in case his partner has a good hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: I have my doubts about Greco's negative double.  Unlikely to have spade fit, and they may be outgunned.  Just 3@C looks like enough.|pg||
nt|kit: Hamman may bid 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|kit: Seems like Greco might have doubled 4@H.  Now Hampson will surely bid 5@C.|pg||
mb|d|mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I do not think Hampson should even be introducing the diamonds with that much discrepancy in the suits.  He knows Greco must have at least 2 clubs.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: When Hamman doubles 4NT, that surely creates a force.|pg||
nt|kit: If Hamman didn't want to create a force, he wouldn't have doubled 4NT.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2 C = 6+ (might be 5 in 3rd sat) 10-15|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi last set for today 4 more tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: morning 1st set of 8 of the finals of the USBC|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other table and access voice without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure if Ace is attitude or count..prob att since he wouldn't want unblock|pg||
nt|bt:  east has a nice hand on this auction|pg||
nt|bt:  i am all for penalizing opps but if a vulnerable slam is very likely, i would just take my chances there|pg||
nt|inquiry:  diamond is in 6@h at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hi joe|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome back, Henri.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=negative/takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes X = 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfc: lead e/w|pg||
nt|uday:  Hola - can I talk a couple of kibs into being commentators?  If you're interested, send me a msg :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think west should pull, in no way is this a penalty doube, but then again i know they are koached by kokish|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow 4+ cards in nt  std NT honors of short suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lall will certainoy shift to a club now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads 3rd and low|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt:  anyway competitive bidding is difficult for all of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4 clubs splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: need x tra value to bid 3 clubs answer yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Because East's Dbl indicates @S's, Brad Moss prefers 3@D to (Dbl of 3@C) or Pass. If Brad passed, Fred would have bid 3@H I think. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a while  but Hampson balanced with 4N|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This is the 4th 15 bd segment of the finals of the team trials to determine the USA entry to the Mind Games.  4 more segments are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubtedly showing 4@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: per System Summary Form   vs NT  King is strong lead, so Ace did ask attitude|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry:  needs to hold to something like down five to win imps, that means five tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bt:  how many tricks for declarer? 3@S and a club?|pg||
nt|jlall: not clear how to play this, but winning and playing a club seems natural |pg||
nt|jlall: he might try the DK first|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Now Lall has a problem -- he may not know the club position.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|uday:  Welcome. We have Mark Feldman, SantyClz2, and Lars Anderson ( who has to run off in 30 ) as commentators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson playing 5@CX West|pg||
nt|petergill: With good cards in both of partner's suits, Fred gos to 4@H, which is doomed by the 4-0 break. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they may have changed 1 or 2 things since then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If no 4-0 trump break, 4@H needs (@SAQ onside and no @d ruff), or @S blockage (e.g Ax in West) or (defence doesn't find @s switch in time). Not that bad a contract. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Clever jack of clubs play by Meckstroth -- pretending he has the 10|pg||
nt|bt: thanks uday, ill be brief :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: good to be here at this interesting fight, now that the pretenders are all out :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: regular smith|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 1st of 4 sessions today of the finals of the team trials for the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4 more sessions are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfc: meck falsecarded in both suits from hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  Wolpert playing 3@D East|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|uday:  And joining us is Ben (Inquiry) Dickens|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jlall: so first he sets up ruffs, then he works on diamonds, notice the one thing he will not do is play trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: greco scared of tapping declarer because declarer might ruff diamonds in hand, ruff clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: but he has no appealing play really|pg||
nt|jlall: greco does not know declarer doesnt have the @HT either, so tapping him feels normal|pg||
nt|jlall: seems impossible that he will make this whatever happens unless greco drops his hand on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxx in trumps on defence, normal expert defence is to duck two rounds, then win the 3rd and decide whether to play a 4th round of trumps. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroth says sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: unusual, yes|pg||
nt|petergill: West's @S5 (UDCA) allows Meckstroth to count N's shape as 3541|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: I am sure he has a good reason, I can't see it, presumably he's thinking katz has AKT8x of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: not the apol, the huddling|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall: guess he just assumed katz would go up|pg||
nt|jlall: good poker play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bt: decl will get 4@D and one in each|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bt:  declarer knows they have a slam so he is happy with 5 down|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: KATZ not happy|pg||
nt|jlall: when the HT dropped katz assumed hampson had QT of hearts as I would too|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s4|nt|inquiry:  this is just five down now... losing 3 more spade tricks....|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jlall: or QTx|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, Rodwell hoped Meckstroth had doubleton jack, hence his two ducks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: EW's aim is merely to beat 4@H on various layouts - they are not after the 2nd undertrick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: apologetic sort of table, this|pg||
mc|9|nt|bt: in the closed room hamman chose to pass 1@S in same acuction, so its 4 imps to diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says i have to duck heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says he lost track|pg||

nt|jlall: interesting, if katz had AKT of hearts would he have gone down?|pg||
nt|ritong: amazing|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Fred can apologise for bidding game and Moss can apologise for not making it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's not used to Meck going into the tank|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfc: is nosiy outside in hall way|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson did not open a strong club, somewhat surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: X can iclude 5+@S GF|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C suit opener's limited to max of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jlall: probably needed a pointed suit ten|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  as we see, gittelman strongly believes in counting ppoints for nt, again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss dont have much pd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman overcalled 4@S   strange to see moss taking lower road|pg||
nt|ritong: brave raise  will work super here|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth not done yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman realized at the adverse vulnerability that Brad Moss had a serious hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kit: This shows secondary diamond suit, not natural|pg||
nt|dburn: and not done at all|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Last session of the day.  Meckwell aren't exactly juniors any more. Fatigue may be becoming an issue.|pg||
mb|d|nt|bt: in the other room, ok ok :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome Henri.|pg||
nt|jlall: 2S is a constructive raise, with no game interest they start with 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Looks like 8 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bt:  and Qxx in spades a stopper|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|markf:  On hand 1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c6|nt|inquiry:  well yes, that too... but on lead looks like that is working|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bt:  solid 8% game|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
nt|jlall: this could be a huge swing for NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
nt|uday:  Any experienced kibs feel like jumping in with commentary? buzz me|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman's choice of 4@S made it harder for EW to find the save - 5@C by East over Hamman's 4@s might be a good hand that gets raised to 6@C.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bt:  AK onside, KJ onside, @D 32|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jlall: if nickell had overcalled michaels, west would not know his partner had clubs though so he might not be overly aggressive|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfc: moss playing with 9 and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or KQ or KJ doubleton legitimatily|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Now the spade shift, although it isn't necessary since South has third trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson claims 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth trying to get hearts out of the way before playing ace and a diamond in the hope of a blockage|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampsons says they could make 5 clubs Greco are you trying to make him feel better|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about these hands|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: a side four carder is worth a supplementary card in the long suit|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s9|nt|inquiry:  looks like will be down one... a small pickup|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: succeeded with half of that plan, but not the other half|pg||
nt|bigtrain: partial elimination now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: If declarer goes right in hearts, he will make.  But he might take a "safety play" of AK of hearts, and he will find oout it isn't so safe.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|s8|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hT|pc|dT|pc|h8|nt|kit: This play by Hamman really showed a lot of foresight.|pg||

nt|dburn: not a shabby result for Nickell at the other table, this|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfc: chuckes|pg||
nt|jlall: this time hampson upgrades|pg||
nt|petergill: Moss followed the theory "preempt one level lower when vul vs not vul, and one level higher when at fav vul" but it didn't work this time, due to Meckstroth's boldness. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: game the other way has only three top losers, though maybe not ten winners|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|inquiry:  both pairs play bidding, ew use standard carding, ns use upside down signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S 1-suit, weaker than starting with DBL|pg||
nt|markf:  Theymay play 3@S shws a stiff|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's WBF Convention Card from a few years ago http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems%5C2005worldchampionships-estoril%5Cbermudabowl%5Cusa%202/gitelman-moss+notes.pdf |pg||
nt|dburn: and Rodwell may take a shot at it, despite the vulnerability (or maybe because of it, since East is supposed to have a sound hand)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2h + 4|pg||
nt|bt:  this is the games you want to bid, at worst a diamond finesse and some extra chanses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just Stayman without stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
mb|5H|nt|markf:  Dull hand, easy to bid and make 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: 1@H shows 8-11 points, denies 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and Nickell has a winning position now whatever happens|pg||
nt|petergill: Another 10 imps if South passes. |pg||
nt|petergill: or 11 imps if South bids 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1N = 11-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: only one singleton king likely to score here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt:  a diamond lead wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|bt:  except for us seeing all hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: this denies the king|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says please stop that  -- have to lead it its the contract|pg||
nt|kit: diamond shift now, and defense will have many tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia got to open north hand 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: even spade followed by diamond will work|pg||
nt|markf:  Nickell has a difficult Opening Lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
nt|jlall: natural bidding after 1H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: asks @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if you normally lead A from AK  at 5+ level you often want to lead unsupported Ace -- so switch back to K from AK and show COUNT to aid cashout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
nt|petergill: On @DK lead, 4@s might make|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S or 4@SX e.g @DK to ace, @SJ wins, @D ruff, @SA, spade to dummy, @D 10 pitching a club. Doesn't help N to cover @SJ. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: eric once explained some very esoteric reason to me but has since admited they just found it easier to think all upside-down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
pc|s9|nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
nt|jlall: on a club lead if greco ducks 3N can be defeated|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th  best  smith echo|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has just stuck with his diamonds, I'm not sure about that|pg||
nt|jlall: greco almost for sure is 1534 on the bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: and hampson has announced 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: if greco had 2 spades he would have raised spades at some point, and with 1 spade and 2 diamonds he wouldnt bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is very tricky with no communication|pg||
nt|jlall: however, EW have no suit to attack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco is shaking his head|pg||
nt|jlall: he can win, play a spade, club back he wins the ace, cashes a heart, plays a spade|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a winning line|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bt:  there is a case for west returning a small heart at second trick, give decl xxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:  with @CA in east, @DK in west is likely|pg||
nt|petergill: WBF Convention Card for EW http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems%5C2009worldteams-brazil%5Cbermudabowl%5Cusa2/meckstroth-rodwell.pdf|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jlall: but thats because we can see all the hands|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlall: so far, so good|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: if it asks for " help", @c A becomes very leadable|pg||

mb|1D|nt|mcphee: just a guess on my part:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i doubt zia opens 2@S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||
nt|markf:  If they dont play Puppet over 2NT, this will work out poorly|pg||

nt|petergill: guess to finess the nine - not easy|pg||
nt|ritong: and side opposition|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jlall: then he will duck 2 rounds of clubs and win the third|pg||
nt|jlall: at which point, he will have to guess diamonds|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bigtrain: i'm shocked with the poor trump|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will all aces and spaces judged that he needed his partner to be able to take control.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must really like the @C trick source|pg||
nt|jlall: unlucky pitch|pg||
nt|jlall: but it should be noted, once nickell tanked for a long time on that pitch|pg||

mb|2D|an|undiscussed|nt|athene: yes, he probably counted his losers and thought "better not get partner too excited"|pg||
nt|athene: this is one of the many situations a partnership needs to discuss when playing against a nebulous minor opener|pg||
nt|athene: when can you bid their suit naturally?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: With Greco expecting only 3-card support, he may hold back and bid only 3@H|pg||

nt|athene: he too takes the low road - EW being very coy with their ten-card fit|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||

nt|ritong: this shift simplifies matters|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, there was some tangling around|pg||
nt|ritong: still has to make a decision about his basic suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  intra finesse in clubs I think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  he may try to shorten his trumps by ruffing diamonds twice... but everything seems to be down one.|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think greco should pass 2@H henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps even two fits, when west was not hot to raise to 3@h with three  here, 3@d would have hit big|pg||
nt|jlall: KQJx of hearts and very defensive values...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try to catch them higher greedy me:)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|kit: Declarer assumes hearts 3-2, of course.  So, counting his winners, if clubs 4-2 he has 4 clubs, 5 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 spade.  Not enough.  So he needs clubs 3-3 also.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: but if he has, then you want to take a shot at game|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|kit: Passing 2@D looks clear with partner known to have at most 3 hearts.  Of course he might have just passed 1NT.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: zia: "an unusual situation"|pg||
nt|athene: yes he probably counted himself fortunate when 2@D (rather than 2@H) appeared|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so he goes the other route, just going voluntarily for heart ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he is hoping the defence will now attack trumps themselves and he can change tack?|pg||
nt|kit: I think Zia is trying to induce his opponents to lead trumps|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|cK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|dburn: thsi time he found them both, but he'd trade one of them for the @sQ on the last deal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jlall: nickell will probably just bid 3N|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: discussed by e/w|pg||

nt|inquiry:  the double is takeout|pg||
nt|jlall: katz will pass, his free 1N has a minimum of about 8|pg||
nt|dburn: ungainly sort of contract at the other table, when North hoped to find a spade fit and a thin game|pg||
nt|ritong: which would have enhanced his hand big time|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: maybe a good 7|pg||
nt|jlall: so his hand is garbage|pg||
nt|ritong: purely so|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bt: trump shift, @SA diamond, duck ace ...|pg||
nt|bt: and east has to play for exactly Jxx in south|pg||
nt|markf:  Declarer could make on trump lead by playing for Jxx offside, but not best line|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|robinswr: with 4531, I would double 1 club |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: when opp have shown themselves to be in swing mode -- does that affect your thought process on defense??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: based on meck's comment when asked if he knew it was his lead the answer is yes it affects your thoughts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X not 2@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|inquiry:  so diamond picked up 11 imps on the last board... as 3@dx was down two at the other table|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1 or 2 down on the @D guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says Gitelman thinks perhaps that was a bit optimustic|pg||
nt|bt: that won paralyze nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss shaking head|pg||
nt|bt: wont|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|robinswr: 5 of clubs probably suit preferance for hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: when singleton in dummy most play suit preferance|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c now would sort of threaten the declarer of a ruff and save the @d Q|pg||
nt|jlall: the players would never guess the imp results, board 2 EW are cold for a vul game and both tables played partial down white... board 3 both made a very difficult 3N, board 4 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: platnick let 4S slip through vul to win 5 against 790...board 6 both sides sold to 2H when they coudl make a partial|pg||
nt|dburn: but, if East can somehow find a diamond shift after @h10, there is a chance to beat 1NT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfc: msp|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlall: good call henri|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5th heart will squeeze him to have to guess for the contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I think he led the queen to deny the king, so if his partner were void he would be forced to ruff.|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any chance he ducks this??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ifhes ducking it he needs ti do it fast|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says we are fine on time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|inquiry:  nine sure tricks here... 4@C, 1@H, 1@H ruff, 2@D and a @S... so play shuld be quick|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: Howeveer, 6@D is the winning contract anyway, since can ruff a club in the short hand -- and diamonds split.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: 6NT or 6@C won't make, but 6@D will.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@D is a pretty good contract; it's not just because of the 3-3 break|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: Or at least can -- will have to guess whether to ruff third round of clubs high or not|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: He will get spade lead.  He must win, queen of clubs, club to ace, club ruff high, and draw trumps.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: that would be wrong if clubs, not diamonds, were 3-3, though? - tricky|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: yes -- he will have to guess.|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose there is a small chance of a major-suit squeeze even if you ruffed high and then found yourself with a trump loser|pg||
nt|chip: And the spade Q may give him some pause.|pg||
nt|athene: spade length with @HKQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will get it right if he believes spades 5-1, since if diamonds 4-2 he can't get back to dummy anyway so must play for diamonds 3-3.|pg||
nt|athene: it's very tricky - after you cash the @CQ and @CA, hasn't the chance of a 3-3 club break gone up?|pg||
nt|chip: But once club J not doubleton, 3-3 clubs much more likely than 3-3 diamonds, so shouldn't make it that way.|pg||
nt|athene: right, that is sort of what i was thinking about|pg||
nt|kit: I think with danger of 5-1 spade split he will take the winning line of play|pg||
nt|athene: how sure can he be that the play to trick 1 means east has a singleton spade?|pg||
nt|athene: i mean for example could the lead have been a singleton?|pg||
nt|chip: Without 5-1 split danger it is right to play Q,A low club planning to ruff low if E follows. This is to cater to E having xx of clubs, or Jxxx and T9 of D.|pg||
nt|chip: But the winning line is definitely not percentage even if suspect spades 5-1.|pg||
nt|kit: All true -- but I'll bet he gets it right -- believing the spade position.|pg||
nt|athene: the other thing is that the auction did not exactly say "lead a spade no matter what your holding in spades", did it?|pg||
nt|kit: if stiff queen of spades, then clearly must play for 3-3 diamonds.|pg||
nt|athene: NS just showed minors|pg||
nt|chip: But even if you know the spades, it still isn't the right line. |pg||
nt|kit: Really Chip?  Why?|pg||
nt|chip: No, can play for clubs to split and diamond 4-2.|pg||
nt|kit: how does he safely get back to draw trumps?|pg||

pc|s8|nt|chip: Now has s strip squeeze to make.|pg||
nt|athene: this can't be right?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have opened his hand, and South opened his, and an opening bid facing an opening bid is a game|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|jlall: I assume you are joking when they open all 11s :)|pg||
nt|ritong: suspect some sarcastic antimodernism of yours:)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - not infrequently these days an opening bid facing an opening bid can't beat game by the other side|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they need to bid and make a slam to flatten the board|pg||
nt|ritong: i rather saw something like 1@d 2@c 2NT 3@d 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: since that perfectly normal @sJ lead at the other table found a layout that blew a trick in the spade suit itself|pg||
mb|6C|nt|kit: he knows he is off an ace and the queen of trumps (4@H was RKC) but he might take his chances anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: now is it possible to play rd here?|pg||
nt|dburn: and when Zia played a heart from the dummy, East didn't split his honours, so 6@d made in comfort in the end|pg||

nt|ritong: oui, perso is @cs|pg||
nt|jlall: so, hampson probably didnt want to bid 2C risking a double|pg||

nt|uday:  Such an innocuous board for such a scary final contract|pg||
nt|inquiry:  this will make a dull hand fairly excliting.. |pg||
nt|jlall: then invite, risking letting them X 3N light for a heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or a spec X|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: he has west to show spade control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did take losing @C finesse after @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: duly accepted|pg||
nt|dburn: 7@d, on the other hand, is a different proposition altogether|pg||
nt|ritong: "i expect 3NT" lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so close Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i am the shame of the profession|pg||
nt|dburn: even though I am sure the lead will be the same, I don't see how he can put 13 tricks together|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: he'll probably ruff as many diamonds as he can|pg||
nt|jlall: he is very much in the bid game or pass school rather than giving them extra info|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: GL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen worse slams    this just needs @D not worse than 42, @C coming in for 5 tricks and a @H @S squeeze|pg||
nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||
nt|markf:  Only real chance is for @D's 3-3 and J@C falling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have a slide rule?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Still, declarer isn't 100% home.  Easier to make 6 than 5, since in 6 you would have to play for QJ doubleton in diamonds.  In 5, you may be guarding against 4-1 split.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz2:  Anyone see a 9th trick for Katz?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet in here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nice lead partner alll laugh|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: a bit similar to push or fold|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the advantages of doing that is that it lets you play sequences that would normally be invitational as forcing, allowing more room to explore good hands|pg||
nt|ritong: in poker|pg||
nt|ritong: true, david|pg||
nt|ritong: modern players do not knit much when in game zone  reg slam, is the contrary imo|pg||
nt|jlall: meckwell play the same exact system in the other room, will be interesting to see what they choose|pg||
nt|dburn: and jlall is quite right when he speaks of giving information away to the opponents - why tell them whether opener is maximum or minimum?|pg||
nt|jlall: on board 37, meck chose to bid like greco, bid 1@S with 4 spades, but then compete to 2S over 2H. Platnick did bid 3@D which i thought was the best bid|pg||
nt|jlall: i love having greco-hampson and meckwell in the same seats because we can compare their judgement within the same basic system|pg||
pc|h2|nt|markf:  I see Gitleman getting 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Heart continuation might have presented more problems, taking out the entry|pg||
pc|h3|nt|inquiry:  certaiin 2@Dxx will make... how many overtricks is the question|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Several people have shown me that if Katz plays 3 rounds of @cs and @hrs, they starts @ss he can't fail to get 9.|pg||
nt|bt: i have had an idea about forbidding my partners to make lead directing doubles|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Dirty Harry said it:  "Are you feeling lucky ... punk?"|pg||
nt|ritong: well, do ya?|pg||
nt|bt: i played in a final match against italy in a european championships, someone decided to double stayman with QJ742 ...|pg||
nt|bt: only one overtrick|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz has focus on making sure of 8 tricks. Gain from an overtrick is much less than the loss from going down 1|pg||
nt|bt: so i can feel your pain here brad moss|pg||
nt|bt: !|pg||
nt|markf:  Hampson could have finessed in 4@S playing for AJ on his right. Would have gone down.|pg||
nt|markf:  Meant Greco|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opponents 2 ways to win|pg||
nt|bt: one we see here|pg||
nt|bt: the other is they get more bidding space|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|inquiry:  nice spade signal, makes defense easy|pg||
nt|dburn: South can duck this and East will be somewhat endplayed, but only for eight tricks and not nine|pg||
nt|jlall: he is still trying to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he wins it, as he has done, there is some danger of down two|pg||
nt|jlall: but now he knows it is very bad|pg||
nt|ritong: fred bravely plays for his good case|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: oh  dummy reversal    i missed that line :(|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: oh, sure - he won't care about extra undertricks while there is a chance to make|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: trying for a dummy reversal, which needs 3-3 diamonds plus clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: So, what is his safety play now?  I don't think he can handle QJxx on his right|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco says good play  Nickell says when he bid 3 NT I was glad I hadn't bid 1NT|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: coward|pg||

mb|4S|nt|dburn: he might well, or at any rate raise only to 2NT which I suppose can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: forcing and natural|pg||
nt|ritong: for the 78 persons who messaged me, how do you translate " the overtrick is huge"?:)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So, 11 imps on a "nothing" hand.|pg||
nt|jlall: no one would force ralph to pass even if nickell bid the slowest 2@H ever|pg||
nt|jlall: of course, irrelevant with nickells actual hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Katz opting for Drury rather than 1@s, which could be passed, or 2@s which presumably would show spades and a heart fit, but myabe not quite this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nickell opened weak 2 in both rooms|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|kit: Bathurst knows better than to lead partner's suit at this stage of the match|pg||
nt|markf:  Hands fit well, 12 tricks in 6NT|pg||
nt|jlall: 2D is very strange, is he looking for slam?|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s should not thrill nickell|pg||
nt|jlall: if it's 3 card drury i can't imagine looking for a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: may be looking for 3NT rather than 4@h, perhaps|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, that is possible|pg||
nt|jlall: we get back to information leakage though|pg||
nt|dburn: and may choose to bid it, having heard 2@s|pg||
nt|petergill: After 1@D - 2@D or 1@C - 2@C inverted, a good idea is for responder to have a bid available over 2NT that asks opener if he has only 3 cards in his suit. |pg||
nt|ritong: are you saying that contract was not good, mark?:)|pg||
nt|dburn: well, six wasn't cold either|pg||
nt|ritong: indeed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 20% chance is better than 0%    but i can't remember by how much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought would at least get a snicker :(|pg||
nt|ritong: wound reopened|pg||
nt|ritong: bleeding restarts|pg||
nt|ritong: time to hit some goodie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman thinking|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfc: constructive bid at least 5 4 or 6 3|pg||
nt|jlall: wow on 38, rodwell did make the responsive X of 1N that hampson did not make, platnick jumped to 3N which was down, and meck saved|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fourth best|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate bidding 3-card majors in response to a t/o double but here there's no reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|jlall: so a possible swing for nickell went to diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: so nick is in slam mood, and not deterred with 2@s|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|markf:  Nickell shouldnt have signed off.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: katz says disappoint if you go down|pg||
nt|ritong: and now, sonny?:)|pg||
nt|dburn: seems so, and like jlall I think that's a bit optimistic with only an eight-card fit|pg||
nt|jlall: did nick ever suggest a slam try? if so i cant imagine ralph would let him out|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@c is slammy|pg||
nt|jlall: and is nick actually thinking here? |pg||
nt|ritong: when 2@s could have been NT oriented|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs|pg||
nt|jlall: nick has gotten very optimistic|pg||
nt|jlall: hes playing his partner for A A QJ of trumps and long clubs i think|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to imagine a hand with more red lights, yes|pg||
nt|jlall: ralph will try for 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the trumps can be played for only one loser, but with spades 4-2 I can't see anything like twelve tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: at least this is only 50 a trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|inquiry:  with @CA gone, a quieck claim coming here.... |pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  this could go down a lot if they duck one @D|pg||
nt|kit: However, the heart lead may be the loser -- since now Bathurst will (may) grab the first round of diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: michael rosenberg has given an excellent suggestion|pg||
nt|jlall: and martha katz|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree, west certainly worth 5NT|pg||
nt|jlall: nick forgot his partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|jlall: then his bidding makes sense|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent point|pg||
nt|jlall: 4D might even be RKC for clubs|pg||
nt|jlall: and 5C 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure if nickell katz play that|pg||
nt|jlall: rodders did pass 1N with the hand hampson bid 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, the bidding may not even be over, since 6@h will come as a shock to Nickell who thinks clubs are trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: currently double checking start of auction and " oh my!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says 4 diamonds is splinter|pg||
nt|dburn: strange to continue to forget partner passed all the way through the auction, when the green card is still sitting on the tray|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell didn't see he was a past hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: small break|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that gives us a chance to see whether this might make in some miraculous way, but I still can't think of one|pg||
nt|ritong: this might take some time, when nick has to recover from the shock before trying to work out a winning case|pg||
nt|jlall: no chance|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jlall: i think you have to play for 3-3 spades and Ax of hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: i think the defending side has a better shot at 3N than these guys do at 1:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I'm not sure that Bathurst will take the chance.  what if declarer had AQx, Axx Qx, AKxxx|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ritong: well, i take it back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: he plays confidently|pg||
nt|jlall: he has only 1 line|pg||
nt|ritong: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: passed hand |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he had more than one - heart to the queen, then play to ruff two diamonds on the table, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: specs suggesting if this heart is ducked, nickell can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: but diamonds 4-4 is less likely than spades 3-3|pg||
nt|jlall: but then south gets in with the HA and gives his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: then again, South could have @hAx and three diamonds, when that line would work|pg||
nt|jlall: if that was the layout you'd be playing for a defensive error since they could play ace and a heart unless spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: as expectable, this won t be a push|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they'd have to play ace and a heart when you led a heart yourself towards the queen, and that's not so clear - but still, probably better to go for the legitimate shot|pg||
pc|d5|nt|inquiry:  contract is going to make. how to play spades... is the only question for katz, i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty clear when he tanks forever and ducks |pg||
nt|dburn: still, after that development Nickell knows at least that hearts are where he wants them|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: they are very good at telling you the results as they know its hard to follow at times|pg||
nt|jlall: oh, i get it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: he was playing for 4-1 spades and the club hook on|pg||
nt|jlall: then he has an endplay|pg||
nt|jlall: after stripping the clubs and playing a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so|pg||
mb|1S|nt|warrens:  yes, and Meck believed S|pg||
nt|jlall: he saw the 4 standard in spades on his right, so he thought it was a stiff|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|jlall: grego will double here|pg||
nt|jlall: greco*|pg||
nt|jlall: as a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: also, @sK will come more frequently from a relatively strong holding, rather than KQ bare|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess he might at that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco reading Katz|pg||
nt|jlall: meck didn't, ut there was a key difference, he was against a strong club pair|pg||
nt|jlall: where 4H might be a 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one of the advantages of strong club|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H here for standard bidders is usually 5 trumps or 4 trumps with shape and not a ton of HCP|pg||
nt|jlall: that makes doubling more attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: could be useful for Milner, this - 3NT won't be reached after this start|pg||
nt|dburn: nor should it be, of course|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, W opened a precision 2@C, which prevented a @D overcall.  now there is no game fo E/Q|pg||
nt|warrens:  e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Answer a man's question and he has information.  Teach him to google and..."|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|ritong: declarer wouyld cover with J9xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, e/q can't make game either|pg||
nt|ritong: in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: so south has a choice between the 9 and his small @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this hand should end quickly|pg||
mb|2D|nt|warrens:  LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: and the pair who post mortem their "bad board" pick up imps on the board, as is so often the case. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so I suppose 4@H shows not a greaat hand for @H, but Garner will not care|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: East says lets hope I counted my aces right today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Drury    does your partnership know how responder shows a good hand with @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: pass?|pg||
nt|jlall: katz does not double 4S because A) he cant beat it B) they might run|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other table has finished play|pg||
nt|dburn: curious deal, in a way - East-West at the other table were quite right to bid 3NT (which needs 4-3 diamonds), East-West at this table are quite right not to|pg||
nt|warrens:  the lead helps, but there's still not hope|pg||
nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 117  Zia playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|jlall: look at it this way|pg||
nt|jlall: his partner had the spade ACE|pg||
nt|dburn: he might not and they might, but surely he expeced to make 4@h - it does seem a bit odd to gamble that passing 4@s is right|pg||
nt|jlall: and 4S can make|pg||
nt|jlall: and would make easily if hampson had the DT|pg||
nt|jlall: saving would be weirder|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: reapeat @cs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||
nt|jlall: and doubling when you think they will often make or have a better spot to run to is not great|pg||
nt|ritong: so, leaping to game is streng verboten for opener|pg||
nt|dburn: this may be a more substantial gain for Diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: repaeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: repeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: omg|pg||
nt|dburn: since 2@d ought to make, and bring in 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|ritong: 11 fingers here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't most  play that Hamman's 2N shows stronger [maybe even Game Force] hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: after 1@s-1NT? I don't know - I guess it's just invitational|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  East will assume his partner has a doubleton @D at most, so he's thinking about 4@C or 5@C or maybe some try like XX.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|inquiry:  double game swing possible on this one... as 4@S looks like it would make (6@S, 2@C, 2@D ruffs).... and 4@h looks like it makes|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, saving would be weird indeed|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bt:  nasty guesses here|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
nt|ritong: covering this makes few sense, for starters|pg||
nt|bt:  after getting spades right decl has to guess what rounded suit to finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|warrens:  is it clear that this isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  playing 4@Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: although some play Henri's favourite Godzilla or whatever it's called|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfc: you only had 19 no only 18 but really good 18|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 7 from east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will do|pg||
nt|markf:  He also can use a spade trick|pg||
nt|bt:  if he gets it right, katz probably should duck one diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bt:  katz should be able to picture the whole hand and what it takes to beat it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlall: if youre not saving i dont think it matters that much whether you think you can make 4H, its just how often do you think you can beat 4S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: and may think that he is obliged to bid anyway|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: especially if pard is like "uh, double? perhaps he wants a special lead"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: to offer a losing choice, you mean|pg||
nt|markf:  I'm surprised Katz won the diamond|pg||
nt|inquiry:  i am told greco and hampson are in 7nt on board 12|pg||
nt|ritong: best katz can do is ducking @d once, and shift @h after cashing his @ss  declarer has a guess|pg||
nt|bt:  at nv imps you should be at 58% or so to bid a grand|pg||
nt|bt:  mathematically|pg||
nt|bt:  though a finesse is good if it makes|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about this  if you know 12 tricks on top, just bid 13|pg||
nt|bt:  as a spec commentated once west shows with @SAQJ and @DK hand is over|pg||
nt|dburn: I'd think it will go down two more often than it will make, but I could be wrong|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bt:  though west wasnt passed so |pg||
nt|ritong: not quite, but is a good clue, yes|pg||
nt|markf:  With West having pointed suit length, odds favor playing for club finesse.|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz was correct in not playing a heart, he's trying to give South a losing option.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I fearlessly predict that the "Lall Hand" will apear in many  bridge columns.|pg||
nt|bt:  which one is that? the lall hand|pg||
nt|ritong: tell gitelmoss they are ahead in the match and you will get a double "heun??"|pg||
nt|ritong: and loses a tapping tempo on lead|pg||
nt|jlall: if katz had doubled, hampson would know he had all 4 spades and make easily from this position|pg||
nt|jlall: however, hammpson still knows that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dburn: we have seen this more than once - a side with a seven-card fit bids as though it had eight or nine, causing opponents to misjudge because each thinks the other short in the enemy ...|pg||
nt|dburn: suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most 2/1 books say 18-19    but  i see trend where it is Game Force|pg||
nt|ritong: you don t like gazouillis, david?|pg||
nt|ritong: pity  really useful gimmick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: it will, and in the right direction to get us another 15 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  You're right, David.  I don't think this young team would withdraw anywhere under 100.|pg||
nt|bt:  at the other table west opened a 2452 1nt and defends 4@S X|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz2:  Father and son participated, one on offense, one on defense in an excellent lesson hand on not rectifying the count for declarer.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish|pg||
nt|bt:  just unlucky i guess|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia-hamman  15-17|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Fred G reasoned (approx) that with "Honour-x in @H and in @C" partner would probably have rebid NT over 1NT, so either heart stop is too weak for 3NT or clubs will not set ...|pg||
nt|petergill: up in time for 3NT - hence Pass - if so, well done by Fred. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz2:  Clearly someone's going to have to invent a defense to Godzilla called Mothra?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|dburn: quite right too, having seen some of the miracle comebacks that their not-altogether-young opponents have managed over the years|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|jlall: or 3H shows a min opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  if the 3 hcp fred has in hearts was in the other major, slam would be reasonable...|pg||
nt|bt:  which is why a 4@H splinter would be more to the point, my partners never have that perfect hand anyway|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Fred will not want to encourage...so he can't pass here... as this has to be forcing pass he is mininum with wasted values in hearts|pg||
nt|inquiry:  so 4@S is weaker than pass... he has to decide if he wants to double or bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Warren -- even in direct seat|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell will correct to the major (if my guess is correct)|pg||
nt|dburn: double by a passed hand often played as a four-card major and a longer minor - not sure what Katz and Nickell use|pg||
nt|jlall: i would be shocked by 3H...perhaps they just changed their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: now we will see one main advantage of kickback|pg||
nt|dburn: good slam, this, and good effort by Hamman and Zia to bid it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfc: ? jump to 4 h what do you do  he says jump to 3 is strong at least we on same page it may not be good|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that, because otherwise Nickell would do what Warren suggests|pg||
nt|jlall: over 5S hampson can bid 5N|pg||
nt|jlall: showing the SK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: chunky NT|pg||
mc|12|nt|jlall: greco does not care about the HQ|pg||

nt|athene: what's zia's style over a strong club?|pg||
nt|warrens:  everything works for N/S on this hand, all 3 finesses onside |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: East will probably just bid 3NT at his next turn, after finding out his partner has nothing.|pg||
mb|p|an|0-5|mb|2H|mb|3N|mb|4H|mb|4N|nt|warrens:  or 5@H Larry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: for 0-5, Hampson has a splendid maximum :)|pg||
nt|kit: Wow -- that is something getting to 4@H, and ditto for 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: is he intending this 4nt as natural, or minors?|pg||
nt|kit: And on heart lead, 4NT goes down.|pg||
nt|warrens:  good bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|athene: greco might be thinking about 6@C if his partner has both minors and a singleton in a major?|pg||
nt|kit: Greco was confident that 3NT better contract than 5@C.  But 4NT vs. 5@C not so clear, particularly since he knows he is getting a heart lead.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|warrens:  LOL|pg||

nt|jcwla:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=97+KQ9+AKQ95+QJ8   17.3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: laughing as similar to past 3nt but no heart suit|pg||
nt|jlall: or maybe he just liked his partner having no HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5s you 5N shows Spade K  yes answer|pg||
nt|ritong: he was aware about @s short anyways|pg||
nt|jlall: since it meant it wasnt wasted and partner had points elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: prolly via 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the last board of the 3rd set restart in 15 min or so|pg||
nt|petergill: Gazzilli also at http://freebridge.blogspot.com.au/2009/08/gazzilli.html|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to spec's commentator's USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for the wonderful broadcast of the USBC|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for broadcasting this championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I was mistaken about precision, but once partner bid 2@D, Kranyak decided that partner didn't have enough for game|pg||
nt|ritong: this is the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an honest opening -- go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroth says great match to justin and kevin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to commentators|pg||
nt|ritong: not vulnerazble:)|pg||
nt|ritong: possible 2 imps swing, tho|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|warrens:  I'm even more surprised|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 down in 5@c|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bigtrain: 1C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: pass = 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1 major|pg||
nt|warrens:  this must show a pretty good hand at unfavorable |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is multi... 1 major|pg||
nt|petergill: The 11 imp swing on Bd 59 was mainly thanks to Bob Hamman bidding 4@S rather than 5@C chosen in a similar situation at this table. |pg||
nt|warrens:  so Moss must be thinking 2@S or 3@S|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: perhaps 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: showing a good hand for @hs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - some (including perhaps Wolpert) might have taken the view that 2@d was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
nt|markf:  Allan, often pairs playing complex systems have not worked out many details, especially with intervention.|pg||
nt|ritong: other room will certainly overcall and raise @ss|pg||
nt|inquiry:  last hand,, thanks to the  voice commentators (al graves and peter lund), to our excellent vugraph operator (debbie hyatt i think)... and to |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: restart in about an hour and 15 min|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Viewgraph schedule adjust to your timezone:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: xx + points|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  good lead|pg||
nt|jlall: nickell is like secretariat, loves starting in a hole and digging out of it. already did it once this tournament (sorry warren)|pg||
nt|ritong: basic game try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one more set tonight and four tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
nt|warrens:  np :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman is 73 (or 74) years old. Aging does not seem to apply to his bridge. |pg||
nt|athene: south might now find a heart lead given 2@S shows heart support?|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  I think Moss should have bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  another swing to Nickell, so it'll be close for tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 64-19 set for Nickell|pg||
nt|markf:  Not that it would have mattered|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, 3NT is surely based on a good/running @c suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  Aging does affect Hamman.  He gets better!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event   shows schedule with viewer's local timezone|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is 65. My source is the Bridge Encyclopedia. Meckwell are mid 50's. |pg||
nt|11jaszczak: lepiej jak w Polsce:)|pg||
nt|ritong: so, it is not clearcut that meck has a huge @s stopper|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|bigtrain: played 1-2-3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unless they had the names wrong|pg||
nt|markf:  Moss had to bid 4@S to have an affect|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Jeff Meckstroth May 15, 1956;  Eric Rodwell May 1, 1957.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman asks show 0-5 Rodwell can't trap when we don't know your suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 21 imps away from the best birthday presents they could get|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
nt|ritong: bid GAME TRY to make it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|inquiry:  i hear 4@C on board 14 in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroths not going down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: they are HOT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set short break please come back to join us|pg||
nt|inquiry:  north at this table, fred gitelman for providing bbo for all o f us.... and the usbf for the exciting match|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  a @C lead in the other room made this hand easier|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy to make this one|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah definitely down|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know if there is any legitimate make now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not definitely, but he will need to take some pretty good views|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director in --|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, maybe the Director knows how to make it - that should help|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 or imps away from the birthday present, I should say - now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  defense needs to get @D's going |pg||
nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on 118  but   congrats to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final also 2 days  120 boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb:  goodnight Debbie|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|ritong: fred and brad will leave the room with rounded shoulders, but the smile on their teammates faces should reassure them:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|markf:  Bye all.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jlall: i am told gib could make it from there, i was still thinking about it double dummy! i assure you nothing single dummy would come close|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjsb:  tthank u very much ! |pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfc: q of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: he worked it out - well done him|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly any normal line would fail - maybe he could have won the second spade in his hand and played a heart|pg||
nt|bobholl: DD a@S @D @C finesse @C ruffed with @S Q |pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all.  See you for sessions 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Moss's 2@S - pass or correct - implied better hearts than spades, so Gitelman was choosing between a @h and @DA and misguessed.  |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|ritong: 12 away 42 left|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, Secretariat may be starting his move with that board - we shall soon see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no|pg||
nt|ritong: was included|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|markf:  Ralph hs created some problems for himself; allowing diamond discard|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks all |pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all, see you for 4th session today and 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks will see you after the break for the second set of the finals of the USBD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: USBC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 min still in the set and probably 15 min break restart at 12:25 chicago time|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Fernando Lema sent me:  http://csbnews.org/usbc-final-time/?lang=en|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: night all|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@s overcall worked better than 2@s as it allowed NS to find their @h fit - but one always wants to overcall the strong club as high as possible - so 2@S was normal over the strong ...|pg||
nt|petergill: club. |pg||
