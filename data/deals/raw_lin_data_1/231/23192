mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other table and access voice without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure if Ace is attitude or count..prob att since he wouldn't want unblock|pg||
nt|bt:  east has a nice hand on this auction|pg||
nt|bt:  i am all for penalizing opps but if a vulnerable slam is very likely, i would just take my chances there|pg||
nt|inquiry:  diamond is in 6@h at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hi joe|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome back, Henri.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=negative/takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes X = 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: lead e/w|pg||
nt|uday:  Hola - can I talk a couple of kibs into being commentators?  If you're interested, send me a msg :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think west should pull, in no way is this a penalty doube, but then again i know they are koached by kokish|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 5th of 8 segments of the finals of the trials for the team to represent the USA in the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt will make in comfort|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow 4+ cards in nt  std NT honors of short suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlall:  hi all|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Lall will certainoy shift to a club now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads 3rd and low|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway competitive bidding is difficult for all of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4 clubs splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: need x tra value to bid 3 clubs answer yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Because East's Dbl indicates @S's, Brad Moss prefers 3@D to (Dbl of 3@C) or Pass. If Brad passed, Fred would have bid 3@H I think. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a while  but Hampson balanced with 4N|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This is the 4th 15 bd segment of the finals of the team trials to determine the USA entry to the Mind Games.  4 more segments are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubtedly showing 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table and voice commentary available without login  using  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it is thunder and lightening and pouring rain here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: per System Summary Form   vs NT  King is strong lead, so Ace did ask attitude|pg||
nt|jlall:  i can hear voice commentary today :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: reg smith|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry:  needs to hold to something like down five to win imps, that means five tricks|pg||
nt|3for3:  my mother 'if you don't like the weather in chicago (or philly) move!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bt:  how many tricks for declarer? 3@S and a club?|pg||
nt|jlall: not clear how to play this, but winning and playing a club seems natural |pg||
nt|jlall: he might try the DK first|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Good morning, Justin.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: Now Lall has a problem -- he may not know the club position.|pg||
nt|jlall:  Meck with great spdes, but he still has A9 of clubs and a partner who ha bid NT, so he opts for 3N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz2:  With us today is Justin Lall, one of the most promising young players in the USA today.  His team was eliminated by Nickell in the semi-finals.|pg||
nt|jlall:  thanks for reminding me|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell is considering whether to remove 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  given that meck seems to have shown doubt about NT and his ruond suits are T8x and Jxx|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry but getting there is far advanced compared to anything most of the rest of us can do.|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, sorry i forgot to put a smiley :) was joking of course, thanks for the introduction|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think rodders will pass|pg||
nt|jlall:  notice that it is not clear if you just look at the EW hands what game you want to be in|pg||
pc|s2|nt|uday:  Welcome. We have Mark Feldman, SantyClz2, and Lars Anderson ( who has to run off in 30 ) as commentators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson playing 5@CX West|pg||
nt|petergill: With good cards in both of partner's suits, Fred gos to 4@H, which is doomed by the 4-0 break. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: they may have changed 1 or 2 things since then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If no 4-0 trump break, 4@H needs (@SAQ onside and no @d ruff), or @S blockage (e.g Ax in West) or (defence doesn't find @s switch in time). Not that bad a contract. |pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|jlall: interesting, if katz had AKT of hearts would he have gone down?|pg||
nt|ritong: amazing|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Fred can apologise for bidding game and Moss can apologise for not making it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's not used to Meck going into the tank|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d!|nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman is not opening 1N because his hand is too good, he's perfectly fine opening it with that shape|pg||
nt|3for3:  north south play what has become known as meckwelllight...so they will each be somewhat familiar with the others system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell treat that as a weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL = cards   14+|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Vugraphzfc: is nosiy outside in hall way|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson did not open a strong club, somewhat surprising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can;/t see explanation|pg||
nt|3for3:  platnick getting both suits in|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: X can iclude 5+@S GF|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C suit opener's limited to max of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jlall: probably needed a pointed suit ten|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bt:  as we see, gittelman strongly believes in counting ppoints for nt, again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss dont have much pd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman overcalled 4@S   strange to see moss taking lower road|pg||
nt|ritong: brave raise  will work super here|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth not done yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman realized at the adverse vulnerability that Brad Moss had a serious hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  You may note that we only quote these "rules" when they would have worked out.|pg||
nt|jlall:  he has chosen to bid 2N even over 1S rather than 2C|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is much more clear over a 1H response|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: This shows secondary diamond suit, not natural|pg||
nt|dburn: and not done at all|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Last session of the day.  Meckwell aren't exactly juniors any more. Fatigue may be becoming an issue.|pg||
nt|jlall:  but hes trying to protect his round suit honors and give away less info, that is his style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: in the other room, ok ok :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome Henri.|pg||
nt|jlall: 2S is a constructive raise, with no game interest they start with 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe 2@D=@D + major|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell will be pleased to find 4 card support. lots of losers though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||
nt|3for3:  one less loser now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: std leads |pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Looks like 8 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bt:  and Qxx in spades a stopper|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    says south worth 17.90|pg||
nt|jlall:  Fred would have done better to correct to 4S, but that is a complete guess, even knowing north has 5 spades and at most 3 hearts, north could easily have an honor|pg||
nt|jlall:  basically, he was all in on the HQ being a positional value|pg||
nt|jlall:  that looks much smarter when partner has K9x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  only non-standard carding agreement is  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their ACBL CC   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|3for3:  45 boards to go, alan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult  --  especially of the future|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
pc|d9|nt|markf:  On hand 1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|inquiry:  well yes, that too... but on lead looks like that is working|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bt:  solid 8% game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
nt|jlall: this could be a huge swing for NS|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
nt|uday:  Any experienced kibs feel like jumping in with commentary? buzz me|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman's choice of 4@S made it harder for EW to find the save - 5@C by East over Hamman's 4@s might be a good hand that gets raised to 6@C.|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will overtake the SK and hook a club first|pg||
nt|jlall:  clubs before diamonds, because it might be KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both boards  large swings on very minor differences in evaluation/guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bt:  AK onside, KJ onside, @D 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Katz playing 2@D north   after he found strange opening bid of 1@H|pg||
nt|3for3:  very strange to open a 5 card major when in range for nt...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|jlall: if nickell had overcalled michaels, west would not know his partner had clubs though so he might not be overly aggressive|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfc: moss playing with 9 and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: or KQ or KJ doubleton legitimatily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most situations  EW carding  upside-down: count, attitude, smith AND suit-preference|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Now the spade shift, although it isn't necessary since South has third trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson claims 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth trying to get hearts out of the way before playing ace and a diamond in the hope of a blockage|pg||
nt|3for3:  even 5422 seems to be many people's idea of NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampsons says they could make 5 clubs Greco are you trying to make him feel better|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about these hands|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|3for3:  alas, sarcasm doesn't travel the internet as well as one might like...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not surprising that Katz-Nickell favor 1@H followed by 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: we really need walter to describe the [proprietary] documented exceptions|pg||
nt|jlall:  zia chose to rebid 2C, hamman chose to pass that (slightly low because partner might have 3 spades, but clearcut imo), so this will be a small swing to nickell|pg||
nt|jlall:  finding a way to get to 4S gets the cash on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall:  but that is a very lucky contract assuming they don't let you ruff a heart|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jlall:  the 3H bid just showed 5 spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: a side four carder is worth a supplementary card in the long suit|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|inquiry:  looks like will be down one... a small pickup|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|jlall:  he was telling his partner to bid 4S with 3 spades and pass otherwise, similar to 1N 2H 2S 3N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dburn: succeeded with half of that plan, but not the other half|pg||
nt|bigtrain: partial elimination now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: so here, big bob treated his hand as an eight bagger|pg||
pc|c7|mc|9|nt|jlall:  fred goin for a pseudo squeeze|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|dburn: not a shabby result for Nickell at the other table, this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would love to know how he knew to play Diamond for 2542|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfc: chuckes|pg||
nt|jlall: this time hampson upgrades|pg||
nt|petergill: Moss followed the theory "preempt one level lower when vul vs not vul, and one level higher when at fav vul" but it didn't work this time, due to Meckstroth's boldness. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn: game the other way has only three top losers, though maybe not ten winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 hcp, 5+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs using same opening bid structure in their versions of precision|pg||
nt|3for3:  I hear 4@S is making in other room|pg||
nt|3for3:  doubled to boot|pg||
mb|4H|nt|inquiry:  both pairs play bidding, ew use standard carding, ns use upside down signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S 1-suit, weaker than starting with DBL|pg||
nt|markf:  Theymay play 3@S shws a stiff|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's WBF Convention Card from a few years ago http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems%5C2005worldchampionships-estoril%5Cbermudabowl%5Cusa%202/gitelman-moss+notes.pdf |pg||
nt|dburn: and Rodwell may take a shot at it, despite the vulnerability (or maybe because of it, since East is supposed to have a sound hand)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A good plan for advancing players is to believe the opp's signals early in the hand.  Be a little more suspicious later in the hand.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2h + 4|pg||
nt|bt:  this is the games you want to bid, at worst a diamond finesse and some extra chanses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just Stayman without stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss's PASS worked really well in the auction|pg||
nt|jlall:  1N in both tables because they play the same system, opening 1D in natural is much more appealing than in RM precision|pg||
nt|3for3:  might easily be duplicated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|markf:  Dull hand, easy to bid and make 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: 1@H shows 8-11 points, denies 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and Nickell has a winning position now whatever happens|pg||
nt|petergill: Another 10 imps if South passes. |pg||
nt|petergill: or 11 imps if South bids 6@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: 1N = 11-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: only one singleton king likely to score here|pg||
nt|jlall:  with this kind of hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as in other room  intereference gives East an easy bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  a diamond lead wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|bt:  except for us seeing all hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: this denies the king|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says please stop that  -- have to lead it its the contract|pg||
nt|kit: diamond shift now, and defense will have many tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia got to open north hand 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: even spade followed by diamond will work|pg||
nt|markf:  Nickell has a difficult Opening Lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
nt|jlall: natural bidding after 1H|pg||
nt|3for3:  i dont see what north south did wrong in the auction.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bigtrain: asks @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if you normally lead A from AK  at 5+ level you often want to lead unsupported Ace -- so switch back to K from AK and show COUNT to aid cashout|pg||
pc|hT|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
nt|petergill: On @DK lead, 4@s might make|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S or 4@SX e.g @DK to ace, @SJ wins, @D ruff, @SA, spade to dummy, @D 10 pitching a club. Doesn't help N to cover @SJ. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: eric once explained some very esoteric reason to me but has since admited they just found it easier to think all upside-down|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
nt|jlall: on a club lead if greco ducks 3N can be defeated|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th  best  smith echo|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has just stuck with his diamonds, I'm not sure about that|pg||
nt|jlall: greco almost for sure is 1534 on the bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: and hampson has announced 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: if greco had 2 spades he would have raised spades at some point, and with 1 spade and 2 diamonds he wouldnt bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is very tricky with no communication|pg||
nt|jlall: however, EW have no suit to attack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco is shaking his head|pg||
nt|jlall: he can win, play a spade, club back he wins the ace, cashes a heart, plays a spade|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a winning line|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
nt|3for3:  obviously we can see ns would have been better off bidding 5@H/4@S, but it is hard to see who should have done something different|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bt:  there is a case for west returning a small heart at second trick, give decl xxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:  with @CA in east, @DK in west is likely|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jlall: but thats because we can see all the hands|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jlall: so far, so good|pg||
nt|bt: decl can place north w @C A or K, thus diamond situation is clear|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: if it asks for " help", @c A becomes very leadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  with @CAK  south would lead the suit   with neither -- he doesn't have opening bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond lead opening|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good play by katz|pg||
nt|jlall: he will go up with the ace here|pg||
nt|jlall: he needs hand entries, even if the CK is on going up with the ace is correct|pg||
nt|warrens:  if the defense cashes their two winners, they can win 3 imps (assuming declarer guesses the @D suit)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: giving up a sure 300 vs maybe losing a +50 is poor strategy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|3for3:  welcome bigtrain|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 8 of @H's looks like a count card, so Diamond might know that the @H will cash|pg||

nt|jlall: board 2 NS lost imps, platnick overcalled 2H then when he got raised he didnt bid game, it was random that his partner had fitting clubs rather than diamond honors with no clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco friendly hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ctchall @D coming up|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: catchall|pg||
nt|petergill: previous board: If Greco bid 4@s at other table, Hamman's 1@C opening ruled out @dK lead.   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco in 4@H east|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D is catchall...  2+ 11-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: a little needle after makin that, can't blame him|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|mcphee: just a guess on my part:)|pg||
nt|petergill: says "highest spot we can afford from weakness (usually 2nd)" |pg||
nt|kit: if 4@S is contract, opening lead may be critical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt zia opens 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Greco in 2@S East|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||
nt|markf:  If they dont play Puppet over 2NT, this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|bt:  another thin slam, will greco hampson bid it up again?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X can include 5@H GF|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss helped win his side that swing for passing 1N when hamman overcalled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from 2010 CC   2N = ogust|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not open 2@S on North hand.  Personally, I think it is a close call.|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@S is a down the middle bid for hampson at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jlall: probably doesnt like Jxx of hearts but what can you do|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows non-max shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: must put my bifocals on again :)|pg||
nt|bt:  and make on the spade lie|pg||
nt|bt:  aha they are sitting out, luckily for nickell :)|pg||

nt|jlall: that greco raised|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think MW play 2 way drury|pg||
nt|jlall:  not 100 % sure|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: only Mollo would have EW declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: shocking dummy for fred|pg||
nt|markf:  His hand is certainly worth 2NT|pg||
nt|bt: there is a trend of opening nt when in the approximate range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says tell me when to stop|pg||
nt|jlall: nick will probably bid here|pg||
nt|jlall: could be double game swing, double shows cards and he has all red suit values/length|pg||
nt|jlall: and his opps are r/w, I just don't see him passing here |pg||
nt|jlall: im told voice commentators betting against the pull|pg||
nt|jlall: tough call either way!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: well i did not expect garner to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e 11 to 14|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rodwell says has distributional hand of some sort|pg||
mb|p|nt|uday:  The other table opened 1H and reached 4H on the same lead|pg||
nt|jlall: great decision, and good job voice commentators :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3hearts is invitational|pg||
nt|warrens:  almost impossible to convince declarer that North had the @D queen, once North showed up with KJ of @S's and A of @C's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says are you going to guess the clubs|pg||
nt|markf:  In terms of playing strength, this is better than many 21 HCP hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: asked again how many points do you have again Katz  only two again you think you will get any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction     Nickell led @C7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|robinswr: katz and Nickell must play redouble followed by double as coop and pass followed by double as penalties|pg||
nt|kit: And East found killing lead it looks like|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to play on diamonds, and hope for good splits|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Zia did pass but still declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred knows dummy has short hearts, because his partner made a takeout |pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: He gets them, but the trump promotion on the clubs will defeat him.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's fine i think|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think the needed to play @S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jlall:  X showing hearts|pg||
nt|jlall:  also, fred really had no appealing lead other than that too. it looks like his side has more than half the deck, dummy has shortness in both majors, and meck has a major 2 suiter, definitely a good thematic lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will play the DK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I believe Meckwell in the 34th year of their partnership.  Even if I'm off by a few years, they've had time to generate a significant number of agreements.|pg||
nt|jlall:  it kills the entry for the CQ if declarer has stiff K of clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfc: 1nt by w = transfer bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: so he was kind of forced to wait for partner to re-open|pg||
nt|mcphee: if brad hooks this the defence can do some damage|pg||
nt|mcphee: West will be in a position to score all of his trumps!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlall: this is not an unreasonable play at all|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he had to finesse here, to make - was a guess|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: they won their 1st national event [pairs] in Norfolk 1979   i remember because navy had invited me to move there just a couple of months earlier|pg||
nt|jlall:  they make fun of me sometimes for playing too fast but sometimes they are 100 % to make a play and it takes them a 30 seconds...they are just double checking everything though, it's a good thing to do|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|jlall: if katz has 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jlall: nick thinks he has to get clubs going|pg||
nt|kareno:  As long as you aren't in (or likely to be) in time trouble.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Hamman treated south hand as 18-19 |pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell leans in|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  9 of @H's looks like suit preference for @S's. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcphee: good shift|pg||
nt|jlall:  the key decision on this hand was really moss playing the SA|pg||
nt|jlall:  the ten at trick 1 looks possible|pg||
nt|jlall:  im not sure what would happen from there, maybe diamond over heart heart heart ruff club|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|jlall: hampson could have KQJxxxx xx x Kxx for instance|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd finessed in hearts he might have been OK, but perhaps not now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: =|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: KnR  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi   says south worth 17.15|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hi |pg||
nt|jlall:  henry says they made it without even phooking the heart|pg||
nt|jlall:  at the other table, on the ST play|pg||
nt|jlall:  north can just pitch diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can?   isn't @D obligatory for the beat??|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jlall:  well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm cheating -- looking at all 4 hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall:  this is a good play by meck|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think hes making|pg||
nt|jlall:  he is going to strip out gitelman|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss must return a diamond to tap meck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet most viewers don't see why @H good play -- can you explain Justin?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlall: or Axx of clubs|pg||
nt|jlall:  but then gitelman gets stripped out of his reds|pg||
nt|jlall:  and plays the CK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: duck j|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't think he'll make 5 if North ducks the @D Jack|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sK|nt|jlall: but all of that is for down 2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but then only 1! winner|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says sorry|pg||
nt|markf:  I dont think he could have made if finesse worked, that's why he didnt finesse|pg||
nt|jlall:  if moss does not tap meck he simply sets up long heart|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: go SOX!!!!|pg||
nt|jlall:  so mecks low heartp lay was dual purpose|pg||
nt|jlall:  it started to strip gitelman|pg||
nt|jlall:  while threatening to set up his long heart|pg||
nt|jlall:  i agree with voice commentators, moss had to just pitch his diamonds...that seems natural also |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|jlall:  pitching a club created a whole threat where you have to keep meck out of dummy|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks low from 3 small? yes says platnick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfc: GUESS??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now they are in cuebidding mode|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C coming up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C pure cue or source of tricks?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cuebid|pg||
nt|kit: they did stop in 4@H at other table, so possible swing for Milner.|pg||
nt|jlall: he is going to cash his spades and play a heart to the jack|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: thats surprising|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serious|pg||
nt|ritong: they usually have very sound preempts  perhaps is allergic to 7222|pg||
nt|jlall:  i would do it with extreme disparity|pg||
nt|jlall:  like that|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S has an automatic 2@c bid according to Sabine Auken.|pg||
nt|jlall:  but usually not|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall:  people asking if meck is worth a 3S raise, personally I would not bid 3S|pg||
nt|jlall:  its NV and you have no idea if partner has club values or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Platnick asks could He have a 5 card minor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: (Rodwell)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfc: on D hook|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  She's a big believer in taking the 1 level away from the opponents.|pg||
nt|bt: a spade back makes this very interesting|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Bd 49: if @H hook, he has to play very precisely I think (without looking at gib, I never would do that) - I think he has to then play @Da, @d ruff, @SA, @d ruff then club and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guess to finess the nine - not easy|pg||
nt|ritong: and side opposition|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlall: then he will duck 2 rounds of clubs and win the third|pg||
nt|jlall: at which point, he will have to guess diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm shocked with the poor trump|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will all aces and spaces judged that he needed his partner to be able to take control.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must really like the @C trick source|pg||
nt|jlall: unlucky pitch|pg||
nt|jlall: but it should be noted, once nickell tanked for a long time on that pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says when can we get to give out smith signals|pg||
nt|jlall: greco was a lock to get @D right|pg||
nt|bt: west can make by finessing clubs and endplaying north|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell now knows where the honors are, since the defense gave up on the hearts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says that was a weakkkkkkkkkkkk raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all laughter|pg||
nt|markf:  Looks like a par result; 3@S down 1, would make 3@H|pg||
nt|jlall: with Axx of diamonds nickell would not be pained|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Hampson also in 3N on lead of @H9  [Nickell bid 2@H on 2nd round]|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bigtrain: generally speaking the top priority to determine is trump strength|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall:  perhaps the master bid is 1D p 1S p 2D p 2S p 3H showing 2461 and an invite, thats the only way they would ever get to this game|pg||
nt|jlall:  haha|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|mcphee: even if he continues @D it will still go 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jlall: katz also pitched a painless diamond which is hard to do with Qxxx staring at KJxx|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Bd 49 - if you do all that, you might then say Sorry for taking so long  :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bt: @H A then @CT is not obvious|pg||
nt|3for3:  he needs to play a club now...|pg||
nt|3for3:  then later throw ibn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winning team represents USA in the world champships [formerly Team Olympiad]  later this year in France   |pg||
nt|3for3:  great shift by platnick, btw|pg||
nt|3for3:  needs to win 3 spades, 3 clubs, ace of hearts...then throw in diamond with long spade|pg||
nt|bt: south is probably known to be 36 in majors by now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes it does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can't set up spades and play 3rd round of @C both|pg||
nt|3for3:  dont cash heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Platnick trick 2 shift was @S2   Nickell played @D9|pg||
nt|3for3:  need that for transportation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still hs @HA for @C fineese|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it works|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C10...  what do you want N to do?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt made in other room|pg||
nt|3for3:  nickel shifted to diamond and it was clear sailing from there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he has to play exact but can make from here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: if N ducks the @C10 THEN you cash @HA and play the last @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry |pg||
nt|warrens:  If he led the @C 8, N could have beaten this hand by going up and blocking the suit.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now @HA  and a club|pg||
nt|3for3:  great hand, this|pg||
nt|3for3:  12 imps, the current difference hang in the balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell again sorry for taking so long|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes 8 of clubs overtaken by 9|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that was a very strange @C8... i wonder if the operator got it wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm assured she didn't|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but leading the 8 makes it possible for N to defeat a cold contract|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to lead the @C10 to start an unblock|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W had the unblock clubs to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: okay|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|jlall: so hard to believe greco could go wrong in D ever|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: says rodwell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: leading the 8 allows th defense to suceed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|warrens:  Diamond can beat this now by cashing a @C and exiting a red card or he can play a spade.  but he can't play a red card first.|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|kit: Canape overcall -- new style :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = art GF raise|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Black Magic" is a term invented by Edgar Kaplan circa 1970 to describe how many partnerships were able to show widely disparate values with the same bids.|pg||
nt|bt: yea, edgar is my guru|pg||
nt|bt: and amazingly black magic is still around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I am typing what they say not any bridge analysis :)|pg||
nt|ritong: somehow perspiring through your sarcastic tones, i d say  kaplan was a master at that|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If I caused some confusion, I'm attributing name to Kaplan, not the methods.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 50 - 3NT was the right contract - unlucky. 3@d also fails, so you should be in 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of the 2/1 pairs open South   ALL of the big clubbers would |pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume you're home justin :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sabine's book is "I Love This Game."|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Will certainly get them to 4@S, but Rodwell won't be quitting|pg||
nt|bt: i wish edgar was still around|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H promises 4|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, I am enjoying listening to the voice commentary today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or he found a way to charge his laptop while on a never ending flight|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfc: tiger broom to sweep the streets|pg||
nt|kit: in 5@H, Rodwell will have to guess the heart position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin overcalls 1@S  Bathurst jumps to 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meck says pass by rodwell is ambiguous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously that was supposed to go to other table|pg||
nt|kit: with no enemy bidding, they got to 5@H in other room.|pg||
nt|bt: anyway gitleman has an interesting hand on this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like|pg||
nt|ritong: had the merit to crystalball @s Q off|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl to slow the auction down and avoid poor 4@h contracts, perhaps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: sold for 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what a great partner|pg||
nt|markf:  4@H seems like a lot; may be making his partner guess|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred must be amused by all the bidding with partner jumping in hearts!!! |pg||
nt|bt: west has a diamond lead, i think, unless there is a rule against leading from kQ|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This would appear to come under the heading of a "sound game" for Meckwell.|pg||
nt|dburn: needs a little more than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Was Hampson's Rdbl at other table a "pretend Support Dbl": due to being 4333? I don't know. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 21-23|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|bigtrain: game try X|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says my usually dummy pd|pg||
nt|jlall: normal auction here, but NS should have been competing|pg||
nt|ritong: moss treated it as a t/o double based on @hs, with "nebulous" @d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D - transfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|markf:  I'm impressed with Fred's Pass|pg||
nt|markf:  Can make 6 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman says best dummy of the day Katz says we know who was thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: impossible to know, hampson did not want to squeal on spades because he might defend 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  2N is some bid by moss|pg||
nt|jlall:  he was really hoping they'd take the push to 3S|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  must be a rule....against leading ffrom kq...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jlall: and also because he is vul at imps with a bad hand|pg||
nt|jlall: greco not close to balancing with only 3 spades and KT of hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mcphee: this is a pretty good game, not clear if he will make|pg||
nt|phil: Zia led the @sA against 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Lall needs to cash ace of spades to give declarer a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so much for that -- now heart guess for 6|pg||
nt|jlall: that is life sometimes|pg||
nt|jlall:  this would probably be a very interesting hand to play in 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm not sure you could make 4|pg||
nt|jlall:  strange to see meckwell and greco-hampson miss back to back games, no matter how low HCP they are|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes|pg||
nt|jlall:  with both black suits off|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: with this amount of bidding, you can look at the vulnerability and see who is pushing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco opened 2N and superaccept to 4@H -- i wouldn't have guessed EITHER action|pg||
nt|3for3:  this hand will definitely be faster than the previous one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: he will now|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if they can find their heart ruff now, this is down two... |pg||
nt|3for3:  i dont like to make predictions but...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: maybe Katz could play a then k to show spade values|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|inquiry:  looks like they have it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: fred has @dQx, visibly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bt: not to mention he can look under the screen and see who is his partner|pg||
nt|ritong: playing him for @h voàid as well is surprising|pg||
nt|jlall:  Henry says the other room found the CT play from dummy|pg||
nt|jlall:  here meck might play for Jx|pg||
nt|jlall:  oh sorry, rodwell is declaring|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  In order to hear the audio commentary you must be using the web version of BBO:  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer led @C after |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|jlall: greco trying to deny katz an entry to hook the heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10  after @D eliminated|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman would have done better to play a heart honor|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should have cashed ace of spades first -- time to get diamond ruff after that, and not likely anybody is void in spades.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: but, as lall said, who am i to argue meck's choices|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|jlall:  the idea being, to make declarer think moss has 6 hearts for his vulnerable 2N bid|pg||
nt|jlall:  which would make him play for Jx of clubs on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell:  "Dbl (instead 2NT) by Moss would have been -ve, right?".  Gitelman: Yes|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: jack of hearts percentage play anyway, as South could have AQ10|pg||
nt|jlall: katz is not to be denied|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|jlall: he is goig to be getting scared|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think he is playing moss for 2542|pg||

nt|jlall:  3H wa a good rebid, if he bid 2H north might have doubled|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which of them was closer to a bid - I guess South could open a random weak two or bid 2@s over 1NT, but both of those look a bit hairy|pg||

nt|warrens:  for those asking about the last hand, yes, declarer could have made 5 if he won the @C Ace and exited a small one.  but he could have made 6 if it was QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play u/d suit preference|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 = u/d attitude|pg||

nt|bigtrain: sorry for poor typing skills everyone :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|inquiry:  he has to lose 1@C, 1@H, and 2@S... with no lines to try avoid those losers....he is  worrying about fred having five spades|pg||

nt|jlall:  they had no chance at this table|pg||

nt|inquiry:  he may try to shorten his trumps by ruffing diamonds twice... but everything seems to be down one.|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think greco should pass 2@H henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps even two fits, when west was not hot to raise to 3@h with three  here, 3@d would have hit big|pg||

pc|sA|nt|jlall: yeah thats a good point, with an 8 card fit when you bid to 2S they will often compete further|pg||

nt|warrens:  Debbie, did he make it or give up a ruff and go down 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: appeal was from segment  5  board  69|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, which?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jlall: nick might consider overcalling 1N if r/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: since they will be stealing a lot|pg||
nt|jlall: but r/r is a different story|pg||
nt|ritong: brad will make some try here, but they have no fit, so i expect 3NT at last|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia in 6@D on @SJ lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d not too bad|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss figured it out though|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: yes down one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Will they get to the "cold" 6D contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably includes balanced game force   so could be 2@C|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow leads with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  but nickell will ahve to find a spade after taking the last heart....|pg||
nt|jlall: hampsons partners range is 11-13, and not a great 13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: did not see bidding here ask ? being asked|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 2N showing 3@D??|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: Zia in 3N north|pg||
nt|ritong: take that, ritong:)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If someone wants to be imortalized in wikipedia, there doesn't appear to be an article about The Bridge Journal.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well back to the commentaing...  talk with you later ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss gets a warning from the director for taking excessively long time on the last bd|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, i think 3D is a transfer to 3N, the idea being you want the overcaller on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, of course, does not play such conventions for obvious reasons|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|inquiry:  ew also had 8 trick in spades, so down two is not horrible result..the defense is not going to be all that clear|pg||
nt|jlall:  playing on spades seems natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell on bathroom break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when i have time will do score or I will miss this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  4@H=rkc for @D's|pg||

nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: blasty|pg||
nt|jlall: i am stunned|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jlall: maybe he didnt bid 2N because he wanted to avoid a double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have opened his hand, and South opened his, and an opening bid facing an opening bid is a game|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|jlall: I assume you are joking when they open all 11s :)|pg||
nt|ritong: suspect some sarcastic antimodernism of yours:)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - not infrequently these days an opening bid facing an opening bid can't beat game by the other side|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they need to bid and make a slam to flatten the board|pg||
nt|ritong: i rather saw something like 1@d 2@c 2NT 3@d 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: since that perfectly normal @sJ lead at the other table found a layout that blew a trick in the spade suit itself|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: he knows he is off an ace and the queen of trumps (4@H was RKC) but he might take his chances anyway|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bt: now is it possible to play rd here?|pg||
nt|dburn: and when Zia played a heart from the dummy, East didn't split his honours, so 6@d made in comfort in the end|pg||
nt|3for3:  north did not open 3nt, needless to say|pg||
nt|3for3:  normal 3nt with an overtrick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the appeal centers around   moss as declarer in 3N  rodwell making an off-tempo encouraging signal and meckstroth shifting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: being asked ? I did not see bidding so this is the contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jlall: i am pretty sure that they play 2N as artificial over 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, perso is @cs|pg||
nt|jlall: so, hampson probably didnt want to bid 2C risking a double|pg||
nt|ritong: guess 6@c asks for third round control|pg||
nt|jlall:  Sorry to harp on this point, but imagine playing a bunch of boards against guys who are always in thin games, always making very tough plays that make you have to figure out the hand because they don't autopilot, always trying to steal and swin|pg||
nt|jlall:  dle|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Unlucky the one time he should have zigged, and he zagged.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still might win imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: justin bet that partner had junk and he does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: zia in 3nt so best not to bid slam|pg||
nt|kit: true -- 3NT at other table looks doomed.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: 3 spades shows spade control  3nt is non-serious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: do not play a natural 2n over 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bt: i think he will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|uday:  Such an innocuous board for such a scary final contract|pg||
nt|inquiry:  this will make a dull hand fairly excliting.. |pg||
nt|jlall: then invite, risking letting them X 3N light for a heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or a spec X|pg||
nt|jlall:  always blasting to game and not making cherry picking bids to give you info|pg||
nt|jlall:  then the director tells you youre in tiem trouble|pg||
nt|jlall:  im a young guy but i just played 90 boards against them and it is so exhausting, that is part of their game, their opponents always tire out|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I think Brad was born in 1971.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during earlier round       Director: you're behind the clock   Steve Robinson: change the clock|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he has west to show spade control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did take losing @C finesse after @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: duly accepted|pg||
nt|dburn: 7@d, on the other hand, is a different proposition altogether|pg||
nt|ritong: "i expect 3NT" lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so close Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i am the shame of the profession|pg||
nt|dburn: even though I am sure the lead will be the same, I don't see how he can put 13 tricks together|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|robinswr: he'll probably ruff as many diamonds as he can|pg||
nt|jlall: he is very much in the bid game or pass school rather than giving them extra info|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: GL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen worse slams    this just needs @D not worse than 42, @C coming in for 5 tricks and a @H @S squeeze|pg||
nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||
nt|markf:  Only real chance is for @D's 3-3 and J@C falling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have a slide rule?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Still, declarer isn't 100% home.  Easier to make 6 than 5, since in 6 you would have to play for QJ doubleton in diamonds.  In 5, you may be guarding against 4-1 split.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz2:  Anyone see a 9th trick for Katz?|pg||

nt|jlall: of course, irrelevant with nickells actual hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Katz opting for Drury rather than 1@s, which could be passed, or 2@s which presumably would show spades and a heart fit, but myabe not quite this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Nickell opened weak 2 in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Bathurst knows better than to lead partner's suit at this stage of the match|pg||
nt|markf:  Hands fit well, 12 tricks in 6NT|pg||
nt|jlall: 2D is very strange, is he looking for slam?|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s should not thrill nickell|pg||
nt|jlall: if it's 3 card drury i can't imagine looking for a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: may be looking for 3NT rather than 4@h, perhaps|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, that is possible|pg||
nt|jlall: we get back to information leakage though|pg||
nt|dburn: and may choose to bid it, having heard 2@s|pg||
nt|petergill: After 1@D - 2@D or 1@C - 2@C inverted, a good idea is for responder to have a bid available over 2NT that asks opener if he has only 3 cards in his suit. |pg||
nt|ritong: are you saying that contract was not good, mark?:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: constructive bid at least 5 4 or 6 3|pg||
nt|jlall: wow on 38, rodwell did make the responsive X of 1N that hampson did not make, platnick jumped to 3N which was down, and meck saved|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfc: fourth best|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate bidding 3-card majors in response to a t/o double but here there's no reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|jlall: so a possible swing for nickell went to diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: so nick is in slam mood, and not deterred with 2@s|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, a good decision by N/S not to compete|pg||
nt|3for3:  another hand to tap, or to go for your own ruffs|pg||

nt|jlall: did nick ever suggest a slam try? if so i cant imagine ralph would let him out|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@c is slammy|pg||
nt|jlall: and is nick actually thinking here? |pg||
nt|ritong: when 2@s could have been NT oriented|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he pickup @H suit too  or just take his 9 and run?|pg||

nt|jlall: ralph will try for 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the trumps can be played for only one loser, but with spades 4-2 I can't see anything like twelve tricks|pg||

nt|ritong: i agree, west certainly worth 5NT|pg||
nt|jlall: nick forgot his partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|jlall: then his bidding makes sense|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent point|pg||
nt|jlall: 4D might even be RKC for clubs|pg||
nt|jlall: and 5C 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure if nickell katz play that|pg||
nt|jlall: rodders did pass 1N with the hand hampson bid 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, the bidding may not even be over, since 6@h will come as a shock to Nickell who thinks clubs are trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: currently double checking start of auction and " oh my!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says 4 diamonds is splinter|pg||
nt|dburn: strange to continue to forget partner passed all the way through the auction, when the green card is still sitting on the tray|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell didn't see he was a past hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: small break|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that gives us a chance to see whether this might make in some miraculous way, but I still can't think of one|pg||
nt|ritong: this might take some time, when nick has to recover from the shock before trying to work out a winning case|pg||
nt|jlall: no chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: as to distract players|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: break here for a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which leads to story about     Terence Reese playing a hand at rubber bridge and not noticing naked lady in the room|pg||
nt|warrens:  a break now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: short break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no result on appeal|pg||
nt|warrens:  do you mean no change is the ruling or there isn't a ruling yet?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever noticed it is always the slower room that takes the break ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no ruling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I do not know what the appeal is only that there is one and no ruling yet|pg||
nt|garden2005: no to wysy³aj jak napiszesz a ja napisze drugi post po swojemu na ten sam temat|pg||
nt|garden2005: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: range for 2nt hearts good 7 to terrible 11|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlall: i think you have to play for 3-3 spades and Ax of hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think the defending side has a better shot at 3N than these guys do at 1:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I'm not sure that Bathurst will take the chance.  what if declarer had AQx, Axx Qx, AKxxx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: well, i take it back|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: he plays confidently|pg||
nt|jlall: he has only 1 line|pg||
nt|ritong: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: passed hand |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he had more than one - heart to the queen, then play to ruff two diamonds on the table, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: specs suggesting if this heart is ducked, nickell can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: but diamonds 4-4 is less likely than spades 3-3|pg||
nt|jlall: but then south gets in with the HA and gives his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: then again, South could have @hAx and three diamonds, when that line would work|pg||
nt|jlall: if that was the layout you'd be playing for a defensive error since they could play ace and a heart unless spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: as expectable, this won t be a push|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they'd have to play ace and a heart when you led a heart yourself towards the queen, and that's not so clear - but still, probably better to go for the legitimate shot|pg||
pc|d3|nt|inquiry:  contract is going to make. how to play spades... is the only question for katz, i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jlall: pretty clear when he tanks forever and ducks |pg||
nt|dburn: still, after that development Nickell knows at least that hearts are where he wants them|pg||

nt|markf:  Katz might have bid more too; not as clear.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some might open the s hand with a 1 bid.  2 quick tricks and a 6-card suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: perhaps fred will, considering @ss|pg||
nt|petergill: Not quite sure what happened there - whether it was 12 tricks or 11 or 10, not important, only overtricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  slam makes here, but you are off an ace and Qxxx of trump|pg||
mb|2H|nt|warrens:  or even AKx, Axx, xx, AJ10xx for those who are complaining that I'm giving Meck too many points|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy reassures nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: he could balance, and have a bad encounter|pg||
nt|dburn: marginal hand for 2/1 players, West's|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: and 2.5@h for east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 fingers cold and tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  east will want to show a good spade raise, so he bid 2nt, limit raise... can't be better since he is passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, etc|pg||
nt|jlall: 2.8 for me|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: will spare you my usual song:)|pg||
nt|dburn: even though you would open the bidding with it, there are times when an opening bid plus an opening bid doesn't make a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 tricks on 55|pg||
nt|jlall:  this is what i was talking about with meckwell|pg||
nt|jlall:  they might have a slam|pg||
nt|jlall:  but they just jump to 4S|pg||
nt|jlall:  their 1S is limited|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss has no idea how to lead, it depends on the hand type meck has|pg||
nt|jlall:  i will bet on a trump though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell claims 9 or 11 ..not going to take any finesses in H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1M-4M by big club pair is a huge winner, unlike 2/1 where it is always preemptive   here sometimes opening bid with no slam ambition|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It's a plot, Karen...|pg||
nt|jlall:  unsurprisingly, hamman did not lead a trump, since he hates trump leads to be passive|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  right, has to be AKxxx of @C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 115  also 3N east  after west shows @D    same @H lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  so I'm stuck giving him a good 18|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a very good hand to open 1 and rebid 2|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|santyclz2:  1.5 in @ds .5 in @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says I didn't have to jump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lew mathe:  NEVER lead trump .... unless it is right|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i doubt they bid it off 1 keycard and Qxxx in trump|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S art GF|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, do they play 1@H-2@S as weak in order to play this forcing?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|mcphee: Debbie, :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can open light vul says Katz|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 55 corrected to reflect making 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: good thing you precised, debbie|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 6card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S strong spade rebid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn: often-mangled suit combination, those clubs - not at this level, of course, but sometimes players adopt the "danger play" line of cashing the ace before finessing|pg||
nt|jlall: looks like 3N time|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, private.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Q say anything about serious/non-serious ?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: nice try Justin|pg||
nt|jlall:  and as we know, hamman played a lot with mathe|pg||
nt|bigtrain: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  looks safe enough, but has to be careful in spades... |pg||
nt|ritong: reminds me debbie rosenberg|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: blackwood|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: in pre-1970 textbooks   trump was often a default lead when nothing else looked good|pg||
nt|kareno:  Also Lew Mathe:  NEVER lead a singleton trump if you want to be on my team.|pg||
nt|jlall:  the younger players definitely lead trumps a lot more than the previous generations did, i think this is because people bid games lighter and lighter now with shape, and so aggressive leads are less necessary and just not blowing a trick or|pg||
nt|jlall:  cutting down ruffs beats many more games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 0-3|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|nt|ritong: asked about her first internet vug experience, she said " was about 1998, the only thing i remember was someone going down in grand with AKJ10xx vsxx|pg||
nt|jlall: possible he just leads a club to the ten|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, I would not be surprised if the percentage play turned out to be to run the ten and then cash the ace-king, since with no entry to West North should duck from @cQx or ...|pg||
nt|dburn: @cQxx|pg||
nt|jlall: he WANTS them to win the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: but hes giving up on some overtricks|pg||
nt|jlall: possibly|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rodwell signal is standard here|pg||
nt|3for3:  looks like a slightly fortunate 13 imps headed to nickell|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|inquiry:  another chance for diamond team to pick up some imps, as 2@S is contract in both rooms and will make in this one... unclear if it will make in the other... |pg||
nt|bigtrain: they won't bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|ritong: the whole table smiling at that point|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: play is 2 spades by west|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but i don t know how they got there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: north south have 2 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe 1@D dble and a transfer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 1N and xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: nonetheless, even if we of course prefer to offer accurate things, BBO is not an official scorer|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 5@H says no @SQ|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: kj73 and club t indummy|pg||

nt|markf:  This board is poor for Katz-Nickell, failing to get ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a reason for the lead there  rather than  didn't like other leads|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think bobs saying when someone points out when eh DOES lead a trump is "I didn't say trump leads are always wrong, im just the only one who knows when theyre right"|pg||

nt|dburn: back in 4@h, Meckstroth will need to read the position very well to make it if Moss plays a spade now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the toughest bid for precision to handle is a natural 2@D overcall of a nebulous @D|pg||
nt|jlall:  if moss plays a spade meck could easily go down|pg||
nt|dburn: since if he tries to cross to dummy for another heart finesse, he will go down quickly|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz checking for S J10x coming down|pg||
nt|jlall: i dont get it|pg||
nt|ritong: me neither|pg||
nt|jlall: if the club hook was on, you still have to pick up spades|pg||
nt|jlall: if you can pick up spades, you dont need the club finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampson says block out the spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room on their final board |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not - if he knew that diamond lead was a singleton, he would know that Moss could not have @hKx remaining|pg||
nt|3for3:  7 imps; would have been 12 if they had doubled...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell down 2 and Meckstroths says we probably beat 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: also sometimes they huddle over their discards|pg||
nt|ritong: if a @s was right, pard would have contributed @d9 imo|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: might end up shooting 6@H in search of a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are very good at telling you the results as they know its hard to follow at times|pg||
nt|jlall: oh, i get it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jlall: he was playing for 4-1 spades and the club hook on|pg||
nt|jlall: then he has an endplay|pg||
nt|jlall: after stripping the clubs and playing a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so|pg||
mb|d|nt|warrens:  yes, and Meck believed S|pg||
nt|jlall: he saw the 4 standard in spades on his right, so he thought it was a stiff|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|jlall: grego will double here|pg||
nt|jlall: greco*|pg||
nt|jlall: as a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: also, @sK will come more frequently from a relatively strong holding, rather than KQ bare|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess he might at that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco reading Katz|pg||
nt|jlall: meck didn't, ut there was a key difference, he was against a strong club pair|pg||
nt|jlall: where 4H might be a 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one of the advantages of strong club|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H here for standard bidders is usually 5 trumps or 4 trumps with shape and not a ton of HCP|pg||
nt|jlall: that makes doubling more attractive|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|dburn: could be useful for Milner, this - 3NT won't be reached after this start|pg||
nt|dburn: nor should it be, of course|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, W opened a precision 2@C, which prevented a @D overcall.  now there is no game fo E/Q|pg||
nt|warrens:  e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Answer a man's question and he has information.  Teach him to google and..."|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: fastest mouse sometimes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :( sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: declarer wouyld cover with J9xx|pg||
nt|dburn: else, he would have started with stiff @sA and would have returned a diamond at lightning pace|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: well, e/q can't make game either|pg||
nt|ritong: in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: so south has a choice between the 9 and his small @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this hand should end quickly|pg||
nt|jlall:  opening helped keep them low here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@d = 4+@H 7-9|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: and the pair who post mortem their "bad board" pick up imps on the board, as is so often the case. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so I suppose 4@H shows not a greaat hand for @H, but Garner will not care|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: East says lets hope I counted my aces right today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Drury    does your partnership know how responder shows a good hand with @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: pass?|pg||
nt|jlall: katz does not double 4S because A) he cant beat it B) they might run|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3@H should be 2 down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: other table has finished play|pg||
nt|dburn: curious deal, in a way - East-West at the other table were quite right to bid 3NT (which needs 4-3 diamonds), East-West at this table are quite right not to|pg||
nt|warrens:  the lead helps, but there's still not hope|pg||
nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 117  Zia playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|jlall: look at it this way|pg||
nt|jlall: his partner had the spade ACE|pg||
nt|dburn: he might not and they might, but surely he expeced to make 4@h - it does seem a bit odd to gamble that passing 4@s is right|pg||
nt|jlall: and 4S can make|pg||
nt|jlall: and would make easily if hampson had the DT|pg||
nt|jlall: saving would be weirder|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: reapeat @cs|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think fred will just cash his spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||
nt|jlall: and doubling when you think they will often make or have a better spot to run to is not great|pg||
nt|ritong: so, leaping to game is streng verboten for opener|pg||
nt|dburn: this may be a more substantial gain for Diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: repaeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: repeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: omg|pg||
nt|dburn: since 2@d ought to make, and bring in 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|ritong: 11 fingers here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't most  play that Hamman's 2N shows stronger [maybe even Game Force] hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: after 1@s-1NT? I don't know - I guess it's just invitational|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  East will assume his partner has a doubleton @D at most, so he's thinking about 4@C or 5@C or maybe some try like XX.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  He still could/should have made it.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|inquiry:  double game swing possible on this one... as 4@S looks like it would make (6@S, 2@C, 2@D ruffs).... and 4@h looks like it makes|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, saving would be weird indeed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt:  nasty guesses here|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
nt|ritong: covering this makes few sense, for starters|pg||
nt|bt:  after getting spades right decl has to guess what rounded suit to finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|warrens:  is it clear that this isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  playing 4@Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: although some play Henri's favourite Godzilla or whatever it's called|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: you only had 19 no only 18 but really good 18|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: @s 7 from east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will do|pg||
nt|markf:  He also can use a spade trick|pg||
nt|bt:  if he gets it right, katz probably should duck one diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bt:  katz should be able to picture the whole hand and what it takes to beat it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: if youre not saving i dont think it matters that much whether you think you can make 4H, its just how often do you think you can beat 4S|pg||

mb|4S|nt|mcphee: well Brad is not shy|pg||
nt|mcphee: he placed fred with 4-4 majors I think|pg||
nt|robinswr: obviously 2@d did not promise both majors|pg||
nt|mcphee: you think not steve?|pg||
nt|robinswr: should be two places to play|pg||
nt|warrens:  my guess is that X shows 1m + 1M|pg||
nt|jlall: either they changed their system and i didnt know|pg||
nt|warrens:  did he really show a minimum?  Rodwell showed a GF.|pg||
nt|jlall: or 3H shows a min opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  if the 3 hcp fred has in hearts was in the other major, slam would be reasonable...|pg||
nt|bt:  which is why a 4@H splinter would be more to the point, my partners never have that perfect hand anyway|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Fred will not want to encourage...so he can't pass here... as this has to be forcing pass he is mininum with wasted values in hearts|pg||
nt|inquiry:  so 4@S is weaker than pass... he has to decide if he wants to double or bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Warren -- even in direct seat|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell will correct to the major (if my guess is correct)|pg||
nt|dburn: double by a passed hand often played as a four-card major and a longer minor - not sure what Katz and Nickell use|pg||
nt|jlall: i would be shocked by 3H...perhaps they just changed their system|pg||
mb|d|nt|jlall: now we will see one main advantage of kickback|pg||
nt|dburn: good slam, this, and good effort by Hamman and Zia to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can also access voice without login using  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: ? jump to 4 h what do you do  he says jump to 3 is strong at least we on same page it may not be good|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that, because otherwise Nickell would do what Warren suggests|pg||
nt|jlall: over 5S hampson can bid 5N|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mcphee: he really can not go down even getting @S wrong|pg||

nt|jcwla:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=97+KQ9+AKQ95+QJ8   17.3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: laughing as similar to past 3nt but no heart suit|pg||
nt|jlall: or maybe he just liked his partner having no HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5s you 5N shows Spade K  yes answer|pg||
nt|ritong: he was aware about @s short anyways|pg||
nt|jlall: since it meant it wasnt wasted and partner had points elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: prolly via 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the last board of the 3rd set restart in 15 min or so|pg||
nt|petergill: Gazzilli also at http://freebridge.blogspot.com.au/2009/08/gazzilli.html|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to spec's commentator's USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for the wonderful broadcast of the USBC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of Set 5 of 8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for broadcasting this championship|pg||
mb|1S|nt|warrens:  I was mistaken about precision, but once partner bid 2@D, Kranyak decided that partner didn't have enough for game|pg||
nt|ritong: this is the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an honest opening -- go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroth says great match to justin and kevin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to commentators|pg||
nt|ritong: not vulnerazble:)|pg||
nt|ritong: possible 2 imps swing, tho|pg||
mb|d|nt|warrens:  I'm even more surprised|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 down in 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule showing Viewer timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X can include 5+h GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: restart is about one hour|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|bigtrain: 1C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: pass = 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1 major|pg||
nt|warrens:  this must show a pretty good hand at unfavorable |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is multi... 1 major|pg||
nt|petergill: The 11 imp swing on Bd 59 was mainly thanks to Bob Hamman bidding 4@S rather than 5@C chosen in a similar situation at this table. |pg||
nt|warrens:  so Moss must be thinking 2@S or 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event   shows schedule with viewer's local timezone|pg||
nt|chip: Seems N make the percentage play on defense, even if wrong here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|dburn: well, board 69 may remain to be replayed by the Director and the committee, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Last bd of the segment now..will be back in about 10 min|pg||
nt|bigtrain: restart at 4:45 eastern|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 65 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@C by North is a transfer to @D's, showing a limit or better raise of @S's|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: perhaps 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: showing a good hand for @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - some (including perhaps Wolpert) might have taken the view that 2@d was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
nt|markf:  Allan, often pairs playing complex systems have not worked out many details, especially with intervention.|pg||
nt|ritong: other room will certainly overcall and raise @ss|pg||
nt|inquiry:  last hand,, thanks to the  voice commentators (al graves and peter lund), to our excellent vugraph operator (debbie hyatt i think)... and to |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: restart in about an hour and 15 min|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz2:  Viewgraph schedule adjust to your timezone:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: xx + points|pg||
nt|chip: might stop in a partscore here and level the match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  good lead|pg||
nt|jlall: nickell is like secretariat, loves starting in a hole and digging out of it. already did it once this tournament (sorry warren)|pg||
nt|ritong: basic game try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one more set tonight and four tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
nt|warrens:  np :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman is 73 (or 74) years old. Aging does not seem to apply to his bridge. |pg||
nt|athene: south might now find a heart lead given 2@S shows heart support?|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  I think Moss should have bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  another swing to Nickell, so it'll be close for tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 64-19 set for Nickell|pg||
nt|markf:  Not that it would have mattered|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, 3NT is surely based on a good/running @c suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  Aging does affect Hamman.  He gets better!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event   shows schedule with viewer's local timezone|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is 65. My source is the Bridge Encyclopedia. Meckwell are mid 50's. |pg||
nt|11jaszczak: lepiej jak w Polsce:)|pg||
nt|ritong: so, it is not clearcut that meck has a huge @s stopper|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|bigtrain: played 1-2-3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unless they had the names wrong|pg||
nt|markf:  Moss had to bid 4@S to have an affect|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Jeff Meckstroth May 15, 1956;  Eric Rodwell May 1, 1957.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman asks show 0-5 Rodwell can't trap when we don't know your suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 21 imps away from the best birthday presents they could get|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
nt|ritong: bid GAME TRY to make it|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@C sounds like a game try in @S's.  maybe too high now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|inquiry:  i hear 4@C on board 14 in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroths not going down|pg||
nt|adonis18:  5 losers|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: they are HOT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set short break please come back to join us|pg||
nt|inquiry:  north at this table, fred gitelman for providing bbo for all o f us.... and the usbf for the exciting match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams can always agree to start earlier than shown on schedule  [except after long lunch break]|pg||
nt|dburn: in an ideal world the appeal (if there is one) would be held before the next set started, so that the players would know the score, but this is not such a world|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i dislike 4-card overcalls for this very reason|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|dT|nt|warrens:  a @C lead in the other room made this hand easier|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy to make this one|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah definitely down|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know if there is any legitimate make now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not definitely, but he will need to take some pretty good views|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director in --|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, maybe the Director knows how to make it - that should help|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 or imps away from the birthday present, I should say - now|pg||
nt|chip: Some comments that 4S is reasonable, and would probably make.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: 3NT far from ridiculous, of course - the diamonds might come in, after all, and that would give nine tops after the club lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  Very interesting set, thanks all|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  defense needs to get @D's going |pg||
nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on 118  but   congrats to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final also 2 days  120 boards|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chip: 3N can be defeated if EW continue clubs now, but then switch. When W wins the a spade or D can play a club through again to set up 5 tricks.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  goodnight Debbie|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: fred and brad will leave the room with rounded shoulders, but the smile on their teammates faces should reassure them:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|markf:  Bye all.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlall: i am told gib could make it from there, i was still thinking about it double dummy! i assure you nothing single dummy would come close|pg||
nt|chip: A of spades and a club will probably get down 2 if declarer takes the D finesse.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jjsb:  tthank u very much ! |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfc: q of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: he worked it out - well done him|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly any normal line would fail - maybe he could have won the second spade in his hand and played a heart|pg||
nt|bobholl: DD a@S @D @C finesse @C ruffed with @S Q |pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all.  See you for sessions 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Moss's 2@S - pass or correct - implied better hearts than spades, so Gitelman was choosing between a @h and @DA and misguessed.  |pg||
nt|dburn: normally declarer would cash a high diamond first, but he does not have the entries to pick up @dQxxx with East|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|ritong: 12 away 42 left|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, Secretariat may be starting his move with that board - we shall soon see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no|pg||
nt|ritong: was included|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more than 1 now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|markf:  Ralph hs created some problems for himself; allowing diamond discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all.  See you here in the last set.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
nt|dburn: so to play high would be a "danger play", losing to a small singleton with West|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: most probably this match will not continue see you later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
pc|c9|nt|warrens:  whoops|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|phil: wow|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|warrens:  ok, he can survive now|pg||
nt|warrens:  -1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bt:  @S k will solv it|pg||
nt|bt:  solve|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Still has only a @h and a @s to lose.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: merci a tous  see you all soon|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all, see you for 4th session today and 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks will see you after the break for the second set of the finals of the USBD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: USBC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 min still in the set and probably 15 min break restart at 12:25 chicago time|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Fernando Lema sent me:  http://csbnews.org/usbc-final-time/?lang=en|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: night all|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@s overcall worked better than 2@s as it allowed NS to find their @h fit - but one always wants to overcall the strong club as high as possible - so 2@S was normal over the strong ...|pg||
nt|petergill: club. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|warrens:  draw two rounds of trump and play @C's|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h7|nt|warrens:  I think Nickell was afraid of being sqeezed if he played a low @H|pg||
nt|roghog:  bye all|pg||
mc|8|nt|warrens:  I think a low @H mwould have gotten -2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: restart in one hour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fun show   30 to play after 1 hour break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thanks Debbie!!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are meeting for the committee|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no ruleing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no adjustment and appeal pending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ruling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: you can find appeal later on line|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye thanks all the specs and commenators and the ACBL USBF BBO and Jan Martel for this broadcasts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
