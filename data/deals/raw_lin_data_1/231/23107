nt|petergill: John Kranyak played very fast when his team beat mine in the Spingold last year - one sign of a great player is someone who is good at both "thinking fast and thinking slow" i.e. ...|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 3NT by North is interesting after a spade to the ace and a small one back|pg||
nt|petergill: 300 vs 100 when more was possible, on repeated trump leads by the defence before @SQ could be set up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a version of Precision|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@CX went for 100|pg||
nt|phil: yep - very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Almost|pg||

nt|kit: Difficult for N-S to find their heart fit|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
pc|s6|nt|warrens:  4@H is probably kickback in @D's |pg||

pc|sK|nt|phil: why can't John be 1=3=3=6 or 1=4=3=5? |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks to be -1 with the 4th round uppercut|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what North's heart signal means here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: when N to bid @H ? (I do not see)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|petergill: other table: After West's Dbl (did North see it? or think the dbl must be a psyche?), one would expect 3Nt to make|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to try another trump now I think, since he knows there is a diamond ruff out against him.  he needs 2-2 trumps and some help in spade suit.|pg||
nt|kit: but he might try queen of spades and hope opponents don't get diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out there is no diamond ruff for them, but he can't know that.  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: we can see all lines doomed but E still has hopes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  6@C will show Q and K of @C's (and no other K)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Dbl of Strong Club did not show any points, so North went with the odds|pg||
nt|warrens:  this would be a good contract if North had one more @C|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  I don't think there's any chance here with clubs this way|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm guess a trump back, since N has shown the Q of @D's|pg||
nt|phil: cant he ruff two spades and establish the 5th club for two heart pitches? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes he can|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA play (play the card you are known to hold) might lead to declarer taking a ruffing @S finesse through East, on other layouts|pg||
nt|warrens:  Oh, I take it back.  He can make it if he can score 6 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Needs 2 @s ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: now @S expected by N|pg||
nt|kit: Now South has to work out the hand, which he should be able to do -- and not play ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this @D returns troubles S a bit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: North thought he might have to lead diamond if declarer had Ax I think.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he did well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but @S by N then it was sure down imo|pg||
nt|kit: So now declarer will presumably try to cash king of spades and just go down.  Nothing works anyway.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|h9|pg||
mc|8|nt|phil: so win @cK, ruff spade, trump to hand, ruff last spade, last trump to hand, draw trump (pitch heart), club, club ruff, etc..  |pg||
nt|petergill: Now @DK then @d to hand - if @D are 4-1, need clubs 3-3 or squeeze|pg||
nt|phil: true thats better|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Gavin is thinking that @D to hand is better than my line now if trumps are 5-0|pg||

nt|petergill: Well bid and well played|pg||
nt|phil: both tables earned those 16 IMPs|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|kit: I guess he was -- North had to be 1-1 in minors, or South would have given him a ruff.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [but not 19-20 bal]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||

mb|2C|nt|phil: four losers in 4@s - does 3N fetch? |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C denies a 4+card major|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Unfortunately, North will take this 3@S call seriously|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i CANT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i'll be surprised if he bids|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: you were right -- I thought he would bid game|pg||
nt|bigtrain: alot of faces with little value|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: although @SAK and @D crashes 2@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh no then @SQ to bed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then too tough for defense @SAx@S to Q and @D return to defeat|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Seems like this line gives defense a chance with trump shift, but Meckstroth deduced that this would be impossible to find.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kareno: He can discount many of them.|pg||
nt|kit: Note East plays ace, then king.  Order of plays is suit-preference.  And they play upside-down suit-preference.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they also usually lead the K here thus the order strongly states @D interest|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its only when the usual order is changed that there is any SP inference|pg||
nt|kareno: South had the wrong minor suit holdings - 3-2 the other way and it would have taken a diamond lead to beat 4.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meckstroth asking point count with Bathhurst.  Justin: "I don't expect zero count..3S is preempt.."|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  77 [3@HE-1]  Zia going down in 3@S North|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Still, I don't see how ducking the diamond gains declarer anything.  On diamond continuation, he will still have to play AKQ of hearts and hope hearts split, I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you guess spades. 4 spades, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs. The defence can't take more than two heart tricks, and if they play too many hearts, you have 2 tricks there|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: and along the way you'll get a good count for the spade hook|pg||
pc|c8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|phil: the double only cost 1 IMP as it turns out - assuming he makes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|phil: this would be a good time to go feed the pets or water the plants|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure from this auction whether East-West knew they had a spade fit and rejected it, or never knew they had it|pg||
nt|phil: yes - it looked like Hamman just chose to make a quantitative invite - although I do not know what a direct 2N would be over 1N|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's not usually a good sign when you double and you can't decide what to do at trick 2|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that an immediate 2@s over 1NT is invitational with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: screen down; Kranyak asking about auction; Zia could have 4 spades for 1NT and could have shown them over 2NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: y agree|pg||
nt|bt: ruffing low heart then high heart maybe |pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he thinks he can afford to ruff a heart (guarding against 5-2), and it will be difficult for defense to separate everything.  But I don't think he can afford to risk that.|pg||
nt|po-s: better to ask before doubling - not that it would have helped|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: somehow I don't think East would have defended this way vs. 4@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|hedyg:  2@H or 1NT?|pg||

nt|kit: Still, I can see merit to what he did -- not sure.|pg||
nt|phil: doesnt long spades make the double more attractive, not less? |pg||

nt|jaapfr: no standard preempt but nowadays..................|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: here we have a oretty normal, nowadays 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they list 2L as 10-15, 1@D as 11-15|pg||
mb|2N|an|natural|nt|kit: Now this really surprises me.  Surely Meckstroth must be worth some try.  The 5-level can't be that dangerous opposite a 4@D call.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 3@D is an artificial @H slam try|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess that at this table 2@h was just hearts, whereas it was hearts and a minor at the other|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2L = two level|pg||
nt|kit: Is 2NT forcing Walter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: XX shows @D control|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Gavin Wolpert will be disappointed by dummy - he thought EW bidding made South likely to have short @H's - and 4@S was an each-way bet in case EW can make 4@H|pg||
nt|bt: making 5 without breaking a sweat i foresee|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bigtrain: 1st or 2nd round...  all RM below game cuebidding can be 1st or 2nd round controls...  they use RKC to determine if they have enough keys - cuebidding to determine no suit has 2 ...|pg||
nt|bigtrain: fast losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is a natural, invitational 2NT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: one would bid also 4@S WITHOUT AKKK pff|pg||
nt|kareno: rdbl have a special meaning?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth taking into account possible light opener and not driving to game.  Still, seems like he should -- his AQ of clubs are like AK.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|d8|nt|warrens:  nice bid by Zia|pg||
nt|phil: yes, every reason to expect 5-2 in Kran's hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: mind you, Wolpert and Kranyak should have gone a step further than Zia and Hamman and tried 3NT on their 5-5 spade fit|pg||
nt|kit: Since when do these guys need 25 HCP to make 3NT Walter?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: tuesday - late afternoon|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|po-s: He has been unusually timid today. Remember the spade game missed before|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: true, a club lead would beat it, but [a] Hamman would not lead one and [b] the suit might well block if he did|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, Zia pushed NS overboard, while Kevin Bathurst's 3@C at the other table ensured that NS could not slip into 3NT making, which might happen if West passes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|bt: when opps preempt you have to play partner for something, the minor kings are doubtful opposite a major 2-suiter|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but only during a hurricane|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: 2@H would show intermediate values at this vulnerable so rodwell must choose between 1 and 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: easy choice for him|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: intermediate is vague but approximatily a good 6-card suit with about 13-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|adonis18:  difficult for NS to reach 6 @c now|pg||
nt|kit: West has difficult hand to bid over 1@D opening.  Overcallling on 4-card major has a lot of pitfalls.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a typical 3rd hand 1@D (although lousy cards:)|pg||
nt|dougs: 2@c is either a club suit or clubs with a spade fit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: 2NT is an art @H raise|pg||
nt|kit: the 1@D opening is basically a weak NT, but can find a major-suit fit.|pg||
nt|dougs: @D with either|pg||
nt|chip: EW play flannery, but the West hand is presumably too good. Here we see the other room chose to ignore their major fit.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chip: 2N is natural, GF, with 3H.|pg||
nt|phil: no 3rd seat preempt by Gavin....|pg||

nt|dougs: sorry 2@C is a cue bid raise of spades|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2@H could go for 500 as 3@H for 800|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like North bid his hand with the negative double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  80 [4@SN-3]  Milner remembered to DBL|pg||
nt|kit: this one might be close -- can East be put under enough pressure?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: pls stop thinking else 1100|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: this is going to be ugly.  The problem was that North trusted his opponents to have a spade fit, and they don't.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you think W could X 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why West should double.  For all he knows, opponents have 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|kit: East might have doubled, but he doesn't know his partner has clubs under control.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he never could show his 14 hcp|pg||
nt|warrens:  a psychic double by Kranyak?|pg||
nt|phil: very Zia-esque|pg||
nt|chip: In the other room they opened a strong club with the W hand, then got a 3D preempt.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he did double (Kranyak)|pg||
nt|petergill: Quite a week for the Wolpert family. Gavin's mum Hazel is playing in the finals of the Canadian Women's Trials, his brother Darren is playing the semi final of the Canadian Open ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Trials today. Also, Darren won the Vanberbilt a month or two ago. |pg||
nt|dburn: this is quite a lot of bidding for Hamman to be doing - wouldn't blame Zia for just Blackwooding into slam now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: which is the @sJ away from being a good contract, and the @s109 away from being a terrible one|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: did Meck's @D carding show pref for @S   [reverse suit pref]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D3 did|pg||
nt|kit: I think defense needed difficult spade shift at trick 2|pg||
nt|kareno: Rodwell must duck here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just curious -- declarer in complete control here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i agree kit...  i think it makes from here|pg||
nt|kit: If West wins ace, declarer has ruffing finesse.  If he ducks East can't attack spades, and declarer has loser on loser in clubs.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yeah, it is making from here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easiest defense against 4@H  ....  bid 5@D|pg||
nt|kit: I think Rodwell will go up ace.  Declarer might have Qx in both black suits, in which case he must go up and shift to spade.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   retract bad joke|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: 3C showed 55, denied 3S|pg||

pc|hK|nt|kit: It turns out the the save is a phantom, but 4@S could easily have been making.  The real question in my mind is if South should have overcalled 2@C rather than doubling.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: bridge not always fair|pg||
nt|bt: well losing imps for getting to 7 off an ace is pretty fair|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: as Katz's is thinking, Kranyak says "I don't have a good hand; I'll tell you that"|pg||

nt|dburn: though there may be some doubt in his mind as to whether it is intended either as strong or, Heaven forfend, as some variant of the dreaded Leaping Michaels|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bt: well once you bid 5@D you have expressed the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: oh I agree East shouldn't have bid the grand.  If there were a grand, West would have Q-bid 6@C.|pg||
nt|bt: now kit, in my world 4@D promises 2 suits, then bidding 6@C would imply clubs being one of them|pg||
nt|dburn: old head on young shoulders, Wolpert's - quite right not to make stuff up on the spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: hard to get to 6C if you never bid the suit.|pg||

mb|3H|nt|bigtrain: meckwell don't have the option od 2@H at this vulnerablit as that would be intermediate|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and shapely hands even light shapely hands need to act|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt had a chance to be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: S thinking 6@H can be down 1 |pg||
nt|kit: The double of 3@D will save 1 IMP, since now ace of diamonds will be cashed.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry was called away|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr: 4@H not really|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell have never been known as being bashful :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would we not all think as W that after 1@H by pd we do have a game on:)?|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly awkward, this|pg||
nt|dburn: Nickell may be concerned that North has all three spades|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case, banging down the ace could well be fatal|pg||
nt|dburn: but I think that a club or diamond play will also work, so he should be OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, NAT or BAL 2+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: else he would defintely had bid 6@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C is @C or bal GF|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|dburn: reasonable shot by Kranyak, but it may cost him an overtrick on the actual lie|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H = cuwbid|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and @CJx|pg||
nt|kit: but if South had 10 of diamonds, slam is down.  And that wouldn't have affected anybody's bidding.  Shows how difficult bidding can be.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cuebid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: 4@C non-serious cuebid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: he will cash another club and pitch king of diamonds, in case ace of diamonds was singleton.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: non-serious about slam thus less than a great hand...  all really good hnds bid 3NT to show slam interest rather than 4@C|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: true, but still...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougs: xof 3@S is gf shape unkown but normally balanced.  An agressive bid with this little.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bigtrain: 2@H promises a 4fit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chip: 4D an interesting effort. Perhaps now will want to bid 5H since he hasn't shown his hand (and suggesting the wrong lead too boot)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Nickell:  "wish trick"|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, S on lead, so not an issue.|pg||
nt|phil: 5@h would have been very inexpensive|pg||

nt|jaapfr: the nightmere story continues|pg||

nt|bt: say a diamond lead you make it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Actually, 4@S isn't down yet|pg||
nt|dburn: Nickell disinclined to bid very much at all, and quite right too in theory - 4@s is a rotten contract|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chip: now making 6, so an IMP back to Nickell.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: in previous session i suggested that EW do play and bid primarily tactically (tough to analyze but based on their incredible experience)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|jaapfr: to disbalnce the opponents|pg||
nt|kit: Now club shift pretty easy, and that is down 1 (at least)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: knr = 17.75|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Jeff: What kind of Smith?  Justin: Reg|pg||
nt|kit: Reasonable line of play, but now South has the info to find the spade shift.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi     fun tool to see how hand value changes with minor adjustments|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|kit: He will ruff club trying to strip out East's exits, but East will still have a club exit|pg||
nt|bt: so rodwell avoided the diamond lead, heart lead gives it some play|pg||
nt|kit: Or he may just lead diamond now, hoping East has KQ or honor doubleton.  Those are his choices.|pg||
nt|bt: i think full credit is due for the trump lead|pg||
nt|bt: nicely done|pg||
nt|bt: i confess that i might have lead a diamond|pg||
nt|kit: Not me -- why lead away from an honor when there doesn't appear to be threats of discards in dummy.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: well there was a discard, only it was in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but in practice it will be worth six or seven IMPs to Milner, who could use them|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|kit: true, but in general a passive lead here figures to be right -- and trump lead might stop a ruff in dummy in addition.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bt: west will show heart length at first opportunity|pg||

pc|c2|nt|kit: Must be right to be greedy and discard club.  He should have the count.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell shows even number of hearts, so Meckstroth knows to grab ace first round.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|kit: And Rodwell should know that declarer has stiff heart, else Meckstroth wouldn't have taken his ace so fast.|pg||
nt|kit: So Rodwell can afford to dump his hearts.|pg||
nt|bt: he is just checking in his mind|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised he has such a problem with this position.  If the heart suit were running, Meckstroth wouldn't have taken his ace -- or he would have shifted to a diamond.|pg||

nt|phil: dbl maybe? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt much better chance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1100|pg||
nt|bt: presumably 2@C is a positive in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends on defense|pg||
nt|kit: This is the hand Blackwood was invented for|pg||
nt|dburn: Wolpert pre-empting where Rodwell did not - Kranyak may elect to get involved at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: In fact, opening 4NT Blackwood would be best if they play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dougs: 2S is 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|bt: i usually play 4nt to ask for specific aces, makes this one easy, 4N-5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: 4N-5@C w no aces, 4N-5N with 2|pg||

nt|bt: 4N-5N w club ace|pg||
nt|kit: This is frightening -- now Meckstroth has no idea if they are off 2 aces or not.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: there must be a bid where E can ask aces with after 3@S???|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly a very bad hand for their methods|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dougs?|pg||
nt|dburn: but not too involved - his approach is the standard one of raising to four to deprive West of a value-showing jump or cue bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is well aware of what a 3@C bid might look like in this situation|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bt: he isnt passing|pg||
nt|dougs: 4@C was needed to set trumps since 4@D would have set @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 4nt?|pg||
nt|dougs: mech was stuck with 4@c|pg||
nt|dburn: just in case Wolpert has real rubbish and his opponents have a slam|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||

nt|chip: might make 4S if defense doesn't get to leading trumps soon enough. But another lost major fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Wolpert again bidding more than Rodwell, whose 2@d at the other table was a sound heart raise|pg||

nt|kit: So what is this double?  If it means lead a spade, Meckstroth didn't.|pg||
nt|kit: nice play at trick 1|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: @HQ @H*|pg||

nt|bigtrain: @C10 is rusinow from 4+card suits standard from <4|pg||
nt|kareno: I think if east cashes out, west can come under pressure but not really enough|pg||
nt|kit: If East cashes all of his clubs West will be squeezed in the red suits.  But if he doesn't cash the last one, the defense may prevail.|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure of the range here - is that an upgraded strong no trump, or maybe they use 14-16|pg||

nt|kareno: Check board 87 please, Op|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is a transfer but doesn't promise 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|chip: In the other room E jumped all the way to 6C after his partner overcalled 2C. Seems a bit much to me, though a better partner would have had a stiff spade (1-4-2-6)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers  open North hand, but NS 1st action tend to be sound|pg||
nt|chip: 1N is 15-17 in theory, seems rather weird to me here. Yes, 3rd seat, but vulnerable with a good lead??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  but this is atypical shape :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 4@D would show slam interest, right?|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: not unexpected -- but not typical |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: Wolpert has "garbage Stayman" in his bag, so used it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not sure of NT range but I'd guess 14-16|pg||
nt|dburn: and Katz, with one of the less desirable hands to lead from, made a strange-looking but logical choice|pg||
nt|dburn: the upshot of all of which looks to be down one and a couple more to Milner, but Kranyak has yet to earn them|pg||
nt|bigtrain: adirect 4@D would be a slam try|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: this 2@S much easier to make:)|pg||
nt|chip: I have sympathy for the DBL, though if S raised hearts instead of XX, N might have bid 5H (though that goes down, so still a swing to EW.)|pg||

nt|dougs: 2n ask and 3@H shows 4 @h with a singleton and extras|pg||
nt|bt: of all |pg||
pc|cT|nt|dougs: 2@S was natural or a max heart raise with shortness|pg||
nt|bt: so opposite a non-practiced partner, avoid sequences like the one they had|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: maybe more on offer now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chip: Kib asks about spade lead (at both tables), they figure E must be void in H to bid this way.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zia shows his hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR was a bit more active, but still lebensol from W|pg||
nt|bt: unlikely as it is|pg||
nt|dougs: 3@D is @h invite plus|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, though even DD there are more tricks than trumps here (despite the majors being impure, thought the minors are pure).|pg||
nt|phil: 5N now? |pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for North now with only Kx|pg||
nt|chip: I think 6C with only 2 spades, though that will give S a bit of a problem.|pg||
nt|phil: over 6@c, would 6@d say 'choose a major'? |pg||
nt|chip: The problem with 6C by N is that N could have very good clubs (say AKQJTx).|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure if S could have made a forcing pass over 5D. |pg||
nt|chip: many pairs play that after preempt-Bid-5X that pass is forcing (particularly when they are NV). Helps the non-preempt side sort things out.|pg||
nt|phil: spec asking about 6@d now - that really sounds like a grand try to me |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play   Diamond over Lee  by 141|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a huge mountain to climb.  They may just shake hands and wait for next year.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Last board of the segment.  We will be back in about 90 min from now |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: The best force bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone commented that they are within the clock (still 8 minutes).  Kranyak:  "we won't finish on time; don't worry"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 6D by N is not a possible bid (it would suggest better spades than Kx).  Kib asks if S would bid 6S over a slow 6C bid, and the answer is maybe not. Over 5N will bid 6S I think.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: 2@D 3@S-4@S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: thanks for letting me jump in  Andy/Walter|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: this probably rates as a minimum 1N bid|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: RD=first control to come?|pg||
nt|chip: 6D by N would be a grand slam try in spades (and would make it impossible to get to 6C) so would never be bid.|pg||

nt|phil: all I can say is Steve Weinsteins and Kevin Fays series on Bridgewinners "Under Further Review" is getting lots of material from today|pg||
nt|warrens:  amazingly, only needed one small difference in South's hand to make 7@H: AQ10xxxx, QJ9x, xx, --|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a thread about grands missing the trump ace|pg||
