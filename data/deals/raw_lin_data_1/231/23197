nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure if Ace is attitude or count..prob att since he wouldn't want unblock|pg||
nt|bt:  east has a nice hand on this auction|pg||
nt|bt:  i am all for penalizing opps but if a vulnerable slam is very likely, i would just take my chances there|pg||
nt|inquiry:  diamond is in 6@h at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pass is flexible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hi joe|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome back, Henri.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=negative/takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes X = 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: lead e/w|pg||
nt|uday:  Hola - can I talk a couple of kibs into being commentators?  If you're interested, send me a msg :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think west should pull, in no way is this a penalty doube, but then again i know they are koached by kokish|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 5th of 8 segments of the finals of the trials for the team to represent the USA in the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt will make in comfort|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If there is anyone who isn't aware, this is the final segment of the finals of the team trials to choose the USA entrant into the Mind Games in France later this year.|pg||
nt|ritong: in lille|pg||
nt|ritong: mid august|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow 4+ cards in nt  std NT honors of short suit|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  15 boards remaining.  The number 1 seed vs the number 2 seed.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Expect good bridge!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jlall:  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: showed weaker 5h bid on this sequence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Lall will certainoy shift to a club now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads 3rd and low|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bt:  anyway competitive bidding is difficult for all of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4 clubs splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: need x tra value to bid 3 clubs answer yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Because East's Dbl indicates @S's, Brad Moss prefers 3@D to (Dbl of 3@C) or Pass. If Brad passed, Fred would have bid 3@H I think. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a while  but Hampson balanced with 4N|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This is the 4th 15 bd segment of the finals of the team trials to determine the USA entry to the Mind Games.  4 more segments are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubtedly showing 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table and voice commentary available without login  using  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it is thunder and lightening and pouring rain here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: per System Summary Form   vs NT  King is strong lead, so Ace did ask attitude|pg||
nt|jlall:  i can hear voice commentary today :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: reg smith|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry:  needs to hold to something like down five to win imps, that means five tricks|pg||
nt|3for3:  my mother 'if you don't like the weather in chicago (or philly) move!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bt:  how many tricks for declarer? 3@S and a club?|pg||
nt|jlall: not clear how to play this, but winning and playing a club seems natural |pg||
nt|jlall: he might try the DK first|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Good morning, Justin.|pg||
nt|ritong: and good fortune for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ritong: needs luck to gain average 2 imps a board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: notice declarer will falsecard at every opportunity|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: Now Lall has a problem -- he may not know the club position.|pg||
nt|jlall:  Meck with great spdes, but he still has A9 of clubs and a partner who ha bid NT, so he opts for 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz2:  With us today is Justin Lall, one of the most promising young players in the USA today.  His team was eliminated by Nickell in the semi-finals.|pg||
nt|jlall:  thanks for reminding me|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell is considering whether to remove 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  given that meck seems to have shown doubt about NT and his ruond suits are T8x and Jxx|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry but getting there is far advanced compared to anything most of the rest of us can do.|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, sorry i forgot to put a smiley :) was joking of course, thanks for the introduction|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think rodders will pass|pg||
nt|jlall:  notice that it is not clear if you just look at the EW hands what game you want to be in|pg||
pc|h7|nt|uday:  Welcome. We have Mark Feldman, SantyClz2, and Lars Anderson ( who has to run off in 30 ) as commentators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson playing 5@CX West|pg||
nt|petergill: With good cards in both of partner's suits, Fred gos to 4@H, which is doomed by the 4-0 break. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: they may have changed 1 or 2 things since then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If no 4-0 trump break, 4@H needs (@SAQ onside and no @d ruff), or @S blockage (e.g Ax in West) or (defence doesn't find @s switch in time). Not that bad a contract. |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my mother:   if you don't like the weather in chicago ... wait 5 minutes|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|kit: Clever jack of clubs play by Meckstroth -- pretending he has the 10|pg||
nt|bt: thanks uday, ill be brief :)|pg||
nt|jlall:  he thought if meck had spades good enough for 4S to be better than 5D opposite Tx, he would have raised 3S to 4S i think|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bt: good to be here at this interesting fight, now that the pretenders are all out :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: regular smith|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 1st of 4 sessions today of the finals of the team trials for the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4 more sessions are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfc: meck falsecarded in both suits from hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  Wolpert playing 3@D East|pg||
pc|s3|nt|uday:  And joining us is Ben (Inquiry) Dickens|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jlall: so first he sets up ruffs, then he works on diamonds, notice the one thing he will not do is play trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: greco scared of tapping declarer because declarer might ruff diamonds in hand, ruff clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: but he has no appealing play really|pg||
nt|jlall: greco does not know declarer doesnt have the @HT either, so tapping him feels normal|pg||
nt|jlall: seems impossible that he will make this whatever happens unless greco drops his hand on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxx in trumps on defence, normal expert defence is to duck two rounds, then win the 3rd and decide whether to play a 4th round of trumps. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroth says sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: unusual, yes|pg||
nt|petergill: West's @S5 (UDCA) allows Meckstroth to count N's shape as 3541|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: I am sure he has a good reason, I can't see it, presumably he's thinking katz has AKT8x of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: not the apol, the huddling|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|jlall: guess he just assumed katz would go up|pg||
nt|jlall: good poker play|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bt: decl will get 4@D and one in each|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|bt:  declarer knows they have a slam so he is happy with 5 down|pg||
nt|ritong: luck does not mean trying to force fate  luck means being fortunate enough to encounter situations where your system is favorable|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfc: KATZ not happy|pg||
nt|jlall: when the HT dropped katz assumed hampson had QT of hearts as I would too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|inquiry:  this is just five down now... losing 3 more spade tricks....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jlall:  Henry and Karen, do you agree with mecks 2C start? Maybe double then 1S would have been better. By the time he got around bidding to NT he had already doubled, cued, bid spades, and raised diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell not unreasonably thought that kind of doubt about NT opposite his actual holding meant NT would be bad|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, i agree|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jlall: or QTx|pg||
nt|petergill: In @D, Rodwell hoped Meckstroth had doubleton jack, hence his two ducks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|petergill: EW's aim is merely to beat 4@H on various layouts - they are not after the 2nd undertrick|pg||
nt|ritong: plus one or two good guessed coinflips|pg||

nt|jlall: interesting, if katz had AKT of hearts would he have gone down?|pg||
nt|ritong: amazing|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Fred can apologise for bidding game and Moss can apologise for not making it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's not used to Meck going into the tank|pg||
nt|dburn: entry problems, I guess - if he had crossed to the club to finesse in hearts again, he could not then pitch his club on diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman is not opening 1N because his hand is too good, he's perfectly fine opening it with that shape|pg||
nt|3for3:  north south play what has become known as meckwelllight...so they will each be somewhat familiar with the others system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell treat that as a weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL = cards   14+|pg||
nt|dburn: but not for the first time in this match the older guys pre-empted higher than the younger guys, and came away with a big swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it was ahopeless position..;thanks david. I appreciate your comments and help|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 29 imps is not a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: is nosiy outside in hall way|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson did not open a strong club, somewhat surprising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can;/t see explanation|pg||
nt|3for3:  platnick getting both suits in|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: X can iclude 5+@S GF|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C suit opener's limited to max of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jlall: probably needed a pointed suit ten|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 2 imps per board is, esp versus these icons|pg||
mb|d|nt|bt:  as we see, gittelman strongly believes in counting ppoints for nt, again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss dont have much pd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman overcalled 4@S   strange to see moss taking lower road|pg||
nt|ritong: brave raise  will work super here|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth not done yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman realized at the adverse vulnerability that Brad Moss had a serious hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  You may note that we only quote these "rules" when they would have worked out.|pg||
nt|jlall:  he has chosen to bid 2N even over 1S rather than 2C|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is much more clear over a 1H response|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This shows secondary diamond suit, not natural|pg||
nt|dburn: and not done at all|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Last session of the day.  Meckwell aren't exactly juniors any more. Fatigue may be becoming an issue.|pg||
nt|jlall:  but hes trying to protect his round suit honors and give away less info, that is his style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: in the other room, ok ok :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome Henri.|pg||
nt|jlall: 2S is a constructive raise, with no game interest they start with 1N|pg||
nt|dburn: Greco choosing not to support diamonds ever, which may be costly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good steal for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
nt|dburn: passes not forcing at this level, so Hampson could not offer one of those|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the 4H bid was very effective|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fred has a veru strong 2h bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: maybe 2@D=@D + major|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell will be pleased to find 4 card support. lots of losers though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||
nt|3for3:  one less loser now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: std leads |pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Looks like 8 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bt:  and Qxx in spades a stopper|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    says south worth 17.90|pg||
nt|jlall:  Fred would have done better to correct to 4S, but that is a complete guess, even knowing north has 5 spades and at most 3 hearts, north could easily have an honor|pg||
nt|jlall:  basically, he was all in on the HQ being a positional value|pg||
nt|jlall:  that looks much smarter when partner has K9x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  only non-standard carding agreement is  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their ACBL CC   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|3for3:  45 boards to go, alan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult  --  especially of the future|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: and Greco underleading to get a club ruff, not knowing that he doesn't need one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|markf:  On hand 1|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator (affectionately known as knr) rates the s hand at 11.6 points, enough for a modern opening bid.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=qj5+a109754+6+qj10|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, i will not try my little laius with brad:) his nature is to try to force fate|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|inquiry:  well yes, that too... but on lead looks like that is working|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bt:  solid 8% game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
nt|jlall: this could be a huge swing for NS|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
nt|uday:  Any experienced kibs feel like jumping in with commentary? buzz me|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman's choice of 4@S made it harder for EW to find the save - 5@C by East over Hamman's 4@s might be a good hand that gets raised to 6@C.|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will overtake the SK and hook a club first|pg||
nt|jlall:  clubs before diamonds, because it might be KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both boards  large swings on very minor differences in evaluation/guess|pg||
nt|dburn: par at the other table, where North-South were not actually saving over 6@d but over 5@s|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
nt|ritong: and, as specs,we certainly like it|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bt:  AK onside, KJ onside, @D 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Katz playing 2@D north   after he found strange opening bid of 1@H|pg||
nt|3for3:  very strange to open a 5 card major when in range for nt...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bad club spots make this bloody|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|jlall: if nickell had overcalled michaels, west would not know his partner had clubs though so he might not be overly aggressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5s is down on 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu:  but 6@D make - and who would lead a @D from W's hand? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I don't say they were right to save against 5@s, only that the result is par|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no one who couldn't see through the cazrds|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: moss playing with 9 and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|bigtrain: or KQ or KJ doubleton legitimatily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most situations  EW carding  upside-down: count, attitude, smith AND suit-preference|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Now the spade shift, although it isn't necessary since South has third trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson claims 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth trying to get hearts out of the way before playing ace and a diamond in the hope of a blockage|pg||
nt|3for3:  even 5422 seems to be many people's idea of NT|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampsons says they could make 5 clubs Greco are you trying to make him feel better|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about these hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|3for3:  alas, sarcasm doesn't travel the internet as well as one might like...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not surprising that Katz-Nickell favor 1@H followed by 2@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: we really need walter to describe the [proprietary] documented exceptions|pg||
nt|jlall:  zia chose to rebid 2C, hamman chose to pass that (slightly low because partner might have 3 spades, but clearcut imo), so this will be a small swing to nickell|pg||
nt|jlall:  finding a way to get to 4S gets the cash on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall:  but that is a very lucky contract assuming they don't let you ruff a heart|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jlall:  the 3H bid just showed 5 spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: a side four carder is worth a supplementary card in the long suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

nt|jlall: this time hampson upgrades|pg||
nt|petergill: Moss followed the theory "preempt one level lower when vul vs not vul, and one level higher when at fav vul" but it didn't work this time, due to Meckstroth's boldness. |pg||

nt|dburn: and Rodwell may take a shot at it, despite the vulnerability (or maybe because of it, since East is supposed to have a sound hand)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A good plan for advancing players is to believe the opp's signals early in the hand.  Be a little more suspicious later in the hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman rejecting 1NT, but this could be a serious violation of an obscure Law|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or just Stayman without stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss's PASS worked really well in the auction|pg||
nt|jlall:  1N in both tables because they play the same system, opening 1D in natural is much more appealing than in RM precision|pg||
nt|3for3:  might easily be duplicated here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: zia doesn't love clubs but his partner does|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: asks @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if you normally lead A from AK  at 5+ level you often want to lead unsupported Ace -- so switch back to K from AK and show COUNT to aid cashout|pg||
pc|cT|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
nt|petergill: On @DK lead, 4@s might make|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S or 4@SX e.g @DK to ace, @SJ wins, @D ruff, @SA, spade to dummy, @D 10 pitching a club. Doesn't help N to cover @SJ. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: eric once explained some very esoteric reason to me but has since admited they just found it easier to think all upside-down|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
nt|ritong: can make, but not single dummy i fear|pg||
pc|s4|nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
nt|jlall: on a club lead if greco ducks 3N can be defeated|pg||
nt|chick:  Burn's Third Law:  You cannot make 3N on a crossruff.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th  best  smith echo|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has just stuck with his diamonds, I'm not sure about that|pg||
nt|jlall: greco almost for sure is 1534 on the bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: and hampson has announced 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: if greco had 2 spades he would have raised spades at some point, and with 1 spade and 2 diamonds he wouldnt bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is very tricky with no communication|pg||
nt|jlall: however, EW have no suit to attack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco is shaking his head|pg||
nt|jlall: he can win, play a spade, club back he wins the ace, cashes a heart, plays a spade|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a winning line|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
nt|3for3:  obviously we can see ns would have been better off bidding 5@H/4@S, but it is hard to see who should have done something different|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bt:  there is a case for west returning a small heart at second trick, give decl xxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:  with @CA in east, @DK in west is likely|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jlall: so far, so good|pg||
nt|bt: decl can place north w @C A or K, thus diamond situation is clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure about xx|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: if it asks for " help", @c A becomes very leadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  with @CAK  south would lead the suit   with neither -- he doesn't have opening bid|pg||
nt|farrukh:  Hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: had to guess @ss, take the @c and backwards @ds  lots of black magic|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: zias club spots are tough  on hamman|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond lead opening|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good play by katz|pg||
nt|jlall: he will go up with the ace here|pg||
nt|jlall: he needs hand entries, even if the CK is on going up with the ace is correct|pg||
nt|warrens:  if the defense cashes their two winners, they can win 3 imps (assuming declarer guesses the @D suit)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: giving up a sure 300 vs maybe losing a +50 is poor strategy|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Open room:  1@s (w) p 2@c p p x p 2@h ppp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: apparently XX forced 2 clubs for c or d, but declarer's dia play made it clubs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|3for3:  welcome bigtrain|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 8 of @H's looks like a count card, so Diamond might know that the @H will cash|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 1@D is catchall...  2+ 11-15|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i doubt zia opens 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Greco in 2@S East|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||
nt|markf:  If they dont play Puppet over 2NT, this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|bt:  another thin slam, will greco hampson bid it up again?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X can include 5@H GF|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss helped win his side that swing for passing 1N when hamman overcalled|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from 2010 CC   2N = ogust|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not open 2@S on North hand.  Personally, I think it is a close call.|pg||
nt|jlall: 3@S is a down the middle bid for hampson at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|jlall: probably doesnt like Jxx of hearts but what can you do|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows non-max shape|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: must put my bifocals on again :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: only Mollo would have EW declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: shocking dummy for fred|pg||
nt|markf:  His hand is certainly worth 2NT|pg||
nt|bt: there is a trend of opening nt when in the approximate range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says tell me when to stop|pg||
nt|jlall: nick will probably bid here|pg||
nt|jlall: could be double game swing, double shows cards and he has all red suit values/length|pg||
nt|jlall: and his opps are r/w, I just don't see him passing here |pg||
nt|jlall: im told voice commentators betting against the pull|pg||
nt|jlall: tough call either way!|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT looks clearcut|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: well i did not expect garner to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e 11 to 14|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rodwell says has distributional hand of some sort|pg||
mb|1N|nt|uday:  The other table opened 1H and reached 4H on the same lead|pg||
nt|jlall: great decision, and good job voice commentators :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3hearts is invitational|pg||
nt|warrens:  almost impossible to convince declarer that North had the @D queen, once North showed up with KJ of @S's and A of @C's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry connection was lost|pg||
nt|dburn: useful entry to dummy, that, which Hamman can exploit by playing a diamond or a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: but the play may already have progressed while the technology regressed, so to speak|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it didn't progress very far!|pg||
nt|dburn: I see - perhaps Hampson is wondering which of his clubs to play, though it seems odd to contemplate the matter at this length|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: all in again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says are you going to guess the clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: same auction     Nickell led @C7|pg||

nt|farrukh:  Well some action going on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Fasten your seatbelts, folks.|pg||
nt|farrukh:  Gitelman will pass I suppose as he has shown 4/4 or 4/5 |pg||
nt|ritong: ya, brad seems to be eager to shove anytime it will not be completely ridiculous|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer will have to play on diamonds, and hope for good splits|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  I'm not sure that if I were considering x'ing someone for penalty at low levels, I'd pick Hamman...|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Zia did pass but still declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred knows dummy has short hearts, because his partner made a takeout |pg||
nt|farrukh:  Remember with 5+@s, he would have overcalled 1@s instead of dbl |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: double by brad suggest diamond trap|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: He gets them, but the trump promotion on the clubs will defeat him.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's fine i think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: i think the needed to play @S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall:  X showing hearts|pg||
nt|jlall:  also, fred really had no appealing lead other than that too. it looks like his side has more than half the deck, dummy has shortness in both majors, and meck has a major 2 suiter, definitely a good thematic lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will play the DK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I believe Meckwell in the 34th year of their partnership.  Even if I'm off by a few years, they've had time to generate a significant number of agreements.|pg||
nt|jlall:  it kills the entry for the CQ if declarer has stiff K of clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfc: 1nt by w = transfer bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: so he was kind of forced to wait for partner to re-open|pg||
nt|mcphee: if brad hooks this the defence can do some damage|pg||
nt|mcphee: West will be in a position to score all of his trumps!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jlall: this is not an unreasonable play at all|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he had to finesse here, to make - was a guess|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they won their 1st national event [pairs] in Norfolk 1979   i remember because navy had invited me to move there just a couple of months earlier|pg||
nt|jlall:  they make fun of me sometimes for playing too fast but sometimes they are 100 % to make a play and it takes them a 30 seconds...they are just double checking everything though, it's a good thing to do|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: hits a very good flop again, i d say|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jlall: if katz has 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jlall: nick thinks he has to get clubs going|pg||
nt|kareno:  As long as you aren't in (or likely to be) in time trouble.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hamman treated south hand as 18-19 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell leans in|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: good shift|pg||
nt|jlall:  the key decision on this hand was really moss playing the SA|pg||
nt|jlall:  the ten at trick 1 looks possible|pg||
nt|jlall:  im not sure what would happen from there, maybe diamond over heart heart heart ruff club|pg||
nt|ritong: but for a smaller gain than his first try|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|jlall: hampson could have KQJxxxx xx x Kxx for instance|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: go SOX!!!!|pg||
nt|jlall:  so mecks low heartp lay was dual purpose|pg||
nt|jlall:  it started to strip gitelman|pg||
nt|jlall:  while threatening to set up his long heart|pg||
nt|jlall:  i agree with voice commentators, moss had to just pitch his diamonds...that seems natural also |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|jlall:  pitching a club created a whole threat where you have to keep meck out of dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: u think showing @C or asking for partial @D stop?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that  positional @D stop|pg||
nt|bigtrain: as long as they don't give up an early spade trick or block the heart sit this should go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: speaking of giving up an early spade|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: well looks like he'll score this up...  maybe even 10 tricks|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator values the n hand at 21.00.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=83+akq107+aq2+a73|pg||
nt|bt: the reason for opening nt, should be "I have no rebid if i dont do it"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss asks did you insult my lead and they all laugh|pg||
nt|jlall: you will get count from katz|pg||
nt|ritong: guess in @hs gives nine tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: including 2@cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director -- Guys four boards in 45 min is unacceptable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all agree|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wolpert also led @C10|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1 C = 16 any|pg||
nt|bt: in this case it was certainly wrong|pg||
nt|ritong: jumpshift with three can be a problem|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bt: now if you dont have any methods after a 1@S or 1NT response ....|pg||
nt|bt: but i assume at this level they have|pg||
nt|jlall: it seems like leading K from AK would have solved this situation|pg||
nt|jlall: rather than on the ace lead, attitude denying the king|pg||
nt|jlall: even if you play A from AK|pg||
nt|jlall: when you bid 1H |pg||
nt|jlall: your partner will lead from Ax|pg||
nt|bigtrain: catchall/nebulous @D 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|petergill: I now think Mark is right and I am wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: XX = 4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 hcp, 2+@D|pg||
nt|jlall:  very interesting hand, these kind of partials are where the best teams really thrive, they are the "in the trenches" kind of 5 imp swings that amount to a LOT in a 120 board match|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure gitelmoss have included gazzilli or alike|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell didn't bid with South hand after 1@C-1@H[8-11, not 5+@S]|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 8-10 balanced|pg||
mb|2H|an|transfer|nt|kit: Here is a potential swing -- 6@H might be reached, and it doesn't look like it makes.|pg||
nt|bt: then they deserve a loss :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hmmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: ? play smith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
nt|jlall:  they are definitely not "nothing" hands, even if they are not action packed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1NT = control ask|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Usually at this table there wouldn't be much discussion of which pair was taking too much time.  This time it seems far more even than usual.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D denies 3 or 4@H|pg||
nt|markf:  I was wrong, finesse would work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: lots of writing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jlall:  they are what seperate the men from the boys|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rodwell treating hand as 1-suiter in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says we refused to play 2 spades at this table|pg||
nt|mcphee: well he needed to play in 2 for a +|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 3 (A -2 K-a)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any inferences from Rodwell's PASS?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 4 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both sides of table|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  this is a friendly hand for 3nt, even with the @D's offside, since S has no entry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: without penalty interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: udca|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2 spades weak raise|pg||
nt|bt: a natural, wide range system is unplayable without conventions or "black magic"|pg||
nt|markf:  4-3-3-3 hands are poor for offense, I much prefer 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pd let me tell you you got one more point think next hand have 4|pg||
nt|jlall: not a killing lead here, but very expert standard|pg||
nt|jlall: freco still has to make it|pg||
nt|jlall: greco*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@H would show 5+@S 4+@H less than invite |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Karen Allison said earlier today "If I had to choose 1 person to declare a hand to save my life, I'd pick Bob Hamman."|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: huge praise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: 2@H = sets trump and asks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = blanced|pg||
nt|kit: However, if East is declarer, as he will be, Bathurst better stay away from a spade lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks walter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th best nt|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodders chose to focus on spades, cant blame him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin does anyone use reverse flannery with 6@S 4@H??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   @Sxxxxxx  @HAQTx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck: Less than invitational|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: It looks like from here they will be able to stop.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he can bid RKC or wait here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i guess 3@C waiting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: x of 2 hearts ? rodwell says penalty|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer will have to duck @H's only once to make|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT would have been RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X by either player would have been penalty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell asks low from 3 small? yes says platnick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfc: GUESS??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now they are in cuebidding mode|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C coming up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C pure cue or source of tricks?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cuebid|pg||
nt|kit: they did stop in 4@H at other table, so possible swing for Milner.|pg||
nt|jlall: he is going to cash his spades and play a heart to the jack|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bigtrain: thats surprising|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serious|pg||
nt|ritong: they usually have very sound preempts  perhaps is allergic to 7222|pg||
nt|jlall:  i would do it with extreme disparity|pg||
nt|jlall:  like that|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  S has an automatic 2@c bid according to Sabine Auken.|pg||
nt|jlall:  but usually not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the ruff of a heart loser won't hurt zia|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall:  people asking if meck is worth a 3S raise, personally I would not bid 3S|pg||
nt|jlall:  its NV and you have no idea if partner has club values or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Platnick asks could He have a 5 card minor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: (Rodwell)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: on D hook|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  She's a big believer in taking the 1 level away from the opponents.|pg||
nt|bt: a spade back makes this very interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: @d position not quite clear here|pg||
nt|ritong: @d9 then 8 by zia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: zia told declarer that d might be interior|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: Bd 49: if @H hook, he has to play very precisely I think (without looking at gib, I never would do that) - I think he has to then play @Da, @d ruff, @SA, @d ruff then club and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guess to finess the nine - not easy|pg||
nt|ritong: and side opposition|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jlall: then he will duck 2 rounds of clubs and win the third|pg||
nt|jlall: at which point, he will have to guess diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: i'm shocked with the poor trump|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will all aces and spaces judged that he needed his partner to be able to take control.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must really like the @C trick source|pg||
nt|jlall: unlucky pitch|pg||
nt|jlall: but it should be noted, once nickell tanked for a long time on that pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says when can we get to give out smith signals|pg||
nt|jlall: greco was a lock to get @D right|pg||
nt|bt: west can make by finessing clubs and endplaying north|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell now knows where the honors are, since the defense gave up on the hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says that was a weakkkkkkkkkkkk raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all laughter|pg||
nt|markf:  Looks like a par result; 3@S down 1, would make 3@H|pg||
nt|jlall: with Axx of diamonds nickell would not be pained|pg||
nt|farrukh:  yes, but Fred is very well aware of Zia and Hamman playing MUD leads |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Hampson also in 3N on lead of @H9  [Nickell bid 2@H on 2nd round]|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bigtrain: generally speaking the top priority to determine is trump strength|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it will hurt him in the sense that it will cost him an overtrick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jlall:  perhaps the master bid is 1D p 1S p 2D p 2S p 3H showing 2461 and an invite, thats the only way they would ever get to this game|pg||
nt|jlall:  haha|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|mcphee: even if he continues @D it will still go 1 down|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jlall: katz also pitched a painless diamond which is hard to do with Qxxx staring at KJxx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Bd 49 - if you do all that, you might then say Sorry for taking so long  :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|bt: @H A then @CT is not obvious|pg||
nt|3for3:  he needs to play a club now...|pg||
nt|3for3:  then later throw ibn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winning team represents USA in the world champships [formerly Team Olympiad]  later this year in France   |pg||
nt|3for3:  great shift by platnick, btw|pg||
nt|3for3:  needs to win 3 spades, 3 clubs, ace of hearts...then throw in diamond with long spade|pg||
nt|bt: south is probably known to be 36 in majors by now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes it does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can't set up spades and play 3rd round of @C both|pg||
nt|3for3:  dont cash heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Platnick trick 2 shift was @S2   Nickell played @D9|pg||
nt|3for3:  need that for transportation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still hs @HA for @C fineese|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it works|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @C10...  what do you want N to do?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt made in other room|pg||
nt|3for3:  nickel shifted to diamond and it was clear sailing from there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he has to play exact but can make from here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bigtrain: if N ducks the @C10 THEN you cash @HA and play the last @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry |pg||
nt|warrens:  If he led the @C 8, N could have beaten this hand by going up and blocking the suit.|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway the trump return saved fred the guess|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|nt|bigtrain: now @HA  and a club|pg||
nt|3for3:  great hand, this|pg||
nt|3for3:  12 imps, the current difference hang in the balance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell again sorry for taking so long|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes 8 of clubs overtaken by 9|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that was a very strange @C8... i wonder if the operator got it wrong|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm assured she didn't|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but leading the 8 makes it possible for N to defeat a cold contract|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you have to lead the @C10 to start an unblock|pg||
nt|bigtrain: W had the unblock clubs to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: okay|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jlall: so hard to believe greco could go wrong in D ever|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: says rodwell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: leading the 8 allows th defense to suceed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|warrens:  Diamond can beat this now by cashing a @C and exiting a red card or he can play a spade.  but he can't play a red card first.|pg||

mb|2D|an|hts|nt|3for3:  this looks like a 'breather' a more strightforward hand for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 40 board match :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5d requires heart guess|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what 4@d would have been - maybe a void|pg||
nt|ritong: ok i try an other way  is 110 the actual score?:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: Canape overcall -- new style :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = art GF raise|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Black Magic" is a term invented by Edgar Kaplan circa 1970 to describe how many partnerships were able to show widely disparate values with the same bids.|pg||
nt|bt: yea, edgar is my guru|pg||
nt|bt: and amazingly black magic is still around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I am typing what they say not any bridge analysis :)|pg||
nt|ritong: somehow perspiring through your sarcastic tones, i d say  kaplan was a master at that|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If I caused some confusion, I'm attributing name to Kaplan, not the methods.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 50 - 3NT was the right contract - unlucky. 3@d also fails, so you should be in 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of the 2/1 pairs open South   ALL of the big clubbers would |pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume you're home justin :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sabine's book is "I Love This Game."|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will certainly get them to 4@S, but Rodwell won't be quitting|pg||
nt|bt: i wish edgar was still around|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H promises 4|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, I am enjoying listening to the voice commentary today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or he found a way to charge his laptop while on a never ending flight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I'm not sure what methods zia and bob use over 1S..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfc: tiger broom to sweep the streets|pg||
nt|kit: in 5@H, Rodwell will have to guess the heart position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin overcalls 1@S  Bathurst jumps to 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meck says pass by rodwell is ambiguous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: obviously that was supposed to go to other table|pg||
nt|kit: with no enemy bidding, they got to 5@H in other room.|pg||
nt|bt: anyway gitleman has an interesting hand on this auction|pg||
nt|ritong: looks like|pg||
nt|ritong: had the merit to crystalball @s Q off|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl to slow the auction down and avoid poor 4@h contracts, perhaps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D = 0-7 any|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: sold for 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what a great partner|pg||
nt|markf:  4@H seems like a lot; may be making his partner guess|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred must be amused by all the bidding with partner jumping in hearts!!! |pg||
nt|bt: west has a diamond lead, i think, unless there is a rule against leading from kQ|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This would appear to come under the heading of a "sound game" for Meckwell.|pg||
nt|dburn: needs a little more than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Was Hampson's Rdbl at other table a "pretend Support Dbl": due to being 4333? I don't know. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 21-23|pg||
nt|farrukh:  Even if @H was over ruffed, Fred was making contract +1|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bigtrain: game try X|pg||
nt|dburn: well done by Hampson, who might have been tempted to bid 6@d at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says my usually dummy pd|pg||
nt|jlall: normal auction here, but NS should have been competing|pg||
nt|ritong: moss treated it as a t/o double based on @hs, with "nebulous" @d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D - transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|markf:  I'm impressed with Fred's Pass|pg||
nt|markf:  Can make 6 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman says best dummy of the day Katz says we know who was thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: impossible to know, hampson did not want to squeal on spades because he might defend 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  2N is some bid by moss|pg||
nt|jlall:  he was really hoping they'd take the push to 3S|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  World Mind Sports Games:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mind_Sports_Games|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  must be a rule....against leading ffrom kq...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: and also because he is vul at imps with a bad hand|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mcphee: this is a pretty good game, not clear if he will make|pg||
nt|phil: Zia led the @sA against 5@h|pg||
nt|dburn: down four? seems generous|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Lall needs to cash ace of spades to give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|ritong: zia had to raise here because his pard was not in balancing position, so, basically, he has a hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Chinese Chess:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: trump switch is a tough play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: so much for that -- now heart guess for 6|pg||
nt|jlall: that is life sometimes|pg||
nt|jlall:  this would probably be a very interesting hand to play in 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm not sure you could make 4|pg||
nt|jlall:  strange to see meckwell and greco-hampson miss back to back games, no matter how low HCP they are|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes|pg||
nt|jlall:  with both black suits off|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bt: with this amount of bidding, you can look at the vulnerability and see who is pushing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco opened 2N and superaccept to 4@H -- i wouldn't have guessed EITHER action|pg||
nt|3for3:  this hand will definitely be faster than the previous one|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: he will now|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ritong: fred has @dQx, visibly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bt: not to mention he can look under the screen and see who is his partner|pg||
nt|ritong: playing him for @h voàid as well is surprising|pg||
nt|jlall:  Henry says the other room found the CT play from dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: declarer led @C after |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jlall: greco trying to deny katz an entry to hook the heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10  after @D eliminated|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman would have done better to play a heart honor|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: seems like he should have cashed ace of spades first -- time to get diamond ruff after that, and not likely anybody is void in spades.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: but, as lall said, who am i to argue meck's choices|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chip: I N hadn't won the heart A to play a club, contract could make (by endplaying South).|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jlall:  the idea being, to make declarer think moss has 6 hearts for his vulnerable 2N bid|pg||
nt|jlall:  which would make him play for Jx of clubs on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell:  "Dbl (instead 2NT) by Moss would have been -ve, right?".  Gitelman: Yes|pg||
nt|ritong: for that matter, and with all due respect, i somehow disagree with direct 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: hello chip  welcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e knows w is short in hts|pg||
nt|chip: Could miss a good 4S save by passing (auction is at 3N when back to you), though I agree it has defects.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|kit: jack of hearts percentage play anyway, as South could have AQ10|pg||
nt|jlall: katz is not to be denied|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlall: he is goig to be getting scared|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think he is playing moss for 2542|pg||

nt|inquiry:  i don't think fred will make a negative double over 1@S, we will see after p 1@C-1@S.... |pg||
nt|jlall: nice defense|pg||
nt|ritong: hi justin hi all|pg||
nt|jlall:  wow|pg||
nt|jlall:  NS sold to 4H at the other table|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, it actually saved a trick,well done|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 20-21|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|3for3:  on the diamond guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: they play transfers over the double, so hampson will probably bid 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's easy to do if neither of you bids|pg||
nt|3for3:  i suspect a heart lead tho|pg||
nt|ritong: different position here, where gitelman is in prebalancing position|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: no prealert about 3@D??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=4-fit  inv+|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Another off-beat 1NT opening|pg||
nt|kit: 3C puppet Stayman -- now they have found hearts, but will they get too high?|pg||
nt|jlall: usually with 4 spades greco bids 2S, but with a horrible 3rd seat opener he is allowed to bid 1S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = transfer but might be only 4@H when 5@S held|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jlall: i dont blame him here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D accepts invite  but no slam interest|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = limit raise +|pg||
nt|104891: sry priv|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is art game try usually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- does 2N guarantee 4-fit or can it be 3??|pg||
nt|dburn: not such a good contract by South - Meckwell may be able to play by North, depending on the vagaries of system|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: even had he played @S trick 2 I think he can make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: shift to low club that will beat it also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=slam try in @H|pg||
nt|jlall:  3H wa a good rebid, if he bid 2H north might have doubled|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which of them was closer to a bid - I guess South could open a random weak two or bid 2@s over 1NT, but both of those look a bit hairy|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, with no known heart fit Jxx of hearts looks horrible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about 3@D   trust Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is 98% 4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|inquiry:  the @S split is just enough to set 4@S... good doublet by fred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they started to pick up the bids before they saw the x|pg||

nt|ritong: zia has two top losers, apart from the trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 4@S RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e/w say sorry but then west says nice hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred will look around for a club to lead, not finding one, he will start a red suit|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That was a mispelling most of us couldn't make even if we tried.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroths says maybe we can make one of these|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might be 3 with a shapely invite IF they play semi-forcing NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = u/d attitude|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if SP then he would have played @D10|pg||
nt|warrens:  for those asking about the last hand, yes, declarer could have made 5 if he won the @C Ace and exited a small one.  but he could have made 6 if it was QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play u/d suit preference|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 = u/d attitude|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the ONLY time they play standard carding is on a lead that shows the ace-king|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only then that its all u/d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: other than that its all u/d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry for poor typing skills everyone :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|inquiry:  he has to lose 1@C, 1@H, and 2@S... with no lines to try avoid those losers....he is  worrying about fred having five spades|pg||
nt|inquiry:  for his double|pg||
nt|jlall:  they had no chance at this table|pg||
nt|dburn: don't know whether even these relays can sort out the @sJ10, without which slam would be pretty horrible|pg||
nt|dburn: what they need is some bid by North which says "OK, now I know what I can find out, do you like your hand for slam?"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: On a better day this slam would make, but this is not a better day|pg||
nt|ritong: this shift simplifies matters|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, there was some tangling around|pg||
nt|ritong: still has to make a decision about his basic suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  intra finesse in clubs I think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  he may try to shorten his trumps by ruffing diamonds twice... but everything seems to be down one.|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think greco should pass 2@H henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps even two fits, when west was not hot to raise to 3@h with three  here, 3@d would have hit big|pg||
nt|jlall: KQJx of hearts and very defensive values...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try to catch them higher greedy me:)|pg||
nt|ritong: so his idea should be to optimize trump handling|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfc: i suspect 5nt was an effort to check spade quality below top thre honors|pg||
nt|passell: I think it was choice of slams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson must have been looking for something else..he finally passes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz2:  Burn's LAW Of Total Trump (and others):  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Declarer assumes hearts 3-2, of course.  So, counting his winners, if clubs 4-2 he has 4 clubs, 5 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 spade.  Not enough.  So he needs clubs 3-3 also.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah thats a good point, with an 8 card fit when you bid to 2S they will often compete further|pg||
nt|ritong: also, 1@s then 2@s depicts my garbage accurately|pg||
nt|3for3:  but you have good system skills...|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to limit losers to one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chip: This looks like the normal, if unsuccessful, line.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: hello jacky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: excellent says gitelman|pg||
nt|ritong: nice to see you|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has forced his partner to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
nt|jlall: however, he can make him ruff again|pg||
nt|jlall: for a promotion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfc: katz raises his eyebrows|pg||
nt|ritong: for this purpose, @h to the 9 was very possible|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: could try to ruff 2D|pg||
nt|passell: when partner showed 8 plus with 1spade and he had 25 highs he was always in slam|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|santyclz2:  "Simplifies the play."|pg||
nt|jlall: oops|pg||
nt|ritong: since it caters with J10x onside|pg||
nt|ritong: and does not cancel a further K hook|pg||
nt|chip: Heart to the nine more attractive if transportation was easier, and here ruffs possibly pending.|pg||
nt|ritong: but, if zia did not play that way, there certainly is an explanation|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't he need to lead spdae first to succeed if he hooks the h9|pg||
nt|chip: For example, here with clubs 5-1, finessing the heart 9 would allow a ruff with Kx(x) of hearts onside.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|dburn: he may be dismayed to find that he needs one of two queens to oblige - didn't work last time|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman says he is just going to take his 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: katz showing his hand to moss|pg||
nt|inquiry:  rodwell is sruggling in 3@D on this hand in the other room... so nice pickup for diamond|pg||

mb|2H|nt|passell: a diamond seems normal and neccessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: great choice by nick |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Walter -- what is alert of 1@D?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D is NOT an aleert just natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director is to check not happy with what board is being played now watching|pg||
nt|warrens:  1@D is a natural overcall and 1NT is a good @D raise, right Walter?|pg||
nt|3for3:  pass looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't but yes :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz2:  The 2@h bid is a book "midnight swiss weak 2".|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hearts dummy first Nickell says nice|pg||
nt|markf:  Double Dummy can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: hamman did not resist other room, and tried for a @s fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th 2nd higher from trash|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is equivalent to a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more action from Lall|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D-P-1@S-2@C//DBL[3@S]|pg||
nt|inquiry:  the double is takeout|pg||
nt|jlall: katz will pass, his free 1N has a minimum of about 8|pg||
nt|dburn: ungainly sort of contract at the other table, when North hoped to find a spade fit and a thin game|pg||
nt|ritong: which would have enhanced his hand big time|pg||
nt|3for3:  oh, perhaps he was 'trapping'|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: maybe a good 7|pg||
nt|jlall: so his hand is garbage|pg||
nt|ritong: purely so|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this isn't a bad choice either, though it could blow a tempo sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: trump shift, @SA diamond, duck ace ...|pg||
nt|bt: and east has to play for exactly Jxx in south|pg||
nt|markf:  Declarer could make on trump lead by playing for Jxx offside, but not best line|pg||
nt|jlall:  what would you guys bid over the neg X?|pg||
nt|jlall:  i like 2S|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward rebid now - 3@c often played as extras, so 2@s his only real option|pg||
nt|jlall:  Even if they don't play it as extras|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 2@S is the only option|pg||
nt|jlall:  KJT97|pg||
nt|jlall:  Uncle Bob chose 3C in the other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X doesn't promise @C as far as i'm concerned|pg||
nt|jlall:  this is part of the reason i like 2S, even oppsoite 1-4 in the blacks 2S looks just fine|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not me|pg||
nt|warrens:  now 2@D must show a minimum|pg||
nt|bigtrain: WEST just siad he had a good raise|pg||
pc|s5|nt|robinswr: with 4531, I would double 1 club |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hampson is in 4@s on 111.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, Greco is declaring.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: when opp have shown themselves to be in swing mode -- does that affect your thought process on defense??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: based on meck's comment when asked if he knew it was his lead the answer is yes it affects your thoughts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X not 2@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman picked 3@c, so Zia's negative doubles may have more tendency to show both suits|pg||
nt|3for3:  north south do play meckwell lite.  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|inquiry:  so diamond picked up 11 imps on the last board... as 3@dx was down two at the other table|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1 or 2 down on the @D guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says Gitelman thinks perhaps that was a bit optimustic|pg||
nt|bt: that won paralyze nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss shaking head|pg||
nt|bt: wont|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|robinswr: 5 of clubs probably suit preferance for hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: when singleton in dummy most play suit preferance|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c now would sort of threaten the declarer of a ruff and save the @d Q|pg||
nt|jlall: the players would never guess the imp results, board 2 EW are cold for a vul game and both tables played partial down white... board 3 both made a very difficult 3N, board 4 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: platnick let 4S slip through vul to win 5 against 790...board 6 both sides sold to 2H when they coudl make a partial|pg||
nt|dburn: but, if East can somehow find a diamond shift after @h10, there is a chance to beat 1NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfc: msp|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, problem solved by Platnick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is RM  [rodwell-meckstroth]  and RM Lite variations  diamond-platnick, greco-hampson, cheek-grue, lall-kranyack and a few others in this trials|pg||
nt|warrens:  making 5 seems odd|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5 is alot|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jlall: good call henri|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5th heart will squeeze him to have to guess for the contract|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: I think he led the queen to deny the king, so if his partner were void he would be forced to ruff.|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any chance he ducks this??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ifhes ducking it he needs ti do it fast|pg||
nt|jlall:  good play by meck|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if Meckstroth continues a low diamond for Rodwell to ruff...|pg||
nt|3for3:  3 top losers, and a fair amount of handling, this is far from trivial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if already asked -- but Walter    sitting south would you show your HCP over 1@D overcall [DBL] or hope for penalty?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jlall:  he had no idea which round suit might be good|pg||
nt|dburn: ...there may be some danger of loss of trump control|pg||
nt|jlall:  this play taps declarer and takes away a diamond winner|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @D7 says @C|pg||
nt|dburn: @d7 reverse suit preference for clubs|pg||
nt|rick3son:  look and see, ace trumps lead worked out well also|pg||
nt|passell: probably cost a trump trick  but looking at dummy is a good thing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: fred has his fealers out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: so quiet in here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says we are fine on time|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|inquiry:  nine sure tricks here... 4@C, 1@H, 1@H ruff, 2@D and a @S... so play shuld be quick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   Lall-Bathurst   sorry Kevin|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: just in case partner has Kx of hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: not good hands for a team thats way behind|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah, humanly works|pg||
nt|warrens:  this will require a little careful handling|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bt: i think it was a tough defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  guess is overtrick or undertrick|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcphee: phew!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|warrens:  but with W having the long clubs, this line should work well|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at this color i would attempt to penalize...  but would change horses after the good @d raise|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz2:  Jinxed by the commentators.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: @s9? doesn't that ask for clubs?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Greco (e) is in 3nt on bd 112 with a @s lead.|pg||
nt|ritong: only snag is, how to join dummy to draw last trump  here, both ways work out|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: not that it matters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Fred concedes and then asks who had the ace of diamond shucks|pg||
nt|dburn: normal play in clubs, but this may be down two now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roghog:  EW card: http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/KranyakWolpert.jpg|pg||
nt|roghog:  sorry, I mean NS|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: mind you, after @d7 he might have suspected that East had @cK|pg||
nt|jlall:  so a swing for the style of bidding your longest suit, then your second longest suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it'll never catch on|pg||
nt|jlall:  I confess id still bid 2S. Hamman must have played it great to make 3C|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Bid what you have?  What a  radical idea!|pg||
nt|jlall:  hamman did indeed play it double dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the convention has a name  YBYSIBM     you bid your suit, i bid mine|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Brown sticker?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get used to seeing that Justin :)|pg||
nt|jlall:  I do not mean to sound surprised. Bob is my hero and always will be!|pg||
nt|jlall:  he bids his longest suit, then his second longest suit, then plays it double dummy and wins 7|pg||
nt|jlall:  easy game|pg||
nt|jlall:  this is down 2 no matter what happens but moss doesnt know that|pg||
nt|jlall:  he is trying to figure out a layout where he can make|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|warrens:  Ace and a @S now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky for defense   in other room east also held @SKT doubleton|pg||
nt|warrens:  needs to play a club to get the @H pitch first, either before or after the Ace of @s's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads are? rusinow yes says meckstroth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: in this situation and it pays to ask|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodders will play a trump through i think, but he might not know that declarer has this shape rather than 6223|pg||
nt|jlall:  it doesnt matter though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Henry talking about Jeff Rubens  so my quesiton is: was he still a student when publishing  The Bridge Journal|pg||
nt|jlall:  he will not take a second heart finesse, you heart it here first!|pg||
nt|jlall:  heard*|pg||
nt|jlall:  meck is never ducking that HJ with K9x of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm one of the lucky few to have a complete set of The Bridge Journal -- GREAT short-lived publication|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|bt: though if east bids 4@S here, he likel has a lot of cards in the pointed suits, 3 small clubs is unlikely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell play rusinow (2nd of touching honors) in suits where they have shown 4+ cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director still watching|pg||

nt|jlall:  that is why meck is a great player, even if it doesnt matter he will never tell you more about the hand than he has to, so you always have to be thinking, its very very hard playing against him|pg||
nt|warrens:  a blank spot by declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: new leader again|pg||
nt|ritong: was @c to the K, ofc|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: so Justin's action picks up 3    and a lot of comments from spectators|pg||
nt|jlall:  he does not auto pilot and play a trump EVER|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 83 needs to inset score|pg||
nt|ahollan1: movie not showing score from 83|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director here to discuss the appeal now so a short break|pg||
nt|bigtrain: insert|pg||
nt|warrens:  Debbie, did he make it or give up a ruff and go down 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: appeal was from segment  5  board  69|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, which?|pg||
nt|passell: on his own declarer would play the king of clubs  since he would pick up stiff jack or queen and lose only to stiff ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|an|gerber?|nt|jlall: nick might consider overcalling 1N if r/w|pg||
nt|ritong: very creative|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I think the operator is having a little fun with us...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it was alerted..you guess|pg||
nt|ritong: i have nothing against fun, but considering the importance of the event, perhaps an accurate report would be in order|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i can't read reply|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: since they will be stealing a lot|pg||
nt|jlall: but r/r is a different story|pg||
nt|ritong: brad will make some try here, but they have no fit, so i expect 3NT at last|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia in 6@D on @SJ lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d not too bad|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss figured it out though|pg||
nt|jlall:  but he had to use some brain cells|pg||
nt|dburn: may be "play 3NT from your side"|pg||
mb|4D|an|?|nt|inquiry:  1nt passed out is likely|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fast|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes down one|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Will they get to the "cold" 6D contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably includes balanced game force   so could be 2@C|pg||
nt|inquiry:  defense has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow leads with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  but nickell will ahve to find a spade after taking the last heart....|pg||
nt|jlall: hampsons partners range is 11-13, and not a great 13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: did not see bidding here ask ? being asked|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N showing 3@D??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Zia in 3N north|pg||
nt|ritong: take that, ritong:)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  If someone wants to be imortalized in wikipedia, there doesn't appear to be an article about The Bridge Journal.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well back to the commentaing...  talk with you later ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss gets a warning from the director for taking excessively long time on the last bd|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, i think 3D is a transfer to 3N, the idea being you want the overcaller on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, of course, does not play such conventions for obvious reasons|pg||
mb|5C|nt|inquiry:  ew also had 8 trick in spades, so down two is not horrible result..the defense is not going to be all that clear|pg||
nt|jlall:  playing on spades seems natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell on bathroom break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when i have time will do score or I will miss this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@H=rkc for @D's|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C=2 w/o the Q|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: blasty|pg||
nt|jlall: i am stunned|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: maybe he didnt bid 2N because he wanted to avoid a double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have opened his hand, and South opened his, and an opening bid facing an opening bid is a game|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|jlall: I assume you are joking when they open all 11s :)|pg||
nt|ritong: suspect some sarcastic antimodernism of yours:)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - not infrequently these days an opening bid facing an opening bid can't beat game by the other side|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they need to bid and make a slam to flatten the board|pg||
nt|ritong: i rather saw something like 1@d 2@c 2NT 3@d 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: since that perfectly normal @sJ lead at the other table found a layout that blew a trick in the spade suit itself|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: he knows he is off an ace and the queen of trumps (4@H was RKC) but he might take his chances anyway|pg||
nt|passell: this looks like a flat 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: now is it possible to play rd here?|pg||
nt|dburn: and when Zia played a heart from the dummy, East didn't split his honours, so 6@d made in comfort in the end|pg||
nt|3for3:  north did not open 3nt, needless to say|pg||
nt|3for3:  normal 3nt with an overtrick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the appeal centers around   moss as declarer in 3N  rodwell making an off-tempo encouraging signal and meckstroth shifting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: being asked ? I did not see bidding so this is the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckwell flattened 6@s on 97, even though they also played by South|pg||
nt|dburn: they started with a 1@h response to the strong club, but as it happened South's next bid was an artificial 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: i am pretty sure that they play 2N as artificial over 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, perso is @cs|pg||
nt|jlall: so, hampson probably didnt want to bid 2C risking a double|pg||
nt|ritong: guess 6@c asks for third round control|pg||
nt|jlall:  Sorry to harp on this point, but imagine playing a bunch of boards against guys who are always in thin games, always making very tough plays that make you have to figure out the hand because they don't autopilot, always trying to steal and swin|pg||
nt|jlall:  dle|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Unlucky the one time he should have zigged, and he zagged.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still might win imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: justin bet that partner had junk and he does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: zia in 3nt so best not to bid slam|pg||
nt|kit: true -- 3NT at other table looks doomed.|pg||
nt|ritong: gulp|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfc: 3 spades shows spade control  3nt is non-serious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: do not play a natural 2n over 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bt: i think he will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|uday:  Such an innocuous board for such a scary final contract|pg||
nt|inquiry:  this will make a dull hand fairly excliting.. |pg||
nt|jlall: then invite, risking letting them X 3N light for a heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or a spec X|pg||
nt|jlall:  always blasting to game and not making cherry picking bids to give you info|pg||
nt|jlall:  then the director tells you youre in tiem trouble|pg||
nt|jlall:  im a young guy but i just played 90 boards against them and it is so exhausting, that is part of their game, their opponents always tire out|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I think Brad was born in 1971.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during earlier round       Director: you're behind the clock   Steve Robinson: change the clock|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfc: he has west to show spade control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did take losing @C finesse after @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: duly accepted|pg||
nt|dburn: 7@d, on the other hand, is a different proposition altogether|pg||
nt|ritong: "i expect 3NT" lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so close Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i am the shame of the profession|pg||
nt|dburn: even though I am sure the lead will be the same, I don't see how he can put 13 tricks together|pg||
pc|s2|nt|robinswr: he'll probably ruff as many diamonds as he can|pg||
nt|jlall: he is very much in the bid game or pass school rather than giving them extra info|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: GL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen worse slams    this just needs @D not worse than 42, @C coming in for 5 tricks and a @H @S squeeze|pg||
nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||
nt|markf:  Only real chance is for @D's 3-3 and J@C falling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have a slide rule?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Still, declarer isn't 100% home.  Easier to make 6 than 5, since in 6 you would have to play for QJ doubleton in diamonds.  In 5, you may be guarding against 4-1 split.|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is delighted  his @s works|pg||
nt|ritong: or not  boom|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz2:  Anyone see a 9th trick for Katz?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet in here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfc: nice lead partner alll laugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for defense -- moss misplayed the hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: a bit similar to push or fold|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the advantages of doing that is that it lets you play sequences that would normally be invitational as forcing, allowing more room to explore good hands|pg||
nt|ritong: in poker|pg||
nt|ritong: true, david|pg||
nt|ritong: modern players do not knit much when in game zone  reg slam, is the contrary imo|pg||
nt|jlall: meckwell play the same exact system in the other room, will be interesting to see what they choose|pg||
nt|dburn: and jlall is quite right when he speaks of giving information away to the opponents - why tell them whether opener is maximum or minimum?|pg||
nt|jlall: on board 37, meck chose to bid like greco, bid 1@S with 4 spades, but then compete to 2S over 2H. Platnick did bid 3@D which i thought was the best bid|pg||
nt|jlall: i love having greco-hampson and meckwell in the same seats because we can compare their judgement within the same basic system|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|markf:  I see Gitleman getting 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz2:  "Born in 1971 in NYC."  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&Itemid=29&id=29|pg||
nt|dburn: the director, of course, is just properly doing his job - many arguments for and against bridge being a timed game|pg||
nt|jlall:  Fred had 3 small 3 small in the majors, no doubt he would have hated to bid 3N and have rodwell lead a major which would happen often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you traverse the site Joe just posted, it includes bios of many players as well as photos  --- you can finally put faces to the names|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes you get to choose which face goes with which name|pg||
nt|dburn: commentators naturally prefer a fast pace - gives them less time to misanalyse the deals|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sounds like the next big Iphone app.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: from comment i believe 9C is upside down suit pref|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: and on 98 Meckstroth led a diamond against 5@c, and declarer did indeed try @cK from his hand, which this time pinned the singleton ace|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Heart continuation might have presented more problems, taking out the entry|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss will probably just duck this|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell plays ud signals but doesnt even want to waste the 6|pg||
nt|jlall:  i guess he can afford the six|pg||
nt|warrens:  is he thinking of encouraging because he has the 10?|pg||
nt|jlall:  but when you look at T863 over 972 the 6 or 8 is pretty counterintuitive|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|inquiry:  certaiin 2@Dxx will make... how many overtricks is the question|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Several people have shown me that if Katz plays 3 rounds of @cs and @hrs, they starts @ss he can't fail to get 9.|pg||
nt|bt: i have had an idea about forbidding my partners to make lead directing doubles|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Dirty Harry said it:  "Are you feeling lucky ... punk?"|pg||
nt|ritong: well, do ya?|pg||
nt|bt: i played in a final match against italy in a european championships, someone decided to double stayman with QJ742 ...|pg||
nt|bt: only one overtrick|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz has focus on making sure of 8 tricks. Gain from an overtrick is much less than the loss from going down 1|pg||
nt|bt: so i can feel your pain here brad moss|pg||
nt|bt: !|pg||
nt|markf:  Hampson could have finessed in 4@S playing for AJ on his right. Would have gone down.|pg||
nt|markf:  Meant Greco|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opponents 2 ways to win|pg||
nt|bt: one we see here|pg||
nt|bt: the other is they get more bidding space|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: maybe he's gone back to the bathroom|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss calls the director|pg||
nt|warrens:  ethically, isn't it hard for Meck to switch after a deliberate 3|pg||
nt|warrens:  ?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it is|pg||
nt|jlall:  i do not blame moss|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred and brad are 2 guys who often talk about how bad "slow signalling" is|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|inquiry:  nice spade signal, makes defense easy|pg||
nt|dburn: South can duck this and East will be somewhat endplayed, but only for eight tricks and not nine|pg||
nt|jlall: he is still trying to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he wins it, as he has done, there is some danger of down two|pg||
nt|jlall: but now he knows it is very bad|pg||
nt|ritong: fred bravely plays for his good case|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  dummy reversal    i missed that line :(|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: oh, sure - he won't care about extra undertricks while there is a chance to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss: H3 att?. Meck: Yes|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|dburn: trying for a dummy reversal, which needs 3-3 diamonds plus clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: So, what is his safety play now?  I don't think he can handle QJxx on his right|pg||
nt|markf:  As a was told by r_prah, defender would rise and play trump with AJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: there may be a strom brewing in the Northern quarter|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlall:  if brad gets this wrong we are gonna see fireworks|pg||
