pc|c2|nt|warrens:  a very amusing auction|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|dburn: but it looks as though Lall psyched 1@d in third chair and after that, everything went slightly haywire|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|dburn: double was takeout, redouble may or may not have been hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  XX of 1@D in other room definitely @H's|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: but Lall didn't want to correct clubs to hearts, in case Bathurst thought he had something|pg||

nt|kit: Lall didn't make what would seem to be a normal 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: last board of the set thank you for joining|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bigtrain: might have bid 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 50 minutes until restart   but  teams can agree to start earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: direct 3@C - invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Closed Room just starting  103|pg||
nt|kit: Lall did well to keep quiet it looks like.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thanks to the ACBL USBF BBO and Jan Martel for allowing this show|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and there is outside chance of no final set -- but i wouldn't bet on a concession|pg||
nt|bigtrain: lol|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d4|nt|kit: certainly no concession, particularly since Milner figures to pick up on last 3 deals.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for broadcasting this championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I was mistaken about precision, but once partner bid 2@D, Kranyak decided that partner didn't have enough for game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|warrens:  I'm even more surprised|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|min|mb|p|mb|3H|an|ask|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - some (including perhaps Wolpert) might have taken the view that 2@d was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||

nt|dburn: he worked it out - well done him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
