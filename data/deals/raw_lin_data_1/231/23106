nt|kareno: Hi there, now I'm using my fingers instead of my vocal chords :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final 15 boards of the day  but 4x15 boards tomorrow to complete the Semi-Final matches|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i suspect meck will bid 2@C as its the most flexible|pg||
nt|kareno: Milner has come back some from their large deficit at the 30 board stage|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT would be minor oriented|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|adonis18:  the second true Yarborough this week|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D is the so-called nebulous diamond (2+ 11-15, 11 defined loosely)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you will see 1@D opened alot by this pair... so much so eric rodwell jokes "over one billion served"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: some people suggest conventional doubles over 1nt, hoope they are here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Declarer has 5 easy tricks for 800, but perhaps that's all|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|petergill: Perhaps Zia thought that, with partner likely to have only 3 trumps on the auction, a trump lead might pick up partner's trump holding of say, QJx or KJx which might not otherwise ...|pg||
nt|petergill: be picked up|pg||
nt|petergill: so it might be better to go for heart overruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phil Clayton|pg||
nt|phil: hi Roland, Hi Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is more likely to picture Hamman with @SA than @DA|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Phil|pg||
nt|phil: other table is in 2@c x'd after Meck doubled 1@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Justin Lall opened 11! at the other table, as i would ahve, so 2CX is the contract there|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d4|nt|phil: yes, he has a load of defense|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Hamman's low spades were suit pref signals that he had @DA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia just asked me how many spectators there are - he said "1500?" which was almost exactly right!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bigtrain: 1NT = 11+ balanced|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: do they really want to play 6@D? i think not|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Also welcome to Farrukh Liaqat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think Hamman may not have seen Milner's bid, because he isn't pushing the tray - now Milner taps him and he pushes it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: 1nt = 10 or more  leads 3 and 6th|pg||
nt|kit: I think it takea a heart lead to defeat 6@D -- not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ns makes some 8 in @s because entryproblems so ew migth have to bid on 3-level|pg||
nt|farrukh: Hello from Pakistan.|pg||
nt|barnets: hard for n/s actually to bid spades though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "sorry for taking so long" Milner: "I think Bob fell asleep for a moment" Zia: "I thought it was Bob thinking, I had a clear bid otherwise" - in a tone of voice that made it ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: clear he was kidding|pg||

nt|petergill: John Kranyak played very fast when his team beat mine in the Spingold last year - one sign of a great player is someone who is good at both "thinking fast and thinking slow" i.e. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: play well at two tempos, as required|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any shape|pg||

nt|phil: UNDO|pg||
mb|r|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT by North is interesting after a spade to the ace and a small one back|pg||
nt|petergill: 300 vs 100 when more was possible, on repeated trump leads by the defence before @SQ could be set up|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|phil: looks like they found that defense in the OR? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lets look|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@CX went for 100|pg||
nt|phil: yep - very nice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Almost|pg||
nt|Walddk4: spade to the king and a spade, and Rodwell misguessed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1NT asks for controls|pg||
nt|dougs: 2c=6+ clubs 10-15|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know if 2@S is forcing or not here|pg||
nt|dougs: 2s is non-forcing|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bigtrain: 2@S shows 0-2 controls (A=2 K=1)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult for N-S to find their heart fit|pg||
nt|warrens:  this bid will keep them out of 3NT.  need to get to 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: greco hampson play big club|pg||
nt|bigtrain: specifically rm lite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i have no idea who the players are - although  suspect /ew are meckwell :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the operator will put them  in when time is available|pg||
nt|phil: 3@s is useful, but how do you work out South's shape now ? |pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: re all|pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  4@H is probably kickback in @D's |pg||
pc|d3|nt|warrens:  4NT shows 1/4|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C asks Q|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|phil: why can't John be 1=3=3=6 or 1=4=3=5? |pg||
pc|hT|nt|bigtrain: looks to be -1 with the 4th round uppercut|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what North's heart signal means here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: when N to bid @H ? (I do not see)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|petergill: other table: After West's Dbl (did North see it? or think the dbl must be a psyche?), one would expect 3Nt to make|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Declarer will have to try another trump now I think, since he knows there is a diamond ruff out against him.  he needs 2-2 trumps and some help in spade suit.|pg||
nt|kit: but he might try queen of spades and hope opponents don't get diamond ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out there is no diamond ruff for them, but he can't know that.  |pg||
nt|jaapfr: we can see all lines doomed but E still has hopes|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  6@C will show Q and K of @C's (and no other K)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: Dbl of Strong Club did not show any points, so North went with the odds|pg||
nt|warrens:  this would be a good contract if North had one more @C|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|warrens:  I don't think there's any chance here with clubs this way|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm guess a trump back, since N has shown the Q of @D's|pg||
nt|phil: cant he ruff two spades and establish the 5th club for two heart pitches? |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes he can|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA play (play the card you are known to hold) might lead to declarer taking a ruffing @S finesse through East, on other layouts|pg||
nt|warrens:  Oh, I take it back.  He can make it if he can score 6 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Needs 2 @s ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: now @S expected by N|pg||
nt|kit: Now South has to work out the hand, which he should be able to do -- and not play ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this @D returns troubles S a bit|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: North thought he might have to lead diamond if declarer had Ax I think.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he did well|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but @S by N then it was sure down imo|pg||
nt|kit: So now declarer will presumably try to cash king of spades and just go down.  Nothing works anyway.|pg||

nt|petergill: Well bid and well played|pg||
nt|phil: both tables earned those 16 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: although @SAK and @D crashes 2@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: oh no then @SQ to bed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then too tough for defense @SAx@S to Q and @D return to defeat|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Seems like this line gives defense a chance with trump shift, but Meckstroth deduced that this would be impossible to find.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|kit: Still, I don't see how ducking the diamond gains declarer anything.  On diamond continuation, he will still have to play AKQ of hearts and hope hearts split, I think.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you guess spades. 4 spades, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs. The defence can't take more than two heart tricks, and if they play too many hearts, you have 2 tricks there|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil: and along the way you'll get a good count for the spade hook|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|phil: the double only cost 1 IMP as it turns out - assuming he makes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|phil: this would be a good time to go feed the pets or water the plants|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure from this auction whether East-West knew they had a spade fit and rejected it, or never knew they had it|pg||
nt|phil: yes - it looked like Hamman just chose to make a quantitative invite - although I do not know what a direct 2N would be over 1N|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's not usually a good sign when you double and you can't decide what to do at trick 2|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that an immediate 2@s over 1NT is invitational with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: screen down; Kranyak asking about auction; Zia could have 4 spades for 1NT and could have shown them over 2NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: y agree|pg||
nt|bt: ruffing low heart then high heart maybe |pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he thinks he can afford to ruff a heart (guarding against 5-2), and it will be difficult for defense to separate everything.  But I don't think he can afford to risk that.|pg||
nt|po-s: better to ask before doubling - not that it would have helped|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now he might be able to test hearts first and won't need to guess spades. Kranyak must duck the heart to give Zia a losing option|pg||
nt|dburn: the good news, I suppose, is that Kranyak may only be on play twice more - the bad news is that the second of those occasions may well be on Friday|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's Friday already where we are, David|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chip: I'd guess this sequnce showed invitational with 5H, but 2C then 2S would be invitational 4-5. Perhaps Bob thought if Zia didn't want to bid 1S, then NT would be better.|pg||
nt|po-s: He should be so lucky if he is playing on Friday|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He will, we are only half way through after this set|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he will be playing on Friday except in some very unlikely and unfortunate event - Saturday is less certain|pg||
nt|chip: I'd guess EW play that W would often bid 1N with 4S-4D and a notrumpy hand.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: S no entry for @H trumping now|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he survives since North has ace of clubs.  But the whole approach looks suspect to me.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|dburn: South should probably duck this to deny declarer the option of testing hearts, but...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Walter -- did RDBL say anything about @H or just a re-try|pg||

nt|kit: West has difficult hand to bid over 1@D opening.  Overcallling on 4-card major has a lot of pitfalls.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a typical 3rd hand 1@D (although lousy cards:)|pg||

nt|kit: East might have doubled, but he doesn't know his partner has clubs under control.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he never could show his 14 hcp|pg||

pc|cT|nt|kit: The 4@S call would be on anything, so East must pass.  West knows what to do.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfd: 3C showed 55, denied 3S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: It turns out the the save is a phantom, but 4@S could easily have been making.  The real question in my mind is if South should have overcalled 2@C rather than doubling.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: bridge not always fair|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: as Katz's is thinking, Kranyak says "I don't have a good hand; I'll tell you that"|pg||

pc|c3|nt|phil: surely Reese is leading a trump - is it simply finding the @sQ? |pg||
nt|phil: so he knows hearts are probably 7-1 since he is looking at AQTx|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 4@C even more shape :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT looks to be the way Katz signs off in clubs but could also be a good hand - Wolpert pre-empting in case it is one|pg||
nt|dburn: Kranyak ought not to take it too seriously|pg||
nt|dburn: though there may be some doubt in his mind as to whether it is intended either as strong or, Heaven forfend, as some variant of the dreaded Leaping Michaels|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bt: well once you bid 5@D you have expressed the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, he seems to be taking his time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: rodwell would bid 3@C with many lightish hands so need to emphasize the playing strength with the jump|pg||
nt|bt: its a tough hand for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kranyak:  "was that just diamonds?"   Wolpert:  "yes, I don't make stuff up on the spot"|pg||
nt|dburn: and to have taken a bid at the end of it, which will double the penalty from 50 to 100|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: oh I agree East shouldn't have bid the grand.  If there were a grand, West would have Q-bid 6@C.|pg||
nt|bt: now kit, in my world 4@D promises 2 suits, then bidding 6@C would imply clubs being one of them|pg||
nt|dburn: old head on young shoulders, Wolpert's - quite right not to make stuff up on the spot|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chip: hard to get to 6C if you never bid the suit.|pg||
nt|chip: If Zia invites or offers a choice of slam, clubs might get bid at the 6 level for the first time.|pg||
nt|phil: especially right-sided|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what that @h5 is - maybe just standard discouragement|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|bt: unless (3@D)-4@C is a club-major 2-suiter|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

nt|jaapfr: now simple 6@C C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: @C@C does the job|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: for those who are curious, a "wish trick" is ace, 2, 3, 4 (any order)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|bt: it is mental strength to refocus and think back if you are unsure|pg||
nt|bt: nimzowitsch, the chess master said "sit on your hands"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@S would be -1400|pg||
nt|phil: dbl maybe? |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt much better chance|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1100|pg||
nt|bt: presumably 2@C is a positive in diamonds|pg||
nt|jaapfr: depends on defense|pg||
nt|kit: This is the hand Blackwood was invented for|pg||
nt|dburn: Wolpert pre-empting where Rodwell did not - Kranyak may elect to get involved at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: In fact, opening 4NT Blackwood would be best if they play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dougs: 2S is 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|bt: i usually play 4nt to ask for specific aces, makes this one easy, 4N-5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: 4N-5@C w no aces, 4N-5N with 2|pg||

nt|bt: 4N-5N w club ace|pg||
nt|kit: This is frightening -- now Meckstroth has no idea if they are off 2 aces or not.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: there must be a bid where E can ask aces with after 3@S???|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly a very bad hand for their methods|pg||
nt|jaapfr: dougs?|pg||
nt|dburn: but not too involved - his approach is the standard one of raising to four to deprive West of a value-showing jump or cue bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is well aware of what a 3@C bid might look like in this situation|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: he isnt passing|pg||
nt|dougs: 4@C was needed to set trumps since 4@D would have set @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and 4nt?|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup:  4 @s very near makes if you have entryes rigth not give 2 @s away -so like @h lead -maybe always|pg||
nt|kit: I think the key is for North to voluntarily show some spade tolerance -- then South can bid the game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Director back, so we must be running behind|pg||
nt|kareno: North can raise here|pg||
nt|phil: it seems a trump lead would give 4@s problems - very double dummy from Jxx though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but WAY back when 1N was 16-18 ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: declarer would need to establish a safe way back to his hand before the club gets ruffed|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes Jxx of trumps not high on the lead list :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia leans over to look at Lall's hand :)|pg||
nt|phil: otherwise the hand with short spades is ruffing the 4th club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Milner asks about Z's DBL "not penalties"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|runnerup:  against @s lead you can play for @d -3-3 and make again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: setting up diamonds looks DD to me (ty specs)|pg||

nt|phil: what if they lead a spade Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: Granted it is a magical fit, but North knows it is a magical fit if the opponents have their indicated 8-card heart fit.|pg||
nt|kit: oh, right -- sorry.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: bets on kibs: where will this board ends in?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nebing one more time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: everyone acting more or less Lawfully at the other table - North-South not allowing East-West to play their 8+ card fit at the two level|pg||
nt|dburn: and East-West having nine trumps to bid three over three|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 2@S|pg||
nt|dougs: Rodwell will probably have a fix before the 3rd set begins.|pg||
nt|chip: might make 4S if defense doesn't get to leading trumps soon enough. But another lost major fit.|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: Wolpert again bidding more than Rodwell, whose 2@d at the other table was a sound heart raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bt: i think ew have pretty good methods :) no system is 100%|pg||

nt|kit: So what is this double?  If it means lead a spade, Meckstroth didn't.|pg||
nt|kit: nice play at trick 1|pg||

nt|dburn: sometimes when you go down four you wonder whether it's what you should do, but you don't wonder for very long|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: rodwell pointed at his heart|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: sometimes the mouse is like a speed of lightening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: runs so fast don't know its clicked|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell shouldn't expect to make a slam, and his spade cards are good for defense.|pg||
nt|kit: So even assuming Lall has expected heart void, he should still be okay defending at this level I think.|pg||
nt|phil: wait I think they can - going to look at it later|pg||
nt|kit: Very similar to last hand -- does one make a somewhat off-shape negative double with the North hand?|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, responsive double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: Not I.|pg||
nt|phil: Zia passed? |pg||
nt|kareno: Too much minor suit garbage.  Maybe if it's purer - AK @h for instance.|pg||

nt|phil: plsu he is on lead|pg||
nt|kareno: For the lead?  Well, Phil answered that :)|pg||
nt|kit: And East will pass 3@C, holding 3 clubs and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now it is easyer to guess @s rigth|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct, Kit|pg||
nt|runnerup:  AK in @c and then east must have both AK in @s|pg||
nt|phil: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: he also can't pick up AKTx in E so no point finessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: North has plenty of defense vs. 3 of either minor, so he won't be inclined to compete to 3-level|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers  open North hand, but NS 1st action tend to be sound|pg||
nt|chip: 1N is 15-17 in theory, seems rather weird to me here. Yes, 3rd seat, but vulnerable with a good lead??|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  but this is atypical shape :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not unexpected -- but not typical |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: Wolpert has "garbage Stayman" in his bag, so used it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not sure of NT range but I'd guess 14-16|pg||
nt|dburn: and Katz, with one of the less desirable hands to lead from, made a strange-looking but logical choice|pg||
nt|dburn: the upshot of all of which looks to be down one and a couple more to Milner, but Kranyak has yet to earn them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: this 2@S much easier to make:)|pg||

nt|kit: a trump lead could blow up partner's trump holding -- then declarer can draw trumps and run the clubs -- from Zia's point of view.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  perhaps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Heart shift good now|pg||
nt|kit: Hammon knows it is impossible for declarer to let this ride to the 9.|pg||
nt|phil: but it sounds like dummy is hitting with a doubleton heart, and Reese didnt rebid hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Still the ten would have been purer play|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but can 10 @h ever be wrong|pg||
nt|phil: maybe that is a good reason for Hamman to double it|pg||
nt|runnerup:  -yes it can|pg||
nt|kit: Phil, holding 4 small clubs it appears that the clubs will run so declarer won't need to ruff anything in dummy.|pg||
nt|phil: I agree Kit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes very difficult to let it go to 9|pg||
nt|kit: Now king of diamonds to perhaps prevent second trump play -- although on lie of cards, small diamond works fine.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Debbie you've been doing a fabulous job.  It is so hard to keep up with all the bids plays and comments and you're been great!!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|phil: looks like Hamman's trump arent going to be in the crossfire shortly|pg||
nt|phil: (are)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|phil: a spade doesnt really help at all |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|phil: now clubruffed overuffed, diamond ruffed, etc.|pg||
nt|kit: Now high club through -- but still will have to lose 2 diamonds in the end.|pg||
nt|phil: he'll get to ruff one diamond dropping the Q|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: thru 54   Diamond 54-1 for the set!    leads Lee by 109|pg||

nt|kareno: Not playing board 60?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|farrukh: and down 2 now|pg||
nt|phil: @dA probably best suggest a spec - I think thats right - keeps Hamman's trump intact|pg||
nt|runnerup:  10 in @c looks odd|pg||
nt|runnerup:  odds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "he had a bid of a hand there, Hamman had|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|phil: nicely played|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: he should have discarded instead of ruffing -- he was lucky ace of diamonds was coming down.|pg||
nt|farrukh: so 9 imps to Nickell and we move on to last board of segment 5|pg||

nt|chip: Yes, that would.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Beatty playing 3N from West  @S8 lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11-15 hcp, 2+@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: NS must remain very low here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a kib asks where the next BB will be held?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaapfr: a very thin slam but unlikely to be bid|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: tx thought Bali in 2013 (I must be wrong)|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|bigtrain: rodwell's TOX may aid in keeping them low|pg||
nt|kit: not at this point, for sure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dougs: 2@h is 24+ balanced or a minor gf|pg||
nt|dburn: lots of bidding at the other table, where Meckwell reached a game not even a mother could love|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: better to have 4th trump for 2@D bid??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: needs only both major queens well placed so max 25% slam!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: best   transfer advances|pg||
nt|dougs: if lall would have passed, meck would have bid 2@h |pg||
nt|phil: 2N sounds like scrambling|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: mind you, they have not done badly doing that all these years, but this one ought to have cost 500|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: now eassy make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like with everything splitting and sitting well this should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cross-ruff works|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W does lead @HAKT then S gives a @C and claims|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|phil: scrambling in this context usually means 2 places to play - not just 'minors'|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on voice  Walter saying -- 2@D always 3-fit   bid higher with 4 |pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 ossible against any defense with this lucky layout|pg||
nt|jaapfr: possible|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|s6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with the X @HAKT should be known|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might be AK108 though|pg||

pc|h3|nt|bt: cashing a spade now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|bt: then the clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 11 tricks|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: the spectators and commentators|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Zia taking the low road|pg||
nt|phil: thanks everyone - only one bad 7@c contract in this segment - so the bridge is clearly improving :)|pg||
nt|farrukh: 1NT by Hamman as they play flannery|pg||

nt|bigtrain: the opponents are guessing i don't buy saving|pg||
nt|ritong: they try, they try|pg||
nt|farrukh: Great result for Nickell on the other table on this board|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Given 470 in the other room, this will probably be another 11 imps to Nickell, and a margin of 99|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: it's not fair -- when i make the last guess it is usually wrong|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 7L save costs 1100 its just not right to save here|pg||
nt|ritong: why not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: there is little upside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many boards still in play at the other 3 tables|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thanks all see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|kareno: And you can allow them to figure out if there is a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: yes he ducked|pg||

nt|dburn: nothing of that sort will happen here, so Milner continues to pick up bits and pieces|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last hand of this set;  back in 30 minutes (slightly less if we are on time)|pg||
nt|chip: Not a good law of total tricks hand: 16 trumps, but 18 tricks (so right to bid 3 over 3).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last here for the day.  Mattch resumes tomorrow (13 hours 45 min from now)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks to the commentators !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Last hand of the segement coming up..we will back shortly to continue with the 6/8 segment|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: did he finesse @S?|pg||
nt|bt: well i guess spade finesse was awfully good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of the set  45 boards left to play|pg||
nt|jaapfr: was it show up|pg||
nt|dburn: and has in fact recovered 20 IMPs on the session so far, which will give them fresh heart for the fight|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr: y and squeeze indeed|pg||
nt|bt: yea but squeeze is still there if he cashes @SA first, what if south has @SQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a @D lead and a @S return, can't make 3, can they?|pg||
nt|chip: True, but that wasn't going to happen.|pg||
nt|warrens:  just thinking about the law|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: schedule showing viewer local timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|phil: nice job Joe this week (in both roles :))|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i've been argueing that point with him|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OR was a bit more active, but still lebensol from W|pg||
nt|bt: unlikely as it is|pg||
nt|dougs: 3@D is @h invite plus|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, though even DD there are more tricks than trumps here (despite the majors being impure, thought the minors are pure).|pg||
nt|phil: 5N now? |pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for North now with only Kx|pg||
nt|chip: I think 6C with only 2 spades, though that will give S a bit of a problem.|pg||
nt|phil: over 6@c, would 6@d say 'choose a major'? |pg||
nt|chip: The problem with 6C by N is that N could have very good clubs (say AKQJTx).|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure if S could have made a forcing pass over 5D. |pg||
nt|chip: many pairs play that after preempt-Bid-5X that pass is forcing (particularly when they are NV). Helps the non-preempt side sort things out.|pg||
nt|phil: spec asking about 6@d now - that really sounds like a grand try to me |pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: The best force bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: someone commented that they are within the clock (still 8 minutes).  Kranyak:  "we won't finish on time; don't worry"|pg||
mb|r|nt|chip: 6D by N is not a possible bid (it would suggest better spades than Kx).  Kib asks if S would bid 6S over a slow 6C bid, and the answer is maybe not. Over 5N will bid 6S I think.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: 2@D 3@S-4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree with 2@S bid?|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice bid but what would josephine say about it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks for letting me jump in  Andy/Walter|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this probably rates as a minimum 1N bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: RD=first control to come?|pg||
nt|chip: 6D by N would be a grand slam try in spades (and would make it impossible to get to 6C) so would never be bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 14-16 1nt|pg||
nt|phil: something about 7@c contracts today for the Milner team....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: U have slam in NT - @H - @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will Greco make a new try?|pg||
nt|chip: This is the third grand slam today where Hamman is on lead with an ace. Must be a record out of only 30 hands.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|rodal f: One IMP gained for Jacobs. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: sorry i am lost about EW bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chip: club can't go away.|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, Zia on lead. I meant Hamman was on lead versus 7C.|pg||
nt|phil: all I can say is Steve Weinsteins and Kevin Fays series on Bridgewinners "Under Further Review" is getting lots of material from today|pg||
nt|warrens:  amazingly, only needed one small difference in South's hand to make 7@H: AQ10xxxx, QJ9x, xx, --|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a thread about grands missing the trump ace|pg||
nt|chip: 5n was meant as choice of slam I'm pretty sure. then used it as a choice of grand slams.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|phil: ok, good match everyone - see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: By all:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down but most leads will be down here|pg||
nt|bt: arguably west could bid 3N over 3@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: well thanks everyone, very interesting set|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt unbeatable|pg||
nt|dougs: thanks all|pg||
nt|bt: and well done team nickell|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure how forcing any of those bids were, but the result is another instance of a vulnerable game that needs quite a bit of luck|pg||

pc|c3|nt|dburn: and won't get it on this occasion|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|ybob: ty Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we all agree 4@S  always made against any defense |pg||
nt|jaapfr: no reactions: so do you think EW must bid 4@S here (pls Y or N)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6y 2n|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11y 3n|pg||
nt|jaapfr: next question E to bid higher or W 3@H and not 3@S?|pg||
