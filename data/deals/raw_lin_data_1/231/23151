nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "3rd & 5th and upside down?" Hampson: "except when the lead shows the AK against a suit contract"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: If I am opening ultra light, I still do not pass 1@s with only 2.  Anyone else?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: absolutely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Z: "no Rusinow here? " Hampson: "that's a standard Jack; if he had shown hearts in the bidding it would show the Q"|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: Zia (to answer a spec and perhaps many more) had a hand with only one bid in it.  Best chance for game is a major so he bypassed his diamonds this time.|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, -1 if the defense plays @H's|pg||
nt|bigtrain: -1 regardless|pg||
nt|kareno: Which is sensible now that dummy is out of spades.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, -1 regardless|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||

mb|2N|an|asking|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Nicely bid - a good game for n/s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco asks about 2NT - "in competition it's not forcing" - I don't know if that applies to this auction (where LHO bid but not RHO) or not|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or the @DA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jlall:  often with this many HCP when the opponents bid a game it's right to lead a trump|pg||
nt|jlall:  since either your partner will not have high cards, so other things will blow a trick, or they have bid a light game which is usually on shape so you want to try to stop ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlall:  still, stiff 9 is not very appealing|pg||
nt|kareno: Unless you were on Lew Mathe's team where leading a singleton trump was an executable offense :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Too often that card helps declarer to unwind a suit.|pg||
nt|jlall:  Hamman is well known for hating trump leads if the purpose of them is to be passive|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: even spade followed by diamond will work|pg||
nt|markf:  Nickell has a difficult Opening Lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kareno: Okay I'm told that:  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php link allows to hear voice on bbo vg|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  I am somewhat surprised zia didn't open 2N, probably because his hand is so suit oriented|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall:  but his hand is definitely worth 20 if balanced at least, and it will be hard to show that after opening 1H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|warrens:  I agree he clearly has the values for a 2NT opening, but xx of @S's is a real danger|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps he cleaves to 20 for 2nt as I do :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "this is the kind of hand that will revolutionize bridge ... I hope Brad Moss is in my seat" |pg||
nt|jlall:  Zia is commenting on his own failure to open 2N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson: "he might open 2N?"  Z: "he would"|pg||
nt|jlall:  Brad Moss is well known for opening 1N and 2N more than anyone|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|jlall:  Hampson figured it out without even seeing zias hand :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: often with a 6card major even|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia had seen it rigth :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, it was Gitelman this time|pg||
pc|h3|mc|11|nt|kareno: Yeah he learned that from his father - against Mike Moss you always had to be prepared to defend notrumps.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mcphee: just a guess on my part:)|pg||
nt|petergill: says "highest spot we can afford from weakness (usually 2nd)" |pg||
nt|kit: if 4@S is contract, opening lead may be critical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt zia opens 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||
nt|markf:  If they dont play Puppet over 2NT, this will work out poorly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from 2010 CC   2N = ogust|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not open 2@S on North hand.  Personally, I think it is a close call.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: must put my bifocals on again :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: only Mollo would have EW declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: shocking dummy for fred|pg||
nt|markf:  His hand is certainly worth 2NT|pg||
nt|bt: there is a trend of opening nt when in the approximate range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says tell me when to stop|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: well i did not expect garner to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e 11 to 14|pg||
pc|s7|nt|uday:  The other table opened 1H and reached 4H on the same lead|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says are you going to guess the clubs|pg||
nt|markf:  In terms of playing strength, this is better than many 21 HCP hands|pg||

nt|jlall:  My philosophy is if I'm 5332 to just figure out what my hand is worth, and bid the appropriate number of NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "not a good hand to open 2N this time" Hampson: "Fred sits North" Zia: "that's bad news" Hampson: "I don't know actually"|pg||

nt|bigtrain: hi kit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|jlall:  he knows that 2N will be opened and it will go 2N-3N down|pg||
nt|bobholl: in holland 2nt 3nt mostly shows 5@S and 4@H so you have to puppet "always"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kareno: That hand is so skewed against notrump I wouldn't consider it.|pg||

nt|bigtrain: definitely old school|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: west says your hearts that good|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Kaplan and Rubens Hand Evaluator values the n hand at 21.00.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=83+akq107+aq2+a73|pg||
nt|bt: the reason for opening nt, should be "I have no rebid if i dont do it"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: Wolpert also led @C10|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1 C = 16 any|pg||
nt|bt: in this case it was certainly wrong|pg||
nt|ritong: jumpshift with three can be a problem|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: now if you dont have any methods after a 1@S or 1NT response ....|pg||
nt|bt: but i assume at this level they have|pg||
mb|d|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: udca|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2 spades weak raise|pg||
nt|bt: a natural, wide range system is unplayable without conventions or "black magic"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: pd let me tell you you got one more point think next hand have 4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|bigtrain: 2@H = sets trump and asks|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  "Black Magic" is a term invented by Edgar Kaplan circa 1970 to describe how many partnerships were able to show widely disparate values with the same bids.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco: "we would have done better against slam"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson: "You just needed a simple spade finesse, right?" Zia - "I was trying to make extra tricks" Hampson "but you were in 5" Zia "I thought I was in 4!"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "all right - what's the contract?" Hampson: "4 no" laughter|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jlall:  Greco leading the jack to get attitude about the ten|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "Rusinow" "yes"|pg||
nt|jlall:  as opposed to leading the queen to show the king, where partner will discourage with the ten thinking you need to know about the jack|pg||
nt|kareno: Good set of leads.  |pg||
nt|jlall:  this is very tricky to play, your entries are screwed up|pg||
nt|kit: Danger with jack lead is that partner has ace of hearts, thinks declarer has king, and shifts.  But on balance, getting info about the 10 is more important on this hand.|pg||
nt|jlall:  i suspect he will duck this heart|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, very tricky.  We can see that he has 9 top tricks with diamonds splitting, but he may try to bank on club suit instead|pg||
nt|jlall:  he would like to be able to test everything|pg||
nt|kareno: And patience in the heart suit is needed|pg||
nt|jlall:  how about possibly playing a club to the queen early|pg||
nt|jlall:  if that lives, you are in good shape, if it loses you can fall back on diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: very possible line -- and then he might be in trouble|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, because then they can fire back a club and you dont have communication to cash 5 diamonds and 2 spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  How about win the second @h and run the @c8?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "what's that signal?" Greco: "upside down" Zia: "so it's only standard when you lead the A or K" Greco: "against suits"|pg||
nt|bobholl: how about @D KQ first and than @C to Q wins in a lot of cases|pg||
nt|jlall:  the problem is if the C8 loses to the ten or jack as it normally does|pg||
nt|jlall:  you know nothing about any suit|pg||
nt|jlall:  they just run hearts at you and play a club|pg||
nt|jlall:  and you are completely guessing|pg||
nt|kareno: I think that looks good, Henry, because we see the hands.  Possible but then when it loses to 10 or jack, what?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think he can afford to run the 8 of clubs -- then what does he do?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he can|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i think justin has to right - win 2nd @H and a @C to the Q|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|jlall:  greco has taken out zias dummy entry rather than his hand entry|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: He has more flexibility with the spade switch|pg||
nt|kit: Now at least he has entry to king of spades -- so he can unblock diamonds and lead club to queen okay.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia: "do you play Smith?" Greco shakes his head and Hampson (on other side of screen from Zia "no"|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@H seems normal|pg||
nt|jlall:  4S is interesting|pg||
nt|kit: This may slow Greco down -- from his point of view they could be off 4 aces.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  I imagine greco will bid 2S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jlall:  he can bid 2S then 3S NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  or he can just play his partner for an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Didn't slow him down at all :)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|kareno: That would be playing ONLY for the jack onside, Ace irrelevant.  But because he needs a diamond ruff, he must play for the ace onside.|pg||
nt|jlall:  more questions: Why not AJx? Well, the jack doesnt drop on the third round so its not that. If it was the king is fine. Why not play for AJxx without a 2nd trump? Well presumably they could cross to their partners heart for a trump back. Why not|pg||
nt|jlall:  play for Axx? As I said, they could just win and play a trump|pg||
nt|kit: Finessing the 10 would be playing Zia to make a mistake.  His only legit play is to hope North has ace of diamonds and jack comes down third.|pg||

mb|3H!|an|like !ds, but can still stop|mb|p|mb|3N!|an|short !ss, NF|nt|kit: Greco will like his hand on the auction -- compared to what he might hold (see previous hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  Geoff is probably the best bidder I know, he is one of my best friends so i know his game well but he really understands bidding and thinks about it at a high level...if you ever try to have a debate with him you will lose, that is the downside|pg||
nt|jlall:  i confess I would just have bid 3N over 2S with his hand|pg||
nt|kit: Surely there must be some slam possibility if partner likes his hand.  What is the harm of looking?|pg||
nt|kit: Greco might even have 4 diamonds.|pg||
nt|jlall:  i would be worried partner would like some hands where slam is not good|pg||
nt|jlall:  the 4th diamond does not matter a ton if he has an honor|pg||
nt|kit: But would partner drive all the way to slam by himself unless he really has the goods?|pg||
nt|jlall:  i guess if he has Axxx Ax Axxx Kxx the 4th trump is the nuts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Both alerted 3N but I don't know if it was a serious or non-serious slam try|pg||
nt|kit: Seems unusualy for 3NT to be a Q-bid when the fit is a minor, but maybe that's the way they play it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco alerted and Zia didn't ask - Hampson wrote something including @ds but I can't read the rest|pg||
nt|jlall:  i am not saying 3D is a bad bid, Im saying its a good bid|pg||
nt|kit: Except for the 4-3-3-3, East couldn't have a better hand -- max in high cards, primes.  So if 3NT is a slam try, I think he should drive to slam.|pg||
nt|jlall:  Greco will surely bid over 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think 3D could be either slammish or wanting to find 5D rather than 3N|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: Or at a least, make some very encouraging noises.|pg||
nt|jlall:  over 3H, partner bid 3S, so if they have a weak suit its spades|pg||
nt|jlall:  with weak clubs, they would not bid 3N, they would bid 3S|pg||
nt|jlall:  so even if partner has choice of games greco should bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Zia's asking about 3N, so maybe .. I think he wrote @d slam try|pg||
nt|jlall:  greco is a very thoughtful player but he comes up with the right choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|an|RKC !ds|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jlall:  4H is keycard|pg||
nt|jlall:  hampson has heard enough|pg||
nt|kareno: Some food for thought, spectators, on the previous board, north doubled 2@d early in the auction and got to defend it redoubled for a loss of 1190.  If you are going to double ...|pg||
nt|kareno: those bids, HAVE YOUR SUIT and LOTS of it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|an|pick a slam|mb|p|nt|kareno: Oops - 1160 I'm told.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Hampson is bidding RKC.  Aggressive, but reasonable if 3NT was a light slam try.|pg||
nt|jlall:  excellent auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: minorwood is different...  it;s either redwood or kickback|pg||
nt|kit: Very well-judged by both of them.|pg||
nt|jlall:  I see, 3H asked for shortness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I now have the notes - 3@h said he liked diamonds, 3N showed short spades|pg||
nt|jlall:  with a positive hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall:  i guess the offset being if you have 2452 you have to be able to force past 3N if partner likes his hand for diamonds, which makes sense|pg||

nt|jlall:  first seat w/r they like to preempt|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: If they are opening 4-3-3-3 13, they are really playing 13-16.  Saying 14-16 is misleading.|pg||

nt|jlall:  KNR is very stupid for balanced hands imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They do say that they upgrade frequently|pg||

nt|jlall:  also, GH always say they upgrade frequently|pg||

mb|2N|an|!d transfer|nt|kareno: And I agree completely Justin - have been saying that all week.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|an|rejects invitation|nt|jlall:  I am surprised by 2N, usually with this shape you can start with 3C then bid 4D to show 5(332)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt some sort of force with likely relays.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  and also find 5-3 major suits|pg||
mb|4D|an|RKC !ds|nt|jlall:  i assume he just wants to play in diamonds regardless so hes going this round|pg||
nt|jlall:  route*|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|an|1 or 4|mb|p|nt|warrens:  so Greco used the transfer to get into RKC for @D's.  |pg||
nt|warrens:  he will ask for Kings next, I presume|pg||
nt|jlall:  this will work well if he can show his CK|pg||
nt|jlall:  he will then show his entire hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: justin would have a better idea than i...  they don't play anything like meckwell i think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1N system are very individualistic|pg||
nt|kareno: So 2nt showed diamonds and 3@c says 'likes diamonds' (I ask 'why?')|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is exactly a 50% slam, but it isn't even money on the imp scale|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes I think meckwell do some fancy stuff, I am not sure|pg||
nt|kareno: 4@d ace asking |pg||
nt|jlall:  Walter would know :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Warren, you mean 50% grand yes?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I thought that Greco signalled "up" for 3@c - could have been wrong - the rest I'm sure of|pg||
nt|jlall:  say he can bid 5C king ask, his partner can bid 5H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT in RM is puppet...  so this auction is out of my wheelhaouse|pg||
nt|jlall:  he can bid 6C showin the CK|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I mean grand slam, of course|pg||
nt|jlall:  he will now have shown A AKQ AK|pg||
nt|jlall:  since he confirmed all the keycards|pg||
nt|jlall:  that will leave partner very well placed|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like jan has things well under control with the explanations|pg||
nt|jlall:  a spec suggests that east would be suggesting 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall:  that would normally be true, and is perhaps a flaw in grecos bidding|pg||
nt|kareno: Except that she could not actually confirm the meaning of 3@c|pg||
nt|jlall:  however, with AKQ sixth AK of clubs HA|pg||
nt|jlall:  it seems like east could bid 7 himself|pg||
nt|jlall:  what can partner have?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: On auctions like this one I can lead forward to read the notes, just can't always see them even then. When it isn't clear that things are being alerted, of course I can't lean ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: forward, because that would give the players inappropriate information|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is 9 tricks opposite a 1n opener and 20 HCP|pg||

mb|5N|an|pick a slam|mb|p|nt|kareno: 7 is p;urely on the spade finesse and not good enough, though they may accidentally arrive there.|pg||
nt|jlall:  ok, 5N might ask for third round club control for 7?|pg||
nt|jlall:  effectively, showing the CK?|pg||
nt|kareno: But east has that - he needs second round spades, no?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|7D|nt|jlall:  since 5C would be their king ask I assume (though some play 4N is passable)|pg||
nt|jlall:  ok, he just asked partner to pick a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson wrote 5N = choose; I couldn't read Greco's note and it's now on the floor upside down|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco: "he bid 7N, I'm not going to bid again" Zia: "Hamman's been on lead with an ace against this contract" Hampson: "I'm glad we put the ace off lead :)"|pg||
nt|jlall:  hampson correctly diagnosed diamonds would never be better than NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Happily for Nickell this is nonvulnerable.  Obviously Greco Hampson would not want to bid this grand slam this early in a match.|pg||
nt|jlall:  It has been suggested to me that maybe greco was going to pass 6N but bid 7 over 6D, as 6D would imply prime cards and/or a ruffing value|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is certainly logical if 5N was pick a slam, imaginative way to bid it|pg||
nt|jlall:  imagine how he felt when partner picked diamodns for 6, but NT for 7!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia asked something and Greco says that 3@c said if I had an invitational hand with @ds he didn't want to play 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So I did in fact misunderstand the gestures about 3@c :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Too many specs talking to me just now.  Sorry, can't reply.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jlall:  so a little luck to the dimond team on this one, a lot of imps swung on a 50/50 proposition|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|jlall:  also, LHO has long spades, and if he tests dimonds also long diamodns, which indicates taking a finesse through RHO|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamman: "and your signals are upside down?" Hampson: "correct"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: West will lead heart now, so forcing immediate decision.|pg||

nt|jlall:  i think the C9 is too obvious even|pg||
nt|kareno: So, @h ak looking for drop and then club finesse?|pg||
nt|kit: He might take heart hook simply because he is down only 1 if he goes wrong|pg||
nt|jlall:  ill bet on bob here|pg||
nt|kit: While if he cashes AK of hearts and loses club finesse, he could be down 2 or even down 3|pg||
nt|jlall:  what?|pg||
nt|jlall:  he doesnt have to cash the HK|pg||
nt|jlall:  he could win the ace and hook a club if he was worried about down 1|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is still percentage over hooking the H|pg||
nt|kit: oh, right -- he has entry.  But that doesn't give him shot at Qx of hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: Qx in hearts|pg||
nt|jlall:  ok, so your argument is about whether to cash the HK or not|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: other table has finished play|pg||

nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||

nt|markf:  He also can use a spade trick|pg||
nt|bt:  if he gets it right, katz probably should duck one diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bt:  katz should be able to picture the whole hand and what it takes to beat it|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||

nt|markf:  I'm surprised Katz won the diamond|pg||

nt|ritong: best katz can do is ducking @d once, and shift @h after cashing his @ss  declarer has a guess|pg||

pc|d3|nt|bt:  though west wasnt passed so |pg||
nt|ritong: not quite, but is a good clue, yes|pg||
nt|markf:  With West having pointed suit length, odds favor playing for club finesse.|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz was correct in not playing a heart, he's trying to give South a losing option.|pg||

nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||

nt|jcwla:  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=97+KQ9+AKQ95+QJ8   17.3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: laughing as similar to past 3nt but no heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for broadcasting this championship|pg||
mb|1N|nt|warrens:  I was mistaken about precision, but once partner bid 2@D, Kranyak decided that partner didn't have enough for game|pg||
nt|ritong: this is the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an honest opening -- go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroth says great match to justin and kevin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to commentators|pg||
nt|ritong: not vulnerazble:)|pg||
nt|ritong: possible 2 imps swing, tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I'm even more surprised|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 down in 5@c|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - some (including perhaps Wolpert) might have taken the view that 2@d was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
nt|markf:  Allan, often pairs playing complex systems have not worked out many details, especially with intervention.|pg||
nt|ritong: other room will certainly overcall and raise @ss|pg||
mb|r|nt|santyclz2:  Viewgraph schedule adjust to your timezone:  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: xx + points|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  i hear 4@C on board 14 in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: they are HOT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set short break please come back to join us|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|warrens:  defense needs to get @D's going |pg||
nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on 118  but   congrats to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final also 2 days  120 boards|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: fred and brad will leave the room with rounded shoulders, but the smile on their teammates faces should reassure them:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jjsb:  tthank u very much ! |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfc: q of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: he worked it out - well done him|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|markf:  Ralph hs created some problems for himself; allowing diamond discard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: most probably this match will not continue see you later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks will see you after the break for the second set of the finals of the USBD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: USBC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 min still in the set and probably 15 min break restart at 12:25 chicago time|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Fernando Lema sent me:  http://csbnews.org/usbc-final-time/?lang=en|pg||
