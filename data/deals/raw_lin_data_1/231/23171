nt|petergill: 1@c can be short|pg||
nt|petergill: It's good to take your time to think things through, as long as he plays @SJ after his think, having worked out the layout to play for|pg||

nt|petergill: Sebastian Yuen had to overcome his initial impulse that the NT bidder is unlikely to have a singleton spade|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: but initial impulses can become ingrained thoughts, in which case wrong plays can happen|pg||
nt|petergill: That is perhaps one of the most common errors made in bridge|pg||
nt|petergill: when "thinking slow" you have to try to avoid being set in your thinking |pg||
nt|petergill: That's all we have for you from Sydney|pg||
nt|petergill: thanks to Dave Thompson and Alex Smirnov for arranging this presentation|pg||
nt|petergill: You might see more Aussie youth matches on BBO this afternoon|pg||
nt|petergill: with or without commentary. |pg||
nt|petergill: when "thinking slow" you sometimes have to check if an assumption you've made e.g. that North cannot have a singleton spade on the bidding as I personally (West) would have bid 2@C ...|pg||
nt|petergill: on his hand - might be wrong|pg||
nt|petergill: and take into account that not everyone bids or plays the same way you would. e.g. Bd 29|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||

mb|1D|nt|petergill: 1@d or 1@S by West? Thoughts?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|smirny: 1@D i prefer|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S has advantage that 5-2 (or even 5-1) spade fit will often be playable. |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: me too - he can now pattern out his had and show the reverse|pg||
nt|petergill: but hand is strong enough to bid out 6-5 shape, so 1@D better|pg||
