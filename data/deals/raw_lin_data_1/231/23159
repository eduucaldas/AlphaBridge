nt|vugraphzad: I think one of the problems on this hand was Nic winning the heart K, rather than ducking to give count and preserve his entry.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|kthorpe: Interesting.  6@D on a finesse (working) .. hearts don't provide enough pitches.|pg||
nt|kthorpe: But will be preemption by EW|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|kthorpe: I'd have bid 3@S but maybe vulnerability swayed him?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzad: Many ways to raise spades here, cue bid, 3S, 2nt|pg||
nt|kthorpe: Yes I'd have picked one that used more room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: It is nice when you have spades to use it to the best of your advantage.|pg||
nt|kthorpe: S knows N has 4+ diamonds since bid freely.  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|fluff:  brds 29 and 31 could be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|kthorpe: I @H spades|pg||
nt|kthorpe: At other table N bid 4@D freely and then carried on over a cue.|pg||
