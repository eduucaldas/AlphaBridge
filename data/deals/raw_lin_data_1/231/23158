nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||

nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mcphee: just a guess on my part:)|pg||
nt|petergill: says "highest spot we can afford from weakness (usually 2nd)" |pg||
nt|kit: if 4@S is contract, opening lead may be critical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i doubt zia opens 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||
nt|markf:  If they dont play Puppet over 2NT, this will work out poorly|pg||
nt|bt:  another thin slam, will greco hampson bid it up again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from 2010 CC   2N = ogust|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not open 2@S on North hand.  Personally, I think it is a close call.|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: must put my bifocals on again :)|pg||
nt|bt:  and make on the spade lie|pg||
nt|bt:  aha they are sitting out, luckily for nickell :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: only Mollo would have EW declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: shocking dummy for fred|pg||
nt|markf:  His hand is certainly worth 2NT|pg||
nt|bt: there is a trend of opening nt when in the approximate range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says tell me when to stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: well i did not expect garner to pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e 11 to 14|pg||
mb|3N|nt|uday:  The other table opened 1H and reached 4H on the same lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says are you going to guess the clubs|pg||
nt|markf:  In terms of playing strength, this is better than many 21 HCP hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: asked again how many points do you have again Katz  only two again you think you will get any|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: katz and Nickell must play redouble followed by double as coop and pass followed by double as penalties|pg||
nt|kit: And East found killing lead it looks like|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fat finger trade!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: hcp|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Zia did pass but still declaring 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: He gets them, but the trump promotion on the clubs will defeat him.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1nt by w = transfer bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: so he was kind of forced to wait for partner to re-open|pg||
nt|mcphee: if brad hooks this the defence can do some damage|pg||
nt|mcphee: West will be in a position to score all of his trumps!|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  "Black Magic" is a term invented by Edgar Kaplan circa 1970 to describe how many partnerships were able to show widely disparate values with the same bids.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: meck says pass by rodwell is ambiguous|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: when opp have shown themselves to be in swing mode -- does that affect your thought process on defense??|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Dirty Harry said it:  "Are you feeling lucky ... punk?"|pg||

nt|warrens:  the lead helps, but there's still not hope|pg||
nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||

pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||

pc|s9|nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|bt:  mathematically|pg||
nt|bt:  though a finesse is good if it makes|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about this  if you know 12 tricks on top, just bid 13|pg||
nt|bt:  as a spec commentated once west shows with @SAQJ and @DK hand is over|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bt:  though west wasnt passed so |pg||
nt|ritong: not quite, but is a good clue, yes|pg||
nt|markf:  With West having pointed suit length, odds favor playing for club finesse.|pg||

nt|bt:  which one is that? the lall hand|pg||
nt|ritong: tell gitelmoss they are ahead in the match and you will get a double "heun??"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: we have seen this more than once - a side with a seven-card fit bids as though it had eight or nine, causing opponents to misjudge because each thinks the other short in the enemy ...|pg||
nt|dburn: suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: it will, and in the right direction to get us another 15 boards|pg||

mb|d|mb|2S|an|promise 3+ spades|nt|warrens:  1N-3N might get us another swing|pg||
nt|inquiry:  the 2@S bid here promises at tleast 3@S... in north|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says I hope this one is not as hard as the last one|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcphee: well Brad is not shy|pg||
nt|mcphee: he placed fred with 4-4 majors I think|pg||
nt|robinswr: obviously 2@d did not promise both majors|pg||
nt|mcphee: you think not steve?|pg||
nt|robinswr: should be two places to play|pg||
nt|warrens:  my guess is that X shows 1m + 1M|pg||
mb|4H|nt|inquiry:  if the 3 hcp fred has in hearts was in the other major, slam would be reasonable...|pg||
nt|bt:  which is why a 4@H splinter would be more to the point, my partners never have that perfect hand anyway|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Fred will not want to encourage...so he can't pass here... as this has to be forcing pass he is mininum with wasted values in hearts|pg||
nt|inquiry:  so 4@S is weaker than pass... he has to decide if he wants to double or bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: coffee time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: right Warren -- even in direct seat|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell will correct to the major (if my guess is correct)|pg||
nt|dburn: double by a passed hand often played as a four-card major and a longer minor - not sure what Katz and Nickell use|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: ? jump to 4 h what do you do  he says jump to 3 is strong at least we on same page it may not be good|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that, because otherwise Nickell would do what Warren suggests|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: chunky NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: EW ACBL convention card   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/NickellKatz.bmp|pg||
nt|warrens:  playing precision, N is limited to 10, so I guess S decided not to push it.  a little surprising to me|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all sure what the bidding at the other table meant|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mcphee: he really can not go down even getting @S wrong|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he guesses spades wrong he has to guess how to strip the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can't make it if he misguesses spades here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sominex|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says he is so confused|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: its okay as long as you are not confused tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he is laughing at himself|pg||
nt|mcphee: i guess they can just return a trump to beat it if he gets it wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie you have 29 min for this and one other board|pg||
nt|robinswr: any return beats it if he misguess|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: you would think he will go right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I am still not out of the woods|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: how do i play it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss talking out loud to himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very jovial table|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes right you are because he is not able to play 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: opps good practice for tomorrow|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|warrens:  at the other table, E psyched a precision @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|inquiry:  nickel made a nice duck here...but if fred guess right he makes an overtrick i think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  as he will turn to diamonds after this|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: moss shows hand making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss I know you have 8 hearts and having hard time believing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|warrens:  a very amusing auction|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: but it looks as though Lall psyched 1@d in third chair and after that, everything went slightly haywire|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|dburn: double was takeout, redouble may or may not have been hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|warrens:  XX of 1@D in other room definitely @H's|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: but Lall didn't want to correct clubs to hearts, in case Bathurst thought he had something|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the USBF ACBL BBO and Jan Martel for broadcasting this championship|pg||
mb|2H|nt|warrens:  I was mistaken about precision, but once partner bid 2@D, Kranyak decided that partner didn't have enough for game|pg||
nt|ritong: this is the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an honest opening -- go figure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroth says great match to justin and kevin|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
nt|markf:  Allan, often pairs playing complex systems have not worked out many details, especially with intervention.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
pc|c4|nt|inquiry:  i hear 4@C on board 14 in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: they are HOT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set short break please come back to join us|pg||
nt|inquiry:  north at this table, fred gitelman for providing bbo for all o f us.... and the usbf for the exciting match|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  defense needs to get @D's going |pg||

pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
