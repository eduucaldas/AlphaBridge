nt|vugraphzaa: rates to be a push|pg||
nt|penseur9: last board of the day here...|pg||
nt|penseur9: a big hand of applause for Tony, our great operator...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: not an easy hand for NS facing a 1Cl opener by south and a weak jump in spades 1C-P-1D-2Sp|pg||

nt|lml: no its marked as down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure she didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzab: no she cashed club ace, i misclicked|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzab: good d|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|fredp: 6NT or 6D likely contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzab: maybe will be dissuaded by the overcall!!!|pg||
nt|francine21: Yes at the other table they help declarer by returning a @C after the @SA and continuation of @C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|lml: we all knew it was just a misclick|pg||
mb|p|nt|fredp: 6D great contract|pg||
nt|francine21: It is cold|pg||
nt|fredp: he may go down on a heart lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|francine21: if he guess to ply on @C after 3 round of @D not obvious|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can happend that moisan is the best.|pg||
nt|fredp: Les will drive to 6D I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzab: after he wakes up|pg||
nt|fredp: he is afraid of Kxx|pg||
nt|francine21: I don't like the 3 @D call minimum hand no good support 4-3-3-3 I pass 2 @H partner will bid again|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzab: looks like 11 tricks no problem|pg||
nt|fredp: he might very well decide to play in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzab: i agree Francine|pg||
nt|francine21: And he will probably go down  |pg||
nt|vugraphzab: declarer will have no idea spades break so badly|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 6@D as well a good contract. @D to the A and afterword hook it. @H looser are pitched by @C|pg||
nt|fredp: 6NT down for sure...6D almost surely down|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|lml: going to need to be a good guesser to make this|pg||
nt|lml: not on that lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|francine21: You have 5 @S and 7 @C so after a @H lead  you will try to pitch your @H on @S and not @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: it seems reasonable enough from Wolperts hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: I agree Fredp now.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: obviously you can make this hand on any lead|pg||
nt|lml: it is just easy on a club lead|pg||
