mb|p|nt|dburn: could be useful for Milner, this - 3NT won't be reached after this start|pg||
nt|dburn: nor should it be, of course|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, W opened a precision 2@C, which prevented a @D overcall.  now there is no game fo E/Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: declarer wouyld cover with J9xx|pg||

pc|s5|nt|mcphee: so I suppose 4@H shows not a greaat hand for @H, but Garner will not care|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table has finished play|pg||
nt|dburn: curious deal, in a way - East-West at the other table were quite right to bid 3NT (which needs 4-3 diamonds), East-West at this table are quite right not to|pg||
nt|warrens:  the lead helps, but there's still not hope|pg||
nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 117  Zia playing 2@S North|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|warrens:  East will assume his partner has a doubleton @D at most, so he's thinking about 4@C or 5@C or maybe some try like XX.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: we have seen this more than once - a side with a seven-card fit bids as though it had eight or nine, causing opponents to misjudge because each thinks the other short in the enemy ...|pg||
nt|dburn: suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: it will, and in the right direction to get us another 15 boards|pg||

nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
