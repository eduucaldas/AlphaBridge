mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  should West pass or pull?  It seems like any non-doubled contract is good here - East would have bid *something* over 2@c with 4@s and any HCP, like a negative double|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|djneill:  West can force his way to dummy by unblocking the spades and playing @dA and a @d|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|djneill:  West would have liked to have transferred to @s and then bid 3NT, to givea  choice, but over 3NT that is not an option|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's hand demonstrates why @dAxx is so much better a stopper than @dAx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|djneill:  @dJ was odd, but South can count the @d and knows North has the @dKT - usually the @dJ is lowest of touching|pg||

mc|9|nt|djneill:  East saw South lead a low @d, so even though North opened 3@d, it means South has another @d, so the major suit finesse is too risky|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|djneill:  it would have helped to know if N-S lead top of nothing in this situation, I like to lead low from any 3 in pd's suit if I have not had a chance to raise|pg||
mb|2H!|an|gf|mb|d|nt|djneill:  South is planning on correcting @c to @d, should North bid @c|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|djneill:  North's @sK is possibly not worth a lot, so North is not going to push it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|djneill:  I would find it hard to believe North is considering South has a doubleton @c after the takeout double and not raising hearts|pg||
nt|djneill:  but North knows E and S have 23 HCP, East opening, so knows both of them are bare minimum, or one is .... less than that|pg||

nt|djneill:  West chose a different path than South, with 4@h-5+@d, over @s opening, bid 2@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  instead of takeout double|pg||
nt|djneill:  so in this case, lost a big @h fit I think|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|djneill:  I would think North would bid 3@c, since it seems like 8-9 @c and just 7-8 @s|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  West has a nice hand here, just 12 HCP, but few losers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: the girls are a good chance to bid this i think|pg||
mb|3D|nt|djneill:  yes it would be a nice swing, other table missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  West needs from East:  red honors, @s control|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's hand is good for slam because the Aces (and @sK) cover quick losers, nobody is cashing AK against them unless it is in hearts|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: good hand for 2/1 to keep it low as they prod and poke|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: lauren might pull out exclusion b/w at some point|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|djneill:  right, 2/1 gives a few more minutes on the egg timer|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|djneill:  you saying 5@c as exclusion blackwood?  what is that|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i thought lauren might bid 5@c rather than 4@c|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: asking for keycards excluding the @CA|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: but i dont think there is any way for missing 6@H now - risk might be bidding 7@H|pg||

nt|djneill:  5@s can't be a cue-bid|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugrapha1: got the high-five at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is taking the double initially as a Lightner double, so tries to find South's void, which must be in diamonds I guess since West showed long diamonds|pg||

nt|djneill:  so if East can't reopen, it means East probably has 3+@h, so South is in a possible bad place, but if East can reopen, West can consider  diamonds - in that way, Passing with 4@h-5@d comes out ok either way|pg||
