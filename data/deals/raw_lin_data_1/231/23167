nt|markf:  He could survive by ruffing, but more difficult|pg||
nt|markf:  He if ruffs, needs to play J@H next|pg||

nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other table and access voice without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure if Ace is attitude or count..prob att since he wouldn't want unblock|pg||
nt|bt:  east has a nice hand on this auction|pg||
nt|bt:  i am all for penalizing opps but if a vulnerable slam is very likely, i would just take my chances there|pg||
nt|inquiry:  diamond is in 6@h at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfc: lead e/w|pg||
nt|uday:  Hola - can I talk a couple of kibs into being commentators?  If you're interested, send me a msg :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think west should pull, in no way is this a penalty doube, but then again i know they are koached by kokish|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow 4+ cards in nt  std NT honors of short suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lall will certainoy shift to a club now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads 3rd and low|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bt:  anyway competitive bidding is difficult for all of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4 clubs splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: need x tra value to bid 3 clubs answer yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: per System Summary Form   vs NT  King is strong lead, so Ace did ask attitude|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry:  needs to hold to something like down five to win imps, that means five tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bt:  how many tricks for declarer? 3@S and a club?|pg||
nt|jlall: not clear how to play this, but winning and playing a club seems natural |pg||
nt|jlall: he might try the DK first|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: Now Lall has a problem -- he may not know the club position.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|uday:  Welcome. We have Mark Feldman, SantyClz2, and Lars Anderson ( who has to run off in 30 ) as commentators|pg||

pc|dK|nt|bt: good to be here at this interesting fight, now that the pretenders are all out :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: regular smith|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 1st of 4 sessions today of the finals of the team trials for the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4 more sessions are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfc: meck falsecarded in both suits from hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  Wolpert playing 3@D East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|uday:  And joining us is Ben (Inquiry) Dickens|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jlall: so first he sets up ruffs, then he works on diamonds, notice the one thing he will not do is play trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: greco scared of tapping declarer because declarer might ruff diamonds in hand, ruff clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: but he has no appealing play really|pg||
nt|jlall: greco does not know declarer doesnt have the @HT either, so tapping him feels normal|pg||
nt|jlall: seems impossible that he will make this whatever happens unless greco drops his hand on the table|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: I am sure he has a good reason, I can't see it, presumably he's thinking katz has AKT8x of hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall: guess he just assumed katz would go up|pg||
nt|jlall: good poker play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bt: decl will get 4@D and one in each|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: KATZ not happy|pg||
nt|jlall: when the HT dropped katz assumed hampson had QT of hearts as I would too|pg||

pc|h2|pc|sT|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|d5|pc|c7|pg||
mc|9|nt|bt: in the closed room hamman chose to pass 1@S in same acuction, so its 4 imps to diamond|pg||

nt|jlall: interesting, if katz had AKT of hearts would he have gone down?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: is nosiy outside in hall way|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|bigtrain: X can iclude 5+@S GF|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C suit opener's limited to max of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jlall: probably needed a pointed suit ten|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bt:  as we see, gittelman strongly believes in counting ppoints for nt, again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss dont have much pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This shows secondary diamond suit, not natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: in the other room, ok ok :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome Henri.|pg||
nt|jlall: 2S is a constructive raise, with no game interest they start with 1N|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt:  and Qxx in spades a stopper|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|markf:  On hand 1|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|inquiry:  well yes, that too... but on lead looks like that is working|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bt:  solid 8% game|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
nt|jlall: this could be a huge swing for NS|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
nt|uday:  Any experienced kibs feel like jumping in with commentary? buzz me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt:  AK onside, KJ onside, @D 32|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jlall: if nickell had overcalled michaels, west would not know his partner had clubs though so he might not be overly aggressive|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfc: moss playing with 9 and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: Now the spade shift, although it isn't necessary since South has third trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson claims 2 down|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampsons says they could make 5 clubs Greco are you trying to make him feel better|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Hampson also opened strong 1@C|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@c = spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5=@H GF|pg||
mb|2C|an|spades|nt|kit: I think he is probably right to open 1@C -- hand would be difficult to describe if he opens 1@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 21H = no spade fit, bad hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bigtrain: 2S natural rebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: promising 6+@S?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kit: However, on this hand the 1@C opener gets them overboard, as South has minimum positive and no fit.  Not a big cost.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: and @D9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Katz led @Dx  from West   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: platnick would like to transfer lead to partner after this auction|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5+@H 4+@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: feels like @DJ|pg||
nt|kit: He doesn't have any real play even with the favorable lie of the cards.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it does look like he has only 4 losers|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Maybe he can set up spades and not have too many losers on the side.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|warrens:  Kit, I don't see how the defense can beat him|pg||
nt|kit: Definitely best not to cover.  now declarer is in dummy for last time, and if he doesn't take diamond finesse he can't take it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco got to score 3@C 4@D 2@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|markf:  Rodwell will switch to spades|pg||
nt|kit: But he can get 3 diamonds, 3 spades, 1 heart, and 2 clubs even with dummy dead -- so I guess he can make if he goes back to spades now.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Now key which spade he plays|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: If he plays a low spade, platnick can win 8 and play clubs, and Diamond unblocks ace of spades.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: declarer will have 3 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 heart, and 2 clubs -- so will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 3 more @S tricks than Greco took|pg||
nt|markf:  Eric must have had a reason, but puzzled as to why he cashed the club A. If Platnik had 2 spades honors he could have set up clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think he cashed the club ace.|pg||
nt|kit: The defense did that.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2h + 4|pg||
nt|bt:  this is the games you want to bid, at worst a diamond finesse and some extra chanses|pg||
mb|p|nt|markf:  Dull hand, easy to bid and make 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: 1@H shows 8-11 points, denies 5 spades|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1N = 11-13|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: only one singleton king likely to score here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  a diamond lead wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|bt:  except for us seeing all hands|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says please stop that  -- have to lead it its the contract|pg||
nt|kit: diamond shift now, and defense will have many tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia got to open north hand 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: even spade followed by diamond will work|pg||
nt|markf:  Nickell has a difficult Opening Lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
nt|jlall: natural bidding after 1H|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
nt|jlall: on a club lead if greco ducks 3N can be defeated|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th  best  smith echo|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has just stuck with his diamonds, I'm not sure about that|pg||
nt|jlall: greco almost for sure is 1534 on the bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: and hampson has announced 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: if greco had 2 spades he would have raised spades at some point, and with 1 spade and 2 diamonds he wouldnt bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is very tricky with no communication|pg||
nt|jlall: however, EW have no suit to attack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco is shaking his head|pg||
nt|jlall: he can win, play a spade, club back he wins the ace, cashes a heart, plays a spade|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a winning line|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bt:  there is a case for west returning a small heart at second trick, give decl xxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:  with @CA in east, @DK in west is likely|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jlall: but thats because we can see all the hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jlall: so far, so good|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: if it asks for " help", @c A becomes very leadable|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond lead opening|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good play by katz|pg||

nt|kit: Best defense is to continue hearts, but that may not be obvious.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|jlall: they play transfers over the double, so hampson will probably bid 1@H|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|kit: Another off-beat 1NT opening|pg||
nt|kit: 3C puppet Stayman -- now they have found hearts, but will they get too high?|pg||
nt|jlall: usually with 4 spades greco bids 2S, but with a horrible 3rd seat opener he is allowed to bid 1S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jlall: i dont blame him here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|inquiry:  being vul, ew might push to game|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roghog:  or try...   http://csbnews.org/usbc-semifinals/?lang=en |pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: he did misguess hearts in other room, and that may seal Milner's fate.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow from 4+ or more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman preety hand pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even had he played @S trick 2 I think he can make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: shift to low club that will beat it also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=slam try in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  the @S split is just enough to set 4@S... good doublet by fred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they started to pick up the bids before they saw the x|pg||
nt|jlall: nickell should balance with 3@D|pg||
nt|jlall: i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nickell points to 2 club bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: forces sound to be even|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson shakes his head|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, even HCP and they have an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2 spades over 1 heart with four|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: by greco explained|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 4@S RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: e/w say sorry but then west says nice hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred will look around for a club to lead, not finding one, he will start a red suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|inquiry:  he has to lose 1@C, 1@H, and 2@S... with no lines to try avoid those losers....he is  worrying about fred having five spades|pg||
nt|inquiry:  for his double|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: On a better day this slam would make, but this is not a better day|pg||
nt|ritong: this shift simplifies matters|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, there was some tangling around|pg||
nt|ritong: still has to make a decision about his basic suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  intra finesse in clubs I think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  he may try to shorten his trumps by ruffing diamonds twice... but everything seems to be down one.|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think greco should pass 2@H henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps even two fits, when west was not hot to raise to 3@h with three  here, 3@d would have hit big|pg||
nt|jlall: KQJx of hearts and very defensive values...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try to catch them higher greedy me:)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|s4|nt|kit: Declarer assumes hearts 3-2, of course.  So, counting his winners, if clubs 4-2 he has 4 clubs, 5 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 spade.  Not enough.  So he needs clubs 3-3 also.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah thats a good point, with an 8 card fit when you bid to 2S they will often compete further|pg||
nt|ritong: also, 1@s then 2@s depicts my garbage accurately|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|ritong: hello jacky|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: discussed by e/w|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jlall: great choice by nick |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more action from Lall|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D-P-1@S-2@C//DBL[3@S]|pg||
nt|inquiry:  the double is takeout|pg||
nt|jlall: katz will pass, his free 1N has a minimum of about 8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jlall: maybe a good 7|pg||
nt|jlall: so his hand is garbage|pg||
nt|ritong: purely so|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bt: trump shift, @SA diamond, duck ace ...|pg||
nt|bt: and east has to play for exactly Jxx in south|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|robinswr: with 4531, I would double 1 club |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when opp have shown themselves to be in swing mode -- does that affect your thought process on defense??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: based on meck's comment when asked if he knew it was his lead the answer is yes it affects your thoughts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X not 2@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|inquiry:  so diamond picked up 11 imps on the last board... as 3@dx was down two at the other table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcphee: 1 or 2 down on the @D guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says Gitelman thinks perhaps that was a bit optimustic|pg||
nt|bt: that won paralyze nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss shaking head|pg||
nt|bt: wont|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5 of clubs probably suit preferance for hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: when singleton in dummy most play suit preferance|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c now would sort of threaten the declarer of a ruff and save the @d Q|pg||
nt|jlall: the players would never guess the imp results, board 2 EW are cold for a vul game and both tables played partial down white... board 3 both made a very difficult 3N, board 4 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: platnick let 4S slip through vul to win 5 against 790...board 6 both sides sold to 2H when they coudl make a partial|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfc: msp|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|jlall: good call henri|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: I think he led the queen to deny the king, so if his partner were void he would be forced to ruff.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: Clear to overcall 1NT.  Very difficult for N-S to double.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N denies 4@S|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: so Justin's action picks up 3    and a lot of comments from spectators|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jlall: nick might consider overcalling 1N if r/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: since they will be stealing a lot|pg||
nt|jlall: but r/r is a different story|pg||
mb|1N|nt|inquiry:  1nt passed out is likely|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will they get to the "cold" 6D contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably includes balanced game force   so could be 2@C|pg||
nt|inquiry:  defense has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow leads with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  but nickell will ahve to find a spade after taking the last heart....|pg||
nt|jlall: hampsons partners range is 11-13, and not a great 13|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Zia in 3N north|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  ew also had 8 trick in spades, so down two is not horrible result..the defense is not going to be all that clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@H=rkc for @D's|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C=2 w/o the Q|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: blasty|pg||
nt|jlall: i am stunned|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jlall: maybe he didnt bid 2N because he wanted to avoid a double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have opened his hand, and South opened his, and an opening bid facing an opening bid is a game|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|jlall: I assume you are joking when they open all 11s :)|pg||
nt|ritong: suspect some sarcastic antimodernism of yours:)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - not infrequently these days an opening bid facing an opening bid can't beat game by the other side|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: he knows he is off an ace and the queen of trumps (4@H was RKC) but he might take his chances anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bt: now is it possible to play rd here?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jlall: i am pretty sure that they play 2N as artificial over 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, perso is @cs|pg||
nt|jlall: so, hampson probably didnt want to bid 2C risking a double|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Unlucky the one time he should have zigged, and he zagged.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still might win imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: justin bet that partner had junk and he does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: zia in 3nt so best not to bid slam|pg||
nt|kit: true -- 3NT at other table looks doomed.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfc: 3 spades shows spade control  3nt is non-serious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: do not play a natural 2n over 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bt: i think he will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|uday:  Such an innocuous board for such a scary final contract|pg||
nt|inquiry:  this will make a dull hand fairly excliting.. |pg||
nt|jlall: then invite, risking letting them X 3N light for a heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or a spec X|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfc: he has west to show spade control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did take losing @C finesse after @H lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll probably ruff as many diamonds as he can|pg||
nt|jlall: he is very much in the bid game or pass school rather than giving them extra info|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Still, declarer isn't 100% home.  Easier to make 6 than 5, since in 6 you would have to play for QJ doubleton in diamonds.  In 5, you may be guarding against 4-1 split.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz2:  Anyone see a 9th trick for Katz?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet in here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: nice lead partner alll laugh|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit similar to push or fold|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the advantages of doing that is that it lets you play sequences that would normally be invitational as forcing, allowing more room to explore good hands|pg||
nt|ritong: in poker|pg||
nt|ritong: true, david|pg||
nt|ritong: modern players do not knit much when in game zone  reg slam, is the contrary imo|pg||
nt|jlall: meckwell play the same exact system in the other room, will be interesting to see what they choose|pg||
nt|dburn: and jlall is quite right when he speaks of giving information away to the opponents - why tell them whether opener is maximum or minimum?|pg||
nt|jlall: on board 37, meck chose to bid like greco, bid 1@S with 4 spades, but then compete to 2S over 2H. Platnick did bid 3@D which i thought was the best bid|pg||
nt|jlall: i love having greco-hampson and meckwell in the same seats because we can compare their judgement within the same basic system|pg||

pc|cK|nt|inquiry:  certaiin 2@Dxx will make... how many overtricks is the question|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Several people have shown me that if Katz plays 3 rounds of @cs and @hrs, they starts @ss he can't fail to get 9.|pg||
nt|bt: i have had an idea about forbidding my partners to make lead directing doubles|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Dirty Harry said it:  "Are you feeling lucky ... punk?"|pg||
nt|ritong: well, do ya?|pg||
nt|bt: i played in a final match against italy in a european championships, someone decided to double stayman with QJ742 ...|pg||
nt|bt: only one overtrick|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz has focus on making sure of 8 tricks. Gain from an overtrick is much less than the loss from going down 1|pg||
nt|bt: so i can feel your pain here brad moss|pg||
nt|bt: !|pg||
nt|markf:  Hampson could have finessed in 4@S playing for AJ on his right. Would have gone down.|pg||
nt|markf:  Meant Greco|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opponents 2 ways to win|pg||
nt|bt: one we see here|pg||
nt|bt: the other is they get more bidding space|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s7|pc|c7|pg||

nt|dburn: South can duck this and East will be somewhat endplayed, but only for eight tricks and not nine|pg||
nt|jlall: he is still trying to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he wins it, as he has done, there is some danger of down two|pg||
nt|jlall: but now he knows it is very bad|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|dburn: oh, sure - he won't care about extra undertricks while there is a chance to make|pg||

pc|d5|nt|kit: So, what is his safety play now?  I don't think he can handle QJxx on his right|pg||

nt|jlall: we get back to information leakage though|pg||
nt|dburn: and may choose to bid it, having heard 2@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfc: constructive bid at least 5 4 or 6 3|pg||
nt|jlall: wow on 38, rodwell did make the responsive X of 1N that hampson did not make, platnick jumped to 3N which was down, and meck saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: fourth best|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate bidding 3-card majors in response to a t/o double but here there's no reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|jlall: so a possible swing for nickell went to diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: so nick is in slam mood, and not deterred with 2@s|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|markf:  Nickell shouldnt have signed off.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: katz says disappoint if you go down|pg||
nt|ritong: and now, sonny?:)|pg||
nt|dburn: seems so, and like jlall I think that's a bit optimistic with only an eight-card fit|pg||
nt|jlall: did nick ever suggest a slam try? if so i cant imagine ralph would let him out|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@c is slammy|pg||
nt|jlall: and is nick actually thinking here? |pg||
nt|ritong: when 2@s could have been NT oriented|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs|pg||
nt|jlall: nick has gotten very optimistic|pg||
nt|jlall: hes playing his partner for A A QJ of trumps and long clubs i think|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to imagine a hand with more red lights, yes|pg||
nt|jlall: ralph will try for 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the trumps can be played for only one loser, but with spades 4-2 I can't see anything like twelve tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: at least this is only 50 a trick|pg||
mb|6H|nt|inquiry:  with @CA gone, a quieck claim coming here.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  this could go down a lot if they duck one @D|pg||
nt|kit: However, the heart lead may be the loser -- since now Bathurst will (may) grab the first round of diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: michael rosenberg has given an excellent suggestion|pg||
nt|jlall: and martha katz|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree, west certainly worth 5NT|pg||
nt|jlall: nick forgot his partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|jlall: then his bidding makes sense|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent point|pg||
nt|jlall: 4D might even be RKC for clubs|pg||
nt|jlall: and 5C 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure if nickell katz play that|pg||
nt|jlall: rodders did pass 1N with the hand hampson bid 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, the bidding may not even be over, since 6@h will come as a shock to Nickell who thinks clubs are trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: currently double checking start of auction and " oh my!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says 4 diamonds is splinter|pg||
nt|dburn: strange to continue to forget partner passed all the way through the auction, when the green card is still sitting on the tray|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell didn't see he was a past hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: small break|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that gives us a chance to see whether this might make in some miraculous way, but I still can't think of one|pg||
nt|ritong: this might take some time, when nick has to recover from the shock before trying to work out a winning case|pg||
nt|jlall: no chance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jlall: i think you have to play for 3-3 spades and Ax of hearts|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: i think the defending side has a better shot at 3N than these guys do at 1:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I'm not sure that Bathurst will take the chance.  what if declarer had AQx, Axx Qx, AKxxx|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: well, i take it back|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: he plays confidently|pg||
nt|jlall: he has only 1 line|pg||
nt|ritong: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: passed hand |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he had more than one - heart to the queen, then play to ruff two diamonds on the table, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: specs suggesting if this heart is ducked, nickell can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: but diamonds 4-4 is less likely than spades 3-3|pg||
nt|jlall: but then south gets in with the HA and gives his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: then again, South could have @hAx and three diamonds, when that line would work|pg||
nt|jlall: if that was the layout you'd be playing for a defensive error since they could play ace and a heart unless spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: as expectable, this won t be a push|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they'd have to play ace and a heart when you led a heart yourself towards the queen, and that's not so clear - but still, probably better to go for the legitimate shot|pg||
pc|hT|nt|inquiry:  contract is going to make. how to play spades... is the only question for katz, i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty clear when he tanks forever and ducks |pg||
nt|dburn: still, after that development Nickell knows at least that hearts are where he wants them|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: n/s says good play|pg||
nt|dburn: now, are spades where he wants them? or diamonds?|pg||

nt|jlall: grego will double here|pg||

nt|jlall: as a passed hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco reading Katz|pg||
nt|jlall: meck didn't, ut there was a key difference, he was against a strong club pair|pg||
nt|jlall: where 4H might be a 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one of the advantages of strong club|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H here for standard bidders is usually 5 trumps or 4 trumps with shape and not a ton of HCP|pg||

mb|d|nt|dburn: could be useful for Milner, this - 3NT won't be reached after this start|pg||

nt|jlall: and doubling when you think they will often make or have a better spot to run to is not great|pg||
pc|h8|nt|warrens:  East will assume his partner has a doubleton @D at most, so he's thinking about 4@C or 5@C or maybe some try like XX.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|inquiry:  double game swing possible on this one... as 4@S looks like it would make (6@S, 2@C, 2@D ruffs).... and 4@h looks like it makes|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, saving would be weird indeed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bt:  nasty guesses here|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
nt|ritong: covering this makes few sense, for starters|pg||
nt|bt:  after getting spades right decl has to guess what rounded suit to finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  is it clear that this isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  playing 4@Sx in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: you only had 19 no only 18 but really good 18|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: @s 7 from east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will do|pg||
nt|markf:  He also can use a spade trick|pg||
nt|bt:  if he gets it right, katz probably should duck one diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bt:  katz should be able to picture the whole hand and what it takes to beat it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jlall: if youre not saving i dont think it matters that much whether you think you can make 4H, its just how often do you think you can beat 4S|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|dburn: and may think that he is obliged to bid anyway|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: especially if pard is like "uh, double? perhaps he wants a special lead"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ritong: to offer a losing choice, you mean|pg||
nt|markf:  I'm surprised Katz won the diamond|pg||
nt|inquiry:  i am told greco and hampson are in 7nt on board 12|pg||
nt|ritong: best katz can do is ducking @d once, and shift @h after cashing his @ss  declarer has a guess|pg||
nt|bt:  at nv imps you should be at 58% or so to bid a grand|pg||
nt|bt:  mathematically|pg||
nt|bt:  though a finesse is good if it makes|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about this  if you know 12 tricks on top, just bid 13|pg||
nt|bt:  as a spec commentated once west shows with @SAQJ and @DK hand is over|pg||
nt|dburn: I'd think it will go down two more often than it will make, but I could be wrong|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bt:  though west wasnt passed so |pg||
nt|ritong: not quite, but is a good clue, yes|pg||
nt|markf:  With West having pointed suit length, odds favor playing for club finesse.|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz was correct in not playing a heart, he's trying to give South a losing option.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I fearlessly predict that the "Lall Hand" will apear in many  bridge columns.|pg||
nt|bt:  which one is that? the lall hand|pg||
nt|ritong: tell gitelmoss they are ahead in the match and you will get a double "heun??"|pg||
nt|ritong: and loses a tapping tempo on lead|pg||
nt|jlall: if katz had doubled, hampson would know he had all 4 spades and make easily from this position|pg||
nt|jlall: however, hammpson still knows that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dburn: we have seen this more than once - a side with a seven-card fit bids as though it had eight or nine, causing opponents to misjudge because each thinks the other short in the enemy ...|pg||
nt|dburn: suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: it will, and in the right direction to get us another 15 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  You're right, David.  I don't think this young team would withdraw anywhere under 100.|pg||
nt|bt:  at the other table west opened a 2452 1nt and defends 4@S X|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Father and son participated, one on offense, one on defense in an excellent lesson hand on not rectifying the count for declarer.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish|pg||
nt|bt:  just unlucky i guess|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: quite right too, having seen some of the miracle comebacks that their not-altogether-young opponents have managed over the years|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, one wonders whether the Nickell team is quite sure of its tactics entering the final session with a substantial lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jlall: nicely played|pg||
nt|jlall: even without a double he made it|pg||
nt|jlall: personally i view this as a win for strong club systems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: looks like i missed the first spae spot|pg||
nt|jlall: meck had a much tougher time because 1H p 4H was such a wide range|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :(|pg||
nt|ritong: problem, debbie?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hamp;son counting and counting his cards|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: well Brad is not shy|pg||

nt|robinswr: obviously 2@d did not promise both majors|pg||
nt|mcphee: you think not steve?|pg||
nt|robinswr: should be two places to play|pg||
nt|warrens:  my guess is that X shows 1m + 1M|pg||
nt|jlall: either they changed their system and i didnt know|pg||
nt|warrens:  did he really show a minimum?  Rodwell showed a GF.|pg||
nt|jlall: or 3H shows a min opener|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|inquiry:  if the 3 hcp fred has in hearts was in the other major, slam would be reasonable...|pg||
nt|bt:  which is why a 4@H splinter would be more to the point, my partners never have that perfect hand anyway|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Fred will not want to encourage...so he can't pass here... as this has to be forcing pass he is mininum with wasted values in hearts|pg||
nt|inquiry:  so 4@S is weaker than pass... he has to decide if he wants to double or bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: coffee time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right Warren -- even in direct seat|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell will correct to the major (if my guess is correct)|pg||
nt|dburn: double by a passed hand often played as a four-card major and a longer minor - not sure what Katz and Nickell use|pg||
nt|jlall: i would be shocked by 3H...perhaps they just changed their system|pg||
mb|5C!|an|one|nt|jlall: now we will see one main advantage of kickback|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: ? jump to 4 h what do you do  he says jump to 3 is strong at least we on same page it may not be good|pg||

nt|dburn: not at all sure what the bidding at the other table meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: i could not see if he alerted this bid|pg||
nt|jlall: they must play something if they ask, sign off, and bid again|pg||
mb|7H|nt|mcphee: he really can not go down even getting @S wrong|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie you have 29 min for this and one other board|pg||

nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|sT|nt|warrens:  a @C lead in the other room made this hand easier|pg||
