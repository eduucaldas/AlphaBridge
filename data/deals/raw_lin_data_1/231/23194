mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: spades are different than hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S save would be too expensive.  I don't think they will take it with no singletons.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with hearts i think larry would bid 4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: Hamman did jump to 4@S over Hampson's 2@D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: I didn't think he would be taking heart finesse due to entry problems, but now he might.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: voice commentary for both rooms|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on other table and access voice without login via http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure if Ace is attitude or count..prob att since he wouldn't want unblock|pg||
nt|bt:  east has a nice hand on this auction|pg||
nt|bt:  i am all for penalizing opps but if a vulnerable slam is very likely, i would just take my chances there|pg||
nt|inquiry:  diamond is in 6@h at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pass is flexible|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ritong: hi joe|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome back, Henri.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=negative/takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes X = 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: lead e/w|pg||
nt|uday:  Hola - can I talk a couple of kibs into being commentators?  If you're interested, send me a msg :)|pg||
nt|bt:  i think west should pull, in no way is this a penalty doube, but then again i know they are koached by kokish|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 5th of 8 segments of the finals of the trials for the team to represent the USA in the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|3for3:  3nt will make in comfort|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow 4+ cards in nt  std NT honors of short suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall:  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: showed weaker 5h bid on this sequence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Lall will certainoy shift to a club now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|jlall: hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: leads 3rd and low|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt:  anyway competitive bidding is difficult for all of us|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4 clubs splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: need x tra value to bid 3 clubs answer yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Because East's Dbl indicates @S's, Brad Moss prefers 3@D to (Dbl of 3@C) or Pass. If Brad passed, Fred would have bid 3@H I think. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for a while  but Hampson balanced with 4N|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This is the 4th 15 bd segment of the finals of the team trials to determine the USA entry to the Mind Games.  4 more segments are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubtedly showing 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table and voice commentary available without login  using  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it is thunder and lightening and pouring rain here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: per System Summary Form   vs NT  King is strong lead, so Ace did ask attitude|pg||
nt|jlall:  i can hear voice commentary today :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: reg smith|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|inquiry:  needs to hold to something like down five to win imps, that means five tricks|pg||
nt|3for3:  my mother 'if you don't like the weather in chicago (or philly) move!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bt:  how many tricks for declarer? 3@S and a club?|pg||
nt|jlall: not clear how to play this, but winning and playing a club seems natural |pg||
nt|jlall: he might try the DK first|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Good morning, Justin.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: Now Lall has a problem -- he may not know the club position.|pg||
nt|jlall:  Meck with great spdes, but he still has A9 of clubs and a partner who ha bid NT, so he opts for 3N|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz2:  With us today is Justin Lall, one of the most promising young players in the USA today.  His team was eliminated by Nickell in the semi-finals.|pg||
nt|jlall:  thanks for reminding me|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell is considering whether to remove 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  given that meck seems to have shown doubt about NT and his ruond suits are T8x and Jxx|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry but getting there is far advanced compared to anything most of the rest of us can do.|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, sorry i forgot to put a smiley :) was joking of course, thanks for the introduction|pg||
nt|jlall:  I think rodders will pass|pg||
nt|jlall:  notice that it is not clear if you just look at the EW hands what game you want to be in|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|uday:  Welcome. We have Mark Feldman, SantyClz2, and Lars Anderson ( who has to run off in 30 ) as commentators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson playing 5@CX West|pg||
nt|petergill: With good cards in both of partner's suits, Fred gos to 4@H, which is doomed by the 4-0 break. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: they may have changed 1 or 2 things since then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If no 4-0 trump break, 4@H needs (@SAQ onside and no @d ruff), or @S blockage (e.g Ax in West) or (defence doesn't find @s switch in time). Not that bad a contract. |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: my mother:   if you don't like the weather in chicago ... wait 5 minutes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Clever jack of clubs play by Meckstroth -- pretending he has the 10|pg||
nt|bt: thanks uday, ill be brief :)|pg||
nt|jlall:  he thought if meck had spades good enough for 4S to be better than 5D opposite Tx, he would have raised 3S to 4S i think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bt: good to be here at this interesting fight, now that the pretenders are all out :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: regular smith|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome to the 1st of 4 sessions today of the finals of the team trials for the Mind Games.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4 more sessions are scheduled for tomorrow.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfc: meck falsecarded in both suits from hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  Wolpert playing 3@D East|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|uday:  And joining us is Ben (Inquiry) Dickens|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jlall: so first he sets up ruffs, then he works on diamonds, notice the one thing he will not do is play trumps|pg||
nt|jlall: greco scared of tapping declarer because declarer might ruff diamonds in hand, ruff clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|jlall: but he has no appealing play really|pg||
nt|jlall: greco does not know declarer doesnt have the @HT either, so tapping him feels normal|pg||
nt|jlall: seems impossible that he will make this whatever happens unless greco drops his hand on the table|pg||
nt|petergill: With Axxx in trumps on defence, normal expert defence is to duck two rounds, then win the 3rd and decide whether to play a 4th round of trumps. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroth says sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: unusual, yes|pg||
nt|petergill: West's @S5 (UDCA) allows Meckstroth to count N's shape as 3541|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|jlall: I am sure he has a good reason, I can't see it, presumably he's thinking katz has AKT8x of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: not the apol, the huddling|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jlall: guess he just assumed katz would go up|pg||
nt|jlall: good poker play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bt: decl will get 4@D and one in each|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt:  declarer knows they have a slam so he is happy with 5 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfc: KATZ not happy|pg||
nt|jlall: when the HT dropped katz assumed hampson had QT of hearts as I would too|pg||

mb|2C|an|6+ clubs, 11-15|nt|3for3:  6@D for ns|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6+@C 10-15|pg||
nt|3for3:  good save for EW|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1:  91  Greco pulled partner's DBL of 4@S to 5@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: This is quite an unusual problem for Meckstroth|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @CA9764  just not quite good enough for immediate support :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if he does meck may be pushed to slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ach  @D|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should have bid 5@C -- show slam interest in diamonds.  Very unlikely 4@S makes and 5@D doesn't.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond 5@H bid means @Hxx less dangerous|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  ill take 1000-1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: lol|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  for those not listening, Larry Cohen was suggesing 1000-1 against Diamond leading a @D against 5@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|3for3:  we will never know|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like it is down 3 -- not a big swing vs. an enemy game, but who knows what will happen at other table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  91  5@H going down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: no p/x-i|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this is not a forcing pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11 imps to Nickell back in the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  extending the lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking when they just bid a game forcing pass isn't applied...  have to set GF early in auction|pg||
nt|kit: Big swing on 91, as declarer couldn't handle 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  92   Greco also bid 4@S instead of showing @D fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell:  "sorry"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Eddie Kantar's book on Forcing Pass focused a lot on vulnerability -- but that was before bridge became a bidder's game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: bridge has always been a bidders game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1:  92  Hamman playing 5@HX|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i can't|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|kit: Stopped in 5@H doubled at other table, so likely 5 more IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: forgot to use sarcasm font|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't hear jack either|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: this is not the most effective defense|pg||
nt|bigtrain: back to -3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: lol|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i can hear now|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|c92|st||md|2SKQ8754H73DA9764C,SJ3HA54D82CAQ6543,SA9H2DKQJT53CKJT7,ST62HKQJT986DC982|sv|n|nt|bt:  some work from koach needed here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: interesting, if katz had AKT of hearts would he have gone down?|pg||
nt|ritong: amazing|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Fred can apologise for bidding game and Moss can apologise for not making it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's not used to Meck going into the tank|pg||
nt|dburn: entry problems, I guess - if he had crossed to the club to finesse in hearts again, he could not then pitch his club on diamonds|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman is not opening 1N because his hand is too good, he's perfectly fine opening it with that shape|pg||
nt|3for3:  north south play what has become known as meckwelllight...so they will each be somewhat familiar with the others system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell treat that as a weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL = cards   14+|pg||
nt|dburn: but not for the first time in this match the older guys pre-empted higher than the younger guys, and came away with a big swing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it was ahopeless position..;thanks david. I appreciate your comments and help|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfc: is nosiy outside in hall way|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson did not open a strong club, somewhat surprising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can;/t see explanation|pg||
nt|3for3:  platnick getting both suits in|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: X can iclude 5+@S GF|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C suit opener's limited to max of 15 hcp|pg||
nt|jlall: probably needed a pointed suit ten|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bt:  as we see, gittelman strongly believes in counting ppoints for nt, again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss dont have much pd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hamman overcalled 4@S   strange to see moss taking lower road|pg||
nt|ritong: brave raise  will work super here|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth not done yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Fred Gitelman realized at the adverse vulnerability that Brad Moss had a serious hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  You may note that we only quote these "rules" when they would have worked out.|pg||
nt|jlall:  he has chosen to bid 2N even over 1S rather than 2C|pg||
nt|jlall:  that is much more clear over a 1H response|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This shows secondary diamond suit, not natural|pg||
nt|dburn: and not done at all|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Last session of the day.  Meckwell aren't exactly juniors any more. Fatigue may be becoming an issue.|pg||
nt|jlall:  but hes trying to protect his round suit honors and give away less info, that is his style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: in the other room, ok ok :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Welcome Henri.|pg||
nt|jlall: 2S is a constructive raise, with no game interest they start with 1N|pg||
nt|dburn: Greco choosing not to support diamonds ever, which may be costly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good steal for EW|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: hellow all|pg||
nt|inquiry:  hi henri|pg||
nt|markf:  Zia and Hamman wont open the North hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred would have an awkward rebid if he opened 1@d, so he upgraded on the strong five card suit |pg||
nt|inquiry:  both ns pairs reached 3nt on 22 hcp.... |pg||
nt|bt:  points schmoints, right?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if @DKJ were with west, it would make I guess.|pg||
nt|bt:  arguably you could open 1@D then rebid 2@D over a 1@S/1N response|pg||
nt|inquiry:  and the suit broke evenly|pg||
nt|dburn: passes not forcing at this level, so Hampson could not offer one of those|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the 4H bid was very effective|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: maybe 2@D=@D + major|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell will be pleased to find 4 card support. lots of losers though|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: Lall may have to find king of spades shift -- I think he will.|pg||
nt|3for3:  one less loser now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: std leads |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: Looks like 8 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bt:  and Qxx in spades a stopper|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi    says south worth 17.90|pg||
nt|jlall:  Fred would have done better to correct to 4S, but that is a complete guess, even knowing north has 5 spades and at most 3 hearts, north could easily have an honor|pg||
nt|jlall:  basically, he was all in on the HQ being a positional value|pg||
nt|jlall:  that looks much smarter when partner has K9x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  only non-standard carding agreement is  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their ACBL CC   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|3for3:  45 boards to go, alan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult  --  especially of the future|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell says sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: and Greco underleading to get a club ruff, not knowing that he doesn't need one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|markf:  On hand 1|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|inquiry:  well yes, that too... but on lead looks like that is working|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bt:  solid 8% game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: wolpert playing 2@S east|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Eventually you discover that someone will tell you not to lead from  *every* possible holding that doesn't include akq.|pg||
nt|bt: decl took his discard but will make it easily from here|pg||
nt|inquiry:  an easy 4@H contract, losing just two more hearts, expect a quick claim here|pg||
nt|ritong: brad has to avoid @h crash|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The only real question left is whether n-s will crash their @h honors.|pg||
nt|jlall: this could be a huge swing for NS|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: This is logical shift, knocking entry off dummy.  It looks like it costs a trick, but actually it doesn't as things turn out.|pg||
nt|uday:  Any experienced kibs feel like jumping in with commentary? buzz me|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman's choice of 4@S made it harder for EW to find the save - 5@C by East over Hamman's 4@s might be a good hand that gets raised to 6@C.|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will overtake the SK and hook a club first|pg||
nt|jlall:  clubs before diamonds, because it might be KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both boards  large swings on very minor differences in evaluation/guess|pg||
nt|dburn: par at the other table, where North-South were not actually saving over 6@d but over 5@s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bt: this is the boring beginning of a long exciting match, i promise :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bt:  AK onside, KJ onside, @D 32|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Katz playing 2@D north   after he found strange opening bid of 1@H|pg||
nt|3for3:  very strange to open a 5 card major when in range for nt...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jlall: if nickell had overcalled michaels, west would not know his partner had clubs though so he might not be overly aggressive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5s is down on 2 diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu:  but 6@D make - and who would lead a @D from W's hand? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I don't say they were right to save against 5@s, only that the result is par|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no one who couldn't see through the cazrds|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Vugraphzfc: moss playing with 9 and ace of hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: or KQ or KJ doubleton legitimatily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most situations  EW carding  upside-down: count, attitude, smith AND suit-preference|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: Now the spade shift, although it isn't necessary since South has third trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson claims 2 down|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckstroth trying to get hearts out of the way before playing ace and a diamond in the hope of a blockage|pg||
nt|3for3:  even 5422 seems to be many people's idea of NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampsons says they could make 5 clubs Greco are you trying to make him feel better|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about these hands|pg||
pc|s2|nt|3for3:  alas, sarcasm doesn't travel the internet as well as one might like...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not surprising that Katz-Nickell favor 1@H followed by 2@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: we really need walter to describe the [proprietary] documented exceptions|pg||
nt|jlall:  zia chose to rebid 2C, hamman chose to pass that (slightly low because partner might have 3 spades, but clearcut imo), so this will be a small swing to nickell|pg||
nt|jlall:  finding a way to get to 4S gets the cash on this layout|pg||
nt|jlall:  but that is a very lucky contract assuming they don't let you ruff a heart|pg||

nt|jlall: this time hampson upgrades|pg||
nt|petergill: Moss followed the theory "preempt one level lower when vul vs not vul, and one level higher when at fav vul" but it didn't work this time, due to Meckstroth's boldness. |pg||

nt|dburn: and Rodwell may take a shot at it, despite the vulnerability (or maybe because of it, since East is supposed to have a sound hand)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A good plan for advancing players is to believe the opp's signals early in the hand.  Be a little more suspicious later in the hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman rejecting 1NT, but this could be a serious violation of an obscure Law|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2h + 4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or just Stayman without stopper|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss's PASS worked really well in the auction|pg||
nt|jlall:  1N in both tables because they play the same system, opening 1D in natural is much more appealing than in RM precision|pg||
nt|3for3:  might easily be duplicated here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|markf:  Dull hand, easy to bid and make 4@H|pg||
nt|jlall: 1@H shows 8-11 points, denies 5 spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dburn: and Nickell has a winning position now whatever happens|pg||

nt|ahollan1: only one singleton king likely to score here|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|bt:  a diamond lead wasnt obvious|pg||
nt|bt:  except for us seeing all hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: this denies the king|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says please stop that  -- have to lead it its the contract|pg||
nt|kit: diamond shift now, and defense will have many tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zia got to open north hand 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: even spade followed by diamond will work|pg||
nt|markf:  Nickell has a difficult Opening Lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss drops soome cards and can't find them and Katz says too bad laughter|pg||
nt|jlall: natural bidding after 1H|pg||
nt|3for3:  i dont see what north south did wrong in the auction.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: asks @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if you normally lead A from AK  at 5+ level you often want to lead unsupported Ace -- so switch back to K from AK and show COUNT to aid cashout|pg||
pc|dA|nt|inquiry:  with east having the @Cqt, there will be a club spade squeeze on east for an overtrick... if fred plays for it.. .losing a diamond and a club... but 4@h itself is straight forward|pg||
nt|petergill: On @DK lead, 4@s might make|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S or 4@SX e.g @DK to ace, @SJ wins, @D ruff, @SA, spade to dummy, @D 10 pitching a club. Doesn't help N to cover @SJ. |pg||
nt|bigtrain: eric once explained some very esoteric reason to me but has since admited they just found it easier to think all upside-down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says this is a bad time to be cute all laugh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|inquiry:  losing at most one in each off suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- now defense will have to work to even beat it 1.|pg||
nt|petergill: To North, @D10 looked like a high card through, not wanting the suit back|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: don't most play through declarer 10/9 = 0/2?|pg||
nt|jlall: on a club lead if greco ducks 3N can be defeated|pg||
nt|chick:  Burn's Third Law:  You cannot make 3N on a crossruff.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Now king of clubs, club ducked -- but defense can recover with diamond to king and spade through and at least beat the contract.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Let's see:  never lead away from a k -- never lead away from or an unsupported ace -- never lead from aq -- never lead a singleton trump.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th  best  smith echo|pg||
nt|jlall: katz has just stuck with his diamonds, I'm not sure about that|pg||
nt|jlall: greco almost for sure is 1534 on the bidding|pg||
nt|jlall: and hampson has announced 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: if greco had 2 spades he would have raised spades at some point, and with 1 spade and 2 diamonds he wouldnt bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|jlall: this hand is very tricky with no communication|pg||
nt|jlall: however, EW have no suit to attack|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco is shaking his head|pg||
nt|jlall: he can win, play a spade, club back he wins the ace, cashes a heart, plays a spade|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a winning line|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Peter  is norm in OZ for that @D10 to be attitude?|pg||
nt|3for3:  obviously we can see ns would have been better off bidding 5@H/4@S, but it is hard to see who should have done something different|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcphee: he is going to take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bt:  there is a case for west returning a small heart at second trick, give decl xxxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:  with @CA in east, @DK in west is likely|pg||

pc|h4|nt|jlall: but thats because we can see all the hands|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jlall: so far, so good|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ritong: the sense of 3@c has importance|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: if it asks for " help", @c A becomes very leadable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  with @CAK  south would lead the suit   with neither -- he doesn't have opening bid|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond lead opening|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good play by katz|pg||
nt|jlall: he will go up with the ace here|pg||
nt|jlall: he needs hand entries, even if the CK is on going up with the ace is correct|pg||
nt|warrens:  if the defense cashes their two winners, they can win 3 imps (assuming declarer guesses the @D suit)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: giving up a sure 300 vs maybe losing a +50 is poor strategy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|3for3:  welcome bigtrain|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 8 of @H's looks like a count card, so Diamond might know that the @H will cash|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Greco in 2@S East|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps it is Moss bidding 1@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Their advance partnership agreement determines what @D10 meant - and JLall- Bathurst are not that regular a partnership, so it wasn't easy to decipher @D10|pg||

nt|bt:  another thin slam, will greco hampson bid it up again?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X can include 5@H GF|pg||

nt|kit: Many would not open 2@S on North hand.  Personally, I think it is a close call.|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: Zia did pass but still declaring 4@S|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred knows dummy has short hearts, because his partner made a takeout |pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: He gets them, but the trump promotion on the clubs will defeat him.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|bigtrain: i think the needed to play @S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall:  X showing hearts|pg||
nt|jlall:  also, fred really had no appealing lead other than that too. it looks like his side has more than half the deck, dummy has shortness in both majors, and meck has a major 2 suiter, definitely a good thematic lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred will play the DK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I believe Meckwell in the 34th year of their partnership.  Even if I'm off by a few years, they've had time to generate a significant number of agreements.|pg||
nt|jlall:  it kills the entry for the CQ if declarer has stiff K of clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfc: 1nt by w = transfer bid|pg||
nt|mcphee: so he was kind of forced to wait for partner to re-open|pg||

nt|jlall: even if you play A from AK|pg||

nt|warrens:  declarer will have to duck @H's only once to make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: 2NT would have been RKC|pg||

pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfc: GUESS??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now they are in cuebidding mode|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C coming up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C pure cue or source of tricks?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cuebid|pg||
nt|kit: they did stop in 4@H at other table, so possible swing for Milner.|pg||
nt|jlall: he is going to cash his spades and play a heart to the jack|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thats surprising|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serious|pg||
nt|ritong: they usually have very sound preempts  perhaps is allergic to 7222|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  S has an automatic 2@c bid according to Sabine Auken.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jlall:  people asking if meck is worth a 3S raise, personally I would not bid 3S|pg||
nt|jlall:  its NV and you have no idea if partner has club values or not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Platnick asks could He have a 5 card minor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: (Rodwell)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzfc: on D hook|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  She's a big believer in taking the 1 level away from the opponents.|pg||
nt|bt: a spade back makes this very interesting|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Bd 49: if @H hook, he has to play very precisely I think (without looking at gib, I never would do that) - I think he has to then play @Da, @d ruff, @SA, @d ruff then club and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guess to finess the nine - not easy|pg||
nt|ritong: and side opposition|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall: then he will duck 2 rounds of clubs and win the third|pg||
nt|jlall: at which point, he will have to guess diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: i'm shocked with the poor trump|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will all aces and spaces judged that he needed his partner to be able to take control.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must really like the @C trick source|pg||
nt|jlall: unlucky pitch|pg||
nt|jlall: but it should be noted, once nickell tanked for a long time on that pitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says when can we get to give out smith signals|pg||
nt|jlall: greco was a lock to get @D right|pg||
nt|bt: west can make by finessing clubs and endplaying north|pg||
nt|3for3:  rodwell now knows where the honors are, since the defense gave up on the hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says that was a weakkkkkkkkkkkk raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: all laughter|pg||
nt|markf:  Looks like a par result; 3@S down 1, would make 3@H|pg||
nt|jlall: with Axx of diamonds nickell would not be pained|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Hampson also in 3N on lead of @H9  [Nickell bid 2@H on 2nd round]|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: generally speaking the top priority to determine is trump strength|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it will hurt him in the sense that it will cost him an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|jlall:  perhaps the master bid is 1D p 1S p 2D p 2S p 3H showing 2461 and an invite, thats the only way they would ever get to this game|pg||
nt|jlall:  haha|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcphee: even if he continues @D it will still go 1 down|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|jlall: katz also pitched a painless diamond which is hard to do with Qxxx staring at KJxx|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|bigtrain: they can't set up spades and play 3rd round of @C both|pg||

nt|kit: But Meckstroth didn't double.  Now what will Rodwell do?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or convert to penalty if 4@S on HCP|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcphee: sold for 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what a great partner|pg||
nt|markf:  4@H seems like a lot; may be making his partner guess|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred must be amused by all the bidding with partner jumping in hearts!!! |pg||
nt|bt: west has a diamond lead, i think, unless there is a rule against leading from kQ|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  This would appear to come under the heading of a "sound game" for Meckwell.|pg||
nt|dburn: needs a little more than the spade finesse|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 21-23|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: game try X|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says my usually dummy pd|pg||
nt|jlall: normal auction here, but NS should have been competing|pg||
nt|ritong: moss treated it as a t/o double based on @hs, with "nebulous" @d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D - transfer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|markf:  I'm impressed with Fred's Pass|pg||
nt|markf:  Can make 6 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman says best dummy of the day Katz says we know who was thinking|pg||
nt|jlall: impossible to know, hampson did not want to squeal on spades because he might defend 3N|pg||
nt|jlall:  2N is some bid by moss|pg||
nt|jlall:  he was really hoping they'd take the push to 3S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|inquiry:  must be a rule....against leading ffrom kq...|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jlall: and also because he is vul at imps with a bad hand|pg||
nt|jlall: greco not close to balancing with only 3 spades and KT of hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfc: technology is still bad|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mcphee: this is a pretty good game, not clear if he will make|pg||

nt|dburn: down four? seems generous|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Lall needs to cash ace of spades to give declarer a problem|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: so much for that -- now heart guess for 6|pg||
nt|jlall: that is life sometimes|pg||
nt|jlall:  this would probably be a very interesting hand to play in 4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm not sure you could make 4|pg||
nt|jlall:  strange to see meckwell and greco-hampson miss back to back games, no matter how low HCP they are|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes|pg||
nt|jlall:  with both black suits off|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt: with this amount of bidding, you can look at the vulnerability and see who is pushing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco opened 2N and superaccept to 4@H -- i wouldn't have guessed EITHER action|pg||
nt|3for3:  this hand will definitely be faster than the previous one|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: he will now|pg||
nt|inquiry:  if they can find their heart ruff now, this is down two... |pg||

pc|s4|nt|ritong: fred has @dQx, visibly|pg||

nt|jlall:  Henry says the other room found the CT play from dummy|pg||
nt|jlall:  here meck might play for Jx|pg||
nt|jlall:  oh sorry, rodwell is declaring|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  In order to hear the audio commentary you must be using the web version of BBO:  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer led @C after |pg||
pc|sA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jlall: greco trying to deny katz an entry to hook the heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C10  after @D eliminated|pg||
nt|jlall:  gitelman would have done better to play a heart honor|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: seems like he should have cashed ace of spades first -- time to get diamond ruff after that, and not likely anybody is void in spades.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: but, as lall said, who am i to argue meck's choices|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jlall:  the idea being, to make declarer think moss has 6 hearts for his vulnerable 2N bid|pg||
nt|jlall:  which would make him play for Jx of clubs on|pg||

nt|kit: 3C puppet Stayman -- now they have found hearts, but will they get too high?|pg||
nt|jlall: usually with 4 spades greco bids 2S, but with a horrible 3rd seat opener he is allowed to bid 1S|pg||

nt|104891: sry priv|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D is art game try usually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- does 2N guarantee 4-fit or can it be 3??|pg||
nt|dburn: not such a good contract by South - Meckwell may be able to play by North, depending on the vagaries of system|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even had he played @S trick 2 I think he can make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: shift to low club that will beat it also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=slam try in @H|pg||
nt|jlall:  3H wa a good rebid, if he bid 2H north might have doubled|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure which of them was closer to a bid - I guess South could open a random weak two or bid 2@s over 1NT, but both of those look a bit hairy|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, with no known heart fit Jxx of hearts looks horrible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about 3@D   trust Walter|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is 98% 4|pg||
mb|2N|an|more relay|nt|inquiry:  the @S split is just enough to set 4@S... good doublet by fred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they started to pick up the bids before they saw the x|pg||
nt|jlall: nickell should balance with 3@D|pg||
nt|jlall: i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: forces sound to be even|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: e/w say sorry but then west says nice hand|pg||
nt|inquiry:  fred will look around for a club to lead, not finding one, he will start a red suit|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That was a mispelling most of us couldn't make even if we tried.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meckstroths says maybe we can make one of these|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might be 3 with a shapely invite IF they play semi-forcing NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = u/d attitude|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if SP then he would have played @D10|pg||
nt|warrens:  for those asking about the last hand, yes, declarer could have made 5 if he won the @C Ace and exited a small one.  but he could have made 6 if it was QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play u/d suit preference|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2 = u/d attitude|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the ONLY time they play standard carding is on a lead that shows the ace-king|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only then that its all u/d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: other than that its all u/d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry for poor typing skills everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  he has to lose 1@C, 1@H, and 2@S... with no lines to try avoid those losers....he is  worrying about fred having five spades|pg||
nt|inquiry:  for his double|pg||
nt|jlall:  they had no chance at this table|pg||
nt|dburn: don't know whether even these relays can sort out the @sJ10, without which slam would be pretty horrible|pg||
nt|dburn: what they need is some bid by North which says "OK, now I know what I can find out, do you like your hand for slam?"|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: On a better day this slam would make, but this is not a better day|pg||
nt|ritong: this shift simplifies matters|pg||
nt|ritong: for the declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, there was some tangling around|pg||
nt|ritong: still has to make a decision about his basic suit|pg||
nt|inquiry:  intra finesse in clubs I think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  he may try to shorten his trumps by ruffing diamonds twice... but everything seems to be down one.|pg||
nt|jlall: do you think greco should pass 2@H henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps even two fits, when west was not hot to raise to 3@h with three  here, 3@d would have hit big|pg||
nt|jlall: KQJx of hearts and very defensive values...|pg||
nt|ritong: i would try to catch them higher greedy me:)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Vugraphzfc: i suspect 5nt was an effort to check spade quality below top thre honors|pg||
nt|passell: I think it was choice of slams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hampson must have been looking for something else..he finally passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Burn's LAW Of Total Trump (and others):  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer assumes hearts 3-2, of course.  So, counting his winners, if clubs 4-2 he has 4 clubs, 5 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 spade.  Not enough.  So he needs clubs 3-3 also.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: yeah thats a good point, with an 8 card fit when you bid to 2S they will often compete further|pg||
nt|ritong: also, 1@s then 2@s depicts my garbage accurately|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: katz raises his eyebrows|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: katz showing his hand to moss|pg||

nt|jlall:  for moss this is a light opener|pg||
nt|passell: key lead here |pg||
pc|cA|nt|passell: a diamond seems normal and neccessary|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jlall: great choice by nick |pg||
nt|bigtrain: eric intrepreted it as SP thus the @H shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- what is alert of 1@D?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@D is NOT an aleert just natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director is to check not happy with what board is being played now watching|pg||
nt|warrens:  1@D is a natural overcall and 1NT is a good @D raise, right Walter?|pg||
nt|3for3:  pass looks wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i didn't but yes :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz2:  The 2@h bid is a book "midnight swiss weak 2".|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hearts dummy first Nickell says nice|pg||
nt|markf:  Double Dummy can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ritong: hamman did not resist other room, and tried for a @s fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4th 2nd higher from trash|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is equivalent to a cuebid|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more action from Lall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Meck overcall a precision 1@D opener?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubt it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-P-1@S-2@C//DBL[3@S]|pg||
nt|inquiry:  the double is takeout|pg||
nt|jlall: katz will pass, his free 1N has a minimum of about 8|pg||
nt|dburn: ungainly sort of contract at the other table, when North hoped to find a spade fit and a thin game|pg||
nt|ritong: which would have enhanced his hand big time|pg||
nt|3for3:  oh, perhaps he was 'trapping'|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jlall: maybe a good 7|pg||
nt|jlall: so his hand is garbage|pg||
nt|ritong: purely so|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this isn't a bad choice either, though it could blow a tempo sometimes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bt: trump shift, @SA diamond, duck ace ...|pg||
nt|bt: and east has to play for exactly Jxx in south|pg||
nt|markf:  Declarer could make on trump lead by playing for Jxx offside, but not best line|pg||
nt|jlall:  what would you guys bid over the neg X?|pg||
nt|jlall:  i like 2S|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward rebid now - 3@c often played as extras, so 2@s his only real option|pg||
nt|jlall:  Even if they don't play it as extras|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 2@S is the only option|pg||
nt|jlall:  KJT97|pg||
nt|jlall:  Uncle Bob chose 3C in the other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X doesn't promise @C as far as i'm concerned|pg||
nt|jlall:  this is part of the reason i like 2S, even oppsoite 1-4 in the blacks 2S looks just fine|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not me|pg||
nt|warrens:  now 2@D must show a minimum|pg||
nt|bigtrain: WEST just siad he had a good raise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|robinswr: with 4531, I would double 1 club |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when opp have shown themselves to be in swing mode -- does that affect your thought process on defense??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: based on meck's comment when asked if he knew it was his lead the answer is yes it affects your thoughts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X not 2@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman picked 3@c, so Zia's negative doubles may have more tendency to show both suits|pg||
nt|3for3:  north south do play meckwell lite.  |pg||
pc|d6|nt|inquiry:  so diamond picked up 11 imps on the last board... as 3@dx was down two at the other table|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcphee: 1 or 2 down on the @D guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says Gitelman thinks perhaps that was a bit optimustic|pg||
nt|bt: that won paralyze nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss shaking head|pg||
nt|bt: wont|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 5 of clubs probably suit preferance for hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: when singleton in dummy most play suit preferance|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c now would sort of threaten the declarer of a ruff and save the @d Q|pg||
nt|jlall: the players would never guess the imp results, board 2 EW are cold for a vul game and both tables played partial down white... board 3 both made a very difficult 3N, board 4 ...|pg||
nt|jlall: platnick let 4S slip through vul to win 5 against 790...board 6 both sides sold to 2H when they coudl make a partial|pg||
nt|dburn: but, if East can somehow find a diamond shift after @h10, there is a chance to beat 1NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: msp|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, problem solved by Platnick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is RM  [rodwell-meckstroth]  and RM Lite variations  diamond-platnick, greco-hampson, cheek-grue, lall-kranyack and a few others in this trials|pg||
nt|warrens:  making 5 seems odd|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5 is alot|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|nt|jlall: good call henri|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5th heart will squeeze him to have to guess for the contract|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: I think he led the queen to deny the king, so if his partner were void he would be forced to ruff.|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any chance he ducks this??|pg||
nt|bigtrain: ifhes ducking it he needs ti do it fast|pg||
nt|jlall:  good play by meck|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, if Meckstroth continues a low diamond for Rodwell to ruff...|pg||

nt|jlall:  that is why meck is a great player, even if it doesnt matter he will never tell you more about the hand than he has to, so you always have to be thinking, its very very hard playing against him|pg||
nt|warrens:  a blank spot by declarer|pg||

nt|warrens:  Debbie, did he make it or give up a ruff and go down 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: appeal was from segment  5  board  69|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, which?|pg||
nt|passell: on his own declarer would play the king of clubs  since he would pick up stiff jack or queen and lose only to stiff ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|asks|nt|jlall: nick might consider overcalling 1N if r/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: since they will be stealing a lot|pg||

nt|ritong: brad will make some try here, but they have no fit, so i expect 3NT at last|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia in 6@D on @SJ lead|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@d not too bad|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss figured it out though|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow leads with 4+ in suit|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  If someone wants to be imortalized in wikipedia, there doesn't appear to be an article about The Bridge Journal.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well back to the commentaing...  talk with you later ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss gets a warning from the director for taking excessively long time on the last bd|pg||
nt|jlall:  yes, i think 3D is a transfer to 3N, the idea being you want the overcaller on lead|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia, of course, does not play such conventions for obvious reasons|pg||
mb|3N|nt|inquiry:  ew also had 8 trick in spades, so down two is not horrible result..the defense is not going to be all that clear|pg||
nt|jlall:  playing on spades seems natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell on bathroom break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when i have time will do score or I will miss this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  4@H=rkc for @D's|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C=2 w/o the Q|pg||
nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: blasty|pg||
nt|jlall: i am stunned|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: maybe he didnt bid 2N because he wanted to avoid a double for a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rusinow with 4+ in suit|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North would have opened his hand, and South opened his, and an opening bid facing an opening bid is a game|pg||
nt|ritong: hi david|pg||
nt|jlall: I assume you are joking when they open all 11s :)|pg||
nt|ritong: suspect some sarcastic antimodernism of yours:)|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - not infrequently these days an opening bid facing an opening bid can't beat game by the other side|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they need to bid and make a slam to flatten the board|pg||
nt|ritong: i rather saw something like 1@d 2@c 2NT 3@d 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: since that perfectly normal @sJ lead at the other table found a layout that blew a trick in the spade suit itself|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he knows he is off an ace and the queen of trumps (4@H was RKC) but he might take his chances anyway|pg||
nt|passell: this looks like a flat 3nt|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bt: now is it possible to play rd here?|pg||
nt|dburn: and when Zia played a heart from the dummy, East didn't split his honours, so 6@d made in comfort in the end|pg||
nt|3for3:  north did not open 3nt, needless to say|pg||
nt|3for3:  normal 3nt with an overtrick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the appeal centers around   moss as declarer in 3N  rodwell making an off-tempo encouraging signal and meckstroth shifting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: being asked ? I did not see bidding so this is the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Meckwell flattened 6@s on 97, even though they also played by South|pg||
nt|dburn: they started with a 1@h response to the strong club, but as it happened South's next bid was an artificial 2@s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlall: i am pretty sure that they play 2N as artificial over 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, perso is @cs|pg||
nt|jlall: so, hampson probably didnt want to bid 2C risking a double|pg||
nt|ritong: guess 6@c asks for third round control|pg||
nt|jlall:  Sorry to harp on this point, but imagine playing a bunch of boards against guys who are always in thin games, always making very tough plays that make you have to figure out the hand because they don't autopilot, always trying to steal and swin|pg||
nt|jlall:  dle|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: Unlucky the one time he should have zigged, and he zagged.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: still might win imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: justin bet that partner had junk and he does|pg||
nt|bigtrain: zia in 3nt so best not to bid slam|pg||
nt|kit: true -- 3NT at other table looks doomed.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3 spades shows spade control  3nt is non-serious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: do not play a natural 2n over 2 hearts|pg||
nt|bt: i think he will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|uday:  Such an innocuous board for such a scary final contract|pg||
nt|inquiry:  this will make a dull hand fairly excliting.. |pg||
nt|jlall: then invite, risking letting them X 3N light for a heart lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or a spec X|pg||
nt|jlall:  always blasting to game and not making cherry picking bids to give you info|pg||
nt|jlall:  then the director tells you youre in tiem trouble|pg||
nt|jlall:  im a young guy but i just played 90 boards against them and it is so exhausting, that is part of their game, their opponents always tire out|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I think Brad was born in 1971.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during earlier round       Director: you're behind the clock   Steve Robinson: change the clock|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfc: he has west to show spade control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia did take losing @C finesse after @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: duly accepted|pg||
nt|dburn: 7@d, on the other hand, is a different proposition altogether|pg||
nt|ritong: "i expect 3NT" lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so close Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: i am the shame of the profession|pg||
nt|dburn: even though I am sure the lead will be the same, I don't see how he can put 13 tricks together|pg||
pc|c2|nt|robinswr: he'll probably ruff as many diamonds as he can|pg||
nt|jlall: he is very much in the bid game or pass school rather than giving them extra info|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: GL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we've seen worse slams    this just needs @D not worse than 42, @C coming in for 5 tricks and a @H @S squeeze|pg||
nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||
nt|markf:  Only real chance is for @D's 3-3 and J@C falling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have a slide rule?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Still, declarer isn't 100% home.  Easier to make 6 than 5, since in 6 you would have to play for QJ doubleton in diamonds.  In 5, you may be guarding against 4-1 split.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Anyone see a 9th trick for Katz?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet in here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: nice lead partner alll laugh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: argument for defense -- moss misplayed the hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: a bit similar to push or fold|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the advantages of doing that is that it lets you play sequences that would normally be invitational as forcing, allowing more room to explore good hands|pg||
nt|ritong: in poker|pg||
nt|ritong: true, david|pg||
nt|ritong: modern players do not knit much when in game zone  reg slam, is the contrary imo|pg||
nt|jlall: meckwell play the same exact system in the other room, will be interesting to see what they choose|pg||
nt|dburn: and jlall is quite right when he speaks of giving information away to the opponents - why tell them whether opener is maximum or minimum?|pg||
nt|jlall: on board 37, meck chose to bid like greco, bid 1@S with 4 spades, but then compete to 2S over 2H. Platnick did bid 3@D which i thought was the best bid|pg||
nt|jlall: i love having greco-hampson and meckwell in the same seats because we can compare their judgement within the same basic system|pg||
pc|h4|nt|markf:  I see Gitleman getting 3 trumps and a spade|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Born in 1971 in NYC."  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&Itemid=29&id=29|pg||
nt|dburn: the director, of course, is just properly doing his job - many arguments for and against bridge being a timed game|pg||
nt|jlall:  Fred had 3 small 3 small in the majors, no doubt he would have hated to bid 3N and have rodwell lead a major which would happen often|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you traverse the site Joe just posted, it includes bios of many players as well as photos  --- you can finally put faces to the names|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes you get to choose which face goes with which name|pg||
nt|dburn: commentators naturally prefer a fast pace - gives them less time to misanalyse the deals|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sounds like the next big Iphone app.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: from comment i believe 9C is upside down suit pref|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: and on 98 Meckstroth led a diamond against 5@c, and declarer did indeed try @cK from his hand, which this time pinned the singleton ace|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Heart continuation might have presented more problems, taking out the entry|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss will probably just duck this|pg||
nt|jlall:  rodwell plays ud signals but doesnt even want to waste the 6|pg||
nt|jlall:  i guess he can afford the six|pg||
nt|warrens:  is he thinking of encouraging because he has the 10?|pg||
nt|jlall:  but when you look at T863 over 972 the 6 or 8 is pretty counterintuitive|pg||
pc|d2|nt|inquiry:  certaiin 2@Dxx will make... how many overtricks is the question|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Several people have shown me that if Katz plays 3 rounds of @cs and @hrs, they starts @ss he can't fail to get 9.|pg||
nt|bt: i have had an idea about forbidding my partners to make lead directing doubles|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Dirty Harry said it:  "Are you feeling lucky ... punk?"|pg||
nt|ritong: well, do ya?|pg||
nt|bt: i played in a final match against italy in a european championships, someone decided to double stayman with QJ742 ...|pg||
nt|bt: only one overtrick|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz has focus on making sure of 8 tricks. Gain from an overtrick is much less than the loss from going down 1|pg||
nt|bt: so i can feel your pain here brad moss|pg||
nt|bt: !|pg||
nt|markf:  Hampson could have finessed in 4@S playing for AJ on his right. Would have gone down.|pg||
nt|markf:  Meant Greco|pg||
nt|bt: lead directing doubles gives opponents 2 ways to win|pg||
nt|bt: one we see here|pg||
nt|bt: the other is they get more bidding space|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he's gone back to the bathroom|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss calls the director|pg||
nt|warrens:  ethically, isn't it hard for Meck to switch after a deliberate 3|pg||
nt|warrens:  ?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it is|pg||
nt|jlall:  i do not blame moss|pg||
nt|jlall:  fred and brad are 2 guys who often talk about how bad "slow signalling" is|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|inquiry:  nice spade signal, makes defense easy|pg||
nt|dburn: South can duck this and East will be somewhat endplayed, but only for eight tricks and not nine|pg||
nt|jlall: he is still trying to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: but if he wins it, as he has done, there is some danger of down two|pg||
nt|jlall: but now he knows it is very bad|pg||
nt|ritong: fred bravely plays for his good case|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: oh  dummy reversal    i missed that line :(|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - he won't care about extra undertricks while there is a chance to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss: H3 att?. Meck: Yes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|dburn: trying for a dummy reversal, which needs 3-3 diamonds plus clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: So, what is his safety play now?  I don't think he can handle QJxx on his right|pg||
nt|markf:  As a was told by r_prah, defender would rise and play trump with AJ|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: there may be a strom brewing in the Northern quarter|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jlall:  if brad gets this wrong we are gonna see fireworks|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s3|nt|kareno:  A LITTLE?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|pc|sT|nt|jlall:  brad could have safety played and popped ace|pg||
nt|jlall:  crossed to the club|pg||
nt|jlall:  and led a heart up|pg||
nt|jlall:  that needs diamonds 5-2 though|pg||
nt|jlall:  its possible meck overcalled a 4 card suit |pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, Justin's right, no need to play the Jack|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|dburn: well defended|pg||
nt|jlall: it kind of looked like nickell would be squeezed if he didnt do this but he was ok on a low heart back since dummy gets squeezed first|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco says good play  Nickell says when he bid 3 NT I was glad I hadn't bid 1NT|pg||

nt|dburn: Katz opting for Drury rather than 1@s, which could be passed, or 2@s which presumably would show spades and a heart fit, but myabe not quite this hand|pg||

nt|jlall: wow on 38, rodwell did make the responsive X of 1N that hampson did not make, platnick jumped to 3N which was down, and meck saved|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fourth best|pg||
nt|robinswr: i hate bidding 3-card majors in response to a t/o double but here there's no reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|jlall: so a possible swing for nickell went to diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: so nick is in slam mood, and not deterred with 2@s|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, a good decision by N/S not to compete|pg||
nt|3for3:  another hand to tap, or to go for your own ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: did not see what Meck wrote to diamond on the 2nt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  with this result, Nickell takes the lead|pg||
nt|passell: he is afraid to duck the heart but he has no tricks  if he doesnt|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|markf:  Nickell shouldnt have signed off.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: katz says disappoint if you go down|pg||
nt|ritong: and now, sonny?:)|pg||
nt|dburn: seems so, and like jlall I think that's a bit optimistic with only an eight-card fit|pg||
nt|jlall: did nick ever suggest a slam try? if so i cant imagine ralph would let him out|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@c is slammy|pg||
nt|jlall: and is nick actually thinking here? |pg||
nt|ritong: when 2@s could have been NT oriented|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he pickup @H suit too  or just take his 9 and run?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need to type faster|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs|pg||
nt|jlall: nick has gotten very optimistic|pg||
nt|jlall: hes playing his partner for A A QJ of trumps and long clubs i think|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to imagine a hand with more red lights, yes|pg||
nt|jlall: ralph will try for 7|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the trumps can be played for only one loser, but with spades 4-2 I can't see anything like twelve tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: told scrambling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries Debbie   we trust Walter's explanations more than Meck's anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: rodwell range of 2h is approx what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sometimes hard to hear what they are saying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: trying not to type so loud to distract players|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: at least this is only 50 a trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|inquiry:  with @CA gone, a quieck claim coming here.... |pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  this could go down a lot if they duck one @D|pg||
nt|kit: However, the heart lead may be the loser -- since now Bathurst will (may) grab the first round of diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: michael rosenberg has given an excellent suggestion|pg||
nt|jlall: and martha katz|pg||
nt|ritong: i agree, west certainly worth 5NT|pg||
nt|jlall: nick forgot his partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|jlall: then his bidding makes sense|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: excellent point|pg||
nt|jlall: 4D might even be RKC for clubs|pg||
nt|jlall: and 5C 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|jlall: not sure if nickell katz play that|pg||
nt|jlall: rodders did pass 1N with the hand hampson bid 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: in that case, the bidding may not even be over, since 6@h will come as a shock to Nickell who thinks clubs are trumps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: currently double checking start of auction and " oh my!"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz says 4 diamonds is splinter|pg||
nt|dburn: strange to continue to forget partner passed all the way through the auction, when the green card is still sitting on the tray|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell didn't see he was a past hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: small break|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that gives us a chance to see whether this might make in some miraculous way, but I still can't think of one|pg||
nt|ritong: this might take some time, when nick has to recover from the shock before trying to work out a winning case|pg||
nt|jlall: no chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: as to distract players|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: break here for a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which leads to story about     Terence Reese playing a hand at rubber bridge and not noticing naked lady in the room|pg||
nt|warrens:  a break now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: short break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no result on appeal|pg||
nt|warrens:  do you mean no change is the ruling or there isn't a ruling yet?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever noticed it is always the slower room that takes the break ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no ruling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I do not know what the appeal is only that there is one and no ruling yet|pg||
nt|garden2005: no to wysy³aj jak napiszesz a ja napisze drugi post po swojemu na ten sam temat|pg||
nt|garden2005: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: range for 2nt hearts good 7 to terrible 11|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jlall: i think you have to play for 3-3 spades and Ax of hearts|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: well, this is the kind of game everyone bids nowadays - the opening was sub-minimum but the response was completely normal|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|passell: it shows once again how worthless jacks can be|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mcphee: i think the defending side has a better shot at 3N than these guys do at 1:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I'm not sure that Bathurst will take the chance.  what if declarer had AQx, Axx Qx, AKxxx|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: well, i take it back|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: he plays confidently|pg||
nt|jlall: he has only 1 line|pg||
nt|ritong: true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: passed hand |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he had more than one - heart to the queen, then play to ruff two diamonds on the table, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|jlall: specs suggesting if this heart is ducked, nickell can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: but diamonds 4-4 is less likely than spades 3-3|pg||
nt|jlall: but then south gets in with the HA and gives his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: then again, South could have @hAx and three diamonds, when that line would work|pg||
nt|jlall: if that was the layout you'd be playing for a defensive error since they could play ace and a heart unless spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|ritong: as expectable, this won t be a push|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they'd have to play ace and a heart when you led a heart yourself towards the queen, and that's not so clear - but still, probably better to go for the legitimate shot|pg||
pc|d6|nt|inquiry:  contract is going to make. how to play spades... is the only question for katz, i think he will get it right|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty clear when he tanks forever and ducks |pg||
nt|dburn: still, after that development Nickell knows at least that hearts are where he wants them|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ritong: perhaps fred will, considering @ss|pg||
nt|petergill: Not quite sure what happened there - whether it was 12 tricks or 11 or 10, not important, only overtricks|pg||

nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: and 2.5@h for east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 fingers cold and tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  east will want to show a good spade raise, so he bid 2nt, limit raise... can't be better since he is passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli, etc|pg||
nt|jlall: 2.8 for me|pg||
nt|passell: the auction at the other table will be different as they wont pass in second seat with Hammans hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman not yet joined the "no eleven count left unopened" party|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hamman won't get to defend 1H, but 3nt is easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: will spare you my usual song:)|pg||
nt|dburn: even though you would open the bidding with it, there are times when an opening bid plus an opening bid doesn't make a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 tricks on 55|pg||
nt|jlall:  this is what i was talking about with meckwell|pg||
nt|jlall:  they might have a slam|pg||
nt|jlall:  but they just jump to 4S|pg||
nt|jlall:  their 1S is limited|pg||
nt|jlall:  moss has no idea how to lead, it depends on the hand type meck has|pg||
nt|jlall:  i will bet on a trump though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell claims 9 or 11 ..not going to take any finesses in H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1M-4M by big club pair is a huge winner, unlike 2/1 where it is always preemptive   here sometimes opening bid with no slam ambition|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  It's a plot, Karen...|pg||
nt|jlall:  unsurprisingly, hamman did not lead a trump, since he hates trump leads to be passive|pg||
nt|passell: he may not want to defend 1heart|pg||
mb|d|nt|warrens:  right, has to be AKxxx of @C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 115  also 3N east  after west shows @D    same @H lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  so I'm stuck giving him a good 18|pg||
nt|jlall: that is a very good hand to open 1 and rebid 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  1.5 in @ds .5 in @cs|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@S art GF|pg||
nt|warrens:  Walter, do they play 1@H-2@S as weak in order to play this forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: Debbie, :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can open light vul says Katz|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ritong: good thing you precised, debbie|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = 6card suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@S strong spade rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: often-mangled suit combination, those clubs - not at this level, of course, but sometimes players adopt the "danger play" line of cashing the ace before finessing|pg||

mb|3N|nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, private.|pg||

mb|p|nt|inquiry:  looks safe enough, but has to be careful in spades... |pg||
nt|ritong: reminds me debbie rosenberg|pg||

pc|h9|nt|bigtrain: blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: Greco not sure about it either - wondering whether a spade or diamond lead could work|pg||

nt|kareno:  Also Lew Mathe:  NEVER lead a singleton trump if you want to be on my team.|pg||
nt|jlall:  the younger players definitely lead trumps a lot more than the previous generations did, i think this is because people bid games lighter and lighter now with shape, and so aggressive leads are less necessary and just not blowing a trick or|pg||
nt|jlall:  cutting down ruffs beats many more games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 0-3|pg||

nt|jlall: possible he just leads a club to the ten|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, I would not be surprised if the percentage play turned out to be to run the ten and then cash the ace-king, since with no entry to West North should duck from @cQx or ...|pg||

nt|inquiry:  they will hope they lose nothing more than the two keycards.. .if the @SK is with north, the @CA has to be with south for his bid (i think), so he will make just fine|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: your bid michaels just want to make sure says diamond and rodwell answers yes|pg||

pc|sT|nt|santyclz2:  As was mine.  (Which doesn't imply I'm above accepting gratuities.)|pg||
nt|dburn: back in 4@h, Meckstroth will need to read the position very well to make it if Moss plays a spade now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the toughest bid for precision to handle is a natural 2@D overcall of a nebulous @D|pg||
nt|jlall:  if moss plays a spade meck could easily go down|pg||
nt|dburn: since if he tries to cross to dummy for another heart finesse, he will go down quickly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: close to what Peter said|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia's Rdbl was in part a mild bluff, to try to convince EW to go to 5@D. Many EW's do. This EW know Zia well enough not to bid 5@D. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: nickell 42-9 this set with 4 to score|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: shades of the old days - Zia choosing @d3 rather than the normal @d8 from his doubleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: if greco believes zia has qd, he might misguess hts|pg||

nt|kit: Tough guess for declarer -- if he ducks and is wrong, defense will certainly shift.|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he ducks this and the ace doesn't show up, Rodwell is in danger of losing 2@S's, 3@H's and 2@C's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: btw   Greco is going down in 2@H on 102|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Hampson says block out the spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room on their final board |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not - if he knew that diamond lead was a singleton, he would know that Moss could not have @hKx remaining|pg||
nt|3for3:  7 imps; would have been 12 if they had doubled...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell down 2 and Meckstroths says we probably beat 4 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: nobody has an opening bid - what odds am I offered on a passout at both tables?|pg||
mb|1D|an|precision|nt|Vugraphzfc: also sometimes they huddle over their discards|pg||
nt|ritong: if a @s was right, pard would have contributed @d9 imo|pg||
nt|passell: no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: might end up shooting 6@H in search of a few imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are very good at telling you the results as they know its hard to follow at times|pg||
nt|jlall: oh, i get it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: he was playing for 4-1 spades and the club hook on|pg||
nt|jlall: then he has an endplay|pg||
nt|jlall: after stripping the clubs and playing a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: I think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, and Meck believed S|pg||
nt|jlall: he saw the 4 standard in spades on his right, so he thought it was a stiff|pg||
nt|jlall: pretty reasonable|pg||
nt|jlall: grego will double here|pg||
nt|jlall: greco*|pg||
nt|jlall: as a passed hand|pg||
nt|ritong: also, @sK will come more frequently from a relatively strong holding, rather than KQ bare|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess he might at that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Greco reading Katz|pg||
nt|jlall: meck didn't, ut there was a key difference, he was against a strong club pair|pg||
nt|jlall: where 4H might be a 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|jlall: that is one of the advantages of strong club|pg||
nt|jlall: 4H here for standard bidders is usually 5 trumps or 4 trumps with shape and not a ton of HCP|pg||
nt|jlall: that makes doubling more attractive|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it was close|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: could be useful for Milner, this - 3NT won't be reached after this start|pg||
nt|dburn: nor should it be, of course|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, W opened a precision 2@C, which prevented a @D overcall.  now there is no game fo E/Q|pg||
nt|warrens:  e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Answer a man's question and he has information.  Teach him to google and..."|pg||
nt|inquiry:  ns can make a bunch of spades... vul 2@S versus nonvul this 2@S bid must begood hand... |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fastest mouse sometimes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :( sorry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: declarer wouyld cover with J9xx|pg||
nt|dburn: else, he would have started with stiff @sA and would have returned a diamond at lightning pace|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dburn: well, e/q can't make game either|pg||
nt|ritong: in @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: so south has a choice between the 9 and his small @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this hand should end quickly|pg||
nt|jlall:  opening helped keep them low here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@d = 4+@H 7-9|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|warrens:  LOL|pg||
nt|petergill: and the pair who post mortem their "bad board" pick up imps on the board, as is so often the case. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: so I suppose 4@H shows not a greaat hand for @H, but Garner will not care|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: East says lets hope I counted my aces right today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Drury    does your partnership know how responder shows a good hand with @C?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: pass?|pg||
nt|jlall: katz does not double 4S because A) he cant beat it B) they might run|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3@H should be 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: other table has finished play|pg||
nt|dburn: curious deal, in a way - East-West at the other table were quite right to bid 3NT (which needs 4-3 diamonds), East-West at this table are quite right not to|pg||
nt|warrens:  the lead helps, but there's still not hope|pg||
nt|warrens:  no hope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 117  Zia playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|jlall: look at it this way|pg||
nt|jlall: his partner had the spade ACE|pg||
nt|dburn: he might not and they might, but surely he expeced to make 4@h - it does seem a bit odd to gamble that passing 4@s is right|pg||
nt|jlall: and 4S can make|pg||
nt|jlall: and would make easily if hampson had the DT|pg||
nt|jlall: saving would be weirder|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: reapeat @cs|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think fred will just cash his spades|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie says I am making 7 and now says he can't count aces|pg||
nt|jlall: and doubling when you think they will often make or have a better spot to run to is not great|pg||
nt|ritong: so, leaping to game is streng verboten for opener|pg||
nt|dburn: this may be a more substantial gain for Diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: repaeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: repeat*|pg||
nt|ritong: omg|pg||
nt|dburn: since 2@d ought to make, and bring in 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|ritong: 11 fingers here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't most  play that Hamman's 2N shows stronger [maybe even Game Force] hand?|pg||
nt|dburn: after 1@s-1NT? I don't know - I guess it's just invitational|pg||
pc|d2|nt|warrens:  East will assume his partner has a doubleton @D at most, so he's thinking about 4@C or 5@C or maybe some try like XX.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  He still could/should have made it.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|inquiry:  double game swing possible on this one... as 4@S looks like it would make (6@S, 2@C, 2@D ruffs).... and 4@h looks like it makes|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, saving would be weird indeed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bt:  nasty guesses here|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
nt|ritong: covering this makes few sense, for starters|pg||
nt|bt:  after getting spades right decl has to guess what rounded suit to finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  is it clear that this isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|inquiry:  playing 4@Sx in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: although some play Henri's favourite Godzilla or whatever it's called|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphzfc: you only had 19 no only 18 but really good 18|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: @s 7 from east|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: will do|pg||
nt|markf:  He also can use a spade trick|pg||
nt|bt:  if he gets it right, katz probably should duck one diamond finesse|pg||
nt|bt:  katz should be able to picture the whole hand and what it takes to beat it|pg||
nt|passell: looks like 2 down 2losers in every suit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all - Katz will also place Nickell with a doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: again  he didn't open in 1st seat 2@S where Justin did|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jlall: if youre not saving i dont think it matters that much whether you think you can make 4H, its just how often do you think you can beat 4S|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps only one in spades given the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond can only be opened with a singleton if King..zia says that would be duplication!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|adonis18:  but the ruff-sluff in the other room was unneccessary|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: and may think that he is obliged to bid anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: especially if pard is like "uh, double? perhaps he wants a special lead"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: to offer a losing choice, you mean|pg||
nt|markf:  I'm surprised Katz won the diamond|pg||
nt|inquiry:  i am told greco and hampson are in 7nt on board 12|pg||
nt|ritong: best katz can do is ducking @d once, and shift @h after cashing his @ss  declarer has a guess|pg||
nt|bt:  at nv imps you should be at 58% or so to bid a grand|pg||
nt|bt:  mathematically|pg||
nt|bt:  though a finesse is good if it makes|pg||
nt|ritong: there is a good rule of thumb about this  if you know 12 tricks on top, just bid 13|pg||
nt|bt:  as a spec commentated once west shows with @SAQJ and @DK hand is over|pg||
nt|dburn: I'd think it will go down two more often than it will make, but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joe's comment in response to voice commentary discussion of  69|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bt:  though west wasnt passed so |pg||
nt|ritong: not quite, but is a good clue, yes|pg||
nt|markf:  With West having pointed suit length, odds favor playing for club finesse.|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  Katz was correct in not playing a heart, he's trying to give South a losing option.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very quiet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I fearlessly predict that the "Lall Hand" will apear in many  bridge columns.|pg||
nt|bt:  which one is that? the lall hand|pg||
nt|ritong: tell gitelmoss they are ahead in the match and you will get a double "heun??"|pg||
nt|ritong: and loses a tapping tempo on lead|pg||
nt|jlall: if katz had doubled, hampson would know he had all 4 spades and make easily from this position|pg||
nt|jlall: however, hammpson still knows that|pg||
nt|jlall:  director was called, and moss drilled in the point with "the H3 was attitude right?"|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|dburn: we have seen this more than once - a side with a seven-card fit bids as though it had eight or nine, causing opponents to misjudge because each thinks the other short in the enemy ...|pg||
nt|dburn: suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think this will get us a 15 imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most 2/1 books say 18-19    but  i see trend where it is Game Force|pg||
nt|ritong: you don t like gazouillis, david?|pg||
nt|ritong: pity  really useful gimmick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dburn: it will, and in the right direction to get us another 15 boards|pg||
nt|warrens:  You're right, David.  I don't think this young team would withdraw anywhere under 100.|pg||
nt|bt:  at the other table west opened a 2452 1nt and defends 4@S X|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its not like eric is a fast player usually...  hes generally very deliberate|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz2:  Father and son participated, one on offense, one on defense in an excellent lesson hand on not rectifying the count for declarer.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish|pg||
nt|bt:  just unlucky i guess|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, that was confusing.  I forget not everyone is listening to the verbal commentary.|pg||
nt|jlall:  i think it would be ridiculous to say that there was not a BIT on that signal|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: zia-hamman  15-17|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Fred G reasoned (approx) that with "Honour-x in @H and in @C" partner would probably have rebid NT over 1NT, so either heart stop is too weak for 3NT or clubs will not set ...|pg||
nt|petergill: up in time for 3NT - hence Pass - if so, well done by Fred. |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Clearly someone's going to have to invent a defense to Godzilla called Mothra?|pg||
nt|jlall:  in fact, i think they will concede that point|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|dburn: quite right too, having seen some of the miracle comebacks that their not-altogether-young opponents have managed over the years|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|passell: rorwell responded 1nt with hampsons hand at the other table looks like a similar result|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jlall:  their argument would be: Meck knew it was never right to play a heart based on the point count|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is two down now - poor declarer, he opened the bidding and then was squeezed on the run of his own trump suit by the defenders|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: indeed, one wonders whether the Nickell team is quite sure of its tactics entering the final session with a substantial lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  and also, moss should have popped HA|pg||
nt|jlall:  and then crossed and played a heart up|pg||
nt|jlall:  i doubt they will argue it wasnt a BIT|pg||
nt|jlall:  BIT=break in tempo|pg||
nt|bigtrain: for sure justin..  but i've been handling alot of messages so that was needed to be said|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jlall: nicely played|pg||

nt|jlall: personally i view this as a win for strong club systems|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: then when he ruff with the 7 he over ruff with the 8|pg||
nt|ritong: it s ok|pg||
nt|petergill: soem people rate Gazzilli , along with Neg Dbls and Reverse Drury, as the most useful gadgets that exist. I|pg||
nt|ritong: like 35 years ago, as far as i am concerned|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board today please join us tomorrow for 60 more boards of the final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room just finished 88  so they have caught up 2 full boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck's did not know what minor that the problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell playing 4@S south|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jlall: baby grand if they dont get preempted out of keycard|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb again|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2+ 11-15|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Roland just pointed out the advantage of using the web version to listen to vgs even if you want to keep the download version for regular play.  Unfortunately only those who are already using the web version heard it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: over 4@c doubled on should answer normally with a club control and pass without a club control (partner can redouble to continue ask)|pg||
nt|markf:  He may have been concerned that Nick had the spade 8 along with the club K|pg||
nt|ritong: greco might love his pard's opening|pg||
nt|jlall: north will show the CA, then the SK then the CK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: new to last board|pg||
nt|dburn: I am prepared to go along with them to some extent - negative doubles are a fine convention|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cole described in Bridge World around 1980    developed by Kit Woolsey, Steve Robinson and Bill Cole|pg||
nt|passell: if hamman had played the jack of spades declarer would have been squeezed|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dburn: Milner may be petitioning the USBF for a late change in the scoring method to BAM|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably Ed Manfield too|pg||
nt|bigtrain: skipped 88|pg||
nt|ahollan1: penultimate is favorite word of many|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: platnick holds up 5 fingers|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Summaries of Gazzilli include http://www.freewebs.com/bobbybridge/conventions/Gazzilli%20Convention.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one response     Including Brian Platnick.  He even uses "Pre- and Post-" penultimate for fun.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = mixed raise|pg||
nt|bigtrain: e/w make a slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D has to decide whether or not to bid 3@S with his 4333 hand, but I think he will since partner promised 5 @S's|pg||
nt|adonis18:  NS makes 4 sp on 18 active points|pg||
nt|jgc: too true|pg||
nt|warrens:  he will expect his partner to have a singleton @H on this auction|pg||
mb|2D|nt|warrens:  1N-3N might get us another swing|pg||
nt|inquiry:  the 2@S bid here promises at tleast 3@S... in north|pg||
nt|jlall: 2N, greco is hoping to hear about spade shortness|pg||
nt|jlall: then he will go ballistic, not even needing the SK|pg||
nt|jlall: hampson can bid 3C showing art GF|pg||
nt|jlall: or 3D showing "iw ould accept a good LR"|pg||
nt|warrens:  3|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@H a stronger 3@S bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: so what will his choice be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule for the finals showing viewer's timezone  http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Nickell says I hope this one is not as hard as the last one|pg||
nt|warrens:  likes the fact that he has zero points in @H's|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: well Brad is not shy|pg||
nt|mcphee: he placed fred with 4-4 majors I think|pg||
nt|robinswr: obviously 2@d did not promise both majors|pg||
nt|mcphee: you think not steve?|pg||
nt|robinswr: should be two places to play|pg||
nt|warrens:  my guess is that X shows 1m + 1M|pg||
nt|jlall: either they changed their system and i didnt know|pg||
nt|warrens:  did he really show a minimum?  Rodwell showed a GF.|pg||
nt|jlall: or 3H shows a min opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|inquiry:  if the 3 hcp fred has in hearts was in the other major, slam would be reasonable...|pg||
nt|bt:  which is why a 4@H splinter would be more to the point, my partners never have that perfect hand anyway|pg||
nt|inquiry:  Fred will not want to encourage...so he can't pass here... as this has to be forcing pass he is mininum with wasted values in hearts|pg||
nt|inquiry:  so 4@S is weaker than pass... he has to decide if he wants to double or bid 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: coffee time|pg||
nt|dburn: not much very exciting has been happening, but Nickell has gradually eked out a 21-IMP lead on this set and a 31-IMP lead overall|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: right Warren -- even in direct seat|pg||
nt|warrens:  Nickell will correct to the major (if my guess is correct)|pg||
nt|dburn: double by a passed hand often played as a four-card major and a longer minor - not sure what Katz and Nickell use|pg||
nt|jlall: i would be shocked by 3H...perhaps they just changed their system|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jlall: now we will see one main advantage of kickback|pg||
nt|dburn: good slam, this, and good effort by Hamman and Zia to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can also access voice without login using  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: ? jump to 4 h what do you do  he says jump to 3 is strong at least we on same page it may not be good|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe that, because otherwise Nickell would do what Warren suggests|pg||
nt|jlall: over 5S hampson can bid 5N|pg||
nt|jlall: showing the SK|pg||
nt|dburn: does this have to make on a spade lead?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: chunky NT|pg||
nt|dburn: or even without one - shift may be enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland  where did u see info about seating rights?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell: He denies 4S, 11-13|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jlall: greco does not care about the HQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: EW ACBL convention card   http://usbf.org/docs/2012usbc/acblcards/NickellKatz.bmp|pg||
nt|warrens:  playing precision, N is limited to 10, so I guess S decided not to push it.  a little surprising to me|pg||
nt|dburn: not at all sure what the bidding at the other table meant|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they can tap out declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfc: i could not see if he alerted this bid|pg||
nt|jlall: they must play something if they ask, sign off, and bid again|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: he really can not go down even getting @S wrong|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he guesses spades wrong he has to guess how to strip the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can't make it if he misguesses spades here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sominex|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss says he is so confused|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: its okay as long as you are not confused tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he is laughing at himself|pg||
nt|mcphee: i guess they can just return a trump to beat it if he gets it wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Howie you have 29 min for this and one other board|pg||
nt|robinswr: any return beats it if he misguess|pg||
nt|passell: a big swing on opening lead here against 3nt  a spade beats it a heart lets it make|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: i think they can beat this|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can tap in either round suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: you would think he will go right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I am still not out of the woods|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: how do i play it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss talking out loud to himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very jovial table|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes right you are because he is not able to play 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: opps good practice for tomorrow|pg||
nt|dburn: Zia led a diamond, Hamman continued the suit, Zia was in with @hK at trick three and... continued diamonds, and the angels wept|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfc: denied the q of hearts and bid 7 says Hampson -- cool|pg||
nt|jlall: lol|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|warrens:  at the other table, E psyched a precision @D|pg||
nt|jlall: i guess greco was just having fun|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|inquiry:  nickel made a nice duck here...but if fred guess right he makes an overtrick i think|pg||
nt|inquiry:  as he will turn to diamonds after this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: moss shows hand making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss I know you have 8 hearts and having hard time believing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlall: he asked for queen, heard no, and bid 7|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D lead in the other room make it easy to make this|pg||
pc|c4|nt|warrens:  a very amusing auction|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: but it looks as though Lall psyched 1@d in third chair and after that, everything went slightly haywire|pg||
nt|passell: the opening nt bidders range often determines the final contract  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|warrens:  down now on anything other than a @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: e/w can make a slam in heart though )|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  a @C discard won't help, since the defense will just switch to @C's|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|dburn: double was takeout, redouble may or may not have been hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|mc|9|nt|warrens:  XX of 1@D in other room definitely @H's|pg||
nt|dburn: Hamman knew his side could have the high-card values for 3NT, but he also knew his partner had at most three spades|pg||

nt|jlall: or maybe he just liked his partner having no HQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5s you 5N shows Spade K  yes answer|pg||
nt|ritong: he was aware about @s short anyways|pg||
nt|jlall: since it meant it wasnt wasted and partner had points elsewhere|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of Set 5 of 8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set|pg||
nt|dburn: so that suit was a big danger, and Hamman had no guarantee that his diamonds would be fast tricks|pg||
nt|passell: yes and the other room range was 14-16  likely 13 -16|pg||

nt|bigtrain: X can include 5+h GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: restart is about one hour|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for Greco, if double guarantees hearts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: 1C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|passell: they play the Meckwell stopperless nt here|pg||
nt|dburn: means he has to bid a stopperless 1NT to show some values (or pass and try to catch up)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bigtrain: pass = 0-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=1 major|pg||
nt|warrens:  this must show a pretty good hand at unfavorable |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is multi... 1 major|pg||
nt|petergill: The 11 imp swing on Bd 59 was mainly thanks to Bob Hamman bidding 4@S rather than 5@C chosen in a similar situation at this table. |pg||
nt|warrens:  so Moss must be thinking 2@S or 3@S|pg||

nt|bigtrain: restart at 4:45 eastern|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 65 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@C by North is a transfer to @D's, showing a limit or better raise of @S's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: perhaps 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: showing a good hand for @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: fred could not be more pleased, well unless it was 5@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - some (including perhaps Wolpert) might have taken the view that 2@d was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N [ostensibly] 14-16 not-vul    good 14-17 vul|pg||
nt|markf:  Allan, often pairs playing complex systems have not worked out many details, especially with intervention.|pg||
nt|ritong: other room will certainly overcall and raise @ss|pg||

pc|sA|nt|warrens:  good lead|pg||
nt|jlall: nickell is like secretariat, loves starting in a hole and digging out of it. already did it once this tournament (sorry warren)|pg||
nt|ritong: basic game try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one more set tonight and four tomorrow|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: it is going to play well|pg||
nt|warrens:  np :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman is 73 (or 74) years old. Aging does not seem to apply to his bridge. |pg||
nt|athene: south might now find a heart lead given 2@S shows heart support?|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|markf:  I think Moss should have bid more than 2@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  another swing to Nickell, so it'll be close for tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 64-19 set for Nickell|pg||
nt|markf:  Not that it would have mattered|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, 3NT is surely based on a good/running @c suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  Aging does affect Hamman.  He gets better!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event   shows schedule with viewer's local timezone|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia is 65. My source is the Bridge Encyclopedia. Meckwell are mid 50's. |pg||
nt|11jaszczak: lepiej jak w Polsce:)|pg||
nt|ritong: so, it is not clearcut that meck has a huge @s stopper|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|bigtrain: played 1-2-3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: unless they had the names wrong|pg||
nt|markf:  Moss had to bid 4@S to have an affect|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Jeff Meckstroth May 15, 1956;  Eric Rodwell May 1, 1957.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Gitelman asks show 0-5 Rodwell can't trap when we don't know your suit|pg||
nt|petergill: 21 imps away from the best birthday presents they could get|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@s here, I believe, is a range ask or clubs, now S has shown @C's + short @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showed a minimum with 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but, as can be seen from the actions on the last deal and this one, the Milner boys have started last-set-swinging early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final session scheduled to begin in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but players can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|dburn: imagine a heart lead to the queen, ducked, a heart back ducked, another heart - how's declarer doing?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably not quite well enough, but we can dream|pg||
nt|ritong: bid GAME TRY to make it|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@C sounds like a game try in @S's.  maybe too high now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: the dream is alive yet...|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy hand to make, but it will require some careful defense|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a hopeless contract, of course, but the defense has no idea what declarer has, and where there's ignorance there's hope|pg||
pc|hK|nt|inquiry:  i hear 4@C on board 14 in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: meckstroths not going down|pg||
nt|adonis18:  5 losers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: they are HOT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: last board of this set short break please come back to join us|pg||
nt|inquiry:  north at this table, fred gitelman for providing bbo for all o f us.... and the usbf for the exciting match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: teams can always agree to start earlier than shown on schedule  [except after long lunch break]|pg||
nt|dburn: in an ideal world the appeal (if there is one) would be held before the next set started, so that the players would know the score, but this is not such a world|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i dislike 4-card overcalls for this very reason|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good...|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that East-West use standard carding, so Katz (who played his low heart perforce, since he could not waste a high one) may have done a good thing thereby|pg||
nt|kit: Nickell knows something is funny with the 1 NT opening|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that East has so much that he can work out what North has in terms of high cards|pg||
nt|kit: He may be afraid declarer has AKQxxx of hearts and nothing else|pg||
pc|dT|nt|warrens:  a @C lead in the other room made this hand easier|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that easy to make this one|pg||
nt|jlall: yeah definitely down|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't know if there is any legitimate make now|pg||
nt|dburn: well, not definitely, but he will need to take some pretty good views|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director in --|pg||
nt|dburn: ah, maybe the Director knows how to make it - that should help|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 or imps away from the birthday present, I should say - now|pg||
nt|chip: Some comments that 4S is reasonable, and would probably make.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: 3NT far from ridiculous, of course - the diamonds might come in, after all, and that would give nine tops after the club lead|pg||
nt|jlall:  Very interesting set, thanks all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  defense needs to get @D's going |pg||
nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room on 118  but   congrats to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final also 2 days  120 boards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chip: 3N can be defeated if EW continue clubs now, but then switch. When W wins the a spade or D can play a club through again to set up 5 tricks.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  goodnight Debbie|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: fred and brad will leave the room with rounded shoulders, but the smile on their teammates faces should reassure them:)|pg||
nt|passell: a great match  I cant wait for the last quarter|pg||
pc|d8|nt|markf:  Bye all.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jlall: i am told gib could make it from there, i was still thinking about it double dummy! i assure you nothing single dummy would come close|pg||
nt|chip: A of spades and a club will probably get down 2 if declarer takes the D finesse.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jjsb:  tthank u very much ! |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: q of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: he worked it out - well done him|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly any normal line would fail - maybe he could have won the second spade in his hand and played a heart|pg||
nt|bobholl: DD a@S @D @C finesse @C ruffed with @S Q |pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfc: ahhahh|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all.  See you for sessions 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: Nickell still has problems -- he has to get out of his hand again somehow.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: if Nickel concludes his partner's card is queen of clubs singleton, he could do something very bad|pg||
nt|warrens:  N needs to play a low @C now for -1.  everything else is worse, I believe|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcphee: did they remind him @D were trump?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Moss's 2@S - pass or correct - implied better hearts than spades, so Gitelman was choosing between a @h and @DA and misguessed.  |pg||
nt|dburn: normally declarer would cash a high diamond first, but he does not have the entries to pick up @dQxxx with East|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: 12 away 42 left|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, Secretariat may be starting his move with that board - we shall soon see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: back in 10 minutes|pg||
nt|ritong: ah no|pg||
nt|ritong: was included|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more than 1 now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|markf:  Ralph hs created some problems for himself; allowing diamond discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all.  See you here in the last set.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
nt|dburn: so to play high would be a "danger play", losing to a small singleton with West|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks all |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: most probably this match will not continue see you later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  whoops|pg||
nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil: wow|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  ok, he can survive now|pg||
nt|warrens:  -1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|bt:  @S k will solv it|pg||
nt|bt:  solve|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Still has only a @h and a @s to lose.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  see you all soon|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Thanks all, see you for 4th session today and 1 and 4 tomorrow.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks will see you after the break for the second set of the finals of the USBD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: USBC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 11 min still in the set and probably 15 min break restart at 12:25 chicago time|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Fernando Lema sent me:  http://csbnews.org/usbc-final-time/?lang=en|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: night all|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@s overcall worked better than 2@s as it allowed NS to find their @h fit - but one always wants to overcall the strong club as high as possible - so 2@S was normal over the strong ...|pg||
nt|petergill: club. |pg||
