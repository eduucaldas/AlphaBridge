nt|pjs_ch:  but didn't make it|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|pjs_ch:  the 3@D opener here is a transfer pre-empt, showing a hand that for most people would be a 3@H opener|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pjs_ch:  the auction started naturally, and will probably be the same here, with 1@H-1@S-2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pjs_ch:  and then N had to decide between simple preference to 2@H and a jump to 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pjs_ch:  the hand is better than it might be, but not as much extra as some would want for 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  even with 3@H as encouragement it's hard to see why SOuth bid 4@H in theother room over the same start as here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pjs_ch:  making 3@H might need some help but it is not impossible|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the lead is good in one way, that it takes a trump from dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|pjs_ch:  but it might make it impossibel for West to lead another one|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the spade suit has possibilities if declarer decides not to go for club ruffs|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  Good evening; first board here of set two of the match between Wales  & Ireland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|pjs_ch:  Ireland started rather well and are 37 imps ahead|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|pjs_ch:  this is, I believe, the first in Internaitonal bridge for Di Kurbalija and Liz Commins|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petepunt: welcome back|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzec: South can lead 7@D then underlead AKQJT clubs...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: even with @D ruff seems ok.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|4D|an|!|nt|yorkbeach:  deep finesse would find @dA, @druff @c9 @druff tio beat 4@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4@d looks like a fit showing jump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with only 3@s, North should X rather than bid on|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Woodruff can play her lowest @c at trick one to show diamond values rather than heart values|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|pjs_ch:  here the points are all with EW and they have enough to justify bidding game|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  Kirby & Kenny play 5 cd majors and a strong NT, so this 2N bid shows weak NT values|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  and AK of hearts and AK of clubs to go with one spade trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pjs_ch:  with weaker spades - K765 rather than K875 declarer would be in trouble |pg||
