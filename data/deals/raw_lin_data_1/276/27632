nt|paulg:  yes, awkward hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when 2@d can contain some fairly strong hands|pg||
nt|idc: Raising @h on the first round silly with those spades and after 2@d, your hand has improved|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch currently happy that she passed 3@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  may win the @hQ and lead a spade to the king|pg||
