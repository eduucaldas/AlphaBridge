mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  though if you open 1@c and reverse, partner may expect you to have more in your suits|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so nothing perfect|pg||

nt|paulg:  hi MIke|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  both pairs play 4-card suits and weak notrump, but the Welsh play some unusual two bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  current scores and all the info you need available from http://ladymilne.sbueast.org.uk/matches.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: The good news for SBU vs England is that we replaced the screen during the break, so hopefully less (non bridge) excitement for them this session|pg||
nt|mamos:  Scotland the holders of the trophy have some catching up to do|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  East can either bid a natural 2@s or 2@d showing spades and another|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mamos:  West may try to play in seconf suit now|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, especially as 4-5 is likely|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  i expected 2NT rather than 3@c  |pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: misunderstanding here re 3@c - 2@d was spades and a minor|pg||

nt|paulg:  hard for Liz McGowan to work out that a diamond ruff is needed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes defence needs 4 trump tricks plus @dA|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as she will not have been told that 3@c was pass and correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: West told South was p/c, but East described 3@c to play|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3@c presumably pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  in other words East passes if her second suit is clubs|pg||

nt|mamos:  claiming down one apparently  :(|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if she miscounted trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: i didn't hear - all tables playing same board at same time, so discussion needs to be hushed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|vugraphzbu: N and S studing EW xconv card|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|mamos:  Well that wasan awkward looking board for EW  but they seemed to have slightly fortunately stopped in a contract that could have made|pg||
mb|2H|an|  |mb|p|mb|2S|an| |nt|paulg:  i presume Kurbalija is showing a balanced 21-22 points here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  After 2@D response and 2N rebid I believe they play 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: East has bid some number of NT, but i can't see the number|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  This is Kokish 2@H, West bids 2@S and East a natural 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|an| |mb|p|mb|3S|an| |nt|mamos:  I think 2NT 21-22|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Enquiry and 3@S shows, I believe 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: thank you for expalining Patrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|paulg:  these auctions can get quite confusing now, what is a cue bid and what is a natural minor suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  The cards lie incredibly well for declarer with north unable to overruff dummy in clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mamos:  i think they will bid slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos:  hehe|pg||
nt|mamos:  dooooh|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  12 tricks likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  a tough area for a new partnership|pg||
nt|mamos:  I think Patrick is right  the auction was rather ambiguous|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: North has called director|pg||
nt|paulg:  Commins is worth a try but, opposite 21-22, does not want to force to slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Only 20 HCP between the two hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: ah South has led out of turn - cos West is declarer even tho East has the spades|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  but is south's card visible?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: bbo software doesn't allow for leads from wrong hand so i may have to wait for all 4 cards to be played before i can put them in|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting call for the TD, since South has led out of turn but West has incorrectly lifted the screen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: 7@d on table|pg||
nt|mamos:  this may have been accepted|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: 6@d sorry - now a pen card - Q@h leaad from N|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think this means that both pairs are to blame, but Mike is probably the expert|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzbu: so bbo allows me to lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|mamos:  if West had raised the screen I think Paul is right  but South may have done it all herself|pg||
