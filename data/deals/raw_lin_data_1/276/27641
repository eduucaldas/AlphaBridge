mb|1H|nt|pdjourdain:  And Scotland "A", the holders, lost surprisingly to the "B" team|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Scotland lost heavily to the SBU. They will have to do well from here to retain the Lady Milne.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  Aida Aris sitting West for Wales with Linda Greenland East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the SBU team played well in the warm up matches that I saw|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Both pairs are playing acol with a weak NT.|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  West could have tried 3NT|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:  If West had knocked out @DA first on a spade lead 3NT makes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  for many pairs 3Nt would not be natural after 1@h-3@h but I suspect it would for this pair|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pdjourdain:  Playing 4-card majors 3NT should be natural|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  Meanwhile, in 3@H the trumps break 4-1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  two ways of beating 4@h, either initial club lead or spade lead and diamond back ducked|pg||
nt|iain sime: I assume 3@H was a limit raise; if so West has made a very conservative pass. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes I do not think I would ever decide my hand is too good for a weak NT but then pass a limit raise|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  club back stil good enough to beat 4@h I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|iain sime: Easy ten tricks now.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now can draw the last trump and play in NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|pdjourdain:  4@H always likely to fail missing three aces and either a club or control|pg||
