mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  West takes advatange of the favourable vulnerability to show both her suits|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  the SBU team comprises the pairs that finished 457 in the Scottish trials|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  nobody can accuse NS of underbidding here|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: This is a contract with limited HCP which may well have chances (does have chances)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed - with the minor suit honours in the East hand and the @hA in the West hand|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|yorkbeach:  correct for East to cover the @d because North might have held 10xx|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Has to play a @S now to play a club up|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: England also made 650 in 4@S on b3, so that one is a push|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  an initial spade lead might have been more testing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  often a difficult decision to decide whether to lead the suit in which might is more likely to have 5 or whether to lead the suit in which you have more help|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in which partner is more likely to have 5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|d9|pg||
