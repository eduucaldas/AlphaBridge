nt|fabsayc: assuming that is splinter agreeing diamonds|pg||

nt|me argent: jacobus couldnt help himself and who can blame him?|pg||
nt|harmon: this is getting ugly now|pg||
nt|kareno: I think even if Zia led the @h 10 as suggested by specs, that a duck will defeat the hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: making or makeable is the same with hamman|pg||
nt|kareno: He is a wizard with the cards.  |pg||
nt|kareno: I predict he will work out the diamond suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he looked underwhelmed by the dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: It would be a phantom save (as a spec suggests) if Bob doesn't make it but I think he will.|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: what transfer system do they play here that they may forget|pg||
nt|kareno: In the expert community the range for 2nt opener has expanded to include a good 19.|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|mittmouse: i think 2h may show clubs|pg||
nt|mittmouse: 1 of the majors shows clubs and the other is diamonds 3c is not forcing|pg||
nt|harmon: maybe 4d over 2n would help|pg||
nt|harmon: dunno their system tho|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 38 imps in 3 boards may be some kind of record|pg||
nt|kareno: The match has really tightened up.|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: will west take the dive over 4@Ss?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: another possible but failing slam|pg||
nt|kareno: That Benito would disapprove of :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: no one is asking about or providing explanation for 2s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: forcing to game Karen|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: i think it showed 4h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, i think we saw something like this before, relays to show openers exact shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that's what it looked like he said but maybe im wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: Practical bid by Landen who has two suits to worry about.  A more natural auction would have led to the same contract this time.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfe: 6 h promised in this auction wold said|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: If it's 2-way new minor then what could 2@s mean?  In any event they are where I thought they would end up.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: 1nt isn't a typo|pg||

nt|fabsayc: double shows spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: "that's it?" wold says|pg||
nt|kareno: So east could have five spades for that double - then 1@s makes more sense to me.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: If you don't like north's play, consider that he needed eight tricks and he guaranteed them.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: for those of you who have asked we have repeatedly been booted|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kareno: In the CR, 3@h was some sort of spade raise showing four trumps - I don't know their system.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfe: and have had major connection problems|pg||
pc|sA|nt|me argent: hard to prevent NS from talking 8 tricks despite the vicous trump break|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: this is makeable by the mundane line of drawing trumps and setting up the diamonds |pg||
nt|harmon: that would stop the bleeding with 8 imps|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, presumably that is what will happen.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: zia is asking about their signals|pg||
nt|kareno: How did 4 go down two in the CR?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they lead 3rd/lowest/udca|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would expect her to take one more ruff after cashing 2 @d's (no finesse)|pg||
nt|warrens:  then try for 2 trump tricks at the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: melzer takes out spade puts it back takes it out again puts it back|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well done for maximum defensive tricks -- if Wold continues @H  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HJ does confuse the issue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but would Jacobus play @H10 from 109xx in a cashout situation??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Would Jacobus have shifted to the heart ten from T952? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: oops, you got there first :)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|kareno: Krekorian trying for a defense against 4@s but his partner may trick him.  Happily diamonds outrank clubs.|pg||
nt|mittmouse: nice bid although a c ruff just loses the c trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: hard for EW to avoid making 3nt here|pg||
nt|harmon: Zia can make by guessing spades except on club return|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5S|nt|mittmouse: y this a next hand at this game but exciting at bd a match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: due to flakey connection we lost results on earlier boards I will post them when I have a minute|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Needs club back to defeat it if declarer works out trumps.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then if he wins ace and finesses spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not exactly obvious though|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, even with diamond return there will be a promotion in hearts.|pg||
nt|harmon: Wouldve put Wold to the test|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on closer analysis you must indeed start spades from dummy |pg||
nt|fabsayc: if queen wins you finesse, if ducked you drop it next round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|me argent: west showing big hand in the context of a non @C opening|pg||

nt|kareno: South has values but no good way to get into the auction.|pg||
nt|henryb:  A bid by North is, in my humble opinion, taking the balancing mania a little far|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Nice auction in the CR for slam - let's see if Wold/Bates can get there as well.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|me argent: forcing @C passed out in CR|pg||
nt|kareno: No one can complain about south's tempo so north is on his own.  He knows Steve Landen has values but bidding is pretty extreme.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: as seen by auction in other room   [of course that 1@D was natural]|pg||
mb|p|nt|kittyc: interesting to bid a 3 card major, is that systemic or just Jacobus creativity|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it's allowed by system -- hand that doesn't want to bid 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After Sutherlin's pass, Wold took 6@s out of his bidding box and put it on the tray - the other side stared at it and then started to laugh|pg||
