nt|mdgraham: As pointed out, surprisingly low total trick count there - combined trumps 21  |pg||
nt|oleberg: (As you can all plainly see, I am well versed in trying to defend bids like 2@H)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: or bid 5@S and danger to -50 - 4@S is practical bidding - I knpw not your style, Ole :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yet the trick count (on perfect defence) is only 18. Where's Larry Cohen?|pg||
nt|oleberg: In america I believe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I expect there are some Necessary Adjustments to be made somewhere.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jron: you can read the book of Lawrence and Wirgren and get an explanation|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C = Bergen - 9-11|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have it|pg||
nt|jron: single @h opp single xx@s opp two etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 3@c explained by S to W: "I think it shows single @c --- if N wasnt a passed hand it would have been @s-limit" |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: reckon South will just bid 4@S now - needs a perfect hand for slam |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: all the ajustments = a try to prove that the LAW work on hands where the LAW is wrong :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the Law does seem to fail on hands like that (big fit hands) but on the smaller deals it works fine |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: "Dont we play Reversed Drury" asks S ---- "No - we have dropped that" is the answar|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and quite right too|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cute position in the spade suit. If South leadds them first, she would have to start with the jack  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: yes -- eighter good bridge -- or easy boards :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I remember an 8-board set once where the score was 0-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: yesterday we had one session of 8 boards where the first 6 boards ended 0-0|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|pelu: some would open in N - and get problems - |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: not an enormously good idea, vulnerable facing a passed partner |pg||

nt|vugraphzwg: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: discussing if 5c could be a winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: short break - players want coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Grove is not pleased with himself - he say he knew it was right to let s8 run at the last board:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: players back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello: Dahl is a conservativ bidder , but|pg||
nt|thorvald: Just tell him it was unmakeable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|thorvald: On the south hand you would like to bid 2,5 @S here, in OR South settled for 2QS|pg||
nt|dkkello: even he open this one a spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwg: he still thinks he could make it|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|thorvald: I don't like the NS bidding, but hard to EW to double|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|dkkello: Grove and I will overrule GIB when we have a chance to look at it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thorvald: But this might bring Iversen in the lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: Until now this session have seen a lot of small pickups from Iversen, so they will be in the lead after this session|pg||
nt|dkkello: Norris is a strong man , since he could bid 3 NT i think |pg||
nt|thorvald: Are NS switched or did you correct that Peter ?|pg||
nt|dkkello: Dahl did pass over 1 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Perhaps he thougth Dahl had better cards for his 3c? Though with better cards he had probably doubled 1nt|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pelu: thid sh also be a flat board in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: You dont know Iversen|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: i wonder if East will splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h is brave|pg||
nt|pelu: yes I do - I have played with him 2-3 years :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|oleberg: the 2@H and 5@H shouldn't be a surprice|pg||

nt|pelu: after the @S-lead = 500/450 = max 2 IMP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: needed @DJ at trick 1. Far too obscure, holding @SKQ|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-lead and @D-ruff - but only if West open 1@C|pg||

nt|dkkello: tuf 2 @H from Iversen at the other table here|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: And what do you think about this 3@H ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Starting time after lunch could be 20 min. earlier than scheduled. Because of snow TD try to make it go faster|pg||
