mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kareno: Club game on a diamond guess.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: not zia's style to use a 2-suited gadget on that hand even if he had one available|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: he doesn't like telling everyone what he has :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt from south now|pg||
nt|athene: unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he doesn't want to bid 5@D because it's hard for partner to bid 5@C over that|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, some diamond ruffs possible.  If north chooses diamonds that won't be good either|pg||
nt|kareno: 4nt showing 2 places to play.|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty nice hand |pg||
nt|athene: but in this situation you allow for partner to have stretched if he is short in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Now Zia should be getting the picture of south's hand.|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know whether north will go for clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he takes a very long time about it zia might well work out what is going on and diagnose the diamond void opposite|pg||
nt|athene: of course 4nt just shows clubs and a red suit; might not be diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: The tournament schedule is available at www.acbl.org|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think south should just bid 5@H with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: because you might be way better off in clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: as a spectator points out, zia might lead the @SK against 5@C and if so i guess hamman will have to work out which spade says "i have a diamond void!"|pg||
nt|athene: if north wants to play clubs he bids 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, Zia took that long to pass|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to play in south's red suit he bids 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: and south corrects if he actually has hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, Zia took that long to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: no lightner double from Hamman!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: back door route to normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: apparently didnt have to |pg||
nt|kareno: Zia has it worked out though.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: i know rosenberg used to "complain" that zia routinely would not make lightner doubles for fear of pushing opps into 6nt or something - if he had a void he expected rosenberg to ...|pg||
nt|athene: find it unaided|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: it looks as though zia-hamman have the same philosophy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Or not ...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|athene: ok :) zia might still have the same philosophy but hamman takes the obvious route|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry, we had a bit of a disconnect with our modem here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|warrens:   this should be -1 quickly|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: NS won't feel exactly happy with -800 but disaster might overtake their counterparts in the other room too|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: Is not clear if the double was lightner or simply penalty|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: perhaps it was both :) |pg||
nt|athene: "lead my void pd, and we can get a big penalty"|pg||

mb|r|an|game try|mb|p|nt|athene: you would have to lead a heart honour from hand rather than playing ace and another|pg||
nt|athene: also lead a club to the queen then duck one|pg||
nt|athene: none of that is really suggested by the takeout double of 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: clearly the only way they are going to get to 4@H is if north bids it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S could get killed with diamond ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but hard to penalize partscores when neither defender has a real trump stack|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||

nt|athene: hard for declarer to pick the club position|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|athene: the only way he might get it right is if he decides that east would have bid 3@D with five|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: so west is more likely 4-3-4-2 than 4-3-3-3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer can't be certain about the @HK yet but i think west is likely to have that|pg||
nt|athene: with @DKQ he would prefer that opening lead rather than a spade from the unsupported king|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: and so he really needs the @HK to make up a double |pg||

nt|me argent: NS have to avoid poor 4@Hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: only you would bid it Joey|pg||
mb|2H|nt|me argent: we shall c|pg||
nt|poohbear: but you prob make it :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not so fast, G might also|pg||
mb|2N|nt|me argent: no fear wallace|pg||
nt|poohbear: we will see how much credibility North puts into a favorable 2@h bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|poohbear: ALOT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: this will make if South guesses @cs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|me argent: with only 2@Hs in his hand guerstman didnt want to get involved wit doubling|pg||
nt|me argent: he wont be happy when he sees wests overcall|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|athene: i guess lead of the king would ask for unblock|pg||
nt|athene: and clearly north's diamonds aren't strong enough for that|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer can take 5@h tricks 2@s 1@d and if he guesses to play a @C the Q and ducks on the way back . Thats 10|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT is highly aggressive to be politically correct|pg||
nt|me argent: west has certainly heping landen in the play|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  if declarer plays a low @D, East has to duck|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: diamond back after the @SA, and zia has to use his @CA to finesse spades, so there's no chance of any cute endplay stuff on north|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: it was a bit odd to play @CK second round of the suit|pg||
nt|athene: did he really do that?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: after you lead to the @CQ and it holds, you sort of duck the next one don't you?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: South is a she|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: they brought 4@H home in the other room - but it was much easier to get the hearts right because west bid 2nt rather than doubling|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: you don't really want ruffs with that trump holding|pg||

nt|poohbear: I was just wondering about the length of the match. Screens usually add 15-30 min for the session|pg||
nt|poohbear: they are|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Tudor suggests that he would have scored the club J if Wallace hadn't led them - Gerstman, laughing, says that Landen would have hooked Tudor for the diamond J - Tudor: "but I ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: played the Q" Gerstman and Landen together "but she played the K" |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: people used to open 1@C on that shape in the late jurassic period|pg||
nt|athene: then they realised that clubs are a minor suit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: I still do :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: so do I:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how many years ago is that :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|poohbear: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: great false  card!|pg||
nt|me argent: north might get into trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Gerstman also said "nice play" to Landen right after the hand - the diamond off dummy made it hard on Tudor|pg||
nt|poohbear: easy 4@s contract here with the @c Q falling|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: your all dinasors |pg||
nt|me argent: not so easy 6@Ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: despite losing 2@s tricks declarer can pitch @d losers on @hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: you'd make it Joey :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: but there is a chance declarer pitches @cs on a non @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5-0 trump break is just a little too much to handle|pg||
nt|athene: north is actually almost endplayed here|pg||
nt|sybarra: there she is again! Caitlin    should I gag?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: with such lousy pointed suit cards landen should sign off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: so may still need to guess @ds|pg||
pc|cK|nt|me argent: good auction to a good contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: north doesn't want to allow zia to throw a second heart on a diamond but presumably south gave count at trick 1?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|poohbear: Do we agree with this lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S i can handle :), higher i will leave to barry and joey|pg||
nt|poohbear: looking at 2 likely natural trump tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only suit tricks can disappear in on this auction, so reasonable lead|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|me argent: i like it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: south showed 1 or 3 hearts, zias cue bid tells which, so defense not difficult|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in this sort of position you can lead clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: through south|pg||
nt|kareno: In this  case, count and attitude same thing.  I don't give count with Q in dummy, just attitude.  Count at 5 lev el or higher though.|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that if he ruffs he is ruffing a loser|pg||

nt|athene: but i guess 11 hcp as opposed to 14 is the difference between a pass and a slightly off-shape t/o double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west might double, but the shape isn't ideal|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: you probably have about the same expectation from defending 2@H as playing a borderline 3nt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: 2@H should go two down |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: diamond ruff is the obvious route|pg||
nt|athene: although east can't be certain his partner has the @DA so @DK now isn't trivial to find|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: if you knew that north was a person who never opened a weak-2 with two aces outside his suit, the @DK would be a bit easier to find|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: but as a spectator points out, the ruff isn't really necessary - if the defence just force, declarer can't keep trump control and set up his diamonds|pg||

nt|athene: but when a defender in 4@S is endplayed with the fifth defensive winner, it's not such a huge victory for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyone who thinks the Seniors events are pianolas to win should check the bracket sheets - they're tough!!|pg||
nt|me argent: an agressive vul 2@Hs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: a "weak"-2|pg||
nt|kareno: Obviously not a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost intermediate?|pg||
nt|poohbear: i like it. Pure hand good @h spots|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess they play 2major 9-12 and multi for the rubbish|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|me argent: will gerstman show his age?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite common these days|pg||
nt|kareno: I would think that north hand a little strong for that bid.|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be worse if had more points with scattered jacks and Qs in short suits|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now was time for 2nt|pg||
nt|me argent: nah he will do just fine here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: it's sad when you can't bid at favourable on a nice 6-5-2-0|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: Good sniffer, Nader Hanna!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|athene: discarding preserves west's chances of making three trump tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just playing technically correct|pg||

nt|athene: i guess 4@C might make it hard for EW to sort out their major-suit fits|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: as it happens they can't go wrong but it would be easy to imagine layouts where they got into a 4-3 fit rather than a 4-4 fit now|pg||
nt|athene: for example if east doubles again with a strong hand with 4-3 majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: north thinks there is good chance of finding his partner with a singleton diamond, on the bidding|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: so on that basis he might get the @SQ wrong - but 4@C on a balanced hand is perhaps more likely without TWO side queens|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh im glad i looked in here|pg||
nt|athene: when north, having made a fit jump, shows up with 3 diamonds, he can only have one spade|pg||
nt|kareno: Nine more boards to go, folks.  It ain't over yet but that's a demoralizing blow.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade guess needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south really should not duck there|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|athene: but maybe he was taken in by yet another grosvenor - thinking that with his actual hand hamman would surely cash the @SA to take advantage of the pitch on the diamond|pg||

nt|athene: there is a case for south grabbing the ace anyway because if declarer had @CQ10x, two clubs can go on the hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but south might have been thinking that declarer might want to use the hearts for diamond discards if he just had three or four small hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yet another possibility is that NS might play coded nines and tens in which case the @C9 could be @CQ109|pg||

mb|1N|an|f1|mb|2D|nt|athene: you might double here with south i suppose|pg||

nt|poohbear: 8xx of @hs would slow me down AlOT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but with three spades there is less reason to be aggressive; with a doubleton i certainly would|pg||
nt|me argent: good point|pg||
nt|poohbear: Gerstman doessnt even GF the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now|pg||
nt|poohbear: TO dbl now could be bloody|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: the logic being that you know partner is short in spades so if you have game on he is surely doing something himself|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@C bid, is both underbid and distorts the shape|pg||
nt|athene: south now wondering whether to bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont like double its likely to get usn overboard|pg||
nt|me argent: holding bad trumps is not a time for agression|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lestergold: if north cannot reopen if 2@s is passed round to him, then were are we likely to be going?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 3@C is right the double is not, but they may survive|pg||
nt|athene: north needs the diamonds to run and some quick tricks from partner, on a spade lead, for 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite a lot to ask from a passed hand|pg||

mb|r|mb|p|nt|athene: if south has @SJ10x then north wants to declare 3nt|pg||
nt|poohbear: they must be 5-0 since the defense has no HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|athene: but if south has the @SQ he has to play it|pg||
nt|kareno: WAIT Zia didn't bid that|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s i do not like at all he either has to pass or try 3n himself not likely to find partner with additional fortification in @s|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D from zia? probably not, no, near the end of a match he is winning|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume north has settled in 4@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: North must be pleased to see partner dbl 5@cs|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|athene: the hearts set up with only one ruff|pg||

nt|athene: you just have to guess the trumps don't you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/4 fit a combined 28 good controls yes but its a very thin 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if north hand is tapped would seem too much to do|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: yes but north won't get forced until trick 13|pg||
nt|athene: and since you have to ruff a heart in the south hand it's natural to play west for the long clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: sensible stop 5@c altho as rthey are trailing there was an arguiment for trying the slam|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt also would depend on picking the club suit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he may play this as cross ruff, that can work also since zia follows to everything|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|athene: 4@H bid and made on 61 just finishes things|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: that was the one with the weak-2 where you need the really nice diamond layout when the defence attack the spades|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't see 18 IMPs on this board.|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: EW don't have many points but they have a 5-4 spade fit and some shape|pg||
mb|r!|an|3 !hs|nt|athene: that's usually all you need to bid game|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hamman knows his fifth spade is enormous now|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well bid, thanks everybody, and congrats to those easterners for maintaining Lord Grey's cup|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|athene: hamman doesn't cash @SAK because if trumps ARE 3-1 he really doesn't want to allow the defenders to draw a third round|pg||
nt|athene: the hand could fall apart very badly if that happened|pg||
nt|athene: also if diamonds break badly he might be trying to limit the damage|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: normally with this suit you want to finesse the ten first just in case south has @DQJx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: but that is only in a vacuum|pg||
nt|athene: often there are tactical considerations which make it better to just lead to the king|pg||
nt|kareno: They can take three tricks now but that is all.|pg||
nt|athene: for example the possibility of a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but hamman doesn't mind losing @DA, diamond ruff because now the trumps are coming in|pg||
nt|kareno: Congratulations to Meltzer and especially to Bob Hamman for that spectacular hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our wonderful Operator for a job very well done!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer in the other room faced much the same decision and cashed one trump then led to the @DK, so 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to the specs for keeping us awake :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Board 55 for those who missed it.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|nt|me argent: alas EW have but 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|poohbear: 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|poohbear: so a pretty tight match except for one board. ( as Harry put it )|pg||
