mb|1D|an|!|mb|3D|an|!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East Passes 1@c with an eye on the vulnerablity - that @s suit is moth-eaten|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welxom back|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads a nice-looking @s but North's spots are a mood-dampener|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can count 3@c, 2@s, 2@d, 2@h for 9 minimum|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|c9|nt|djneill:  there is a small clue that the @dQ is offsides -if East had @sKJxxx  @hxx  @dQxx @cAxx for example they might have overcalled 1@s|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|djneill:  nifty, East does not cash the @s, wow, there must have been a clue somewhere - otherwise it looks pretty odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  North delays the moment of truth in @d, also in case East has both the @dT and @d9 (the 8 forces the Queen)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: N in tank |pg||
nt|djneill:  North really wanted East to play spades, Chan made a great switch!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|djneill:  perhaps West gave a Smith signal in @c (showing dislike for @s)|pg||

nt|djneill:  had the @dQ been onside the actual "endplay" would have been down one - North read those defensive cards perfectly|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Appreciation goes out to those commentating. |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bucheister: you are the one doing all the work|pg||
nt|djneill:  West trots out the Multi 2@d, showing a preempt in a major, probably spades but I'mnot sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|qba2:  can you put just the surnames in - forget the christian names.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: tricky hand to play|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if defense puts on pressure|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  North does not have a "cards" double of 2@d (13-15 bal) available so Passes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugrapha1: apologies, lost play|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's right john it worked out very well, how often do you buy it at 2@s when the opponents have 24 HCP|pg||
nt|bucheister: most likely down one but the defense must be careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: Certainly not a text book weak two but still effective.|pg||
nt|djneill:  this 24 HCP though is a bad mesh, does not do very well in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2@h response was pass/correct, and West is supposed to Pass with @h, or bid @s with @s|pg||
nt|bucheister: North might have upgraded that hand to  15 and bid 2nt and that would have led to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  mm, closer to a downgrade than an upgrade, the red Queens are as defenseless as a baby in the blitz|pg||

nt|fugitiv: east hand getting squeezed first|pg||
nt|t 2: not hard for S to pitch spade on the auction right? |pg||
nt|fugitiv: he should play for north to have the hearts in which case he could make on a double squeeze, if he'd cashed his ac|pg||
nt|fugitiv: sure|pg||
nt|fugitiv: he knows partner has nothing in high cards too|pg||
nt|fugitiv: Since Henbest had 1 point less than he should have|pg||
nt|t 2: yep |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: thinking here|pg||
nt|fugitiv: I guess hes thinking could declarer have KTx AKQ AJ left|pg||
nt|lethal666: he knows east is 2/2 in spades and D & has AJxxx Clubs now... so he cant let go a heart|pg||
nt|lethal666: he would have probably chosen 6S|pg||
nt|lethal666: if he had KTx|pg||
nt|fugitiv: sure |pg||
nt|lethal666: Depends after 4 days of play and 32 + boards into today, whether he is still sharp|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: glasses off and cards on the table|pg||

mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: maybe 4N instead of 5D|pg||

nt|djneill:  4@s-X on a 4-1 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  it is possible that North wanted to open 1NT, but was constrained by the system, if they play the same as East-West, we now can see that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  North would never rebid 1NT with so strong a hand in a strong NT system, since it would show 12-14 HCP|pg||

nt|lethal666: Yes|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|djneill:  2@c natural and limited, so North can't just assume E-W have game and bid @d|pg||

nt|djneill:  the chances of an 8 card suit WITHOUT the top 3 honors is very small|pg||

nt|djneill:  rising with the @hA would work if diamonds are not so wild, but the problem with that is it turns into a crossruff and I don't think that North being short in hearts will let that work|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||

mb|1N|nt|djneill:  e.g. X = 15+, 2@c = majors, 2@d = one major, 2M = 5M + 4+m would not allow South to show 5@d-4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: plausible alternative auction: 1C-1N-3N, making on double spades hook if W views it|pg||

nt|marlowepi: still 1N does seem just a trifle unabitious with 2C HCP...|pg||

nt|djneill:  ouch, setting up a @h for North, but the @dJ is always onside anyways|pg||
pc|hT|nt|djneill:  I think West should have used 2@c Stayman but it is definitely rational to play 1NT with that honor structure|pg||
nt|djneill:  longest and strongest strikes North and South is thinking of how to get down 2 out of this after 5@d-2@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  if 1NT is 11-14, then North is now marked for 0-3 more HCP, so if South chooses to exit passively it could mean 7 black tricks for East so South will definitely cash out|pg||

nt|djneill:  South probably should have bid 2@c, but sometimes that helps them reevaluate to push to a major game, who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: probably a help suit game try|pg||
nt|djneill:  nothing like a KQJxxx(x) suit to tell the opponents they have nothing wasted with a singleton|pg||

mb|3N|nt|rodal f: 6@H havw a chance by a triple @D hook|pg||

mb|p|pc|h6|nt|frankaus: @S $ @H squeese may work here|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Final segment will not start before 4.00pm due to slow play|pg||

nt|djneill:  overtaking clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  other room here, West opened 4@s, and North.... bid 5@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  will Hollands do the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|fugitiv: in reality its hard to see NS bidding game |pg||
mb|1D|nt|fugitiv: though they are at fav|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  again the 3 cards in @s is a dampener|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fugitiv: also it goes off on good defence|pg||
nt|djneill:  North may just take the money here, going for 800 hoping slam is not on|pg||
nt|djneill:  but there won't be a lot in the money sack when he opens it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|!|nt|djneill:  uh oh, the double gives North a peek into the @d break|pg||
mb|p|nt|fugitiv: more imps for adelaide|pg||
mb|p|nt|fugitiv: who have played well this set|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|djneill:  Hocking's previous double actually didn't gain a lot, as the contract was the same at the other table, it was rather the great defense|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fugitiv: Popp was very close to making 4sx on 13 and misguessed the ending|pg||
nt|fugitiv: having played the hand well until that point|pg||
nt|djneill:  and this double will not gain a lot either, in fact it may gain a very very negative number|pg||
