nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamman commented that 5@c wasn't very good - it was -1 after the diamond worked :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|caitlin: so close to a slam but @DK offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = game forcing|pg||
nt|caitlin: now I play once a 2/1 3@C does NOT show extras|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia has the 4@h card out but hasn't actually put it on the tray yet - sort of thinking about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was just going to poll Caitlin and Jan -- do you use 2@H or 2N as the catchall rebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: if you don't play the way I do (and many don't) N has to rebid a five card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I have a friend who has been experimenting with a flip-flop where 2@H=catchall and 2N=6+@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hamman explains that 4@h is sort of a picture bid; Zia says "it's a medium slam try" Hamman: "he should have about 20 HCPs and a void in hearts"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: later in the week when scoring is BAM  Hamman line probably very different from what we'll see tonight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I always think you can learn a lot by trying to figure out what an expert like Hamman is thinking about - what things is he worrying about or planning for or??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're trying to compare results from the Lynch-Dovell match   Don't Bother   we're playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Looks like 5 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 spade and at least 1 diamond - is he deciding whether to go for diamonds splitting or hook the ten (after all, most W's would duck the K with the Ax ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: or Axx, but couldn't with stiff A)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, the room is too small to play the same boards in all the matches. Tomorrow we'll have the same boards in both semi-final matches|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|4C!|an|fit-showing|nt|caitlin: Can you imagine how much bridge these folks play....first seniors, then main event both gruelling|pg||
mb|4D|nt|caitlin: I like fsj=fit showing jumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Actually, the Seniors is much less grueling than the alternative of 2 days of matchpoint pairs and 2 days of BAM and then 3 days of Blue Ribbon matchpoint pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with Said's raise the @D shortness is implied|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: must have 4 of pd's trumps and decent 5-card outside suit which doesn't help N at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Siebert asks about Hamman's DBL and Hamman makes a throat cutting gesture :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sure the @C suit helps -- takes care of @S losers|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that Hamman comment reminds me of scene from movie Meatballs.    Coach, we're down 60 points at the half and our 2 best players are injured.  What are we going to do???|pg||
