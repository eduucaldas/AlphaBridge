mb|1H|mb|p|nt|caitlin: greetings|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good evening, ekeblad-rubin use custom system with canape|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not sure why the jump|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: looks like a trump lead destroys this contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S always less than game force, usually 4+@S, but maybe 3@S in hand that doesn't want to respond 1N|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks al, well done keeping up with this system|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Good evening all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I think 3@D would have cancelled game force|pg||

nt|djneill:  2@s appears to be a kind of Third Suit forcing, semi-natural, perhaps 3@d would have been nonforcing, and 2NT without a @c stopper risky|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: hmmm   i thought he'd take the @C finesse    hard to see 10 tricks without @CK onside|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very natural auction|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|chilloncan: top of the evenings ladies & gents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe fall of @D10 means that suit is source of extra tricks|pg||

nt|othered1: rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Hello all from Orlando.|pg||
nt|caitlin: so close to slam but @DK off|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, Team Dovell had a pretty nice lead at half, 43 imps, but Team Lynch has recovered almost all of that.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|othered1: I'm not familiar with the Dovell team, as I don't get around much anymore.   Can anyone fill me in?|pg||

nt|kareno: 5@d a great contract and 3nt should be fine as well.  6@d won't fetch.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure I love bidding 3 nt with qj tight |pg||
nt|othered1: What was 3@S, just a stall?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I guess it was some sort of cuebid.|pg||
nt|othered1: trying to right-side 3N doesn't make a lot of sense.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|kareno: If  east ducks this then the club trick goes away.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: North could just as easily have just bid 3nt with both black suits stopped.  |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: auction almost too delicate|pg||
nt|kareno: So it'll  be a couple of IMPs to Lynch and a tighter match yet.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|djneill:  North may have doubled but chose 1@s|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is the only forcing bid in Ultimate Canape   approx 17+ hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S is undoubtedly worried about a medium swing away, but partner does not rate to be top of range|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: N might promote some 7 counts at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with spades when the 5 card suit here is so good and the hearts so bad|pg||
nt|djneill:  and it found the fit|pg||
pc|dA|nt|djneill:  South could have bid 3@h over 3@d I believe as an artificial good @s raise but maybe this 4333 is not that good anyways|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of work here for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i think if 7 hcp are promotable -- vul wouldn't be a factor|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for some that would be true...but with a vul game & NV opps at the one level, there are still some hands that would be borderline, and i am saying those ties might welll be broken ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in favor of showing an 8 count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Said as South playing 10@C|pg||
nt|chilloncan: EW have won this event a few years ago i believe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S is thinking about what to do next|pg||
nt|chilloncan: all four suits conceivable|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically has to avoid losing 2 @hs|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: n/s might bring in 4@s if they bid it but now it's most unlikely.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|othered1: with the pass by west in OR, not a modern tactic, NS found their game.  MUch tougher here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'm disinclined to pass when I have an ace.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: So am I.  At this vul, I'd guess very few players would pass, even though it could be very right on any given hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: North is marked with spades on this auction.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, but not enough so for south to bid them|pg||
nt|kareno: No but perhaps to lead them.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|kareno: South has a pretty good hand on the auction.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|chilloncan: unucky result for EW, hard to find a player born before 1731 who would pass over a forcing club with W hand t those colors|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: i mean after 1731|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 17 other table's South accentuated @d rather than the @s feature and got them guessing about the @c stopper, got to 5@d|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this DBL probably same  5-7 hcp|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|chilloncan: is W second suit was hearts instead of spades, 1C would be a risky opening at these colors - then he might ignore stiff queen of hearts and open 1D...although 1D doesnt mean much ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in this system either. the main point is that with good secondary spades, W is ready to risk preemption|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it sems lie he has a relatively easy q of c shift|pg||

nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: wow they made 4s on 19|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting hand here folks|pg||
nt|djneill:  there North opted to bid 4@h, perhaps a splinter, and West went for the doubleton @d lead, hoping to get in with the @sK and then back for a ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: "a bit"   still trying for that Understatement of the Year Award Ed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: excellent red suit slam but bad break in 1d|pg||

nt|mittmouse: he must have led his dblton d|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|othered1: me?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he already won the underwear of the year award and the underbid of the year award, so he is going for the hat trick|pg||
nt|djneill:  yeah Passell is not so bad on the all time list, if Lair is 5th, Passell is 2nd or 3rd|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h will defence find @d lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4N|nt|othered1: Again, south opens 1@C and west tries 1@S.  Will have better luck this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass ostensibly 0-4 HCP     [only Walter the Walrus would say North is worth 5]|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S has horror hand for strong club.......2 suits with lower major and lower minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: notm expecting save at these colours|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless that's another Passell - they have a family of bridge experts|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|lestergold: maybe lightner double coming|pg||

nt|djneill:  you guys called the Lightner, nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: and the forcing club nightmare chickens come home to roost, predictably|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: but happy ending|pg||
nt|othered1: But Rubin took the aggressive action with 4@H and EW didn't take the very good save|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: p0erfect example asks for first suit bid by dummy |pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|nt|chilloncan: and rightly so -- they had achieved exactly what they aimed at. sometimes openber will guess right, but you live with that|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|othered1: Living with -620 rather than -100 isn't very comfortable|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you push the club opener to the point of guessing and then you live with the result. if u r going to save over his guess, why be so active? go slow and figure it out yourself when ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|othered1: I wonder if 2N is natural try or an asking bid|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes East was positive West's values were mostly outside of spades thanks to N-S strenuous vulnerable @s bids, and so that means East can count on West having lots of @h honors and an Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: its gone 4a.m. here and im past my sell by date folks so i must bid you all goodnight much as im enjoying this fascinating match|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so i'm extrapolating 3@S=min, 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  if West wanted game from the getgo West would just bid 3NT over 2@h, implying @s, I guess|pg||

nt|djneill:  razor sharp decision by North, as 4@h will drift down exactly 1 and 4@s down only on reasonable defense|pg||
nt|djneill:  this could be a pickup for N-S in the other room too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Really, do they always open a 4-card major?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Did Hamman's swindle from last night make today's bulletin?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not quite like Hamman's 4@s hand yesterday but not bad either|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2N|nt|andyv:  who will push whom to where here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|5D|nt|andyv:  EW did well to buy the contract in OR at 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 3@s is just a bid, since south was passed hand, so "unusual/unusual" may not apply|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: If they play weak 2's, north can't really act over 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: You can beat this a few, but will n orth cover the @DQ?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  @s lead will set this 2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 150 150   push    ummm maybe not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could have beaten this more with spade shift trick 2 (i think)|pg||
nt|djneill:  thanks for your commentatory skills Martin and George, and your operational prowess Barry|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfd: always happy to be of service|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: finally a match to keep us all awake|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill:  it has not disappointed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if we'll see different match for final segment of the quarter final|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is totally normal, but auction may not be identical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14 to poor 17|pg||
nt|djneill:  another slam|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless... no another Lightner!|pg||
nt|djneill:  but that would ask for a ... @h right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|djneill:  is it open to interpretation|pg||
nt|djneill:  North can double 6@s to try to get a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: depends, i hate the strict rules of lightner doubles|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: auction is slightly different, yes  however the opening leader has the same informations|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: declarer has @ss and dummy has @hs, that is|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@s in my opinion is an underbid, my word|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but west could (should) bid 4@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: only two others from which to choose and one wasn't very close at half.  Actually, neither of the others still  in play was close at half.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chilloncan: E clearly looking for a swing with the lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: no lightner needed|pg||

nt|othered1: And another good baby slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam should go down|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: diamond lead.  club shift|pg||
nt|othered1: If NS don't take what's a decent @D save|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even diamond diamond works|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  can anything go wrong for the Duvall team on this board|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|bg: 6 spades makes without a club lead 7 dia off a couple lots of possibilties|pg||
nt|othered1: Really unlucky to lose the match by going down in slam, if that's what happens.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I don't  think the save is a consideration any more.  You gotta bid them to save in them.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: will double by north call for ruff or dummy's first suit?  @HQ may indicate the former|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: guys, how do you make hand slam if defense leads diamonds twice|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the club and spade breaks make it impossible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  it can be made but have to go after @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be over in 2 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: double dummy make, on @D, @D, no?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: i dont think so but for sure not single dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  yes, play A@h and ruff @h then take ruffing finesse in @hs|pg||
