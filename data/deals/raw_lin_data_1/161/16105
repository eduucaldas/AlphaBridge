nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East Passes 1@c with an eye on the vulnerablity - that @s suit is moth-eaten|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Apologies viewers, players sat in opposite position. I will restart in 2nd board |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads a nice-looking @s but North's spots are a mood-dampener|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|djneill:  North can count 3@c, 2@s, 2@d, 2@h for 9 minimum|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is a small clue that the @dQ is offsides -if East had @sKJxxx  @hxx  @dQxx @cAxx for example they might have overcalled 1@s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|djneill:  nifty, East does not cash the @s, wow, there must have been a clue somewhere - otherwise it looks pretty odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  North delays the moment of truth in @d, also in case East has both the @dT and @d9 (the 8 forces the Queen)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: N in tank |pg||
nt|djneill:  North really wanted East to play spades, Chan made a great switch!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|djneill:  perhaps West gave a Smith signal in @c (showing dislike for @s)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||

nt|bobholl: if n @H lead may be even 4@S|pg||

nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||

nt|haans: 2@Cx make no game|pg||

nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tez|pg||
nt|anton72: too agressive start :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
nt|haans: you for the kill |pg||
nt|haans: good start|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble would be too agressive, but pass, not 5@H|pg||
nt|desinka: they play this one boards|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
nt|bernix: difficult to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: penalty doubles have died in IMPs|pg||
