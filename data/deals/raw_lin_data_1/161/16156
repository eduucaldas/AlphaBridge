nt|ahollan1: Drew asking non-screenmate??  |pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think I like east's chances here, though it might take careful defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The question was after the opening lead had been made and the screen was up|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

nt|othered1: trump lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that might explain Russ' DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Ronnie definitely wrote "weak" to Jimmy; Russ whispered to Drew, so I don't know what he said - might have said constructive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Drew says: "I need a director & has gone to call one"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Ronnie: "what did you tell him?" Russ: "our agreement is invitational, you RDBL with weak"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i mention because DBL seems like quite a position if 3@D is weak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe hoping for cross-ruff in minors??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah -- this deck probably has only 13@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Drew's problem is that Russ said "invitational" out loud and he thinks Ronnie might have heard him and that would make it easier to pull|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Ronnie explains 2@c shape and not 4 hearts, so easy to pull|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And in the midst of that, I missed the play - sorry|pg||

nt|othered1: and doesn't deny 4@S|pg||
nt|casenjo:  yes, this pair plays all low level doubles are takeout when they play imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but many use the responsive dbl to DENY 4+@S   so  partnership agreement needed|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this is even more true when the opponents have bid and raised a suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: for those ocd types who are interested|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|reisig: 4@h is a stretch|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mittmouse: this will probably  make ad n/s make 3s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: xyz actually refers to three suit leads, checkback or two way apply to this auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: bids not leads|pg||
nt|kareno: I think Eddie Wold is considering his play, yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that is probably a safe bet|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he didn't get up to use the bathroom or anything he is in fact staring at the dummy|pg||

nt|mittmouse: oh sorry i have been informed that my comment might appear racist when the pakistani team made their arrival on the world stage in rye 1 of the pairs played paki-pre-empts-the ...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: brainchild of munir ata-ullah|pg||
nt|mittmouse: and they all referred to themselves as pakis|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i was very riendly with all the guys i mean no disrespect if u get the world championship book from rye u will see the convention i have referred to|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pg||

nt|reisig: wellcome to Georgie Mittelman|pg||
nt|mittmouse: hi all|pg||
nt|reisig: remember the days when we had to "make" the boards?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: as u know richie-i hate to date ourselves but up until circa 1970 all the team games were bd a match the acbl introducd swiss which was an idea borrowed from chess around 1970 and ...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: it created a windfall for the league|pg||
nt|reisig: true|pg||
nt|me argent: much to the experts regret|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i yearn for those days of old-i much prefer bd a match|pg||
nt|reisig: they still have ONE event for you|pg||
nt|me argent: i wonder why?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: but u are right joe bd a match is too tough a game for the average player|pg||
nt|reisig: sure ...one trick ...and you won a board|pg||
nt|mittmouse: peter nagy put it in perspective say u reach an unlucky grand slam and go down and the next hand u are defending 2c for the same point|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfe: sry he is actually thinking did not play from his hand yet|pg||

nt|casenjo:  Roger Bates bid 3NT on board 61, Hamman bid spades keeping them out of their spade fit|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess.  pedestrian @D back would likely have worked better|pg||
mb|1H!|an|4+ !hs, can have longer side suit|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Bates started with DBL where Rubin bid 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: canape version of 1@H opener|pg||
nt|othered1: Last board at this table.  At least for now.|pg||
mb|2N!|an|LImit !h raise|nt|othered1: Normal Jordan 2N?  Odd they'd play something so common.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very exciting match -- thanks to the Players  and Jan|pg||
nt|othered1: Oh,  that's preemptive|pg||
nt|casenjo:  this has been an exciting close match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That's what Rubin said, unless I misunderstood - maybe opposite a 10-15 1@h it's preemptive, maybe I misheard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I misheard|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Casen asking about 3@c. Russ says no agreement about that; after 1M-2M they play short suit game tries and might be that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: phew -- Jan had me scrambling there|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: That's never come up before?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange not to have an agreement about bidding over "Jordan"|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|casenjo:  new leader|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|casenjo:  great lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3N made|pg||
nt|othered1: still have the slam and this board to negotiate for O'Rourke to havee come from rather far behind early inthe 3rd quarter.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my spy [aka brother] says it made an overtrick|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|othered1: will the @C8 coming down be critical?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|casenjo:  thanks Jan for your great work! we love the 'table talk'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  this auction will start  1@D[precision]-DBL-?  i think they play transfers   so   1@H     then it's anybody's guess|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, absolutely terrific presentation, despite the technical problems|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: problems?   we only had ONE crash this set|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: I think this is down, but may need very careful defense|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Diamond return now?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: with 2 to score  Morse lead up to 13|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: That shift, I think, is the killer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke gets another imp -- 6@D made with overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  63  Zia passed 2@C rebid   so Bates balances with 2@D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Wold pushed to 3@D so another plus position for O'Rourke|pg||
nt|othered1: That will work|pg||
nt|othered1: for defense|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke set  58-23  with 2 to score|pg||
nt|casenjo:  now it looks like only 8 tricks for Rubin|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|hT|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hK|pc|s6|mc|9|nt|ahollan1: extra points for 4-queens???|pg||
nt|othered1: Great set by NS at the end of a long day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no pinochle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- what a set|pg||
nt|othered1: And EW in OR did well, also.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: local start times for tomorrow's 64-board final are at  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after more imps on 63  i think we can officially congratulate O'Rourke  great set|pg||
nt|othered1: Fitting that Bates managed to pick off the stiff K for an overtrick on 63 in OR.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Congratulations to Team O'Rourke.  Thanks all and bye.|pg||
