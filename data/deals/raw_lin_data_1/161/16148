mb|5D!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=a) FG, 44/(54) @H & @S, not 44(41)  b) slam try (46) @H & @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Puppet Stayman - Used by responder with at least invitational values to discover whether opener's Notrump bid may consist of a 5 card major suit.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred didn't really PASS 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: director warning for slow play already given|pg||
nt|daman: East did not pass 3@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I guess several variations of Puppet Stayman are in use. |pg||
nt|daman: Deborah?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: they are being very serious about slow play at the tournament this year and I have seen and heard many people already have gotten penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally new concept for ACBL|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortly the ACBL tells : Remember: Slow play is subject to penalty, and the penalties are well earned when slow pairs disrupt the normal progression of the game. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: writing notes on both sides of table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: screen rules|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D Exclusion  Key Card|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|h_karluk: Exclusion Keycard Blackwood is a continuation and extenuation of the Roman Key Card Blackwood convention.|pg||

nt|daman: tah dah was confirmation :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   missed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: This conventional method is initiated: 1. After establishing the trump suit. 2. By a jump bid higher than game level in an unbid suit or  3. In a suit bid by the opponents. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H is a mystery|pg||
