nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|djneill:  East Passes 1@c with an eye on the vulnerablity - that @s suit is moth-eaten|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugrapha1: Apologies viewers, players sat in opposite position. I will restart in 2nd board |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  East leads a nice-looking @s but North's spots are a mood-dampener|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugrapha1: in the tank |pg||
pc|cA|nt|djneill:  North can count 3@c, 2@s, 2@d, 2@h for 9 minimum|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill:  there is a small clue that the @dQ is offsides -if East had @sKJxxx  @hxx  @dQxx @cAxx for example they might have overcalled 1@s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
mc|11|nt|djneill:  nifty, East does not cash the @s, wow, there must have been a clue somewhere - otherwise it looks pretty odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  North delays the moment of truth in @d, also in case East has both the @dT and @d9 (the 8 forces the Queen)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: N in tank |pg||
nt|djneill:  North really wanted East to play spades, Chan made a great switch!|pg||
