mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: EW similar but with a multi and constructive 2s|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to all kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: NS 3 weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mrt2000: Hi Folks  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a standard 4@s now - nothing much to say about it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I do think transfer responses are one of the great theoretical advances of the last 10 years|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi paul|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: David said "we open 1@c a lot"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Welcome back to TGR's in Marble Arch for the second half of this match - Dhondy with a bit to do |pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: There is one ruling to come on board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d X-1|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrt2000: hi andrew|pg||
nt|peachy: East had a problem, he solved it this way|pg||
nt|mcarroll: seems a bit unilateral - esp[ecially with such good @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: May change to 2@d making.....but unclear why at the moment|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website with standings after round 5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So this is 1st vs 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Martin|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was concerned W could leave it in, and he does not want to defend|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: jon,south doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|mrt2000: hi raija|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  question of whether N-S make 4 or 5|pg||
nt|bt: now he does|pg||
nt|peachy: *she|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: S surely having shown his stiff club on the way|pg||
nt|henryb:  or go down 1 when declarer ducks this to his Q|pg||
nt|xenya: might go down on this lead?|pg||
nt|bt: i wouldnt formulate it like that in english jon|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a 3 or 5 play|pg||
nt|bt: but i have a dirty mind|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is - contract will be the same all over the room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it did rather seem that NS were not on the same wavelength on that board |pg||
pc|h3|nt|heyz:  most fields you would try to make as many tricks as possible|pg||
nt|heyz:  this one an exception?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bt: having escaped heart lead decl will go up @DA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cute underlead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrt2000: 7 tricks, next hand|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|henryb:  If N goes up with the A he can draw trumps and pitch a @h on the @cK. making 5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|heyz:  well predicted|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: i think 80% will go down - N must have gotten a clue from the speed of the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: better perhaps to win the Ace, having avoided a @H lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: more interesting on a @D lead, perhaps?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|heyz:  a whistler as we call it in USA|pg||

nt|bt: going up ace will be majority play|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and then there was 6   lol|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: he|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can hope that the opposition reach 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suspect the stiff will be the normal lead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|heyz:  West has an easier lead than East vs @s contract|pg||
nt|bt: u have 2 know ur opps to duck that in dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - and the question is how many try to take a double advantage (that isnt there)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W = she|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|heyz:  solves any lead problems|pg||
nt|bt: now the question is, does north know his pds style?|pg||
nt|jbgood: weak weak in spades being the text here - n has a guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  I feel sure that he does|pg||
nt|heyz:  kib says this could be misinterpreted as t/o for @ss|pg||
nt|bt: a guess?|pg||
nt|heyz:  the dbl|pg||
nt|jbgood: that must be an odd interpretation - this is a normal suit showing double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: N asking E what the double means. East stating, I am not sure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: heavyweight 2NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not alerted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hardly a takeout -- W could double before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not discussed|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT doomed, I fear|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mrt2000: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, do you assume transfers are safe in undiscussed auctions?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could hsve been much worse  though|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d bad weak 2 in a major or balanced 23/24|pg||
nt|peachy: he can take his eight and give up|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally think it's crazy, but I observe myself to be in a minority|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I'm with you  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps without the misunderstanding, they would play in 4H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H practically laydown, and they're in 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, you have to assume if your system is 4 card majors, strong NT, that you are heavily oriented to natural bids|pg||
nt|peachy: NS sat down just before gametime and made a card, I was told. They dont usually play together (although did play in Norway sometime in the past)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is actually an interesting question in big pickup environments like BBO, where you rarely have detailed discussions|pg||
nt|peachy: I make the blanket agreement with all partners that systems on, makes life simple|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and avoids mistakes like this too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: it has some flaws but avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, system on covers a multitude of situations|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  West still has to find the @c shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very careful 3@s - but 3@d bid got defense to a nice start - conventions sometimes give away leaddirecting doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise declarer can still make five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Artur may surface and make the best of it, I think !   lol|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky lead for declarer - the defence can attack spades from the South hand |pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  by guessing hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and duck on the way bacl|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: NO !!!!|pg||

nt|mrt2000: so I see|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  no, only 4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think he can avoid losing a club|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, no|pg||
nt|peachy: well, undoubled overtricks notvuln are not too awful, he was hoping to make|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why West did that. I think a spade is better, to clear the spade trick. Entries may be awkward now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: not a bad contract, the only fault is it is not making :(|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  now 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|henryb:  He could make 4 after the start by taking a ruffing finesse in hearts and getting three club discards: one on the @dQ and two on hearts|pg||

nt|mrt2000: XX maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: forgot to agree on BW :) as well|pg||
nt|peachy: vulnerable, decision is clear|pg||

nt|peachy: I wonder if Dbl was anti-lead directing in clubs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only a bit unlucky, the @D were going away on the @H eventually|pg||
nt|tejjyid: actually, BW doesn't help because of the void|pg||

pc|h9|nt|heyz:  seems high to me|pg||

nt|mrt2000: yuck !!!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very surprising actions by first West, then East. My guess is they are on slightly different wavelengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2NT shows @D and 3@c shows dislike of @d ie less than Hxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lead from N?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|heyz:  can you combine spade plays and diamond hook + ruffing a @D/|pg||
nt|heyz:  ?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr. S|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks fairly routine from here. just take the Diamond finesse and concede a @S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: to me, east's X shows this hand, which makes West's bid PASS rather than 2NT|pg||
