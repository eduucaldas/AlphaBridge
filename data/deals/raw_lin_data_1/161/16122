nt|kareno: I would imagine they are.  It's a homegrown system, very articulated.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yes they are|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Once Russ Ekeblad's system was sort of Bluish, then more Ultimate and now it seems to be unto itself.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Sui generis for sure.|pg||
nt|othered1: And it includes canape, shorter of two suits often bid first, as here.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|othered1: north can rebid 2@H to show a hand that includes a Flannery (4|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S-5@H opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|othered1: North is limited by not opening 1 strong @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: And indeed it looks like Flannery was employed in the CR, and west (Zia) simply punted 3N, successfully.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Will make with a heart lead of course|pg||
nt|othered1: He and Hanna have quite different evaluations of the west hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Hanna treated it as a strong takeout double, one-suited.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: So the spade goes away|pg||
nt|othered1: @S lead might have beaten this, though I don't know why north should h ave found it on this auction|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|xenya: thnaks Shirley :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: should get to 7NT.|pg||

nt|neobas: Hey Raija, Guy :)|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about 4@H (what about a trump lead) but 5@C is cold|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: East's flat 16 count is anything but a 1N opening.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Not flat - two-suited.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: If the suits were diamonds and hearts you might, however, want to open 1nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: That's how I see it, too, but most of the world seems to think that anything without a singleton is balanced :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 5 diamonds and 4 hearts that is|pg||
nt|kareno: I would say that a balanced hand has no more than one doubleton|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Certainly if you evaluate the hand as worth game over a single raise, even a constructivish raise, 1N is an underbid|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
mc|10|nt|othered1: but it looks like he was thinking about it.  South's @CJ may have been the indication|pg||

nt|bobh1: clearly they were on different wavelengths in the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: yes, as above|pg||
mb|1N|nt|heyz:  evidently that wasnt Multon's understanding|pg||
nt|bt: i guess north thought otherwise|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bt: this is how you finish well at mp, have opps crash|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: i take it, we don't havr anything like running scores?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bt: nice pressure bidding by ew|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like +1, 3 @S, 4 @H,  A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  i heard they were on bridgewinners.com yesterday, but i could not find them|pg||
nt|rmb1: But perhaps can not cash @SK|pg||
nt|xenya: i think N's double of 2@D does sound like penalty oriented -- after S's double|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: may not be able to cash all of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  more yelling will ensue|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: definitely.|pg||
nt|bt: i could be convinced to double on the west hand, but i guess the mp score would be almost identical|pg||
nt|xenya: 9 double dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|caitlin: what is 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect its a shape enq|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Transfer to Clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: or inviting in NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will get home|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|heyz:  i'm told only the team event running scores available at bridgewiners|pg||
nt|bobh1: but also S's 3@c was very strong|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: I am not fond of the conversion to 4H|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|neobas: This looks to make, favourable @D holdings|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bt: bridgewhiners maybe lol|pg||
nt|xenya: ah she's on the right track!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Need to unblock @SA for 9|pg||
nt|rmb1: Needed (at the previous trick)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobh1: so maybe N should have bid 3N despite his frustration at not being able to defend 2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, certainly makes sense|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|peachy: but perhaps it is better, however,|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, before cashing the @HA|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: the conversion is close, last time declarer really did not have a stopper, might have influenced this decision|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||

nt|chick: two pretty routine hands, let's bribe the dealer for something more exciting :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: A@H then run the 10 would ensure 4 @H 2 @S and A@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 1NT 12/14|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: pushy Stayman|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D is a great save - ie it makes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: Those who were wondering about the beer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Not if you intend to pass the response|pg||
nt|othered1: That's quite a positional call (the pass) with an 11 count|pg||
nt|xenya: semi-garbage stayman?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|heyz:  now the guys with 25 HCP can start bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, but you might have found the only partial that could go down on an ugly trump break|pg||
nt|rmb1: A good 11 count at that, but you don't know value of @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: EW reverse attitude, standard count|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: NS all upside-down|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h would not be my choice (of course 1@h would not have been either|pg||
nt|bt: looks like ew are frozen out of this auction w 25 hcp ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: weak NT here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s is rather easy to play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: excellent 6@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@s i think makes|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chick: so does 4@H if they ever try to bid it|pg||
nt|chick: more like 4@S is the save :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|neobas: Not a pretty contract|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 7@s is easy with 2 @c ruffs on N|pg||
nt|xenya: despite 4-1 @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: S has to get to his hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: he can manage it i guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rmb1: Dunn gained on  1 when OR played in 4@C+1|pg||
nt|frankaus: there is a saying - red saves overgreen games are like passing a camel thru the eye of a needle |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|dT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: I doubt that he will manage 9 tricks, too much work to do|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|neobas: I think most of us would be in it still though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it begs the question of how to bid 6-4 hands, here a 2@H rebid would have worked better|pg||
nt|peachy: even so,  I expect both rooms to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like down now, with no quick entry to dummy to play trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|heyz:  easy for me to say from here but if you dont come in precision pairs will steal you blind|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|neobas: In my opinion with 2@D you have told about 9/13 of your cards, and with 2@H only about 6/13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 3@H seems fairly clear to me|pg||
nt|peachy: there is advice existing that with bad hand 6-4, rebid the major insted of showing the 4-card minor|pg||
nt|peachy: if he is into that, then it was a guestion of was the hand bad :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Hard to find a bad 6-4 though|pg||
nt|neobas: Especially one with 13 HCP|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: cearefully makes 3 |pg||
nt|caitlin: what are 'green' games?:)|pg||
nt|chick: non-vul I presume :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: green = NV in our parlance|pg||
nt|caitlin: got it.........never heard that before......|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H in open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: green/red like trafic lights - we stop 4 red |pg||
nt|harmon: oh I thought it was like my games I turn green cause the game is so bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@H  4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: No big @C, just an off-shape 1n|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: There's the same hand as earlier.  Not 1nt IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: karen are you opening 1 @H with S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Always and ever|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And I continue to agree with you.  But in a stylized artificial club system with relays, etc., you sometimes have to bid 1N to plug a system hole.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's much the same hand that east had earlier and opened 1@h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|othered1: Untimate @C -- and south was involved in its development -- required some funny 1N openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like the pattern for 1 nt,     5422 |pg||
nt|sybarra: so I am a 1 @H bidder |pg||
nt|sybarra: (among other reasons)|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told south can't open 1@h.  It's either 1nt or forcing club|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: But you're not playing their system :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|heyz:  tough hand for Jeff to play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Johnson has great faith in Meckstroth. But this is abid against the LAW. His side must have only eight @s, and the opponents are likely to have only eight @h, so the three level should belong to them|pg||
nt|heyz:  good point, also his hand has more defensive values|pg||

nt|xenya: same 3@C contract in OR on 1 -- flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|heyz:  you can make 4@s i think|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the otherhand, A10732 is not the sort of defensive holding you normally want against a one level contract|pg||
nt|heyz:  three diamonds shaking @C then ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|neobas: Standard that would be 15-17 unbal w/ 4@S I guess|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, there was an overcall so Walsh not relevant, I guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: maybe, but tricky single dummy|pg||

nt|ritong: no problem harmy|pg||
nt|harmon: but still if her suit had some texture 2n good bid with her suit agressive imho|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think 3 @D was retransfer |pg||

pc|h8|nt|heyz:  2@d is a natural game force|pg||
nt|heyz:  2@h a relay|pg||
nt|xenya: 7N makes on a squeeze against S, 7@D has additional chances, and that's where declarer might go wrong|pg||

nt|heyz:  i thought they showed gf 5-5 on the three level over 1@c but obviously didnt here|pg||

pc|s9|nt|vugraphzrk: He's back. Could've had 2 at that speed|pg||

nt|bt: u have 2 know ur opps to duck that in dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - and the question is how many try to take a double advantage (that isnt there)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|xenya: hardly a takeout -- W could double before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not discussed|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT doomed, I fear|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|mrt2000: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, do you assume transfers are safe in undiscussed auctions?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could hsve been much worse  though|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d bad weak 2 in a major or balanced 23/24|pg||
nt|peachy: he can take his eight and give up|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally think it's crazy, but I observe myself to be in a minority|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I'm with you  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps without the misunderstanding, they would play in 4H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H practically laydown, and they're in 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, you have to assume if your system is 4 card majors, strong NT, that you are heavily oriented to natural bids|pg||
nt|peachy: NS sat down just before gametime and made a card, I was told. They dont usually play together (although did play in Norway sometime in the past)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is actually an interesting question in big pickup environments like BBO, where you rarely have detailed discussions|pg||
nt|peachy: I make the blanket agreement with all partners that systems on, makes life simple|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and avoids mistakes like this too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: it has some flaws but avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, system on covers a multitude of situations|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  West still has to find the @c shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very careful 3@s - but 3@d bid got defense to a nice start - conventions sometimes give away leaddirecting doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise declarer can still make five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Artur may surface and make the best of it, I think !   lol|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: tricky lead for declarer - the defence can attack spades from the South hand |pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  by guessing hearts|pg||

pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: not sure why West did that. I think a spade is better, to clear the spade trick. Entries may be awkward now|pg||

nt|mrt2000: that's not right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: They've now agreed systems on|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@c buried too next room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|heyz:  Pachtman defending his pplus score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: alas, he had nine tricks - two spades, three hearts, three diamonds and one club |pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzrk: 2@c natural|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have been told that if using capp 2@S is expected to be 5/5 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|peachy: invite or 3NT?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  missed a decent slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: and if  u do it 5/4 it should not be described as capp - bvut capp but modified capp|pg||
nt|ritong: if the @c K is honest lead, @h K is on|pg||
nt|ritong: hamman might make 12 tricks, then|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: not only decent|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bt: slam is great but in natural systems after 1@H - 1@S ...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: XX maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: forgot to agree on BW :) as well|pg||
nt|peachy: vulnerable, decision is clear|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Given the state of the match aggression is probably the option|pg||
nt|peachy: that also|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: ow|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|heyz:  best lead now @D to 9 not safe|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: N is a difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|mrt2000: has|pg||
nt|peachy: I wonder if Dbl was anti-lead directing in clubs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only a bit unlucky, the @D were going away on the @H eventually|pg||
nt|tejjyid: actually, BW doesn't help because of the void|pg||
nt|peachy: 3S might have helped sort things out, instead of 4S.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrk: she :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mrt2000: principle of fast arrival, maybe?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||

nt|peachy: Jiminy Crickets, sorry |pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, if @h K is off for some reason, i m not sure how ducking the @d can help|pg||
nt|frankaus: multi-landy or woosey far superior|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: So he can now play a diamond to N, endplaying him|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Frank|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|rodal f: An interesting thinking to|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: He nearly played @d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: Nice|pg||
nt|peachy: In effect, it really does not matter what he plays now, the unfortunate shortage of a trick remains|pg||
nt|ritong: well, south opened the bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|heyz:  seems high to me|pg||
nt|xenya: just as good they are not in 6 -- he can't set up a spade trick now|pg||
nt|peachy: well, as long as Sarah covers this :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: this is last of this set,   another 16 bds to follow |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: after break for comparison's |pg||
nt|kareno: East made a practical bid once west overcalled.|pg||
nt|othered1: Are we likely to continue this match?|pg||
nt|kareno: It's quite close.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: well be back in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: we will continue this match|pg||
nt|sybarra: since a close match likely we get this match  imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I'll try to stay awake - it's past my bedtime :)|pg||

nt|kareno: <applause> for Zach!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for yours too, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like a normal @H game here, unless both east and west get really pushy.|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume east will bid his long suit first and that won't turn west on.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|mc|11|nt|sybarra2: I suspect we are catching up |pg||
