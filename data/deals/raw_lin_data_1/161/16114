nt|smoller: Hi Thorvald|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|thorvald: If all square at the end there will be a count of total poins scored - to me that looks like Dahl having the most because of the 15 imp board from previous round|pg||
nt|thorvald: 4@H seem ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: TD has informed from start about penalty for slow play. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|thorvald: Hi all, I'm not sure what Mads is looking for, but no majors in South will remove any disconcers with the diamonds|pg||
nt|smoller: Looking like a Puppet Stayman-variation|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|thorvald: I would see 3 @C as invitational in this sequence, but with max and @C Queen its easy to accept - still I would just bid 3 NT on the north hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: actually that barely matters,  need to guess the @D |pg||
nt|pelu: u can lose 2@Ds and make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: some specs suggesting 6 @D,  (with the diamond guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: remember -- we will finish with board 14 in this room -- and I will bet a coke or anything that the other room will be finished before we get to that board|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|vugraphzwh: 3@C explained as: "Natural or just forcing"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: If he is worried about one spadestopper he might find the winning bid|pg||

nt|thorvald: 120 here will be 6 imps, and a lead of 11 before the last hand. missing the grand will then result in all square|pg||

mb|3D|nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told Iversen in the quarterfinale was down by 16 imps with 2 boards to go -- and WON |pg||
nt|thorvald: What about a practical 3 NT on the south hand ?|pg||
nt|jron: Cohen probably thinks they have a bad round so he decided he needed a swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told by the TD -- who was captain for the team Iversen beat|pg||

mb|3N|nt|jron: difficult now to bid it w precision|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzwh: Incredible !!!|pg||
nt|pelu: so Iversen will win by 1 IMP|pg||

mc|13|nt|jron: Congrats to Iversen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to all the commentators along the way |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I dont know if EW are going to appeal the TD decision -- but I will let the room be open|pg||
nt|thorvald: keep the table open until we get the official result|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And then we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And I will tell you what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: so the call on TD in board 15 and the misdefend on board 16 was the key-board|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: The Dahl team is starting to count the score just ½m from me|pg||
nt|sybarra: we certainly can not  complain about the exciting boards|pg||
nt|fl j: nice "ugle" game when it go for 1 up/down|pg||

nt|sommer: thats why, he can claim|pg||
nt|thorvald: And jonas finally realized that Eaide could play back e @H after the Spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Erik's 9 of spades to secure a heart lead if Jonas only had 2 spades to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: And another partscore here. Who will get to NT first|pg||
mb|1H|nt|thorvald: And another game NS, should be an easy make|pg||
nt|sommer: E?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..not 1 then|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: w did|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: EW:)|pg||
mb|2N!|an|forcing with hearts|nt|thorvald: Easy in 3NT but they will probably bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|fl j: any system can bid 6, how about 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Green vs red - can be that wrong he thinks|pg||
nt|sommer: but he could:()|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|thorvald: Probably 3 down, but nobody plays with penalty double over 1 NT anymore|pg||
nt|sommer: if he doesnt find the stiff @DK, he may go -4|pg||
nt|thorvald: 7@H is the top spot|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwg: dont think Grove will use a lot of time with this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: 3spades alerted|pg||
mb|4H|nt|smoller: 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5S!|an|2aces + Q of hearts|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwg: so far match has been very close - but Iversen has taken lots of imps this session|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|thorvald: But 7NT will also make on a black squeeze against Vest|pg||
nt|thorvald: I dont understand why South doesnt show his King of @D|pg||
nt|fl j: that was for sure ?|pg||
nt|fl j: i did not understand either, but 6+ most time wins, see this time|pg||
nt|fl j: club 9 is importnant|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwg: 3 diamond shows more than minimum but no single|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: On board 4 Dahl-Norris overbid again and lost 8 more imps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|thorvald: Iversen lost 3 imps on board 9 because Bjørk open in 3rd hand, and got overboard|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
mc|13|nt|thorvald: I don't understand the bidding after 3@S - any explanations ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Apears Grove had shown single diamond - Norman had shown 16 - so would not show king of diamonds|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sybarra: hello Jan and hello all |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: Hi Sheryl|pg||
nt|jron: 4@s seems iiadvised; probably bid to sacrifice but as 3@h was NF I see no reason|pg||
nt|jron: iladvised|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jron: N could play @DQ so S can underlead AK next time to get a heart back|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: If the match ends ALL SQUARE - then totalpoints will be counted|pg||
nt|jron: doesnt matter if S continues @Ds but no reason to give partner a chance to make mistakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and the team with most total points wins the Vinoble Cup 2010|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jron: decided to go passive|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jron: nothning wrong with that|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I guess S can see that Declarer cant run tricks in any suits -- and she is in control |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jron: give A Kxxxxx, AD, xx, AKx and it is vital to get north in for the heart lead|pg||
nt|jron: give East|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Immediately after the end of the board Allan Cohen calls for the TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Now he is explaining what he thinks is wrong|pg||
nt|jron: a possible swing of 5 IMPs for Iversens team|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzwh: Allan Cohen thinks that it took a while before N played @d4 at trick one -- and when S then switched to a @s Allan Cohen thinks there is a problem -- |pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzwg: seems good board for Dahl from closed room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Better to play on the weak hand and a little bit better suit in spades|pg||
nt|sommer: very - how did it go 2 down?|pg||
nt|thorvald: And why bidding 5NT and the bidding the grand after the signoff ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: 4 hearts minimum - after Norman had shown max - meaning the single in diamond from Grove was not the best|pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzwg: until now same as in closed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: Thats what i mean, if 4@H was I dont like @D it must be even more strange to denie the @DK, as partner expects you to have some point elsewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: you are right. |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|smoller: 3NT is also a (lucky) make|pg||
nt|sommer: he got only 1 @Strick|pg||
nt|thorvald: He went 2 down because he never got the second spade trick|pg||
nt|sommer: could be 9 imps back|pg||
nt|thorvald: Anyway - it worked :-) And now an unmakeable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: Gotta learn reading before pressing enter :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: good for the match|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: thats ok, Thorvald ..I type shitty, so this will be the only time|pg||
nt|thorvald: Could make now|pg||
nt|sommer: ya|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzwg: the double could cost|pg||
nt|thorvald: RDBL ?|pg||
nt|smoller: RD anyone?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: 15 imps will tie the gap again almost|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but still work to do|pg||
nt|sommer: best shift is @C's|pg||
nt|sommer: hoping to shorten the table before 2 @S tricks, but N can do it himself|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|thorvald: Chicken|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: the same Houmøller said to Norman:)|pg||
nt|thorvald: *makeable|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sommer: N must still raise @S before ruffing @C's ..if he plays for @C 4-4 he may go down|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|sommer: maybe one @C ruff could do, but..|pg||
nt|sommer: this is best|pg||
nt|fl j: godt for spændingen at Henrik ikke doblede, men han burde vel have gjort det, Bjørg åbnede i anden hånd|pg||
nt|sommer: in the meanwhile, Iversen got 2 more imps, so 15 imps here will still be +5 for Iversen|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: welcome to Flemming Jørgensen|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|mc|10|nt|thorvald: At board 13 Norris-Dahl managed to get into the bidding, that did cost 9 imps, so Iversen now in the lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: Did he manage 10 tricks ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: yes Norman played heart instead of club.  Grove did not like that|pg||
pg||
qx|o16|st||md|2SKTHQ73DAQJ9862C2,SAQ6H85DK7CKT9853,SJ843H94DT543CA76,S9752HAKJT62DCQJ4|sv|e|nt|pelu: even if defense play 3x@D there are no way to make 4@S - no endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Now the TD has decided that the play has to continue -- and he will return with a decision later|pg||
nt|jron: yes on the actual hand it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Allan Cohen means that a @h from S at trick 2 might have been a possibility|pg||
nt|jron: A heart is never right when partner encourages diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Now Iversen asks Cohen what he was thinking about after 4@s from his partner ---- and I think there seems to be a lot of "bad" things discussed|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: hmmm|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|4H|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: the have now played close to 9o boards - all are tired|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and tempers probably frayed |pg||
nt|jron: trying TD to get S to play a heart is poor sportmansship, in my opinion. What do you say about this, Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was wonder what count attitude they played,   but agree,  why would S play a @H?  looking at K |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: *wondering |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|pelu: low-high = comeon or evenNo|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jron: they play UDCA but here the @D4 is an encouraging|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jron: card|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with no signal in @Ds (for example the q)  the spade looked obvious |pg||
nt|sybarra: plus S is looking at a likely club trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Bjørg explained that she was thinking about continue @d -- not continue @hs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jron: the only thing you wont play is a diamond|pg||
nt|pelu: ??|pg||
nt|jron: is a heart, of course|pg||
nt|jron: got distracted by a personal comment, sorry|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: TD has now called for Henrik Iversen -- he has left the table now -- and they are talking in the other room|pg||

nt|fl j: 15 can newer win 4|pg||
nt|thorvald: Playing @H into AQ gave an extra trick|pg||
nt|fl j: on ace lead, play Q|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|thorvald: Why did west not open the bidding|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sommer: ..tie!!|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now NS are to high, but West have realized missing the opening bid, and now overbidding twice|pg||
