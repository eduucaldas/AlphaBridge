pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N might promote some 7 counts at these colours|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i think if 7 hcp are promotable -- vul wouldn't be a factor|pg||
nt|chilloncan: for some that would be true...but with a vul game & NV opps at the one level, there are still some hands that would be borderline, and i am saying those ties might welll be broken ...|pg||

nt|caitlin: misfit in spades......|pg||
nt|kareno: No, not at all.  If he wanted to bid 1nt that would have been okay but even though 3@c shows extras, his hand isn't terrific .|pg||

pc|h5|nt|henryb:  If South had, say, @sAKxxx, @hKx, @d x @cAQJxx, which is about what I would have, you would all be wondering how N-S missed the very reasonable club game if North passed|pg||

nt|chilloncan: unucky result for EW, hard to find a player born before 1731 who would pass over a forcing club with W hand t those colors|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|an|alerted|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: this DBL probably same  5-7 hcp|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4N|nt|chilloncan: is W second suit was hearts instead of spades, 1C would be a risky opening at these colors - then he might ignore stiff queen of hearts and open 1D...although 1D doesnt mean much ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in this system either. the main point is that with good secondary spades, W is ready to risk preemption|pg||

nt|othered1: Lucky.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Russ explaining that he didn't bid 6 because he couldn't ask about @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and bad or unlucky result for Said-Siebert?|pg||
nt|othered1: and the @S 9 wasn't worthless, either|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm surpised Russ stuck around long enough for that chat |pg||
nt|othered1: Unlucky for EW.  Even relay systems -- at least those I know -- sometimes force a decision simply on information available at a safe level.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: such systems are tremendously powerfulm, but at the same time limited in a way, as judgments is factored out all along the way...only the captain getrs to exercise it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar -- in 6@S North -- what is best line after @HJ lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: choices are  immediate @S finesse  or   try to discard both @H losers before playing trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Siebert line must be better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  cash @SA before 3@C then 3@D is improvement  but is it better than the quick finesse?|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Slam makes but it's dicey on this hand.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: And that's why, Paul, I don't keep a private score :)  I don't want to have to look at -800 all night so I just don't keep score and I can play each hand as it comes along|pg||
nt|thurston:  does make comparing with teammates tough tho!|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder what the best line is after a @h lead in 6@s|pg||
nt|thurston:  i like to put smiley faces inside the 0's in 800|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: I played with Don Cowan (late Don Cowan of Toronto) and neither of us kept score - it was tough to compare!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kareno: Take your pitches and pray!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ritong: you have a choice between a straightforward trump hook or a try to pitch the 2@hs, knowing that if you get ruffed with the third @d, no more entry to hook @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|thurston:  you might cash @S ace first and hope if diamond does get ruffed ruffer started with @S Kx|pg||
