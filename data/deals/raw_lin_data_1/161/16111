nt|lazcatluc: Uta putting on the brakes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lazcatluc: he doesn't like his poor heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|donatoru: so 3@c = - 4 card raise , or 10-11 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lazcatluc: but Edi keeps pushing|pg||
nt|stc: so team Marina is under pressure, who's Cernat playing ?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|donatoru: 9-11 4 cards raise|pg||
nt|stc: double dummy cold :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzvp: i sent a kibitz in mission to ask...|pg||
nt|donatoru: no, i said 3@c = 9-11 4 cards , or 10-11 3 cards raise S didnt promised 4 cards raise|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|donatoru: and 4@h over 4@d was regresive|pg||
nt|stc: so with 11 and 4 cards in S the slam was OK|pg||
nt|donatoru: sure|pg||
nt|zoridezi: maybe on 10@h he will play K@h as well |pg||
nt|vugraphzvp: with cluj 2 - kovacs|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvq: hoping for a 5@c or 5@d response?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: but sometimes it pushes opps in a slam they wouldn t have found otherwise:)|pg||
nt|florentin: and West perhaps would do better to bid 5C directly|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: i mean @d ruff or ruffing finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect a @h ruff to hand now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: discard a @d on q@h and concede a@c|pg||
nt|doncapone1: i,m not sure............ could be  invitation  for penalty|pg||
nt|doncapone1: or  unminimal  hand  with 3 cards  fit|pg||
nt|florentin: then, again East must see South attitude before he make a decision  when South can pass such a Dbl|pg||

nt|lazcatluc: he can lose just 1 if he endplays W|pg||
nt|lazcatluc: W can give a ruff & discard if he can read the position correctly|pg||

nt|florentin: how many h in South, after 1C opening?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|h_karluk: @cA then 2 would tell partner to switch lowest suit, @d |pg||
nt|iq007: makeble 4 spades here|pg||
nt|iq007: will they play it?|pg||
nt|doncapone1: lucky slam  from N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|adiqadiq: they make 4 but lets see if they reach|pg||
nt|florentin: 2 quick defensive tricks, 5cards suit   points concentrate   makes East to open|pg||
mb|2D|nt|iq007: Calin Stirbu with the green pullover: http://picasaweb.google.com/BridgeClubBrasov/20101121 5542846272427640818|pg||
nt|florentin: I also like very much Stirbu/Serpoi pair for their attitude on the table   true gentlemen, great fair play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: EW here play a system with a lot of conventions, based on the Kokish sys|pg||
nt|florentin: doubled, even|pg||
mb|2S|nt|florentin: little bit surprised 2NT is not Jacoby   but seems game forcing anyway|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: yes ,EW make 5 in minors|pg||
nt|florentin: depends a lot of 2H meaning|pg||
nt|florentin: if Raluca knows and can tell us|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: or not ..|pg||
nt|doncapone1: about12 %|pg||
mb|3D|nt|stc: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: hello, welcome|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|h_karluk: i guess 4@h now, slam would be an adventure after 3@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too many keycards needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: N wondering if S has J10 @h maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: even so, at teams it s best not to play a slam without an A and based on a finesse :)|pg||
nt|florentin: hello Constantin|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: did not hear|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: only d and not on club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: could be, anyways 2nd seat both vuln weak 2 discussable decision|pg||
nt|florentin: I'm told 2H = weak hand, spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|florentin: vulnerabilty might push |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|florentin: 2S a sign off bid, and 3S trying to show 2suits, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: N looking for trouble, and finding it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: hard to believe N would bid like this|pg||
nt|florentin: if the bidding is true, they just neglected David Burn's rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: ok, 2@h was @s and 5-8 po|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: they neglected ALL RULES !|pg||
nt|florentin: "be sure you have more trumps than opponents"|pg||
mb|p|nt|doncapone1: 6 @S  ? yes  >  but  from E :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: just 3 jacks an ace and a void, not bright chances to resist|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: yes, but S is an agressive bidder usually and she knows that:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think they went up the line right now|pg||
nt|iq007: i guess she needs a guess in diamonds, it's not gonna be easy|pg||
nt|doncapone1: next  easy 12  tricks  :)  with  2-2in trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: well, when partners know each others style then no worries :)|pg||
nt|florentin: this is a little bit unexpected, but very good for E/W|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|doncapone1: let,s  see if  radu play first 10,9 in @C  for  deblo|pg||
nt|doncapone1: but after lead and  trumps  2-2..........easy 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: 2 losers wld jettison to AK @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: yes, father (S) and daughter (N)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: amazing, congratulations :)|pg||
nt|stc: loks like 4 tricks !!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|stc: looks...|pg||
nt|florentin: South marked 6 clubs and 5 spades in North, that's why he passed, I guess|pg||
nt|stc: did S expect something like 6-5 |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: i think he s not in a position to expect anything with that hand|pg||
nt|stc: however with a 2-suiter N would have bid 3@h|pg||
nt|florentin: two good moves, West upgrade, and East fit with A5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|florentin: easy game :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld pitch 2 spades|pg||

pc|dK|nt|andreis: always :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|florentin: yes, a little shaded  but I guess Dbl would be worse|pg||
nt|zoridezi: but problems come into the play when @d will be on the lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzvq: it is ok, if he bid 3M it is stronger|pg||
pc|d8|nt|stc: could be the much needed swing|pg||
nt|stc: W may bid 5@h now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|zoridezi: nope|pg||
nt|adiqadiq: -9 better then slam :)|pg||

nt|doncapone1: oops|pg||
nt|doncapone1: brave  Filip|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|stc: this is the consequnce of 4@c, which was a light overbid|pg||
nt|zoridezi: in this seqvence he should let E to show his hand since he only did once with 4@c and nothing else |pg||
nt|florentin: perhaps West should Dbl   |pg||
nt|zoridezi: 100% the right thing|pg||
nt|florentin: this looks to high|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|iq007: why double with so much in hearts? 5 hearts seems a normal bid|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|iq007: his partner bid 4th level by himself|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|nt|iq007: of course|pg||
