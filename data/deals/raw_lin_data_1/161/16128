nt|kareno: I would imagine they are.  It's a homegrown system, very articulated.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yes they are|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hello all and welcome back to Orlando |pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: Once Russ Ekeblad's system was sort of Bluish, then more Ultimate and now it seems to be unto itself.|pg||
nt|sybarra2: welcome to Ed Shapiro |pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi  everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room can be watched using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and Frank Budia  |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Sui generis for sure.|pg||
nt|othered1: And it includes canape, shorter of two suits often bid first, as here.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: north can rebid 2@H to show a hand that includes a Flannery (4|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S-5@H opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D holding @D length is purely coincidental     2@H=non-force    |pg||
nt|othered1: So, south doesn't have a clear 3@D?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and hello to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: North is limited by not opening 1 strong @C|pg||
nt|frankaus: Les Bart - known as the inventor of the bart convention|pg||
nt|frankaus: details - http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Bart.html|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|othered1: And indeed it looks like Flannery was employed in the CR, and west (Zia) simply punted 3N, successfully.|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D is really going for the gusto, but north can infer @S shortness in south and since he,  himself, doesn't promise long @D . . . |pg||
nt|frankaus: this is likely to make and tighten the match|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: It does need little more than the @C hook|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Will make with a heart lead of course|pg||
nt|othered1: He and Hanna have quite different evaluations of the west hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Hanna treated it as a strong takeout double, one-suited.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: And maybe not even that, if other thinks are right (trumps and @H)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: So the spade goes away|pg||
nt|othered1: @S lead might have beaten this, though I don't know why north should h ave found it on this auction|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: No, it does need the finesse|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, (a) 6+@C, 1-suit  (b) 4+@C & 5+@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: East's flat 16 count is anything but a 1N opening.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Not flat - two-suited.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so RR opens 1@D promising 0+@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they push to 5@C here |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kareno: If the suits were diamonds and hearts you might, however, want to open 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: Just beginning a canape auction, in which case he'll likely imply secondary @D.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: That's how I see it, too, but most of the world seems to think that anything without a singleton is balanced :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm  i thought 2@S  was FG, 5@H|pg||
nt|othered1: If south gets to 5@C, will east make a Lightner double for the @D lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: GF with 4@H|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kareno: 5 diamonds and 4 hearts that is|pg||
nt|kareno: I would say that a balanced hand has no more than one doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Certainly if you evaluate the hand as worth game over a single raise, even a constructivish raise, 1N is an underbid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: a bird in the hand - |pg||
nt|othered1: Another hand on which the NS system hasn't shined brightly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diplomatically speaking   5@D is non-optimal|pg||
nt|frankaus: X may get them to @C|pg||
nt|othered1: But they're gonna do better than -800.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but neither game making|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: It does look like the wheels came off in CR.  Getting to 5@C, down on @D ruff, is just unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra2: it was 6 @C |pg||
nt|othered1: right, and that's not unlucky -- only the price|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if i didn't have bad luck .... i'd have no luck at all     [sorry i couldn't resist]|pg||

pc|cA|pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra2: interesting question Frank |pg||
nt|othered1: It's pretty early in the event for people to be tired enough to miss that . . .|pg||
nt|frankaus: it is seniors - we can miss red on red :)|pg||
nt|othered1: But it was deuce after deuce.|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: not zia's style to use a 2-suited gadget on that hand even if he had one available|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: he doesn't like telling everyone what he has :)|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt from south now|pg||
nt|athene: unusual|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: he doesn't want to bid 5@D because it's hard for partner to bid 5@C over that|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, some diamond ruffs possible.  If north chooses diamonds that won't be good either|pg||
nt|kareno: 4nt showing 2 places to play.|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty nice hand |pg||
nt|athene: but in this situation you allow for partner to have stretched if he is short in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Now Zia should be getting the picture of south's hand.|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know whether north will go for clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if he takes a very long time about it zia might well work out what is going on and diagnose the diamond void opposite|pg||
nt|athene: of course 4nt just shows clubs and a red suit; might not be diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: The tournament schedule is available at www.acbl.org|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think south should just bid 5@H with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: because you might be way better off in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: as a spectator points out, zia might lead the @SK against 5@C and if so i guess hamman will have to work out which spade says "i have a diamond void!"|pg||
nt|athene: if north wants to play clubs he bids 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, Zia took that long to pass|pg||
nt|athene: if he wants to play in south's red suit he bids 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: and south corrects if he actually has hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Yes, Zia took that long to pass|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|athene: ouch|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: no lightner double from Hamman!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: apparently didnt have to |pg||
nt|kareno: Zia has it worked out though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i know rosenberg used to "complain" that zia routinely would not make lightner doubles for fear of pushing opps into 6nt or something - if he had a void he expected rosenberg to ...|pg||
nt|athene: find it unaided|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: it looks as though zia-hamman have the same philosophy|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: Or not ...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: ok :) zia might still have the same philosophy but hamman takes the obvious route|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Is not clear if the double was lightner or simply penalty|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: Isn't that a bit light in high cards for south's opening in their system?  I guess extra shape is why|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|othered1: 11@S and a need for NS to cash out against game and they were blown out of the auction|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|othered1: Another hand where the opening chosen is a matter of style, outside of @C systems.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zia in 4@S after same start|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|othered1: No big @C, just an off-shape 1n|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think you'd need all fingers from 1 hand to count top pairs who open 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: There's the same hand as earlier.  Not 1nt IMO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: east has a pretty grungy 12 count.  Wonder if he was going to treat it as forcing or invitational|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: karen are you opening 1 @H with S?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: Always and ever|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: And I continue to agree with you.  But in a stylized artificial club system with relays, etc., you sometimes have to bid 1N to plug a system hole.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's much the same hand that east had earlier and opened 1@h|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Untimate @C -- and south was involved in its development -- required some funny 1N openings|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like the pattern for 1 nt,     5422 |pg||
nt|sybarra: so I am a 1 @H bidder |pg||
nt|sybarra: (among other reasons)|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm told south can't open 1@h.  It's either 1nt or forcing club|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: But you're not playing their system :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|sK|nt|kareno: And, Ed, I won't likely ever do that :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe an underbid of a 2@H opening here, too?  doesn't seem compatible with the last hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: let's start a pool -- how many more hands will suffer  5-0 trump split|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south showed 1 or 3 hearts, zias cue bid tells which, so defense not difficult|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in this sort of position you can lead clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: through south|pg||
nt|kareno: In this  case, count and attitude same thing.  I don't give count with Q in dummy, just attitude.  Count at 5 lev el or higher though.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Their own|pg||
nt|othered1: some play that after the double of stayman or transfer, south's first obligation is to focus on whether the doubled suit is stopped.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: double ususally shows defense in at least one of the promised suits.  Perhaps NS play that differently|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w off to a good start |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lebi-Hanna play weak NT -- that explains the 1@C opening    i'm still searching for explanation of Ekeblad's 2@C instead of transfer :(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|othered1: A major theft by Hamman when south decided not to take the sure beat|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: Again I'm told: actually 1@H is non-force!, could be 3@H   and 1N could be 3/4@H [but always 2/3@S]|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: King by south presents west with a real problem|pg||

nt|kareno: East unblocking but west is out of spades.|pg||
nt|othered1: Wonder if they'll find the 24 point game in CR and, maybe without @D opening, may have some problems|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|othered1: I'm told they are in 3N with @D lead|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: yes in other room Ed |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible that 2N will make 3 and 3N make 2, not an  uncommon result since defender's objectives are different|pg||
nt|bg: whatever the jack meant it did not work now E has minor problem|pg||

nt|athene: of course it might go 1nt - 2@D; 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: now i suppose north just doubles to show values and south can either pass or bid 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h was some sort of fit jump I suppose so n/s were headed for 3nt.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|othered1: 4-card major, potentially canape (a longer suit elsewhere)|pg||

nt|sybarra: but the only made 4 in the other room |pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Some who play 5-card majors would open 1@S with west hand, thought that's a non-standard style|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: I think Steve Robinson is the flag carrier for -- if you don't open a Major, you don't have one|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: There may have been reasons to take the game, since they weren't in slam and south was unlikely to have opened 1@H.  Perhaps a low @H lead.|pg||

nt|athene: i guess he wants to show 8 of his cards rather than just 5|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: interesting decision for zia now - do you go ahead and bid out your 2-suiter even though an opponent promised length in your second suit?|pg||
nt|kareno: I prefer double also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there was a case for opening 1@S with zia hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfe: That board 55 was a 21 IMP swing.   |pg||
mb|3H|mb|4N|nt|athene: zia will have visions of lots of clubs now|pg||
nt|kareno: Not really, Martin, not in my opinion anyway.  I will say that Steve Robinson advocates it though.|pg||
nt|athene: he just doesn't want his partner to have something really sick like three small in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well it would have identified there best contract of 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: zia hopes for spades 2-2 in north and east - he knows they will be easy to ruff good because the shortage is under dummy so no danger of overruffs|pg||
nt|kareno: He doesn't imagine east with three spades.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorting out the spade length of both hands after opening 1@C is tough, and zia hand strong enough to handle two over one response|pg||
nt|athene: also of course hamman could have only one spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Board 61, Open Room bid and made 4H|pg||
nt|athene: zia probably hoping/expecting 3@C to promise four|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kareno: So a possible pickup of half the difference in the match on this board.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: Now I would say the match is out of reach.|pg||
nt|athene: he needs pitches for three spades - @DK109 tight i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: is there any other hope?|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @DK10x|pg||
nt|athene: he has the nine himself|pg||
nt|athene: well he could play to pin @D10xx with north|pg||
nt|athene: but of course needs a club break as well|pg||
nt|athene: it really has been a bit odd how often trumps have broken badly this set|pg||
nt|kareno: And only one club overtake to dummy - can perhaps set up diamonds but cannot get there to cash them.|pg||
nt|athene: yes, even 2-2 trumps is not two entries because east has nothing to ruff|pg||
nt|athene: curse that 3-card spade holding!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: Would south cover the spade nine?  But even that won't work with the diamond entry killed at trick two.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks close to me Ed, so   what single small change to East hand would justify PASS rather than 3@C|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H bid and made on 61 just finishes things|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|athene: that was the one with the weak-2 where you need the really nice diamond layout when the defence attack the spades|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well bid, thanks everybody, and congrats to those easterners for maintaining Lord Grey's cup|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|athene: hamman doesn't cash @SAK because if trumps ARE 3-1 he really doesn't want to allow the defenders to draw a third round|pg||
nt|athene: the hand could fall apart very badly if that happened|pg||
nt|athene: also if diamonds break badly he might be trying to limit the damage|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: normally with this suit you want to finesse the ten first just in case south has @DQJx|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: but that is only in a vacuum|pg||
nt|athene: often there are tactical considerations which make it better to just lead to the king|pg||
nt|kareno: They can take three tricks now but that is all.|pg||
nt|athene: for example the possibility of a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but hamman doesn't mind losing @DA, diamond ruff because now the trumps are coming in|pg||
nt|kareno: Congratulations to Meltzer and especially to Bob Hamman for that spectacular hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to our wonderful Operator for a job very well done!|pg||
nt|athene: declarer in the other room faced much the same decision and cashed one trump then led to the @DK, so 11 tricks|pg||
