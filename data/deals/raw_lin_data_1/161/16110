pc|sQ|nt|thorvald: At board 13 Norris-Dahl managed to get into the bidding, that did cost 9 imps, so Iversen now in the lead|pg||

nt|sommer: who gets first to NT now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jron: EW, bec NS play weak NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sommer: yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jron: E D first, probably intending to rebid 1N |pg||
nt|sommer: with 15-17 NS, my question would be easy to answer:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jron: showing 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: problem East hand - double initially, or 1@D and double later |pg||
pc|c6|nt|sommer: this is makeable - lets see|pg||
nt|sommer: 8 tricks maybe, even|pg||
nt|jron: I would dbl first any day w such a strong hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|sommer: agree Jacob|pg||
nt|sommer: @D10 will soon create a shortening in N, he will not like a lot|pg||
nt|jron: better to play @CJ to deny dec a entry to dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||

pc|d6|nt|jron: nicely ducked by Røjel to keep him at home and giving N an opportunity to discard a club|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|sommer: @S endplay to avoid the 8th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: S will get this one right -- knows E only has 3@ss after the bidding|pg||
