mb|2D!|mb|d|mb|p!|nt|vugraphzwh: Pass = maybe we should play 2@d DBL|pg||
nt|jron: 2@D weak Multi less than 8|pg||
mb|6N|nt|pelu: now 3@D by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even changing a small club to a small diamond, migth make North think twice befor opening 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 6nt = "practical bridge" :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Practical, and missing a grand|pg||
nt|pelu: "missing"|pg||

nt|oleberg: 7NT is the percentage contract|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|oleberg: But if you play in a suit contract, the risk of a ruff on the opening lead, will very often bring the chance below the required 58%|pg||
nt|oleberg: The 70% you mention, is the number for total points|pg||
mb|d!|mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzwh: 2@s = Pass-correct|pg||

nt|pelu: now D + 2NT sh be scramble|pg||

nt|pelu: but as N over the 2. D by S I would bid 4@C - for sure pd has both black suits and max 2 card @h|pg||

nt|vugraphzwg: yes 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: discussing if 5c could be a winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello: Dahl is a conservativ bidder , but|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|thorvald: On the south hand you would like to bid 2,5 @S here, in OR South settled for 2QS|pg||
nt|dkkello: even he open this one a spade|pg||
mb|r|mb|1N|an|0-5|mb|p|mb|2C|an|if minimum he has to bid 2c|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|thorvald: The 10 tricks wil just be easy if declarer plays it straight-forward|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|thorvald: I don't like the NS bidding, but hard to EW to double|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: But this might bring Iversen in the lead|pg||
nt|thorvald: Until now this session have seen a lot of small pickups from Iversen, so they will be in the lead after this session|pg||
nt|dkkello: Norris is a strong man , since he could bid 3 NT i think |pg||
nt|thorvald: Are NS switched or did you correct that Peter ?|pg||
nt|dkkello: Dahl did pass over 1 NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Perhaps he thougth Dahl had better cards for his 3c? Though with better cards he had probably doubled 1nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|oleberg: South migth have a difficult decicsion|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: how would you continue from here Ole|pg||
nt|oleberg: Moving seems obvious, but the question is how?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S = 7 tricks - so-and-so - S has 4½ trick = 12 - so just bid 6@S|pg||
nt|jron: You lack an invitational bid, so bidding 4N seems like the only possibility|pg||
nt|oleberg: This is one of the sequences where one of my pet-conventions would work'|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|oleberg: 4NT showing 3 aces, initiating cuebids|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: 5@S = 2 aces and @sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@s = AKQ|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|oleberg: the problem with the South hand is, that 6@S migth be to high, and 7! migth be laydown|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: "I almost had a 4@s opening myself" said Ib when he showed the dummy :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzwg: Thank you to Thorvald |pg||
nt|thorvald: And the last board in this segment is a partscore, and 3QD looks like a good score for EW|pg||
nt|thorvald: Iversen gained 6 imp on Board 12, where NS in this room never got into the bidding|pg||
nt|dkkello: will houmøller preemp|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: This is last board of the session. Thank you all - and thank you to Kjeld and Thorvald|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: And 5 imp on this one, and now a slam with all aces but only 12 tricks|pg||

nt|dkkello: it is to early in Denmark for Norris to look for a grand ? :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|thorvald: Now showing 5@D - 6@C and a good hand, but Houmøller wont go anywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: Houmøller does not like it |pg||
nt|vugraphzwg: He says: I have good fit - for spades and hearts|pg||
