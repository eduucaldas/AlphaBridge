mb|p|nt|caitlin: sorry 5@S here........|pg||
nt|caitlin: why 6@C?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: Even with a positive response I don't show that sort of spade suit on the first round.  I'm not sure what 2@s shows, probably an ace and a king.|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@S, of course, is a much better contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kareno: Yes blockage galore.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Karen, it's not worth showing that ragged suit.  now, though, it's hard to get to the better contract of 6@S (though 6@H will make easily with this distribution)|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s gets 100|pg||
nt|po-s: 6H would be more fun if Qxx in different hands...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Drew wrote that 2@s showed one A and one K and then I think Jim wrote 3 controls ... A + K because then Kit wrote something and Drew shook his head and crossed it out, so that was ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: probably 3 kings?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|kareno: I meant 6@s gets 100 out of 100 on a bidding challenge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Of course it makes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And of course it was Krekorian thinking there, I just hadn't put in Fred|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|warrens:  Krekorian knows that 7@H makes if partner has the @H Q, so he's hoping to get to bid KC in @H's|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I don't think they can get to spades now...|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Stewart pointed at 4@s and Drew shrugged, sort of an "I don't know" gesture, so it wasn't Keycard in hearts I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Or maybe Krekorian thought it was?|pg||
nt|kareno: They'd better not fly too high or their wings will melt :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny how often 2@C openings *don't* give you comfortable auctions.|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, they're just cue-bidding, which is odd without an agreed upon suit.  are @H's implied by the lack of any other suit bid naturally?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: But if Kreko was cue bidding, why not bid 4@d over 4@c?|pg||
nt|kareno: I use 2@h second negative so my auction starts 2@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s natural, forcing, weak suit.|pg||
nt|kareno: And I can get to spades from that point.|pg||

nt|po-s: has anyone shown spades?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: NS say that this was a cue-bidding auction but 4@c was ambiguous, could have been a cue bid for hearts or a second suit - everything else was cue bids and Drew says: "I wasn't sure ...|pg||
