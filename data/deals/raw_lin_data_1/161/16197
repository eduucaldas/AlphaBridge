nt|ahollan1: there's a group of players that play the same set of system notes, but there are minor adjustments within specific partnerships|pg||

nt|ahollan1: most who play 1N Semi-Forcing say that opener will bid UNLESS specifically 5332|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: zagorin leans under the screen and tells Helness "I knew you'd lead a heart"|pg||
nt|kit: not at all clear how declarer should tackle this hand -- he doesn't expect the clubs to split after the 2@C call showing the majors|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: Since East led heart rather than spade declarer will judge that is East's longer major, so will probably go after spades|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|kit: I think he was playing West for something like Q9xx of clubs -- that's why he rode the 6 -- reasonable|pg||

nt|kit: Now he can successfully blast out the spades -- but he doesn't know that|pg||

nt|ritong: one table comparison, a board is lost, won or draw  no matter the difference of points|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the win/loss ratio is completely different from imps scoring, and even from matchpoints|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding and card play principles are similar therefore to match points except that it is more brutal as there si only one comparison no gradation of perecnetage scores|pg||
nt|lestergold: im notm sure how tghis afrfects the tactics|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i think there are differences|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think you mneed to take more risks than at mps because you ahve to win the board rather than aim for 655|pg||
nt|lestergold: 65% etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: point a board specialists seem to make bold decisions at any rate|pg||
nt|ritong: we had a good example here|pg||
nt|ritong: silverstein opened 1 NT with 18, admittedly square|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: The players have had a very short break and will be restarting in a minute or two. |pg||
nt|ritong: at other forms of scoring, this would be a debatable decision|pg||
nt|ritong: here, the idea is to gain field|pg||
nt|lestergold: my son tells me there is no such thing as  a 'bad' 18 and one shouldnever downgrade a no trump opening|pg||
nt|caitlin: An extreme example is this: if you bid and make 7NT and opponents bid and make 3N+4 you STILL only get ONE POINT|pg||
nt|ritong: at fav, opponents can overcall with anything, since the "big number" threat is less awkward|pg||
nt|lestergold: but isnt that similar to mps  but at mps if you make 3n +4 and many others make 3n+3 and one or two make 7N you still get a good score whereas -1 is a bad score at point a board ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: its the max loss as it were|pg||
nt|ritong: and the 1 NT choice restricts this threat of a " lead directing" overcall|pg||
