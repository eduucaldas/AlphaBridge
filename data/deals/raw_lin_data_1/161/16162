nt|ahollan1: i'm thinking sort of as a 2-step to show cards but tenuous trump|pg||
nt|bg: a responsive X not a bad idea reasonably sure to get a plus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then -- what would he do if Stewart bid 3@S  --  maybe that is the problem with DBL|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kareno: I'm told they don't echo to show three trumps but rather use suit preference in trumps.  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Llanden: "100 honors"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: one of the good cases for krekorian is stiff @s 109 with west|pg||
nt|ritong: allowing him to lose zero trick in the suit|pg||
nt|thurston:   really needs @H Aq both onside|pg||
nt|ritong: which could prove useful, considering the whole set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Krekorian asking about carding I think (maybe what the diamond 10 meant) and Gerstman whispered an answer that I couldn't hear and they both sort of chuckled|pg||
nt|kareno: Pitch comes out of the wrong hand and they are mirrored in the round suits.  Too bad but it won't fetch.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but that's not the NS system -- their 2@H is "Precision 2@D" shape  and 2@S is @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do they use 2 h/s as 5 with a 4 or 5 in minor?|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: he s getting angry, seems|pg||
nt|thurston:  likely a duplicated result|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: Drew is getting on his nerves now.|pg||
nt|thurston:  may ahve soem magic here - bid 4@S as save - and make it!|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|ritong: they will bid it in attack|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: and maybe it will turn out as a good save|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: The best kind :)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: you bid contracts to make them, and sometimes the layout says " hey you ve lost the minimum on that hand, you could not score plus"|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks Elizabeth, nice job|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set -- odds makers are taking bets about a final 16 board segment|pg||
nt|ritong: the auction allowed NS to find a remarkable defense on that one|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzfe: at least we didn't get disconnected|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: same start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I bet they play on|pg||
nt|othered1: In case NS don't cash out on opening lead, only GIB (who peeks) would find the winning @D hook for @S discard in 4@H.|pg||
nt|ritong: now if 3@c shows a feature|pg||
nt|ritong: well, no|pg||
nt|ritong: north might lead the @c7|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ritong: disclosing the @c position|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|ritong: then decflarer has to hook @ds|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: bye all thx|pg||
nt|ritong: in 4, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: in 3, is an other story|pg||
nt|ritong: no obvious reason to gamble for the uptrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 3@D was pure Ogust [good suit, bad hand]  or  a medium hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: so, next room, west bid 3@c, likely feature, then east 4@h  north, knowing that declarer was really unlikely to hold the @s K, led the @s A, then @s Q overtaken, trump ace and a @s|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: pretty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if this were BAM -- would declarer risk @D finesse for overtrick?       sorry, but i really do think about things like that|pg||
