nt|joest: @SAxx @HJ10x @DQJxx @CAxx|pg||
nt|joest: he dare not blackwood with two spade losers.   It is a matter of style whether to cue bid 5@c or 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: my money is on the latter|pg||
nt|joest: i would be surprised if he passed though|pg||

nt|joest: on the other hand on a bad day you buy @SQxx @Hxxx @dQJx @cAKxx and godown one in 5 when hearts don't split|pg||
nt|sybarra2: needs very little from pard|pg||
nt|joest: and precision pairs tend to open lots of very bad hands -- and at all colors|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.acbl.org/play/activeEthics.html slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Woolsey could have bid 3@D as artificial ASK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: hard to see table this afternoon as in this room the ac is blowing like a blizzard so have tried to move table|pg||
nt|daman: 5@D exclusion?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=a) FG, 44/(54) @H & @S, not 44(41)  b) slam try (46) @H & @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Puppet Stayman - Used by responder with at least invitational values to discover whether opener's Notrump bid may consist of a 5 card major suit.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fred didn't really PASS 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: director warning for slow play already given|pg||
nt|daman: East did not pass 3@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I guess several variations of Puppet Stayman are in use. |pg||
nt|daman: Deborah?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: they are being very serious about slow play at the tournament this year and I have seen and heard many people already have gotten penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally new concept for ACBL|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortly the ACBL tells : Remember: Slow play is subject to penalty, and the penalties are well earned when slow pairs disrupt the normal progression of the game. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: writing notes on both sides of table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: screen rules|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D Exclusion  Key Card|pg||
nt|daman: scrollup Al|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|joest: btw on the previous hand they did make the doubled overtrick, closing the gap to 13|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: Exclusion Keycard Blackwood is a continuation and extenuation of the Roman Key Card Blackwood convention.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yours was a question George :)|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah was confirmation :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   missed that|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: This conventional method is initiated: 1. After establishing the trump suit. 2. By a jump bid higher than game level in an unbid suit or  3. In a suit bid by the opponents. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H is a mystery|pg||
nt|daman: I wasn't sure if there was enough room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: Hamdi    TMI    we need to follow the hand|pg||
nt|joest: over leaping Michaels, west raised to 5@d so this should be 650 vs 600 and 2 more imps to Morse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|daman: 3@C was not on my radar|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this is the kind of hand where if you are looking for a swing you might just raise to 3NT with Kit's hand|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: is 2 @D game force? or transfer ?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|joest: the diamond opening lead will speed up the play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=limited strength 2+@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: but a 5332 hand with lots of queens is not a very great hand.  2@h is well within the realm of reason|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I might bid 2 @D as raise (if permitted)  but with artificial diamond,  may be too confusing |pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 2@s <un vs un> in prev hand as South , around 14- almost 17 : J-Ktx-Axx-AQTxxx|pg||

nt|bucheister: might be a squeeze for 4 if they do not cash; which they certainly should|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 9 tricks here would be very good play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think defense can prevail after @C10 wins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think defense must go  @S, @S, @S ruff, @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not easy at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D first doesn't work because then defense can't lock declarer in east hand |pg||
nt|joest: i think it's odds against your partner will have both length and sufficient strength for you to get in to run your suit as north|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfg: Kit is annoyed at himself|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: and 1@h>1N was (5+ @s F1)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bucheister: still a beat but S must switch to D not spades|pg||
nt|joest: they bid to 4@h with no double in the closed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: 4@H -2 in the CR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yesterday evening Melih in Lynch team <another Turkish guy> showed us still 2@d flannery fans|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|sybarra2: K of @D on table now |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: low diamond instead|pg||
nt|joest: assuming north-south play normal signals and that a low spade discouraged|pg||
nt|sybarra2: would hate to see that run to the 9  |pg||
nt|sybarra2: that=@D |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra2: he is listening to you Jack|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|joest: often not a good thing|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bucheister: he is listerning to his partner|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|daman: East Q bid 2@S in the CR|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: some kibs point out that a spade back there beats it 2. True double dummy but that would be a horrendous play if declarer had Kx and not Qx of spades|pg||
nt|sybarra2: S may get end played in spades on ht lead? |pg||
nt|bucheister: I wonder if N is asking whether Kit knows it is his play|pg||
nt|joest: touche|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|joest: declarer escapes for down one if he hops up with this trick and endplays south.  Right, shirley|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: that was Bob's way|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hK|pg||

nt|vugraphzfg: Was it too cold or too warm before?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe this one likely would be a flat board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but, but, but   what was the defense??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: last board thanks for joining us today|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: thank you ACBL and USBF and BBO for bringing the broadcast to you semi live today due to crashes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Debbie -- and please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we just say thx to operator and Jan Martel |pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx to Debbie Hyatt, our terrific operator |pg||
nt|bucheister: how low does 2D go?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and to Jan Martel organizing the operators |pg||
nt|joest: thx debbie|pg||
nt|joest: this low|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Debbie has escaped to compare with her team (Meltzer), but I will pass on your thanks|pg||
mb|2D!|an|WEak 2 bid in a Major|nt|daman: too cold|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and thanks Jack and John,  for joining in for this set  |pg||
nt|bucheister: and to the operator who is greeaat|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and of courrse thx to our specs for your great comments|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: Only Kit, of course, opens this one a weak 2 bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: how else do you get to 4S|pg||
nt|joest: well it makes it harder to get to the 27 HCP 3NT they reached in the closed room, particularly when Stewart ups the ante right now|pg||
nt|sybarra2: and vul at that |pg||
nt|bucheister: I think the ante is 4S|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Pass or correct|nt|h_karluk: we are told by Debbie she was having hard times :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match   Zia [south] went down in 5@D   Drew Casen made overtrick in 3N even after @S lead|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra2: 2 @S says if your suit is hts,  I have a better hand for you |pg||
nt|joest: now a tough bid for south and 3@h is as practical a solution as any|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: With this pair, 2@s can also be a hand that wants to get out in a minor|pg||
mb|p!|an|spades|nt|daman: last board of this set    Thanks to Debbie Hiatt and Jan Martel   thanks to Hamdi for joining me|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: It's blowing like an arctic gale :). Hopefully we'll get it fixed at the break|pg||
nt|joest: the downside: east is known to like hearts b/c he bid 2@s as pass or correct, not 2@h|pg||
nt|bucheister: I still like leaping Michaels in this auction|pg||
nt|joest: so do i|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if there are any believers in the audience  ---  please pray to the bridge gods for better connectivity in the 2nd half|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: is this right?|pg||
nt|joest: or did north raise to 4@h and east double?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: is this true? |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or did we miss a pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: No, I put in an extra pass :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|joest: this will not be the note Dovell would have wished to end on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: And will justify Kit's theory about opening Multi any time he can!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: anytime boss, a pleasure, thanks all, please visit us again|pg||
nt|daman: the vugraph sked for interested parties     http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: The next set will start shortly after the last table finishes this set - with both matches playing the same hands, we can't start either one early|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to the ACBL for permitting us to broadcast these events|pg||
nt|h_karluk: indeed, nice job|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to fred and BBO for giving us the tools to bring it to everyone|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: except for the last hand     brady and Gunnell did not drop much if anything    they were rock solid|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: that's true, seems they need to warm up a little bit more :)|pg||
nt|daman: they can get a trump promo in @Ds?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends, you know|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: @D to Ace   D Queen overtake with the King    @D|pg||

nt|daman: they earned these IMPs    Bravo John Brady|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed, deserved a round applause|pg||
nt|daman: makes it a 2 IMP match   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I wish I could tell John there's nothing he can do, but of course I can't|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|thurston:  with @S as they are, 3Nt comes home and is likeiest game for NS to reach|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eamongall: NS will survive in 3NT after holding up to 3rd round of @Ss or getting a low @S lead (unlikely from West) |pg||
mb|p|nt|thurston:  2 @D = new minor, maybe as a game force, N will deny 3 @H and S will likely close up shop in 3Nt (maybe 3 @D)|pg||
nt|thurston:  getting in dangerous waters now - 5 @D down on @C ruff|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 5@Ds is a possibility but 4-1 @D and some communication issues|pg||
nt|thurston:  ruff is teh big issue|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: smparnes ... uhoh noted @C ruff ends any 5@Ds pretty quick |pg||
pc|d8|nt|eamongall: so we play 3Nt and no @S lead so even galligan declarer skills can make this |pg||
