mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia has the 4@h card out but hasn't actually put it on the tray yet - sort of thinking about it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i was just going to poll Caitlin and Jan -- do you use 2@H or 2N as the catchall rebid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|caitlin: if you don't play the way I do (and many don't) N has to rebid a five card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I have a friend who has been experimenting with a flip-flop where 2@H=catchall and 2N=6+@H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I always think you can learn a lot by trying to figure out what an expert like Hamman is thinking about - what things is he worrying about or planning for or??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're trying to compare results from the Lynch-Dovell match   Don't Bother   we're playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Looks like 5 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 spade and at least 1 diamond - is he deciding whether to go for diamonds splitting or hook the ten (after all, most W's would duck the K with the Ax ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: or Axx, but couldn't with stiff A)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, the room is too small to play the same boards in all the matches. Tomorrow we'll have the same boards in both semi-final matches|pg||
