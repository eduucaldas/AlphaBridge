pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|djneill:  as playing  a 4-3 fit is not too good, North's 3@h should be forcing to game, just confirming the fit along the way in case South has 5@h, though one would think South would have a checkback available with 5@h|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|djneill:  after the deluge of spades, the count will be rectified (lost 3 tricks, have 9) and a squeeze in @h-@d is an option that happens to work, though there is no risk in the @d finesse since West is out of @s at that point|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

mb|4S|nt|bucheister: Certainly not a text book weak two but still effective.|pg||
nt|djneill:  this 24 HCP though is a bad mesh, does not do very well in 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2@h response was pass/correct, and West is supposed to Pass with @h, or bid @s with @s|pg||
nt|bucheister: North might have upgraded that hand to  15 and bid 2nt and that would have led to 3nt|pg||

nt|djneill:  rising with the @hA would work if diamonds are not so wild, but the problem with that is it turns into a crossruff and I don't think that North being short in hearts will let that work|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2D|nt|djneill:  North can't rebid 1NT now, as that would be 15-17|pg||
nt|djneill:  weak NT, and South does not have the defensive convention to show this type of hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|djneill:  e.g. X = 15+, 2@c = majors, 2@d = one major, 2M = 5M + 4+m would not allow South to show 5@d-4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: plausible alternative auction: 1C-1N-3N, making on double spades hook if W views it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill:  the 2@h was great since now South can't show the good 3@c raise here (may be same hand without the @cK)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wait that is rot, need another entry for long spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still 1N does seem just a trifle unabitious with 2C HCP...|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not easy to find but 3nt. Normal still is 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  ouch, setting up a @h for North, but the @dJ is always onside anyways|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  I think West should have used 2@c Stayman but it is definitely rational to play 1NT with that honor structure|pg||
nt|djneill:  longest and strongest strikes North and South is thinking of how to get down 2 out of this after 5@d-2@h|pg||
nt|djneill:  if 1NT is 11-14, then North is now marked for 0-3 more HCP, so if South chooses to exit passively it could mean 7 black tricks for East so South will definitely cash out|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  (down 1, not completely blood free)|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok West must be playing Polish then, with 1@d natural up to 17 HCP|pg||
nt|andy_h: This looks to be another flat partscore hand - not something team Melbourne wants at the moment, but there are still quite a few boards to score up|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  North chooses a non-standard 1@h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|djneill:  East can raise a natural unbalanced 1@d with just 3, one of the advantages of the approach|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|andy_h: Interesting decision Henbest now has. With an ordinary 18 count with only 1 ace and only 1 diamond stopper, does he really want to bid 1NT?|pg||
