nt|chilloncan: without 7 of diamonds, attacking that suit is more or less going for 33 break. ducking first heart and attacking spades makes u heavy favorite to get an 8th trick in spades, and ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: playing the last two rounds of spades (or last one) may put pressure on opps|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: director has urged table to play faster|pg||
nt|mwigor: going back to the slam - i think ducking the club lead is 63% and playing for 4-3 trumps is 62%|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|mwigor: so any small feeling about the lead (ie that it is a singleton) is enough to swing it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: on that hand moss also lead a @C and Kamil took the same line as Ish for -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes it is tricky to know how to assess the likelihood of singleton from the fact that a club was led, as the auction made that lead a substantial favorite to hit the baize|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|mrdct: when hampson delcarer in 6@s, he got a @h lead and could simply duck that and easily cater for @S5-2|pg||

nt|poohbear: 3@c puppet Stayman . Asks for 5 card major ( guessing )|pg||
nt|poohbear: guessing not :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  note for those of you scoring at home as they say that with strong semi blanced hands with singleton K , it is often best to bid it as if balanced|pg||
nt|algraves:  singleton K as good as doubleton as support and as declarer many holdings provide a stopper not withstanding they lead away from their ace|pg||
nt|wolkowitz: North will hardly suspect that his powerful 5-card suit is worth 6 tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: i wonder what south's plan is?|pg||
nt|wolkowitz: 3@h may be 4 or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|wolkowitz: if they're playing some kind of Romex|pg||
nt|algraves:  well 5@D is a routine make|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|wolkowitz: in that case, South may be thinking of asking or just raising and hoping that the singleton will help 4@h play better than 3N|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: writing notes to Curtis|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|johnlowell:  Board 25 looks like 7 or 8 (on non-@S lead) IMPs to Kang as their teammates found 5@D|pg||

nt|poohbear: all low level dbls takeout when no fit established|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnlowell:  2@C is a puppet to 2@D, here to play, but could have started an invitational sequence|pg||
nt|algraves:  not showing the spades is a huge position|pg||
nt|poohbear: as i mentioned before, the problem with " crash"|pg||
nt|algraves:  Curtis is worried about the vulnerability and adverse distribution|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He is think hard and squinting his eyes|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|poohbear: oops|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|kjadams: expect the spade bid showed 4.|pg||
