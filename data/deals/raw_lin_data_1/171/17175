mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mcarroll: Closed seem to have skipped board 18|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugraphzza: We are having constant connection problem so i am sure it will appear shortly!|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they get there....|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: I like the idea of 2@S here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos:  it's certainly worked out ok for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: east needed to bid 2@h over 1@S as was passed hand could hardly come to grief|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|sharkey: The dominant team in the preliminary rounds, Israeli Juniors, playing Sweden|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: why double he has one suit he needs to show|pg||
nt|lestergold: it worked out ok because east failed to take advanatage of the space he was offered had north originally bid 2@s east was not good enuf to try 3@H|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: its not always going to be a laydown game but even a part score swing is poor allowing n/s to play in 2@s when 3@H is an easy ride|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT may very well be copied next door - hard to see any other contract being played.  But - never know...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|h5|nt|greerm: usually a sequence like that indicates a weaker hand in North, trying to wriggle intoo something safer than 1NT|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mcarroll: True enough, dummy was an unwelcome sight |pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: what gets into trouble is allowing opps to by hand cheaply and easily|pg||

mb|1D|nt|greerm: Wales can get 170 VPs by winning this match by 59 imps, whcih is quite achievable|pg||
