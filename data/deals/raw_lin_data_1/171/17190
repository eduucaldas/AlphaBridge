pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: simon does seem reluctant to declare - perhaps with better reason this time|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W has implied a 3 card spade holding so some might think he could bid 3S expecting 5 from E. but W has bid his hand, so can leave next move to E|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: np Michael we appreciate your efforts on vugraph, I will chase others for scores|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will this start 1@S-2@C?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = forcing 1 round [as are all 1 level suit openings]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chilloncan: yes sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually 14+ HCP, includes most Strong NT hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: will Ish get creative?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes Al top marks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: tough hand good defence this looks a bit of a coffee hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I could say that i miss playing Acol -- but it would be a lie|pg||
nt|timb: yes - they are playing a version of "Melbourne Acol", originally brought to the ACT by Ron Cook |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like an IMP to Hans|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe in Oz, but over here it is a shiraz hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 3@D must have promised fit  [makes sense by passed hand even if never clearly talked about]|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2H has something going for it, but it is dangerous in a way that is often overlooked. when a preempt is this pure, it risks pushing opps to a gane they can make because their hands ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: are pure too. at the ame time, there is a different danger in holding too much defense for a preempt: shortish long suit, side singleton, and ace of long suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told one table in Women's match    3@Hx -800|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Modern Acol is good Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: however -- in [bridge] formative years, i think i learned a TON reading ACOL texts|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seems 500 should be max -- but we'll see|pg||
nt|timb: A novel feature is that 1@H,1@S:2@C & 2D as forcing as a jump to 3@C or 3@D would be a splinter in support of spades |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  did Hinge really open 1N  or was it  operator catch-up from the early connection glitches|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i also have no control over the speed of the play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|mrdct: north needs to play a couple of @hs through|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tim, for some reason i just started reading Howard's version of NSW System -- didn't that use the single jump shift as shortness too??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: seems Jacobs cashing too many tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at @DK  what was the rush??|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: a couple of pairs in the Hans team don't play all of the national events, so it make sense that they didn't accumulte the maximimum PQPs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: very disciplined pass by Jacobs|pg||
nt|mrdct: in NS system his only option would be 3@S i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that depends on who is formulatinfg the rules that contitute the discipline|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or higher :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: this is more of a challenge|pg||
nt|chilloncan: cannot see point of 2S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chilloncan: not best time for a speculative double of stay,man:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobs could NOT open 3rd seat 1@H  [forcing] but might have tried tactical 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 2@H = 10-13 HCP, 5@H unbal, but in 3rd seat can be 5332 and weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: or puppet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it takes up little room, and pd can hardly read you for this hand. if pd raises that rates only to help opps diagnose degree of fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: well it's unlikely to go for a number and if he happens to fit a fit with partner they are positioned to compete|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS are a little bit hamstrung with no weak 2 available|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i count 7 spades there, so lack of weak 2 not an issue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there aren't many other hands that fit Jacobs' sequence other than hand that others might open with Multi 2@D or Weak 2@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are plenty of such hands, depending on style. for example 64 in majors|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the meantime how does 6@c go?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no longer uncommon for vul weak 2 to include 7 card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this works MUCH better -- IFF Thompson can find @H lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will not go well if thompson hits on the heart lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: true, counting suit lengths has gotten harder as average age of players ever rises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: grateful for the 8@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: doesnt matter given grosvenor can never lead them|pg||
nt|chilloncan: interesting, the alert on 3H suggests that the call does not deny 4H, so responder could becone declarer in that suit. contrary to fundamental premise of puppet|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they play here, bill's 2@s would certainly have been successfulk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney did open North hand with 2@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are playing a variation of the Fantunes system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Ish's DBL vs 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that there are distributions for NS where 3N makes and 4@S is down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me this is just unlucky for Robinson-de Livera|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: lets see how robust the @sK still is as a stopper|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure the EW potential disaster can be linked causally to the NSseuqence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dan Neill put together a file to explain a lot of Fantunes -- but we've already seen some bids that don't fit or aren't listed at all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: also contrary to Hinge's apparent vow not to declare:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: df will cash K@D then take 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i guess @h10 is best now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: cashing @dK wont work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still it is helpful to scope out   http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: those who watched the vanderbilt will remember a board where both tables reached 7@d off the ace of trumps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: tragic punishment|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this 7@d is a lot more unlucky|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dey aint no justice|pg||
nt|mrdct: no great disaster with 2@h the contract in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i make DelMonte DBL instead of 3@C a contributor too|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: neither EW pair covered themselves in glory|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: it is always a disaster when you go down in 3N with slam making|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|stayman|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 5+|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you may not lose IMPs on THAT deal but it is a cumulative MATCH, and the lost opportunity for massive gain  counts everuy bit as much in the tally|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h ruff will beat 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  a @D raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a @d raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems Jacobs will start with 2@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: certainly 3X was an alternative, but if E had been 4522 for example, 2S cou;d have been going for a lot against no game. N was perhaps a favorite to have 4 hearts on the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it is a question of not getting too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: thanks Michael!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d for the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this would be a good board not to have great agremeents|pg||
mb|3S|an|asking for 5!h|nt|ahollan1: or just starting a force?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i went and read what ish had written|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i like 4@c now (assuming its a splinter)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure hope bid was alerted on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ought to be, since 3C forcing after cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now if he didn't hold 3@D  then might be harder for North at trick 1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  7N is 88%. 7@d is a little worse because there could be a ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you could win IMPs playing imn a diamond partial against a really good team|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: surely 7NT is better than 88%|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other match (ladies?) both tables stopped in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2-1 is 76%. 3-0 is 34%|pg||
nt|henryb:  24%|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 110% line, BBO has 10% takeout|pg||
nt|henryb:  3-0 on a specific side is 12%|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thompson would have no trouble signing off with his actual hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- that's really pessimistic|pg||
nt|mrdct: no clear reason for ish to find the @HK lead|pg||

nt|chilloncan: in comparing 7D vs 7N, a lot depends on how many Ds E is known to have. if he can have only 5, then 6D might well make with 7N more problematic|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: easy 4@H |pg||
nt|chilloncan: well there is no question of bidding 5H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5@h looks like down 1|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: after Hinge bid only 2@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence hope to get 1@c, 1@h and 2@s here|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: the Law is jnot that bad.    4S is cold  4H also  when you guess the clubs   and they dont ruff them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 card suits are for playing in|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: the law is only useful if you describe your hand accurately. given the X by N, there is no way for S to assume his side has 10 trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: letting play then 4S  is a big risk.  but NS did not know the big H fit, because N started with D |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: isnt 4@h making even if you lose two club tricks?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: but west's @s pips are good enough to pickup the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: nice duck of the @sA by ben|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I bet the hand gets opened 5@C more than once|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as you and I would Al|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i would like to be able to open the West hand 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (not promising a solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean a normal 4@C/@D opening  [ala Namyats]??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: something along those lines yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that said i dont normally play namyats|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugrapha3: theres some banter at the table about the arrangement of tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: gives ish a losing option of playing north for @SAQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: how?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (why wouldnt he cater to both|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah - you're right michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play started same way in other room  [Edggton also ducking @SA]|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its a good duck because it stops declarer from drawing trumps easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key here isn't so much North's trump holding as finding 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: i knew there was something good about it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- declarer doesn't want to pull trump  so is duck best??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'm sure ish wouldnt draw trumps before he had the hand under control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what he doesn't know -- @D9 is natural winner|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is giving a lot of thought to his choice in hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we can see that ace is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Thompson really didn't have attacking defense if winning @SA|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but its not clear to sih|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ish|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: (in division 1)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H would show 3/4@H  so 3@H must show 4 & MAX|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry hollands are actually called henbest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually that may be unique to Jacobs-Thompson  since Fantunes 2@C can be 6@C & 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: oh well good spot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: of course if Ish had had HTxxx in @d it was down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@C  may mean it could also be Balanced Game Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the best spot is 5@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@h isnt terrible|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: not terrible single-dummy   but looking at all 4 hands is different story|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: can still maybe make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  i'd rather be in 6@C than 4@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: N can reasonably bid 2N with his source of tricks. S will go on to 3N if it is worth a shot. perhaps S was barred on second round|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edggton 1N in 1st seat was pure highway robbery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he handle 4-1@H [with K7] AND losing @C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 6@c is quite good in fact|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he can lose a club and two hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|chilloncan: system may dictate 2N, but uncomfortable to bid it as E when high card structure creates no desire to declare NT from that quadrant|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: @S taps make the @H7 key card|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: if its right to finesse arjuna started with a singleton or void @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: if a singleton why didn't he lead it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thats why jacobs is thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another reason to think -- if fly @CA and @CK does NOT fall -- then what|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Marshall -- i'm a bit surprised you didn't mention 2@H rebid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: uh oh -- now maybe in control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|vugrapha3: always was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and we're back to defense prevailing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think when @CK scored -- @C ruff or @D  sets tempo for defense|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @c ruff gets declarer control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- exit @D  then what does declarer do?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|chilloncan: not sure why. what else would he bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's growing number of pairs who define 2@H as 6+  so that 2N becomes the catchall|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: we would all double with S hand so no critique is intended. but it is worth noting that with alf the points in the short suits held by opponents the offense-to-sefense ratio is ...|pg||
