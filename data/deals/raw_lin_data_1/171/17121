nt|barnets: with the west hand|pg||
nt|barnets: dangerous game|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  declarer will have to decided if S started with QJx or Qx to prevent -500|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: or, perhaps Kamil bid 3@h and Fleisher bid four, but that isn't all that likely either|pg||
nt|warrens:  if so, maybe N is thinking of doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this all seems a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|dburn: my guess is that Kamil bid three of something, then Bakhshi bid 3@s and del Monte gave him four|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  best defense is K and a @D, then cash the @H K, then another @D|pg||

nt|imp_jan: kind of fredin dbl then david|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@S by west wld not be my choice|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, not so likely now (more likely if N had balanced with 3@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: sorry for the confusion, trying to help other table|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably that is what happened indeed, warren|pg||

nt|dburn: but four spades would have made|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chorush: Yes but 4 spades is a better contract and duly will make|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: funny pos, due to the fact that spades break badly u shld avoid 5@C but be in 4@S..|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly a case for East just to bid it, once he finds out West doesn't want to play 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chorush: if Bakhshi tries 3 spades now he will get to 4. If 4 clubs, probably 5C|pg||

nt|hedyg: this bidding cant be right|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I guess @H are more important|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: he looks like he's deciding how to play for 5 diamond tricks|pg||

nt|woozle: defense doing well here - after club ace, club to king (ruffed), trump exit, declarer can be held to seven tricks|pg||

nt|chorush: Just talking with Bigtrain about that. We both agree with you|pg||

nt|chorush: Kamil raised to 4 with a very similar hand in the 1st half|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, even the two level is in some danger|pg||
nt|woozle: looks clear here to lead his trump - Fleisher probably has the stiff diamond because Bakhshi didn't shift to his|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: this is counting on him leading a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@DX goes down 1 trick likely|pg||
nt|hedyg: so N's option was to bid 2@c as p/c or to pass|pg||
nt|xenya: well suppose N leads a heart -- as he probably should? |pg||

nt|dinos1: @h lead - Q - @s ...|pg||
nt|peyret: thinks lot. they can miss the chance|pg||
nt|dinos1: or mb better play @c to Q for N to duck :)|pg||
nt|barnets: only if north plays a @D when in with the @SA and not a second heart|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this is exciting|pg||
nt|algraves:  if east passes NS have to defend very well to avoid giving up some 200 a trick overtricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: also, at trick one the 8 may be slightly unclear as to whether it's his suit or his partner's suit|pg||
nt|peyret: if xx weinstein will not pass. but they can fit on @s|pg||
nt|algraves:  and they were going to go minus in 2@D or 2@S making by EW|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there's enough room for X to be both majors|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have had a couple of minus positions I think he should pass this|pg||

nt|barnets: so this is their third vanderbilt final|pg||
nt|algraves:  the best response was " out there"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: if a penalty double was direct, they play xx is strong, pass asks for xx to run out, and direct bids are 2-suited|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this specific auction is not listed among the information I've seen, but I'd guess that they don't have a strength-showing bid here, since he already had a chance to act|pg||

nt|barnets: pretty good going|pg||
nt|hedyg: Dan is Levin breathing?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C!|an|!d + !s, good hand|nt|barnets: fleisher picked up 7 imps so far this quarter|pg||
mb|d|an|support|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: strangely on 14 e/w played 2@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: needs a little better trumps|pg||
nt|warrens:  a little too high.  not sure why N thought he should jump|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than playing in their 7 card suit|pg||
nt|dinos1: alert - good hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: south shows specifically a good 5-5 by agreement here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: so fleisher will justly gain some more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: north has two very nice cards|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|dinos1: so @dK10 is great. lack of @sJ :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: "justly" is a bit harsh|pg||
nt|tejjyid: r u a supporter?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|barnets: well a 7-1 fit is rather better than a 4-3|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|lc: Well, Fleisher will gain only if they stop in the other room :)|pg||
nt|algraves:  just a pip short of making, without the @S Ten they need opener to have Ax in trumps or someonw with JT coubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: HI larry|pg||
nt|lc: Just the @S10 short of it being an okay game.  Hard to diagnose.|pg||
nt|lc: Hi and bye. :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 6 more imps to fleisher|pg||
nt|tez: bye all|pg||
nt|barnets: down by 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye tez|pg||
nt|ritong: when do we restart operator please?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I don't know|pg||
nt|barnets: we have a close final here|pg||
nt|barnets: they are on board 15 in the closed|pg||
nt|barnets: so have that and no 16 to complete|pg||
nt|barnets: they will then score up and will restart after a short break|pg||
nt|barnets: probably around 25-30 mins|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C!|an|!S-!D|nt|dburn: South at the other table showed both his suits with a cue bd, and North jumped because of his two good cards in those suits|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit offbaord other room  now, they just lack trump 10 or J to have a good play|pg||
mb|d!|an|support|nt|woozle: Ish's double is support for Bakhshi's "suit", no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: the resulting game was not bad - needed the opener to have a doubleton @sA, or someone to have @sJ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|woozle: Kamil might be able to stop if his style makes a 2S bid meaningful here|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher has a plus position on the last board of the set in that they may well go plus.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Kamil still trying to decifer 2@C bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if he thinks it;s natural, his side will get to some game or other|pg||
nt|woozle: It feels like Grue's 3S was an overbid at the other table, particularly after intervention at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: but he seems to have worked it out|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dinos1: he may bid 2@s then accept INV|pg||
nt|woozle: Fleisher headed for a six imp gain here, closing the gap to 5.|pg||
nt|woozle: sorry, 5 imps|pg||
nt|dinos1: 190 = 5|pg||
nt|woozle: so Grue will lead by six at the break|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 5 unlss he makes 4 by some chance|pg||
nt|dburn: errors and omissions excepted, of course - the judiciary may yet have to consider board 10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dinos1: 10 tricks)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|woozle: six imps after all. |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|woozle: It's difficult to love a lead from a doubleton jack of trumps...but leading the jack might have saved the position|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s3|mc|10|nt|ritong: restart soon|pg||
nt|sybarra: and join us then,  its another nail biter |pg||
nt|chorush: Should be a great finish|pg||
