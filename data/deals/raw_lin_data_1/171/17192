nt|kiwibridge: they play xfer responses to 1@C|pg||

mb|1C|nt|007 joosth: 20 trumps here when looking at the Law|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that's upside-down HI|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine 4333 exploring other options|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the 1st match we were boards apart, then 2nd half we played them at same time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|007 joosth: yes  true :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: X an interesting choice|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes   not mine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know Acol 1@C usually delivers 4+ suit ... but  8-bagger??|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chilloncan: aims at a VERY narrow target, when pd can bid 3N AND that is the right spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 4H much better  if you bid 5H now  P will expect a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 4@H |pg||
nt|chilloncan: well there is no question of bidding 5H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5@h looks like down 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so possibly 8 IMPs to Hans|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW can make 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hinge-Morrison in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if you missed 1st match --  Ebery got hammered by Hans|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'll try and get scores from the other match|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: perhaps even 4@s if they can play trumps for 1 loser|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: there are 4 teams in Division 1  they play a Double Round Robin of 20 board matches [2 10-board sets]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all over soon even with @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5@c -300|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: after Hinge bid only 2@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence hope to get 1@c, 1@h and 2@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 2 teams advance to the SemiFinals    bottom 2 teams  play top 2 from Division 2 to fill out Semis|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: the Law is jnot that bad.    4S is cold  4H also  when you guess the clubs   and they dont ruff them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 card suits are for playing in|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|chilloncan: the law is only useful if you describe your hand accurately. given the X by N, there is no way for S to assume his side has 10 trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: letting play then 4S  is a big risk.  but NS did not know the big H fit, because N started with D |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: isnt 4@h making even if you lose two club tricks?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: but west's @s pips are good enough to pickup the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: nice duck of the @sA by ben|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I bet the hand gets opened 5@C more than once|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as you and I would Al|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i would like to be able to open the West hand 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (not promising a solid suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean a normal 4@C/@D opening  [ala Namyats]??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: something along those lines yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that said i dont normally play namyats|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugrapha3: theres some banter at the table about the arrangement of tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: gives ish a losing option of playing north for @SAQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: how?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (why wouldnt he cater to both|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah - you're right michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play started same way in other room  [Edggton also ducking @SA]|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its a good duck because it stops declarer from drawing trumps easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key here isn't so much North's trump holding as finding 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: i knew there was something good about it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- declarer doesn't want to pull trump  so is duck best??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'm sure ish wouldnt draw trumps before he had the hand under control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what he doesn't know -- @D9 is natural winner|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is giving a lot of thought to his choice in hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we can see that ace is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Thompson really didn't have attacking defense if winning @SA|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but its not clear to sih|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would consider this hand too good for that, but we'll get definitive answer after publication of "The Science of Bidding Good 8/9 Card Suits"|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: apparently it was easy for simon|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: (in division 1)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would show 3/4@H  so 3@H must show 4 & MAX|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry hollands are actually called henbest|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: of course if Ish had had HTxxx in @d it was down|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the best spot is 5@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@h isnt terrible|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: not terrible single-dummy   but looking at all 4 hands is different story|pg||

nt|ahollan1: actually  i'd rather be in 6@C than 4@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chilloncan: N can reasonably bid 2N with his source of tricks. S will go on to 3N if it is worth a shot. perhaps S was barred on second round|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edggton 1N in 1st seat was pure highway robbery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he handle 4-1@H [with K7] AND losing @C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 6@c is quite good in fact|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he can lose a club and two hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|chilloncan: system may dictate 2N, but uncomfortable to bid it as E when high card structure creates no desire to declare NT from that quadrant|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: @S taps make the @H7 key card|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: if a singleton why didn't he lead it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thats why jacobs is thinking now|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Marshall -- i'm a bit surprised you didn't mention 2@H rebid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uh oh -- now maybe in control|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|vugrapha3: always was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and we're back to defense prevailing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think when @CK scored -- @C ruff or @D  sets tempo for defense|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @c ruff gets declarer control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- exit @D  then what does declarer do?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|chilloncan: not sure why. what else would he bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's growing number of pairs who define 2@H as 6+  so that 2N becomes the catchall|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense can eventually negate declarer's @C suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now another club|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: if @C  let it win -- it is NEXT @C that gets ruffed -- then you can kill north hand|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1: interesting hand  to analyze|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ruff next club - then what?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy it is interesting -- single dummy it is BRUTAL|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: either set up @sJ or give @d rufff|pg||
