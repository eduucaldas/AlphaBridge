nt|kemperg: AH|pg||

nt|sharkey: 3 NT a winner here|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|kemperg: Anothet nice board|pg||
nt|kemperg: know that from Ivanhoe|pg||
nt|mamos: though these 3NT contracts are not that easy  - it did just seem as if NS didnt really think a great deal about the defence|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sharkey: S wont bid Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is a COMYN room in the Louvre|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 1 @h - 1 @s - 3 NT as a good hand and 3-6 in majors|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yoiu dont fancy anything here|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2@D is some kind of heart raise|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mamos: yes |pg||
mb|1S!|an|3!S|nt|kemperg: my wife would like to go and see so perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe also show that he did not have much defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H04@S|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are in a fiorcing sequence what is wrong with south bidding 3@h to give north a chance to complet his hand description|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kemperg: what''s he hoping for?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: We don''\t know those in Holland :)|pg||

nt|mamos: 1@h or 1@s?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|chick: I would think 2@H by E a reasonable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Yes... good agreement to have for 3rd and 4th postition|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes provided it is forcing|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: often it is not|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: we often see on those types of hands a lazy 3n bid ending the auction not just at junior level i might add|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if they play compulsary double raise with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as pds in agreement..|pg||
nt|kemperg: I play 2@D = @H and 2@H= @D|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a Wald hand also? May we see 4 in a major?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: Looks like a coffee hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: mine is milk and 2 sugars thks!|pg||
nt|kemperg: works well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: transfers usually do|pg||
nt|kemperg: use them a lot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT better from W imo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: transfers are useful for weak hands, but not that valuable when both sides have equal points|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting methods to get to 3 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but landed on feet|pg||
nt|kemperg: I need at least 12 and 12 of them|pg||
nt|kemperg: disagree on that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahalim: @H 3-3, @DK onside, friendly for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes should makje in comfort|pg||
nt|chick: when the distribution of one hand is revealed, it can be better to keep the other one as the concealed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: NS use upside down signals|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: and maybe even "right sided" it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: committed to slam now but......|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: of course we can see the h suit declarer cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: options not too many |pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, esp. after the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think he has to depend on the h suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that 3@s shows a minimum  hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|jbgood: the compulsary jump raise backfired indeed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will soon perk up a bit when they find out about the diamond position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||

nt|sharkey: W may Pass...?|pg||
nt|ahalim: even in NT :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and grand in two|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3NT is code|pg||
nt|kemperg: but what code|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 3NT shows 6@s, says west|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: is 2@C  a suit do we know or just art gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Dennis|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a good contracft but a trump lead with this 4/0 break could run into difiiculties|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot enjoy the K@s|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold 3@C dbled to 3 tricks!|pg||
nt|chick: but a grand relies on 2 finesses, so it's not exactly a good bet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2NT here|pg||
nt|mamos: well South knows that they are in the slam zone |pg||
nt|mamos: some work again for the ninth trick but declarer in control|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: oh well certainly wont handle that|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for East to read it...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: well |pg||
nt|kemperg: only 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: still not good|pg||
nt|mamos: so Im not sure 4@h is wise |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: convention card doesn't say 2@c is relay, so natural presumably|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks horribly nf|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sharkey: I know it sounds ridiculous to suggest Pass with Wests hand but unless E has a long Major game is probably not making|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WOW|pg||
nt|chick: I guess 4@H was forcing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: surprisse mee|pg||
nt|ahalim: there you are|pg||
nt|mamos: there must be something about this auction we dont know|pg||
nt|chick: ya, like a @D void? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a junior bid if i ever saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north bid 7@c, but now he has taken it back and thinking again|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  and who let him take it back ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east joking and replacing south's 4@h with 5@h|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm are juniors allowed to take bids back?|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice try by S - but to no avail|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   not my choice of lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard layout but @H helps.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: on a good day 7@c rolls in|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs 3/2 spade break and clubs 3/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not blame him really |pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a fair spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho perhaps grand slams requiring good breaks in two suits are a little dangerous|pg||
nt|viren169: Meanwhile this wont be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has 26 HCP; S opens and N bids - unless there are 60 HCP in this deck pd is blank !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, but S will have a heavy time|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best start for defence but @Cs have been bid and supported!|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's 3@C not a thing of beaty either..... youthful exhuberance I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an even bigger WOW|pg||
nt|chick: lol  the joke's on North when 7@C makes :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South's 4@H  was  .........  unwise|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: I think N's 3NT took up too much room|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew how he found the @d lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: may have been the NTTT rule |pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: (Next To The Thumb)|pg||
nt|hedyg: nearer to the thumb?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i doubt it|pg||
nt|jbgood: that rule was, is and will always be a joke, Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or as a nice young lady said to me - we play the eenie-meeni-miny-mo lead system|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|kemperg: E should not be unhappy with that lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: 7@c much too good for roland at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: actgually 3/1 in trumps and spades 4/1 still works does it not|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of table will be in 7 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 6 on this layout looks doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: He already knows|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think "we" are recounting our tricks|pg||
nt|ahalim: i bet N can't sleep tonight|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C was your joke Dennis?|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C by South wouldn't have been so crazy |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no, it was really there|pg||

nt|lestergold: spade lead was not obvious?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor did I|pg||
nt|viren169: and another good hand to reward the good play!|pg||
nt|mamos: South finds out his partner has 15-16 balanced or whatever and has  loads of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: officially you can take a bid out of you bidding box and put it back, i believe|pg||
nt|kemperg: another nice hand|pg||

nt|chick: 14 tricks off the top|pg||

mb|1H|nt|lestergold: what a sensational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be written up|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: they will|pg||
nt|sharkey: S had a problem last hand.  Pd did indeed bid 3@C so shud expect more than @CJ - West need not have 26 HCP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5D possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe someone will |pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: Kees Tammens is typing already:)|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 1@S here (prefer dble)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Non Vul agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: X now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: E has passed a 7crd @D , won'do that again|pg||
nt|sybarra: this isnt  pretty |pg||
nt|viren169: normal neg dble by North finds the heart fit for N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Advanced cue of @H|pg||
nt|mamos: I bid 1@S  i find it works out best|pg||
nt|mamos: Spade would have pressured declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzag: as long as your bid is not on the tray|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: need to recover my breath after that needa coffee hand but i dont think this one is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a rather savage roland hand in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: Does N undestand 3@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or is 4@D cue?|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did, |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: both sides alerted 4@d|pg||

nt|sharkey: also 6@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: lucky, but it is|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@D cue agreeing hearts I guess|pg||

nt|sharkey: i suspected that implied @H agreement|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: usuall with A or K in pd's suit|pg||

nt|kemperg: never|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vul at NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 20/20 |pg||
nt|sybarra: between the pairs |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: not first time at least...|pg||
nt|viren169: A/K or Qxx are useful holding|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT by N shud show additional values I think - if N evaluates this way|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect they will reach 6@H now. Both N/S are bidding the spots of the cards!|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@H is enough now... however I cant see South passing|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither side have underbid previously this match so no reason to change now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt N bid 5@H without @HK?|pg||
nt|viren169: West may tap it on the way out  holding AQ of @d|pg||
nt|viren169: North has shown the whole of their hand with dble of 1@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has shown @D honor - may be not Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: No need to bid any more unless requested to do so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: good girl Shirley go to the top of the class|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|viren169: I spot some chances looking at the 4 hands and miss all the chances looking at 1 hand!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another easy game|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p!|an|diamonds|nt|kemperg: No not 6@H bat 7NT|pg||

mb|2H|nt|viren169: a super light opening 3rd in hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: specs tell me they lead 2nd|pg||
nt|kemperg: and made|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but the d suit will never surface|pg||
nt|mamos: EW had better not get too enthuisiastic in Clubs 3@C alrerady too high|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   head in the lions mouth|pg||
nt|kemperg: N had other idees about the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Not sure you have to alert 3rd in hand openings nowadays?!?!|pg||
nt|viren169: Mike, any comment?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E had his colours bid:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: and S decided that he wouldnt support hearts higher than the 2 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe he was right|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh    now West has made an assumption|pg||
nt|mamos: which will turn out to be false|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: will end in 5@S|pg||
nt|mamos: North getting a bit carried away here    presumably 1NT 12-14 ?  or is it 15-17?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will it? I wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: coffe hand at last|pg||
nt|hedyg: with what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to get busy in h|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no double, no trouble.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: No  no need to alert  in England nor in Europe|pg||

nt|rodal f: Shold W check E's hand a bit better by a X?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lestergold: could u find a duller hand than this?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean 3@H with what?|pg||
nt|kemperg: could have been expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: you either have the bid or you dont. he would not have bid it without the 2@s bid, why should he bid it now?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: 3@C looks normal over 2@S by North to me|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 9/10 tricks here in 3@S|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 ty op|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 sensible auctions by the Israelis on    2 and 3 netted 24 IMPs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: must be 15-17 or 14 -16, tostong for 12-14|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ahalim: we have a Mostradamus in our midst :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: @H ow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: what are the odds of QJ doubleton in spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: then only 9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kemperg: you have to somtimes, competitive|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mamos: West and East need to be clear about their agreements :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: not high|pg||
nt|mamos: you might not even make six when QJ is doubleton because you might finesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: but QJx onside is also good enough|pg||
pc|d3|nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: good defense|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@H on bd 15 netted +17 imps!|pg||
nt|viren169: to Israel|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: strange line i must admit afterv spade finesse i would want to ensure my seven tricks withc 3@s @h @c 2@ds before sopeculating with the heart suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes esp. since diamond not led|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart finesse can wait til later for overtrick if it works|pg||
nt|lestergold: first things first rather than rear end about face a sit were|pg||
nt|kemperg: start @D, gives leader wrong route|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|nt|mamos: we crashed during Board 15   seems 6@h was made cant help think that was very lucky|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: sorry private|pg||
nt|viren169: probably the reason we crashed!|pg||
nt|viren169: The Internet could not cope with the bidding!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 6@h made after a spade lead, ruffed. 2 rounds of @h and @d towards the king. When the !q dropped it was claiming time|pg||
nt|kemperg: safetyplay|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: could  go off on this line if clubs were badly placed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not when vulnerable|pg||

nt|mamos: another tricky hand   -- no game for EW|pg||
mb|3C|nt|seb75116: EN Ouest RUFA|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a great contract as it needs both black suits to nehave less than 50%|pg||
nt|mamos: you have some work to do in 5@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: toendra in English I don't know, permafrost?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: sure do|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: too good for Roland of course|pg||

nt|mamos: this looks more comfy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcomyn: noit to mention getting there|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: wow you mean the French made foi gras of the poles|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  will be a big bunch of imps |pg||
nt|viren169: 4@D showing shortage... probably a void|pg||
nt|mamos: tundra is an English word|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Cornelia:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no screens?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: we play with screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: 19 to be exact |pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently tried for the sp ruff |pg||
nt|viren169: agreeing @cs off course|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: again 4@H shown values in the suit usually A or K|pg||
nt|mamos: everyone joining in|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: well 8 tricks whewres the 9th|pg||
nt|mamos: cant see it muyself :)|pg||
nt|mamos: myself|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how South knew this was going off|pg||
nt|mamos: but cant argue with success|pg||
nt|kemperg: will N believe the sign|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: while N thinks, EW are discussing a possible double of 2@H on the last board.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: 7@C with a @D start:)|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of RKCB with a void...|pg||
nt|kemperg: if 4@D was void then a problem now|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N will have the A of spade on the table before any diamond enters his mind!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very wise contract if staying there|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|kemperg: he/she did|pg||
nt|viren169: if the opps reach 7|pg||
nt|kemperg: put that with my favorites|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps sneak through a heart finesse?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: I should say spade cash, and it got ruffed|pg||
nt|kemperg: E trying to get a @D start:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however poor 6@c is its a better spot than 3n !!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: thats it|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|viren169: Now we will see!|pg||
nt|kemperg: of coarse a @S|pg||
nt|viren169: my clock is ticking....|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east explaining 4@d as void, west as shortness|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he switch to d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: 4 sp would work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s would too for that matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: gutsy |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not what the doctor recommended!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: where do they go?|pg||
nt|lestergold: what does 4@h mean?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well these french lads are not slam shy as we have seen|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|viren169: Now my heart  has increased!|pg||
nt|viren169: wd North.... phew!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: if 3@d is splinter showing singleton then 4@d  would show void|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: an accident with the Spades might do it|pg||
nt|mamos: I think declarer should cash four Diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: specs tell me South had to double because Pass was forcing  --  hmmmmm  --  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: they were this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid they have actually reached the correct contract even tho 6@c happens to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets not be result merchants|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get 10/10 in the bidding competition for this|pg||
nt|kemperg: Looks like they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 5 it is much easier to make 6 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its always easy to make 8 when there is a one way no cost finesse available|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead you might even make 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west explaining that his partner should have something like 4351, but will be pleased to see 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: you wouold make 7 no might about it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|kemperg: if they play 2/1 it should be|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|viren169: 4N was a poor choice of bids...|pg||

nt|chick: Movie is right|pg||

nt|hedyg: we will be back at 11:00 am Los Angeles, 2:00 pm New York, 19.00 Paris, 6:00 pm London|pg||
mb|r|nt|lestergold: nothing can keep us on the staright and narrow|pg||
nt|viren169: Nothing really make on this hand but I suspect N/S will climb too high|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for the helpful and kind messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thank you all|pg||
nt|mamos: so despite some opportunities this has been low scoring --  in our last match the total imps were 70+  here just three small swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by Vincent is enough, 2@H or 3@H the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we are at vul Mike. Do we feel this right?|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 2@S by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: boards 17 and 18 still waiting to be played in the OR, have some swing potential there. Otherwise it's been a fairly flat session, yes.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: Dennis, you are doing a great job, we all know yours is the toughest of all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Id bid @s with North  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mamos: so Denmark may get a chunk of imps back|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S has some play... but not much!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west alerted 1@s, but east takes it as natural|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty all, see you again|pg||
nt|kemperg: he will|pg||
nt|rodal f: Back to B15|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 2@D   and certainly dont like it as natural|pg||
nt|kemperg: you think its natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: S alerted it, but saw no alert on the N/E side of the screen|pg||
nt|mamos: wellit didnt show both majors did it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: especially when E/W had bid and supported them!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: more true for you maybe :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 2@S my choice|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: Unlucky that 7@C goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: West knows she wants to bid Hearts :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C is good bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Could be a good board for Canada|pg||
nt|mamos: for me it would ask partner to pick best major|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|mamos: 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: Good hand where everyone has something to say!|pg||
nt|kemperg: they need it|pg||
nt|mamos: it just leads to an unclear auction  South's slow pass suggests he didnt understand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was W thinking, not S.|pg||
nt|mamos: we are going to end up in 3@h in a minute :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: who's thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: ok|pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: right now it's E|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mamos: South has other ideas|pg||
nt|mamos: well this may be better than bidding game|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: six black tricks   ta very much|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S have done well but will lose a few imps when scoring up!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but in 7 can u ever get it right|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: bye all|pg||

nt|rodal f: Tx all. Specs included and see u a next segment.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But not at the table|pg||
pc|c5|nt|viren169: Thanks all... a few entertaining hands!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kemperg: will E give the Q|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|mamos: East's overcall   and West's perfectly reasonable raise have lead to playing far too high a  contract :(|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: thx all,  I have a meeting I have to get to   enjoy the rest of the day :) |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|Walddk4: At least the play will be fast|pg||
