mb|p|nt|andyv:  too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: there is a school of....thought that would not overcall with N hand vecause hearts only five long and  bad shape and esp 3 low spades. but a goil's gotta do what a hunk;s gotta do|pg||

nt|andyv:  N should dbl here|pg||
nt|djneill:  slight problem that if South had spades South might have tried noise at the 1-level with something like...the hand.. she has...|pg||

mb|p|nt|djneill:  let's see about this slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ACOL not the best slam system I fear|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|djneill:  3@c game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E patterns out|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, E bid 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  if West can bid 3@h now, we have a ballgame|pg||
nt|andyv:  the slowness of the bid makes me feel that it may not be forcing?|pg||
mb|3S|an|stopper ask|nt|timb: 3@H is forcing but typically is a doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|djneill:  oh well, the blame-game 3@s, who knows what it means|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  yeah stopper ask, right|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|timb: 4th suit|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok thanks tim|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure taking a lot of bidding space|pg||
nt|timb: this is very strong and should be considered forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  then E has an easy 4@s bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: I|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess not that easy|pg||
nt|djneill:  West is lucky East bid 3NT, other things could get confusing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  the system did not show well on this hand|pg||
nt|timb: I'd bid 4@S every day of the week and I play(ed) their "Melbourne Acol" style when I was an active player|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, another push|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chilloncan: 3C crowds the auction, but is routine in many play-as-you-go styles|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  I find the inability to set the trump suit at the 3 level a major drawback|pg||
nt|timb: I might bid 3@H and then continue with 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@s was the best possible way to finish out the hand, but it was nebulous what West really had|pg||

mb|1S|nt|timb: This auction was quite a good deal stronger than a jump to 4@H, at least a king better than an opening hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  N-S may get frozen out of the auction with 23 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: one doesnt "get frozen", one befreezes|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that maybe the best thing for them|pg||
nt|djneill:  may as well defend the contract they should be playing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  @h shift should neutralize the dummy except for the @dT!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|timb: I'd bid 2@D on the East cards even though 1NT was not forcing - I believe 5422s don't belong in 1NT|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|djneill:  West will falsecard the @c8 and North will be guessing who has the @c6|pg||
nt|timb: West should play @C8 on @C7 back|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  with N's spade holding, a @h shift is mandatory either now or after the k@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C - 2NT - 3NT for example|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Yes, that would be lucky|pg||
nt|athene: if west had rebid 3@C the spade weakness would have come to light|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: I've just been re-reading To Bid Or Not To Bid :Law of Total Tricks..........N should get in there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: 3NT no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was a reasonable choice, though, getting the basic hand type across|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 4@D natural|pg||
nt|athene: if you fiddle around too much showing which majors you have, that can help the defence find the right lead, so you often lose out anyway|pg||

nt|chilloncan: bridge is mainly about finding fits. when opps are shapely, suit fit is likely. so theoretically best to organize countermeasures in a way that maximizes identification of fits. ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: what those countermeasures ought to be varies with shape of intervening hand. in general, if you have a suit you should bid it|pg||

mb|2H|nt|caitlin: 12-14?|pg||
nt|athene: but still an ace and Kx in opener's suit is quite a defensive hand for a 2-suiter overcall|pg||
