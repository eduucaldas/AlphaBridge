nt|psridhar: this will go down 1 peacefully|pg||
nt|davidb: 2H is a normal bid with 11 hcp &6 suiter|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: He has already shown five of the hearts and he had good defence against clubs, but many would bid 2@H (I agree).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel were outstanding in the round-robin with an average of 21 VPs over 23 matches. That is very impressive!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: These situations are unclear - suppose East had bid 2@D - would South be happy to defend 2@D doubled?  |pg||
nt|davidb: no results fron CR?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he might be more inclined to bid 2@H then. Also, the meaning of a double of 2@C by North might be unclear in some partnerships.|pg||

nt|ady: seems only 11 after all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sensiblle result for e-w|pg||
nt|ady: looked like 12   maybe play not as it was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but are we sure not 12 operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Gold and Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 off is not that bad considering |pg||
nt|ralfwil: He didn´t use a show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Mike Raif and specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry late|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which he should in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: is hussy politically correct expression?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what she comes up with here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: politically correct is for wussys|pg||
nt|santyclz: When it works it reinforces the behaviour. |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in vul Finns play 5M and 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes <i was, but now we are live|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Dennis |pg||
nt|bg: GM Shirley Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tim it is |pg||
nt|kemperg: what happened|pg||
nt|mamos: what i wasnt watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: finesse in @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats not possible surely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: am i seeing things|pg||
nt|kemperg: how did he do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what? just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: movie says made|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Germ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: East' hand is an opener nowadays|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good h contract but at what level|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no rebid problem|pg||
nt|po-s: @C-1H? or do they play transfer responses?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@c - 1@d - 1@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: as suggest by East' father, who knows their system|pg||
nt|yuval10: and indeed PO, they play transfers over 1@c|pg||
nt|po-s: North will double|pg||
nt|kemperg: and E rdl with 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|po-s: only if they play support D/RD|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl of 1D would mean @Ds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Even I would open 1 @h as South|pg||
nt|lestergold: played too quickly we have seen this so many times in this event|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they are just playing junior style:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we have the well-known - one more trich in @H than in @S|pg||
nt|hawe45: West as declarer and you make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Didnt expect a lead from Qx|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to make|pg||
nt|mamos: im sure Peter's line was better  than East's :(|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi John|pg||
mb|2H|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was made|pg||
nt|lestergold: well great heart save here against the spade game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a clash of systems, with Precision Club against 'standard' here and Carrot Club against 'standard' in the other room ... part of the reason for lots of swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thats junior opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Does NOT excist|pg||
nt|sybarra: does everyone pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: I prefer 2!@h weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south reticent again|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Bruce  raining here in DC |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 13|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why W didn't persevere with trumps|pg||
nt|mamos: a bit horrid for NS|pg||
nt|mamos: it was   she ducked club  took @dA   and hooked trump:( |pg||
nt|jcomyn: weirder|pg||
nt|kemperg: thy Vincent|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: maybe cause of the lost of connection something went wrong|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why didnt u double partner s says|pg||
nt|jcomyn: everything nicely placed. never happens to me|pg||
nt|mamos: but a nasty little problem just after breakfast|pg||
nt|lestergold: N/S can go to 5 level of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|pelu: breakfast? - almost lunch in Europe (12.00)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is West too strong for the same opening as on 11?!|pg||
nt|hawe45: ear/cut 1 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it should not have|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah,  think a lot of folks would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: at this vul |pg||
nt|mamos: South must take some action here  double looks normal enough|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Get 2 @C from partner and I would not like having opened|pg||
nt|mamos: or a protective NT :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - I double , naturalle over 1 @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is a swedish proverb Mike - better late than never:)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 2@s  next|pg||
nt|mamos: in English we finish "better never late"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sporty South - 1400 or so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Could be|pg||
nt|m_niemi: opening w/ S hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: 1Nt I guess coming |pg||
nt|davidstern: With this now being round 14|pg||
nt|tomi2: if E had nod discarded a heart his partnercould have drawn the trumps, he would gain the trick with the high heart, draw the @D and win the last trick with @D7 for -2 and a beer|pg||
nt|kemperg: älso N name ""sounds"" familiar|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes 4@h at these colours|pg||
nt|mamos: these are Juniors :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a favourite irish expression|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|puncher: yes let's hope this match is as exciting as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might pass 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 3@c shows both majors  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N getting excited since he passed?|pg||
nt|mamos: and/or asks for more information from South|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its exclusive to Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Beter laat dan nooit :)|pg||
nt|mamos: West?????? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: majors i presume|pg||
nt|po-s: a conservative bunch these juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: I see no majors|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to pass the S hand  as a Jr|pg||
nt|gowdy: or senior|pg||
nt|mamos: are these the hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: did e really open 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, weak 9-11|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats some 2h by W|pg||
nt|sommer: a frisky 3@H now, would be profitable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  juniors used to bid moe than everyone else :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I like Fisher's pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie 4@h can be made|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no good rebid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree less clear cut than South's hand on the previous deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: if West opems then bidding as many would 4@h probably reached|pg||
pc|d2|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
nt|gowdy: but back in|pg||
nt|m_niemi: p-p-2@h-3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pass this out now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be somke sort of ekrons|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he wopnt he|pg||
pc|dA|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to bid 4@s with N or you are done up0 like a kipper|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like check back |pg||
nt|xenya: nice analysis :)|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly eight tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: am sure the beer was more important|pg||
nt|sommer: 3rd t/o?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or 3@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no more ammo|pg||
nt|bg: this should be a good match  at halfway point France in third Canada8th only four make it to KO|pg||
nt|lestergold: qith  experience they will learn the need for maximum pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: East's 4@d  secured a lead in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the real pressure bid is 5@h by west|pg||
nt|kemperg: I played them, they not afraid of going high|pg||
nt|lestergold: many of us would bid a lot of hearts out of terror of an opposition slam|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes bidding too much  pushes the oppo to the contract we want to avoid :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but you have to know when to do it quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact |pg||
nt|lestergold: only a @d lead beats 6|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D lead defeat 6@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the way it should be a @d lead if 6 is bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: he''s worried now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least I have pards that would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|rich89: italy lost a simple 4 @s :(|pg||
nt|mamos: no underbidding her|pg||
nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that c annot be right|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 20-20 hand, shouldn't be bid too high.|pg||
nt|gowdy: redicent eh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4! only down by sigleton@D|pg||
nt|sommer: he passed.. well, it's ok in red zone|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice and low|pg||
pc|h8|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why! @dK behind and @hA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will pass with confidence as S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for updated results|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is   6 (Israel schools) v  7|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|davidstern: minimum|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie  lots of tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gowdy: here 2nt is "super accept" and  3 @H is a retransfer|pg||
nt|davidstern: But that said 1 trick on lead both heart and club honours oincide and diamonds ok|pg||
nt|davidstern: usual case when you are in 1 and swap NS when you bid 2NT|pg||
nt|ahalim: cannot see the 9th trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are missing spotcards here in clubs and spades to make an extra trick|pg||
nt|xenya: well it could make on a good day|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy o boy that surely is weak|pg||
nt|kemperg: and passed 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Junior World Champion in Philadelphia last year...|pg||
nt|yuval10: good competitive bid from S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
nt|hawe45: If they play 12-14 NT - in my opinion the West-hand is too strong|pg||
nt|gowdy: unsure why not stayman  but very hard to find 6 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: And 6 @H is lucky|pg||
nt|mamos: my head has exploded|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead says misunderstood|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South's @d length may cause declarer to misguess the @h J|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can see why south is taking time|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H +@S but Bid of N ? pehaps jusy a weeeeeeak 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only one answer gives problem*s(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
nt|davidstern: No good switch here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he might be tempted to duck a heart directly. in case they are 4-4 this opens several squeeze chances|pg||
nt|peachy: Not necessarily, there is a style where first seat favorable systemic can open very weak, but of course I do not know their system|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit unlucky cant get partner in|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||
nt|gowdy: to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at fave vul south should protect with 2@H you need to contest these 20/20 hands to get the plus|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  I'm still reeling from the initial pass.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 clubs is invitational check back I believe 2dia would be GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, the Israeli jrs have been looking very strong this year |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: fast enough? :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they did well in Philly at the worlds (they won jrs)   |pg||
nt|bg: trans national mixed teams won by Daniel Lavee and co|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
nt|pelu: strange play|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, thats why a @H contract is best in S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
nt|lestergold: once in a blue moon dummy has tghe  earth and ur partner has zilch and a misfit but more often u get done out of a game|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: declarer got tired of S thinking about ruffing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H in OR ends in 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @sK, @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2nd in hand should always be sound but by todays standards it was just about an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: teams changed a lot since then, the Israelis have two new pairs|pg||
nt|bg: problem arises when too much weidght put on Queens and Jacks for point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: France lost Bessis-Volcker|pg||
nt|lestergold: cost 2 tricks in practice|pg||
nt|kemperg: Still down, @S K, @S A, @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unimportant in 1@h|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the failure to protect was simply giving the opps an easy ride for no good reason|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it deserved to be hammered|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt get the match points|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that South bid only 1@d because of the vulnerability |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
nt|xenya: none of the key suits break evenly|pg||
nt|tomi2: the black suits break squeeze-friendly but not the hearts of course, if had he tried this|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl chooses the straightforward line of either black suit breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes or QJdoubleton in @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: now W|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S K|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to blame anyone for this. But both N and S were a little passive|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade hook |pg||
nt|lestergold: maxi looks like this heart the ruff and a trump|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has good values, so 1@h opening is correct |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: misdeal board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Mikael and Arifin|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Ernst, our operator|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi everybody :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Hi|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Roland and Mikael|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|sommer: didnt expect 4:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and the poor @d spot cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: place your bets  will he make ?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: (unfortunately)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
nt|bg: ok now S had to continue Dia or lose it|pg||
nt|sommer: .."only" 3@H|pg||
pc|dK|nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: or this same|pg||
nt|mamos: @sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or maybe 2@d would have been something other than weak|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
nt|davidstern: question now is how much west trusts the defenders|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||
nt|newmoon: will he make it tho?  has to hook @C10 after 2@Hs|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree with Shirley  I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: nope|pg||
nt|mamos: -750 or even 950|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for 6 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: can S bid 2N Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|ahalim: a funny thing happened on  !, N and E had the same hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think this will be an really intresting match between a verry talanted swedish team vs a Israel that has been dominating this tournament so far|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: hoping for 3-3 split|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Short will be telling Walker to evaluate better and raise with his six count|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure Matheson will say that playing the @dK guarantees the contract, which is the prime objective at the end of a tough weekend|pg||
nt|puncher: absolutely|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mamos: hi again|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Insted of 1@h i would dbl on W hand after pass first time|pg||

nt|mikael_w: And Hi Arifin :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: and emerge with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry, screwed this one up|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec kows Tim Verbeek is a man|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer playing pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is absolutely clear is that south had two opportunities to enter the auction and availed himself of neither this is not recommended|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|nt|newmoon: rehi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit unlucky/unfriendly this |pg||
nt|bg: could be a swing on that board if France finds 3nt instead of 4 dpades|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahalim: Yes, North is a very promising player|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: the 8@s is starting to look like a big card|pg||
nt|mamos: I think EW  probably got about what they earned there|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: maybe not nig enuf|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
mc|6|nt|mikael_w: I would say that N is top 3 in the world all female, and that is not only juniors|pg||

nt|psridhar: 1@h = trf to @s ; and 1@s = 3 cards ( i guess)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South would rebid 2@S on a minimum hand with four spades.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alert|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Yes PS, not only 3 cards but also a weak balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North is investigating further but it seems almost certain from his point of view that 4@S will be the final resting place.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: well bid |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: The heart suit is frozen, so I will guess 12 tricks |pg||
nt|psridhar: easy to go overbd fishing for slam there|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|brolucius: The late Hugh Kelsey liked to describe certain bids (as North's 2@D here) as daisy-picking. By that, he meant that there was no real point in the bid and that it would only give ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: further information to the opponents.  |pg||

nt|paulg:  they will open 1@c in the other room but probably get a similar result|pg||
nt|puncher: it's all so public these days too - with all of us watching over their shoulders - it adds to the pressure of a long weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: the joy of jrs, "keep the game moving" |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s is not a junior contract omn thiose cards actually not a senior one either|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont  understand WEst's play  :(  panic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy to bid 16 opp ten and lots of wasted values like 8 points not needed its effectively a combined working 19 points|pg||
nt|mamos: South has proved he can count to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mss rimstedt will get busy here|pg||
nt|po-s: he doesn´t want opponents tu suffer|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now some fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south has a weak 2 for me even tho he has 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahalim: S to N : " Not my day to-day: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Vincent is it Tim?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the folly of youth with an 8-count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes it is|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe  i wondered Girls Team|pg||
nt|kemperg: wich team is it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: first part score for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: or 1@D and jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to see any result here other than 3n+2|pg||
nt|sommer: he showed a weak hand already, and N showed around 18, so no leb imo|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they surely play Leb|pg||
nt|sommer: but not here|pg||
nt|ahalim: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wowee a grand in the offing|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Pd might pass 1@h when you have an 8 card @s fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is East going to pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: I even think my grandmother would get to 6 @S's|pg||
nt|m_niemi: for me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has finally found the bidding box|pg||
nt|gowdy: those don't look like 4 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly John|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW may have some problems to find @s-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm generally more worried about my opponents than the vugraph audience|pg||
nt|kemperg: will this end in 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there something wrong with 3 nt?  can you make it?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could try a small diamond when W had pitched a diamond, risking 3 down, but preserving some chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the girls team|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H and N will go to 4|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe so|pg||
nt|sommer: in that case, they needed a bad defence:)..or flat board|pg||
nt|mamos: bet they dont|pg||
nt|ahalim: six they will bid for sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i supposxe 6 is where they end up|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Nope:)|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure top-10, but top 3?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: and bridge is about creating problems for theopps|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??????:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: which he joined earlier this week, they havent enough players in the girls team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting very confusing|pg||
nt|ahalim: this shd be a routine 4@S|pg||
mb|p!|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
nt|gowdy: x or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and avoiding you own|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East X = take out to @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so had to pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h now or 4@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet n/s flop into 4 @S somehow |pg||
nt|bg: nice pass by S tempting to preempt with 3 spades but pard will never know what is going on when suits or that bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like goulash dealer having fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hmm I surely disagree with pass on first hand with a 74|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D promises 5 coards if balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: it didn't look like clubs were breaking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice hand now|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 14 opposite 8 it seems unlikely to even be sniffed at.  Bidding 6 looks promising though.|pg||
nt|yuval10: and a good score for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: well interesting hand here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and the singleton @H not so easy to pinpoint |pg||
nt|lestergold: a most unusual double fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and many of us do not speak dutch that well |pg||
nt|sybarra: I only know some of the swear words |pg||
nt|davidstern: Battle of the black suits here|pg||
nt|mamos: how do you make a grand anyway?  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a bgit of luck|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK we are in business again|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dunno what happened, but we're back|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north might bid 4@d now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will no doubt end in a number od hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass is a clever option with the West hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Louse suits both|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@s easy to East|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H wd not be my bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: think he can rebid his 5 card @D here simply|pg||
nt|ahalim: agree Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: i would certainly rebid diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is fine sacrifice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Might reach 6@c now|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c seems opretty infrangible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - thatÂ´s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
nt|bg: this transfer may bring a super acceptance of 3 spades in which case S will bid 4|pg||
nt|tomi2: he already showed 5 but better upgradng akqxx to 6 than 432 to 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: now they are in real trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south did not alert the 2NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: not for an Irishman John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought I was the only one who played ona a ladies team|pg||
nt|kemperg: !2S = @C?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by E?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 3s|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl neg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no point|pg||
nt|mamos: ah thats the Irish way  rub a three leaf clover|pg||
nt|kemperg: not with @D start|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I was told 1@h show atleast 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@S looks like 5 spades and three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Vincent|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought so|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirmed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this guy is incorrigible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: our clover has 4 leaves - ah i see this is \ REFERENCE TO SHAMROCK|pg||
nt|kemperg: these 12pts I would not open|pg||
nt|hawe45: You mean 5 @C / or_|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a heart lead doesnt beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
nt|bg: sry daydreaming too early in the am|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: very nice 4@C bid by Sabourin, should get EW to 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly the W hand improved with the club bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: W probably worried about his @dkxx, a nd the 2 baby @S |pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s  enough to buy the hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three clubs losing 2 spades and two diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK wit the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lousy|pg||
nt|xenya: N won't pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: north must think his pd is 2452 but he stops the black suits well. maybe he passes this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: awww both wrong|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@S seems to save 4 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte alerting both passes, Raulund didn't|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would a H not be led lads|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@H prevent that:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the abbott always leads a H with this holding|pg||
nt|mamos: im interested by South's pass over 3@d  i know he hasnt a good hand but does have good Spades  4@S seems more  "obvious"?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes throw a heart on the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s ruff is entry to the @dK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect West is thinking rather than South|pg||
nt|hawe45: Strange double of 2 @H / if you ask me!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Its basically up tom west to drive the auction now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is worried about the heart position|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive X by W|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi George|pg||
nt|kemperg: no bet|pg||
nt|mamos: coffee  I think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
nt|the saint: What would West's initial double have been? Many play it as that hand or a really big one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and down he goes|pg||
nt|gowdy: back to par 100|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not an auction of beauty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love to know how he thinks p will ever get in|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes definitely so brb|pg||
nt|pelu: S could still have a 4 card @S - so 3@S by N would also be a normal bid - but balanced and extra values - so 3NT very OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: +1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even with a @H lead aren't 6 1 0 6 available?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nows gs try|pg||
nt|mamos: Im about to owe John a drink|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 5 @D X = 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour and 10 minutes is Israel Schools vs USA|pg||
nt|andreasw:  If pd has @h cuebid it is defently worth a shot!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy not vul|pg||
nt|bg: double not good for the Canadians|pg||
nt|xenya: if only a natural 4N was availble here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south also alerted 4@c, but did not alert 4@d. North alerted 4@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: YOWSIE|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have bid 2@s as a fit jump over 1@h but I guess West did not have that option|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has presumably set up a game force amd now perhaps cann confirm thhe club support east having shown a fairly minimum hand can afford to cue 41h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly no play for 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an unreasonable contract in the abstract|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer doesnt know he has nine tricks   so easily|pg||
nt|hawe45: When I double like North here, pd cashes the @H Ace / and give away the slam|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it looks like EW have sold out cheaply|pg||
nt|tomi2: North now clearly overbids his hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S is rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction has gone out of hand|pg||
nt|sommer: -500|pg||
nt|santyclz: Surprised us all.|pg||
nt|mamos: im told 4@s does have a meaning   This team have been fantastic in this tournament|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7 on a @H, not on @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
nt|the saint: North should have been able to read a singleton|pg||
nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake  |pg||
nt|kemperg: we''\l see|pg||
nt|santyclz: That looks right to me, have to delay the @d ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: if you have the @d7...|pg||
nt|mamos: North paid the penalty on Board 1 in the OR for not leading partner's suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT from South might had a play|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could have signed of in 4@H leaving his partner with a chance to bid on|pg||
nt|mamos: East is enjoying it   but North amd South are on different pages of the manual|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps in different manuals|pg||
nt|sommer: and EW had 650 safely = 4 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has made it very clear as to his values now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes usual to play it shows A or K but North likes other leads less|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s and east should know what is needed|pg||
nt|hawe45: With this speed, I= am happy, that they are not bidding on to 7...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is he really thinkin?|pg||
nt|lestergold: who is in the tank here? is south thinking of bidding?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suspect West is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, W thinking here.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but 4@s does seem obvious|pg||
nt|lestergold: west has shown club support 4@s is surely automatic?|pg||
nt|hawe45: They play low/speed cue/bids|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: No one else objects to the 4@h bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: no - they are not. they just misjudge their hand - but i think both know each meaning of each bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will find out automaticlly|pg||
nt|mamos: that the clubs are blocked and the Diamond Ace onside|pg||
nt|mamos: he will but he needs to think|pg||
nt|pelu: Netherland have great tradition and a lot of great results in women team - it looks like a new generation will follow that rute|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will have cashed 9 tricks by that time so can safely lead a @d up|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im wrong he will have cashed 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if discards are not such that it will be safe to try a @d|pg||
nt|pelu: id he takes his 9 tricks and play @D from dummy he will have 10 @CQ block the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: however east has to find 3 discards on @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: eventually I think he will play @hQ  and then will relax|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers in West (23) has only played bridge for 4-5 yeard - I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: In the CR declarer played the AK of @s on board one, before trying the @h finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S on board 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: either its not a coffe hand after all or its a coffe and cakes hand |pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||

nt|hawe45:  - but I was sleeping...|pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control now|pg||
nt|ahalim: or some pages are missing :)|pg||
nt|daman: S should be ablke to make this on a simple endplay|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now he gets squeezed blind|pg||
nt|daman: able*|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is a very mature sequience for two junioras so far.......|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone play that 4NT from East here shows a good 4@c bid?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|puncher: good try by south to get partner in to lead the spade through - just not to be on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems confident that south cannot get a club loser away on @ds|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dagold: nice contract to stop in here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry misclick|pg||
nt|yuval10: especially with @d lead|pg||

nt|ahalim: rhis will be bloody|pg||
nt|mamos: what was 2NT Tom?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: TRUMP BACK|pg||
nt|tomi2: a general gametry, forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: E ha d9 pts more than promised, but W knew that by inference|pg||
nt|mamos: can't dellay it when they lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  problem now is staying out of 7@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: ut sounds interesting|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this looks like the right contrakt that will be 11 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: defence needed to set up Diamond trick to keep it to ten  +1  now|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and holding 4 @H's   X doesnt see right |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rich89: 2@h is 8 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT  should have been a warning ?:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3rd @D and then @H @H, S has to becarefull ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@h iallows for the grand slam possibility if west is even better thab he has promised so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy lead for South in view of X of 2@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: watching talented but inexperienced players reminds how much experience counts for at bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: that confidence could have been misplaced|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can anyone see anything EW could have done better|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think its quite an impressive sequence for two youngsters|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / good bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I think its a very boring sequence from two juniors:p|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bg: X cannot be right with super fit in clubs and no spade winners|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not with 3 spades?|pg||

nt|kemperg: inference, word I know from the books of Terence Rees|pg||
nt|kemperg: Reese|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
nt|tomi2: fron N's point of view 3nt showed a decent hand with 2452 distr.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit pointless|pg||
nt|kemperg: when I remember it well, read those in the 60's|pg||
nt|sommer: he would ruff in hand and run @SJ|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as he will soon|pg||
nt|kemperg: he should, would?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes and not even RD|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and 12  now|pg||
mc|12|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told North is a she i do not know why names are not given as Miss or mrs. or Mz so we know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: giving your age away now|pg||
nt|mamos: French team have started well  -- do we have link to scores  the one I had yesterday seems broken|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: I once had a partner who HATED it when I leapt to 6NT on the second round. 'Why not investigate?' he would wail. Of course, that made me do it all the more often.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|weak d or strong|nt|chessmaste: So, if you got to 5@S you would consider that a low standard?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|psridhar: i wd term it as 'risky'|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is a two-way bid: either a normal strong 2@C or a weak-two in diamonds. West raises the pre-emption, sure from South's double that East has the weak type.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Padon might hv been planning to open 2@C when his rho did it for him|pg||
nt|davidb: 3sp  bid  is  useless .4H  enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandra and Cecilia Rimstedt (playing in the closed room) are sisters and very competent players|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With big international results|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this bidding North would be likely to go down in 6@H, losing two trump tricks.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|davidb: why reach  6? 4sp  down   |pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: This is not laydown|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, PS makes a very good point. It was by no means clear for South to bid spades rather than raise the hearts.|pg||

nt|lestergold: my fingers are butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: we do need to find you a commentator spell checker :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll do that for ya|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we all felt that was not an automatic slam to reach many experienced pairs would mess this hand up|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think a 5@H in tempo .... |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont think D was meant als penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a spec suggest:  X = interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: some kind off want to bid 5@H, but let partner think with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: but must say I have never seen that|pg||
nt|mamos: East perhaps too timid with good clubs and a bit of a Heart fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: would have been a nice play if they stoped in 4@H :)|pg||
nt|xenya: well played, yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: went to school at 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: only +1??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yea, I asked the players.. after the @d finesse things went rather quickly|pg||
nt|sommer: DK lost only 1 imp in b1. That seems ok|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not sure about the play at the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: last hand was a red save hand I think - 5@D was only one down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s better to show the void on S - and N will not be happy!|pg||
nt|mamos: someone has turned the distributiononometer up|pg||
nt|ahalim: is this a goulash tournament ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: after the first match with those hungarians...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pass!!|pg||
nt|gowdy: good !|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone for 6 of a minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: what a deal here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow some fun here in bidding very suitable for polish|pg||
nt|mamos: six is interesting on Diamond lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very very interesting where they stop|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have surely ruiffed a spade high in case they were 4/2|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be exciting|pg||
nt|bg: could be X not meant as penalty but then EW  not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was pretty popular in Holland, Brink Drijver were playing it, but now they stopped playing it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to rework the system notes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but at the end he was down if they were 4-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ... you might want to call it that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: thats not timid  what was 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: don't know that|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: the dutch dealing prog has been set to "wild"|pg||
nt|the saint: I've seen worse 3@C bids 1st NV|pg||
nt|gowdy: just asking :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I thought they bid aggressively in non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: well west alerted it, east didnt, so think your right Bruce|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E could be playing a 4/3 in hts |pg||
nt|bg: E should bid 3 clubs good heart fit and W has a spade shortage|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thisd hand should keep w quiet|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good judgement / if they play 15/17|pg||
mb|2N|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
nt|hawe45: So now we know for sure, that E/W play 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now we know that North likes to bid !  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my club money game 3@c wouold be considered a routine conservative action|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fit showing jump in competition|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D a @S raise |pg||
nt|tomi2: both german pairs have no 2@D weak opener in their system|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dodgy aul h fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have blocked one of the majors somehow|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it will be dangerus getting to hi in the bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 2 NT = 22-24|pg||
nt|pelu: prob N just tranfer to @H and play 4@h|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 1@S   |pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|ahalim: we would all pin the @H 10 seeing all 4 hands :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: EW play different NT ranges in different positions|pg||
nt|hawe45: Rathar weak North for the 2 @C-bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this one was 14-17|pg||
nt|the saint: Will work now, becuase should be able to lead a club vs 3N|pg||
nt|bg: oops now France on different meanings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont know if 4NT was meant as asking aces or that is was quanti|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Robert asking partner if he is right|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the hand,  can S be asking aces?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont really understand the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now a cue by E and off we go |pg||
nt|davidstern: No defence and good play hand why bid so low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 7 surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S  7@S|pg||
nt|pelu: or can she show 6 card @h and invit for slam?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
nt|sybarra: now Bruce, how to pick up the club suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like they are on the same wavelength, but my French isnt fantastic :(|pg||
nt|bg: easy Shirley just play K-A  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 3 or 4 sp?|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree David bid once and high|pg||
nt|davidstern: Depending on mood and partner - indifferent to either|pg||
nt|davidstern: Probably 4@S but ..... on another day 3@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: NEVER ON ANY PLANET would I bid 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: white v white, so always a crap shoot |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, no way you get me to bid 1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: good point|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H has small chances|pg||
nt|jcomyn: How often bravery and skill not rewarded in bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
nt|davidstern: West's made it a little hard on partner|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't agree to that double, it should show spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: testing thei system|pg||
nt|mamos: quieter waters|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes poor spot cards and poor shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s oj if they are very conservative vul about their 3@s bids|pg||

nt|hawe45: But here @D works better...|pg||
nt|gowdy: may start a high D for a look |pg||

nt|the saint: Smolen 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|gowdy: xx @C perhaps 4 @H|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but no matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  thanks Alan|pg||

nt|mamos: 3@C from South|pg||
nt|kemperg: USA in 4@H at 12|pg||
nt|po-s: impossible to find a diamond lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well my son does not believe in no trump downgrades only upgrades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he has been reading Klinger|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  you think these seniors could all the clicks then?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hear the clicks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard does not have high spade honour u cant beat it|pg||
nt|the saint: Well South might hate his club shortage and try for a major fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: my granny would do that  but do the experts do the same?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that solves the s situation|pg||
nt|peachy: East's bidding has pinpointed spade singleton so 3NT started to look bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK?|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe @CA and @Hshift is enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: good lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..no, then S can play dummy reversal|pg||
nt|sommer: it's makeable then|pg||
nt|mikael_w: its not often, but this is a hand where its better to be dec with the week hand|pg||
nt|ahalim: right|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and maybe it was posible after the Dbl ? If S say pass?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
nt|tomi2: should north have opened 3@D maybe? nonvuln but 2nd seat|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what the heck is 4h|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has read everything Julian|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  most bridge players are like airline passengers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  love to upgrade but hate to downgrade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer knows hes probably doomed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dummy trying to read my face, difficult to keep it in shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes probably does, why else does anyone lead into the @H holding|pg||
nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaime Lee|pg||
nt|davidstern: 800 versus 920|pg||
nt|davidstern: 940 if you are inspired in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: EW did well in the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: )|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord where are they going|pg||
nt|kemperg: $@H last train?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: think better to finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losing 2 hearts 2 diamonds and club -4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: but thinks for himself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @d position is favourable for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem with downgrade 18 Milton's you may miss a game when partner has the good intermediates but only 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45: Switch to the @D 10 / East might duck it!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  I would blame partner for not inviting and hide @h J:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer needs only 3 @d for the contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
nt|xenya: E has figured out that @Ss must be 4-4 on the auction -- a nice piece of inference|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXRERAWHACK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXTRA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still ducking is an option!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  No matter Ron will for sure make|pg||
nt|po-s: so how should he play the suit?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cash 4@h and then run the @d7?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
nt|xenya: not worse that 4-4 i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: claim|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
nt|tomi2: now north has no single trick and cant expect his partner to have Ax of @D and to find the lead... something went wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: for another huge score|pg||
nt|mamos: just  couple of trumps to lose|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D was the last making contract but 5D is just unlucky while 4H has  a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: christmas has arrived early|pg||
nt|sommer: more @D? ..or ruff @S|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that pass = 2 card @h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, But if you lie about 2 or 3 @h does it really matter ?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: nice defense by East|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed |pg||
nt|pelu: best: take @SA and strat red cross-ruff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: wel;l; he has decided to play pard for a club guard rather than play the 4/3 fit i wouold have gopne for the 4/3 fit on the grounds that even if north has a club card it might not ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be sufficient|pg||
nt|kemperg: S denied @D controle|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like @d lead is setting the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@h was last train |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Tim|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: OK East making his opponents suffer|pg||
nt|tomi2: e will corrently fight for an overtrick here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why so long to play|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|kemperg: eastern egg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it is EASTER arrivinbg early|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N with stiff A or K not bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and get away with it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi all |pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: the spade 8 confirming that hwe can ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: N didnt get it |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what on earth is this?|pg||
nt|mamos: nasty decision |pg||
nt|gowdy: Erwin did south thank N for the dummy ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ah that way, yes he did|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|bg: W has shown a long heart suit could have 3 clubs but not likely|pg||
nt|mamos: Id like to claim quickly so they have plenty of time to discuss where they went wrong :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D rebid on board 3 led to 6@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: well  Tadaaaa |pg||
nt|mamos: and we are left to wonder what would have happened after 1@c 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 1@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: concede a h and claim|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as you said 1s 7s wqithout all this mucking about|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a really wild board all sorts of ways to get a really horrid result|pg||
nt|gowdy: was he nice looking at that pile of dung|pg||
nt|gowdy: change might to should|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzag: cant see his face|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will talk in bavarian, so we won't undestand this :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 7 is 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe can u see the line|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
nt|paulg:  discards mean that declarer can lead towards @hJ safely|pg||
nt|the saint: I guess with that strong diamond suit, the 1N opener was too much of a distortion for me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no he wont|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinks he has a natural heart trick but how can he hope to wenjoy that when he can see the establisheable diamonds sitting in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are not fantunes yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an appaling error|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with best defence 4@h dbl is -1100|pg||
nt|mikael_w: You have a minimum hand and will not exept any slam-invite anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
nt|lestergold: it has to be the A and there has to be no card to knock out as well for 3N toc be viable|pg||
nt|ahalim: there is the overtrick|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
nt|kemperg: down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apropos my comment, I played in three reasonable slams the other evening each one requiring one finesse. All 3 went down|pg||
nt|mamos: small spade a little tester|pg||
nt|kemperg: we see 6 on @D lead in OR|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Well cant afford N to get in so yes:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Just play the @D normal after that / 9 tricks sure / and no entry in North|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
nt|paulg:  both have prime cards and the breaks are very friendly|pg||
nt|daman: the young players make good use of the red cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H K is needed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats all folks|pg||
nt|sommer: noo|pg||
nt|sommer: ..depends...|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HHH|pg||
nt|sommer: had to ruff with @HQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. A below par slam anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dummy reversal|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhpas better to cash king first|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and you know N will bid 4@h if she is not comfort for slam anyway|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: with both minor aces on N E must play a @s - and he did|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or even better take @DKQ and more @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an insult to partner|pg||
nt|the saint: Make the King of diamonds the club king and it has merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome James|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  declarer will take the heart finesse in an attempt to make the contract, not with any hope|pg||
nt|paulg:  and probably go two down|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: well having chosen the distortion  the bidding has warned him of a likely big hoole in the club department|pg||
nt|bg: Hi James|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dagold: so a likely swing to England|pg||
nt|paulg:  although he can count Sime's hand now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did w not sdign off in 4d or bid 2d the first time|pg||
nt|kemperg: inOR|pg||
nt|hawe45: Bravo!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|psridhar: True given a free auction NS might have easily reached the right gamee there|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had East opened with a normal 2@D, it is possible that N/S would have been in the same position as they were at this table.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: If 1NT was 9-12 East may regret breaking the range as 3NT is a lucky make|pg||

nt|sybarra: when my left opp bids nt over pard's suit,  not sure worth leading  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant rho|pg||
nt|garnetts: lightish opening bid ( and I would open this one) and a light dbl will likely get EW to 3NT |pg||
nt|dagold: would be amazed if it isn't 3N making to be honest|pg||
nt|xenya: -5?  |pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all, and take a pat on the back for being patient :)|pg||
nt|idc: I expect it will take a while to get the scores up to date (if it can be done)|pg||
nt|idc: but at least we will (fingers crossed) get to see some bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and deservedly  |pg||
nt|rich89: could be -2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||
nt|mamos: and presumably the defence to 4@S could have won five or six tricks with that cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s might be unlucky here too|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 13 to Finns bd 21|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/3 fits when you have the high cards in the trump suit and good side suits etc is very often highly playable|pg||
nt|xenya: S was going to get squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|ahalim: and now a quiet board|pg||
nt|xenya: a heated discussion is under way no doubt|pg||
nt|tomi2: the german pair will have to refocus on the remaining boards, still 6 to go. they know they are far behind now|pg||
nt|mamos: slightly odd auction in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: might be duplicated here|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play forcing NT and the 2@C response from N will be multi-meaning... but maybe south will pass 1@S with no king and ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: helmich-hop play some sort of Gazilli, so 2@c was forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: their 1@S opening is limited to 18hcp, so a game is far away|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to stay out of game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has a monster thisd time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least he will think so|pg||
nt|daman: EW are huffing and puffing after the last 2 hands|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best start for NL-girls|pg||
nt|sommer: very difficult to make this one, because of the @C sits|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but after 1@C opening and opps carding, he might have solved it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 0nly lols make those ones|pg||
nt|yuval10: reasonable line to go for the @c ruff, very nice by W not to lead the singelton when she know that partner doesn't have the Ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: definitely not right|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you lead low to the 9 or 10 and ace, what do you do next?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross to the king, you are in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I have a fealing 4@h even make is a good result on this board anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: ???|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S seems a likely spot|pg||
nt|mamos: This table is going to be in time trouble|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding comps expect you to find them on hands like this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board n 5 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a few sacre bleus and things|pg||
nt|peachy: NS are the older of the Israel teams, currently in first place|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 4@h is fouhnd it could make inpractice here|pg||
nt|mamos: i have trouble following one table|pg||
nt|santyclz: Send Roland the bill for the 42" monitor.|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT in North... / but how to bid it|pg||
mb|d!|nt|mamos: and is back|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: bet he goes slamming|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and another s slam|pg||
mb|r|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: East is not timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: I open the North hand with 1 in my longest suit|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this is hard luck for NS  on a good day 6@D is cold  but not this day|pg||
nt|m_niemi: South bids now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d x'd,, so even if they'd x'd 2@d it would have been a loss.|pg||
nt|tomi2: Ellerbeck might see his problematic rebid after 2@C gazilli|pg||
nt|mamos: quick auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 3@D by N?|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS can make 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i go with the original suggestion the 7@d is unlikely to be covered wjatever the north holding and if it is you still have the option of playibng A and @d to K to allow for Qs with ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: North|pg||
nt|po-s: agree, duck one when South showed the ten which he would do  also with four|pg||
mb|1D|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: flat hand open 1nt 4/3/3/3|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer did well to make eight in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think it was misdefended there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes anyyway|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt much like bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with his attitude this is inevitable|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
nt|hawe45: 800 must do this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: Is 5 @D a winner - I´m not so sure|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: raise to 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: did W bid 2 @D?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why Mike|pg||
nt|kemperg: try to look at the Portugal open at the same time, does't work well(|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 4@s has a chanse for e/w but will not be easy to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
nt|gowdy: as well he should|pg||
nt|bg: S hoping Dia Q wrong|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lead 4th best by E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand has 4 @C +2@H+1@S +1@D= 8 |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: with KQJ with west very unlikely to have the @SA so think he should finesse the clubs last board for a safety play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: needs a 9 trick somewhere |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so what is it|pg||
nt|mamos: is this Strong Club do we know?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Is that forcing???|pg||
nt|mamos: what do we think of 2@H :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1s-2s-3s surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: I have seen weaker 2 @H than this|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @C is not my taste|pg||
mb|p!|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: a club limit raise I am told |pg||
nt|mamos: presumably balanced 10ish :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: will he find @C9|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right - IN OR S (Padon) show his hand as a stroing @S-opening - and they were in 4@S -1!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead the @D 10, pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think it is a very strong club.....dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: its artificial yes didnt find a convention card jet|pg||
nt|lestergold: after second double north is very cautious holding some values and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: THE Israeli Juniors  have a fantastic record in the tournament so far averaging 22 points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presumably 1nt shows spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: think so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, East doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
nt|mamos: ah   a sort of inverted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so were 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: but for the ruff,  5 @c would be ok |pg||
nt|daman: I would never have passed the N hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nasytherr|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be good if the Israelis do|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: confirmed 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must discard @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ja - herzlich willkommen|pg||
nt|arno11: danke:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a sane contract at last|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps ahve to find a club or trump lead to beat 4 which is after all a fair contract vulnerable|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  i agree Germ|pg||
nt|santyclz: A fine "midnight swiss" preemptive jump overcall.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C Gazzilli?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: string of relay bids i assume|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Gazilli cofirmed by spec|pg||
nt|kemperg: last train again|pg||
nt|po-s: or he thinks partner has hearts...|pg||
nt|lestergold: as i suggested pn bopard 12 7 imps to sweden who opened 1H with that 11 count reached 41h and made it |pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is pass for me|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a better hand than he thought I believe|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT by E makes also here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mamos: i heart was lead which definitely helped :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: the Israelis gained their swing by the excellent bidding to 6@c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Adam Mesbur is considering bad trump break, eliminations and entries to dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: HI Arno|pg||
nt|mamos: oh thats very ill disciplined|pg||
nt|davidstern: Making me ill anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so do you lead your singleton or you ace |pg||
nt|kemperg: S knows that N can bid very lightly|pg||
nt|mamos: i m ight care to take issue with "fine"|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: my ps always lead from Kx after I do that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then you're not getting into the spirit of the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Confusing it with bridge or something like that.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i dont agree with just the one trick but maybe they dont mind four-figure penalties|pg||
nt|kemperg: @CQ may win the trick|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer adopted what I thought was the right line in 6@S on our earlier board - Diamond ruff cash top Club cross to hand and played Club|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: Q@S = first choice 50% finnesse |pg||
nt|sybarra: *your |pg||
nt|sybarra: if only hts behaved!|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, shaky but easily making|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 6s inevitable|pg||
nt|yuval10: assuming you play natural system, do you think North's hand worth a 1@h opening and 2@s rebid ( over a supposed 1NT ) , or is it 1@s and then 4@h for you?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dagold: best defence|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need to start clubs to try to find close to 9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but choing to rong player as the lead makes him all the rest @H |pg||
nt|bg: not easy has to duck next heart and play W for a doubleton dia honor|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: squeezzed on 3 suits lets see how he discards |pg||
nt|kemperg: do you have @HK?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yep, That is also a common thing. When one hand is extreamy strong and the other one is week you way to often get the strong hands suit as trumph. But this time is was a NT hand ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: (the strong one) so then they should have found the right trumph I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@h makes now:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  he may lead a diamond up at trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is this going?|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer needs to plan for ten tricks, give up club and two hearts and hope spade finesse is working|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 2@S forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: Club of course disappears|pg||
nt|peachy: if hearts were splitting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sommer: ..I think!|pg||
nt|sommer: @CQ would be a great falsecard form E!:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kinda torteous|pg||
nt|kemperg: no @C  K or the other 2?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cameron_1: he must have run it|pg||
nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
pc|cT|nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but it probably wouldn't have been 45 years ago.|pg||
nt|lestergold: may have devlaued the K@s altho i think this is poor policy against preemptd at fave vul when opps rarely have a decent suit|pg||
nt|kemperg: now we'l see:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  After 1@s i would bid 3@h on rimsteds hand |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: nooo|pg||
nt|po-s: would South rebid hearts with a singleton?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: very disciplened pass though|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers was on the Netherland silver-team in Ostend (women team)!!!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|sommer: realy?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dont think so, but 4@H was  last train, no cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: guess we are not linked up with the open room anymore...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: soth needs to make a non commital lead on this auction eg @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it is by far the most important suit in so many systems|pg||
nt|gowdy: even my mother bids 1@S there and she would bid 1 nt with N|pg||
pc|c9|nt|newmoon: yes, sorry 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards liem this can  make on that line but declarfer may go forthespades|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on hearts needs that pesky T to drop which it does|pg||
nt|kemperg: On @S he is low on entry''s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 29 c0mbined on a fairly nisfitting han d is not great for a 6n contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dagold: Norman and Espen have been rewarded with 4 imps for their nice stop in 3@c on 19|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer in control here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|bg: W should switch to spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: very|pg||
nt|sommer: hm|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: opp an overcall it needs to be constructive and with a scrappy 8 count you wouldnt want to be|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dagold: Rosen/Jones got in the way in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jameslee 2: upps thats the end for defence contract home :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 104|pg||
nt|kemperg: Denied als @D cue I think, so after 6@C N knew it all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is cautious with 7.5 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lestergold: could play A and J of spades and if ducked rely on heart finesse for 12 tricks of course taht wont work here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in fact also a little bit nervous to be in 5@h too|pg||
nt|lestergold: most of us would have bid 4@h nad lived or died by the sword as it were|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and Laura and her team recently were promoted to the highest league in Dutch bridge|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mamos: declarer playing carefully|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest why it is so difficult to find a 5-4 club fit|pg||
nt|mamos: to be  fair West had excellent majors and p poor Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: E maybe a little good for 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: well done -- 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|paulg:  and now he knows it was a boring hand|pg||
nt|puncher: board 18 a 5 imp gain to scotland when Irish stretched to a non-making 3N|pg||
nt|mamos: i think the only hope is that the Ace @h is under North's chair|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike |pg||
nt|bg: N might have played spade 10 on ace  has to be a suit preference|pg||
nt|sybarra: off 2 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: little break here, getting water etc.|pg||
nt|mamos: Israelli Npc has aged another couple of weeks|pg||

nt|sybarra: (heart attach medicine)|pg||
nt|lestergold: misere|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he had cashed the @sJ, then West would have been endplayed|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just making|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: all safel y done|pg||
nt|hawe45: Bad defence - but did´nt matter|pg||
nt|andreasw:  And even after pd's 1@S!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: 800 were better|pg||
nt|arno11: still -2...|pg||
nt|hawe45: -1|pg||
nt|arno11: the austrian players participating in this tournament constists of players who are playing only for a very short time the exception being Richard Bina, playing N in this room|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: she doesnt know yet the clubs are coming home |pg||
nt|hawe45: And do´nt forget, that with the @H Jack off-side, 4 @S X = 1.100|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did he manage to play himself off here?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how covering with the Q could gain -- but it certainly could hurt|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo after opening of NT by E, very difficult to find @C fit.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: she is very lucky indeed to even have a play for this contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: I''m glad not being E|pg||
nt|gowdy: treat my overcalls as opening bid on round 1  |pg||
pc|hK|pc|d5|pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: dont sagree|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|kemperg: S |pg||
nt|bg: E didnt pay attention to spade *|pg||
nt|sommer: VERY expensive decission .. maybe 20 imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: E will play the Q also from Q9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: well she has chucked her 12th trick away|pg||
nt|m_niemi: should have discarded @sK on @cK|pg||
nt|bg: 8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: 6@C -1 in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: now she is forced to finesse spade and give up heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: maybe the 8 was 2nd 4th?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: so depending on spade finesse for contract maybe thats better odds than playing for 3 heart tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: But it was only 13 opposite 10, wasn't it? No reason to get to game. |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East has was worth closer to 14, rather than 12, mind you - with that club suit.|pg||
mb|3H|an|transfer|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|psridhar: on a 1@c opening 4@s may be reached -1@c-1@s-2@s-game try and..|pg||

nt|chessmaste: All acedemic now|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: This is more interesting|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or, as everyone on the BBC would say: 'There is an easy 12 tricks'. (Even the Prime Minister gets that one wrong.)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: BBC is a subsidiary of BBO|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have to pay for it, though.|pg||
nt|psridhar: This slam needs a " deal record " play on @c lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: It was not a good one for transfers, as it turns out, because North may well lead the @CK. Yes, he has. But South could well have found a club lead from J-10-x.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer will have to sniff out the diamonds - maybe a Zia like play - try the jack and if they don't cover etc combined with a club diamond squeeze chance|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||

nt|xenya: well played for an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  I like to make the opponents work for +800, but defence was very simple here |pg||
nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might be surprised it is a push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well that was silly altho neither worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a junior push|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ghehehe :P|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing a heart ws surely hopeless at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Remembers me of last year, going one of in a 6NT with 12 tricks from top, winning 3 imps against 6S-3|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly Spade position|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I can barely see the table anymore, so maybe I'll have to take a break|pg||
nt|mamos: Some pairs play 3@d to show short @d  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what would 1NT-2C-3C be?|pg||
nt|mamos: yep well done  well in control  for an undeserved -1imp for NS here|pg||
nt|mamos: 20/20 coming up|pg||
nt|mamos: Junior Bridge is frustrating a mixture of brilliance and the absurd -  one thing that is frustrating if you try to encourage and develop young players is that they sometimes just ...|pg||
nt|mamos: dont stop to think  often things are done at breakneck speed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is turning into a pakistan v west indies|pg||
nt|peachy: inexperience and perhaps being flustered facing world champion Israeli team|pg||

nt|mikael_w: Hi and welcome Yuval :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: They received a new deal no 1, but i don't think we can show it|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and 13 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  There was an appeal from the Wales-Scotland match yesterday afternoon. The decision has gone in Wales' favour and has resulted in another VP for them, the final result now being 20-10 VPs to Wales.|pg||
nt|puncher: surprising pass from John |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW do play 2NT as weak with both minors ... perhaps they need better suits at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|puncher: ahh|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h from South?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N very unlike to have singleton diamond |pg||
nt|arno11: He already showed his skills in bd 13 with a fine declarer play|pg||
nt|bg: spade 8 could be anything but best for pard to simply read it as top of nothing|pg||
nt|bg: besides he has an easy heart return|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes bruce pity true |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: agree with you Bruce|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d on here|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is in 2@Dx on 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: although I'm beginning to learn that it's dangerous to make such predictions |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 55 minutes is Netherlands Juniors vs Germany|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|2hplus4: Appeals are an unappealing part of the game. Why can't players just get on with the game|pg||
nt|puncher: 3@H enough second in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an excellent 6@c|pg||
nt|bg: also E can count 15 points in N hand may hot have dia Q|pg||
nt|po-s: these last trains may cuse a problem if you actually have a control instead of a rain|pg||
nt|po-s: train|pg||
mb|p!|nt|ralfwil: with splitted @d honours and @h4-1, they can defeat 5@h|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 5 vanished|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: even withe 4/1 club break it looks pretty good|pg||
nt|sybarra: a makeable 3 nt,  not sure all will get there |pg||
nt|bg: EW playing 2 of a major reasonable hand and 2 Dia opening to show weak two in a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|kemperg: cricket?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thayare juniors Mike - what you suggest comes with age and experience|pg||

nt|m_niemi: EW has gone down some slams today|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will see if they bid another|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep - a rout|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  slam needs 2 out of 3 finesses, so only 50% ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: was 1@s a muddy the waters bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt presumanbly  now|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer like we play them|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to reach tho|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
nt|paulg:  this could be a gain as I think 4@h is more Carroll's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|rich89: is 1@s nat?|pg||
nt|rich89: y..|pg||
nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45: går i lobby nu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why would W bid 2@C, would bid 2@H for transfer and then 3@H or 4@D.|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond lead may give 9th  immediately|pg||
nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
nt|arno11: W cld make 3 NT on a @D lead but......|pg||
nt|the saint: Can just ruff two hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a sound slam 8 card fit combined 32 points control rich hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe   |pg||
nt|peachy: To answer kibitzers, http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: np|pg||
nt|sommer: the primary reason for the finesse - as I see it - is that @CQ could be very worng from Q9, IF S has 5c @C!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Ernst, But can you in any way get the result in when they have played it so the IMP:s will be right ?|pg||
mb|p!|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans is speaking to Roland I am sure,  not mind all |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 'brilliant dummy'|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting at N/S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E hoping the club suit comes in |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: East shaking his head|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||
nt|paulg:  and may feel the pressure throughout the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  might lead small club|pg||
nt|paulg:  although North's actions suggest the minors|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But @H lead is obvious I think|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Partner could easily have the ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he is thinking then Anderson now knows where everything is|pg||
nt|sybarra: was he smiling when he said that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well em|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 1N raptor on N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: becoming dizzy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrongly directed with the ace of the 4th suit.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything home and hosed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
nt|arno11: W shld probaby act over 1@S  e.g. with 1NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if East opens, nothing will stop W|pg||
nt|mamos: and North has no reason to go on|pg||
nt|mamos: except the enthuisiasm of youth and confidence in partner's declarer play|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not? |pg||
nt|mamos: both NS have nice hands 14 points but good tricks and shape |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has enuf to make anotyher move|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have not been beaten up yet |pg||
nt|bg: I would have bid 3nt with S hand after two hearts too close to only bid 2nt North might easily have passed 2nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 45 minutes: USA vs Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|mikael_w: here it looks like 6 @s will depend on !3-2 and a @d finess|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 45 minutes is USA v Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: jx @d becomes big when pasrtner has reversed and rebid @ds |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not many pauirs even at open level would find 6@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: girls in OR have 1 disaster after the other|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps after anugly 1N opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doubling 3@h into game was not a very good shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
nt|the saint: West is unlimited. You have a maximum pass so partner can't go overboard. Bid 3C to show support and develop the auction|pg||
nt|mamos: Germany need something alittle more exciting if they are going to get back some imps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  50% is more then enough for juniors:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: that will not work. Sp lets see if they stop in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
nt|gowdy: now the 3 @S tricks are blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: then ou get a club lead and all is well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 ever 9 never here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well that takes care of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: board 4 holding 4 to the J|pg||
nt|kemperg: and giving away a spade trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
nt|arno11: what wld X show for you guys after 1@D-X-1@S ?|pg||
nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|yuval10: estimated score now is 12:9 Sweden, as 2@d gone for 500|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Why is the 1nt so wierd:)?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a lot of strong no-trump plyaers open 1NT on any 5332 shape|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@c is an improvising bid from W it seem|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = multi - 2@H pass/correct, 2NT strong, 3@H tranfer, |pg||
nt|yuval10: normal to bid 4@d to show strength and fit @s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thanks Ernst, When will they play board 1 then? At the end or as soon as they get the board ?|pg||
nt|ahalim: double dummy you can make all 13 tricks :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||
nt|peachy: Th French team also has wnjoyed sucess in past tournaments|pg||
nt|hawe45: You must add @C Queen third|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: at the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: poor play by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if that what happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: but undone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats inexperience|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
nt|mamos: ive always thought thee should be a new card in the bidding box  "Undo"   could I try that one again ::)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp tjat West has shown his 20HCP and good @S-support, so he can stop in 4@S - but he has the @D-cue, so..|pg||
mb|5C|nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c might be taken as weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||
nt|sybarra: aka jrs|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lestergold: north has shown a hand worth a game try on an uncontested auction of 1@s 2@s which would ne an acceptNCE WITH SOUTH'SHAND|pg||
nt|the saint: 2H sets up a game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but I'm surprised that West passed when he has a normal 4@h call|pg||
nt|puncher: Other room are currrently playing 5@C doubled so a few imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson pretty sure that the ace of clubs is onside given the spade return|pg||
nt|the saint: So 3C can't be passed|pg||
nt|the saint: Many also use a lebensohl type relay in this position to cater for the weak hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2nt forces 3C  so 3 C is strong|pg||
nt|peachy: in U25|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: looks like 1 down, maybe 2 -- but it won't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: where would he rather be 6 @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: probably a push if S opens 1N in the other room as well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you try to ruff down the @cQ arent you giving up on the finesse?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open 1NT when holding AQ10xx in a major but I play a weak NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes / I see|pg||
nt|yuval10: a lot of imps in the lead now|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong red !q in East|pg||
nt|ahalim: but in practice you may go down in 6 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: you WILL go down, no possible way to figure the @d's out|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok Arifin? You got me? How are you going to make that ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: but perhaps the 4@c bid will make N lead something else|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: play  aow on the lead and let W be high on @sQ... Probably making|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  being told that 13 points is a strong opening bid :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: best by E|pg||
nt|pelu: same bidding over 2NT in OR|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45: Must be discussed for every pair|pg||
nt|m_niemi: West passes some times forcing bids, so East didn't want to risk anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would bid 3@c with a minimum and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gowdy: "Ingberman" in north america|pg||
nt|lestergold: lower range of 3@c is suely no9t strong|pg||
nt|the saint: Hence why Ingberman/Blackout is played to allow a direct 3C to show values|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless partnership agrees that 2n only shows a minimum|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gowdy: for me penalty  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to dash folks but p[lenty of you cu later|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the  @d auction was ridiculous|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dagold: technically he should cash the diamond Ace here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play low....|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suppose West opens 1@h and East responds 1@s, what does West rebid?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|puncher: WBU still 30 or so ahead of England, and Wales now in the 25 zone against N Ireland|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand was bid rather well considering how light n/s open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: however this auction points to the ned for a look at theirbidding methods|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ingberman is over reverses but some have extended it to 2-level jump shifts by opener as well.|pg||
nt|the saint: It is definitely worth playing it in these positions too|pg||
nt|sybarra: well see......thats why you bid it |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks John!|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks John|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2: EW will be happy to see flat hands after those huge swings in the beginning, they know they dont need more imps because the VP scale stops at 25 vp for 37 imps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|newmoon: he heard u|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love this story = Paddy the Irishman, Paddy the englishmasn and paddy the scotsman attended a lecture on extremes. Paddy the englishman asked what the opposite of sadness was - ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: elation, he said. Paddy the scotsman asked the opposite of joy was - sadness he said. Paddy the Irishman asjed the oppoite of Woe - said Giddyup|pg||
nt|kemperg: as was the 3@D on 5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andreasw:  I would almost Allways open 1nt on W hand|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: u cant balance angels on pinheads good trumps and a  couple of cards must be enuf|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|puncher: So Wales can't do much more, but England might perk up - just a case of whether they can do enough or not|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|pelu: best to play @C now to get some count|pg||
nt|yuval10: South took a view that declarer doesn't have 4 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I think the slam is a little less then 50%. But I also remember when I was a junior. And this slam would be bid even if you could see all the cards before bidding :)|pg||
nt|pelu: give East @DQ and not @Hq - and we all would say: missed lay down slam :):)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West took the @D-finess in trick 2??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: He looks like Rodin's thinker now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think its a big chanse/risk this slam will be bid in all 4 tables, but lets se|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|santyclz: It can't be a winning strategy in the long run to allow your opps to play 1 level contracts unless you know they (and you) have no fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a stiff i meant to stay|pg||
nt|mamos: The bridge table can be a lonely place when things go badly and get worse and worse and worse|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|yuval10: i wonder if 2@c was invitational or GF, doesn't look so likely that South will accept an invitation so quickly with his hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|the saint: A chance for Belgium to get a few back|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yorkbeach:  suppose so but 1@h followed by 2@d sounds like an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Give East 4-2-4-3 and 9-10 points... can easy miss game|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|nt|kemperg: I think inv|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 2@c was 2way cbs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: could have doubled 1@s with the trumps and no other features|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hmmm, wonder what the reason was for that ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: intra hook|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzag: dont ask me :)|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|s9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: vwey well played|pg||
nt|yuval10: important for south to play 9@d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Now he will have full count and know S has 4 @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: when declarer plays the suit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzag: Rodin again|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@d ?|pg||
nt|pelu: W know @D 4-2with 4 in S - so odds for the finess|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, South played @d himself...if he plays from under the Q he gave declarere a chance of making a no-play contract ( if he didn't have the T@d )|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, But I still cant stop wonder why on earth E at other table would make the @d finess in trick 2 ?|pg||
nt|pelu: yes strange|pg||
nt|mikael_w: with some luck you can often found out that N has only 1 @d if you play like Schwartz has done|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, I was now told it was W that played in other room. Still as strange tho|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and I also know Fisher is dec here :) sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: 17 imps on the line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's West here too|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Suspenced is mounting....|pg||
nt|mikael_w: anyone has anything to say about the psycic between discard a @h or @cQ in north the last trick ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i stand corrected - 20 imps of course ( +17 or -3 )|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, you are right.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chessmaste: I think declarer played too quickly, although he might always go down.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But a player who leads the @DJ from J-x-x is usually happy if it is covered by the queen. So, not automatic for South to cover.|pg||
nt|psridhar: one of the findamental requirement in bidding is planning your rebid -b4 overcalling 1@d W needs to think of his rebid when pd responds 1Maj|pg||
nt|davidb: declarer  could play for 4th club to be high\squeeze \getting more information .|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll remember that next time I have  AK32    J54    against you, David Bird|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Best chance to lead the jack I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought that was how you normally played the combination!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is for many, sadly|pg||
nt|brolucius: They should book some lessons with you, in that case. |pg||
nt|chessmaste: The Chinese might be found of that play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Splendid idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Can anyone afford lessons with Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: An excellent protective 1@S from North.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Is she under some shock that her partner passed her 1@H or was that NF anyway?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes Mark, reasonable rates|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will lend you some money, Mark, if you are desperate for some lessons.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David knows them because he proof-read my document|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: I find it better to charge unreasonable rates - then your students think you know something |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also a good idea, hmmm|pg||

nt|paulg:  unfortunately the crash meant that our operator could not catch up with the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  not Alan's fault of course, but unfortunate on an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Operation misfit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only 8 tricks at that point but defence is under a lot of pressure omn the run of spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but what shall W return when only minors left?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compliments to the players, they are playing at a fast pace:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good result for Austria(Österreich)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Another bad minor-break here|pg||
nt|santyclz: You also need to discuss what a jump shift forces to, game? 4 of a minor?  Both are used.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finns made 4@h in OR bd 23|pg||
nt|gowdy: on the muli hand  NS had a good auction to 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks are easy now so North was obviously   correct :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: we all have that experience|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 78@d auction when south rebid 3@d after the 1H response north had AKxx of spades which she should have showb rather than raise to 4@ds with a low doubleton|pg||
nt|kemperg: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tofte telling Lee he almost finessed in @c as Lee ducked so quickly|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and here|pg||
nt|po-s: doesn´t everybody nowadays play 2C as puppet to 2D?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45: Nederste linje med bl. a. grønne firkanter, ses kun halvt. Kan jeg rykke noget|pg||
mb|p!|nt|paulg:  Fight between North and East here|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   this is where I have results |pg||
nt|tomi2: other table already finished, that is not so seldom with Hop-Helmich playing :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner wopuld then  have rebid 3N whioch would have ended the auction|pg||
nt|santyclz: Echo.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 10 points and 4 @d East might raise 2@d to 3@d|pg||
mb|1H|nt|2hplus4: E would like to look for @H fit and play in 3@C Can he achieve that?|pg||
nt|gowdy: will west be quite here|pg||
nt|gowdy: I think not|pg||
nt|mamos: NS can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: is W thinking he should get in?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west is a she and yes she is thinking|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty :)  didnt know a "she"|pg||
nt|bg: with S I like a 4 dia splinter firstly you have the single dia but you should also promise not ot have two club losers thus on this hand N could move with confidance but now has a ...|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 13|pg||

nt|kemperg: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have jammed them up a bid  now a free ride really |pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer to bid my Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: 21-19 points   for this one looks less exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry guys, I'm almost faling asleep with the speed at this table|pg||
nt|mamos: did North really pass??? surely 1NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Took the middle road between 3@h and 4@c and went directly to 4@h.|pg||

nt|sybarra: 5 @C in tempo ...pls|pg||

nt|bg: not I|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not a fan - too big a chance of hearts, more in spades and other things|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am so sure of the splinter with that ht holding,  but can understand it |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the 4@S bid was alerted on both sides maybe not the common 4@S?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Im not interested in slam but with boss suit.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i pass as N|pg||
nt|sommer: a gerber 3@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: close|pg||
nt|sommer: ..they play it standard|pg||
nt|po-s: they´ll learn...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord another one but hardly bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most british players i know would if pard say bids 3n u can play 4@s with confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or use:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 4@s  that much  -- it depends on what you agree about splinters|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid 4@C if he has a chance|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: my agreements with splinters are may be unique, but I dont have xxx (or jxxxxx) in an outside suit |pg||
nt|davidstern: If 5@S asks south to bid six with club control I would have perhaps tried that|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone understand the double of 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: "cards" ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: or bid 5 @C if you want  |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Even if you hold your thumbs for Israel you must feel better that Fisher makes the finess. In the long run he will make alot of IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably some imps back to Israel here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or correction. He will lose alot less IMP:s doing that|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s = in the OR is a very good score|pg||
nt|mamos: the auction in the OR is a little surprising after WEst overcalled|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the alerts should be moved - 1@C and 1@H are alerted|pg||
nt|pelu: pass and 1NT naturel|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|mamos: surprising that East let NS play 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Rodin is back again|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a very ordinary 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Problem is, that when you bid with this West-hand - partner will bring you too high|pg||
nt|arno11: 6 in a minor possible here but difficult to make....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w are not too flush here in a high level club contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Pass alerted by east, not by west|pg||
nt|pelu: S was on the france junior gold-team in 2009 (Brasov) - and 2 x spangenberg on NL-girls in 2007 - Silver - so we have real topclass here!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho i would nevber have jumped to 3@d with such an awful suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think both of them take some blame for that auction|pg||
nt|sommer: many Danes play Gerber up-side -down|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer(Walsh?)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Have to be careful not to get overboard on this one.|pg||
nt|kemperg: p and I use it for weak hands, with inv+ we use transters|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i don't think everyone would've accept the invitation with South's hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1H = @s ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ehaa....every hand an adventure!|pg||
nt|mamos: West had better not think she has defence|pg||
nt|bg: The doudle is cards vut as happened in last match partner thought otherwise and allowed -590 vs makinf game themselves|pg||
nt|bg: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel NPC reaches for more heart medicine?|pg||
nt|peachy: this looks like transfer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
nt|m_niemi: his shape is good suit texture not so good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4 th suit forcing 2@D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: very odd|pg||
nt|kemperg: think it is|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass as North|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a current trend, to use transfer bids in a lot of sequences|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N was the better choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know 1NT here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dekkers and Robert very surprised the tray came back without further bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be 4/5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1NT hearts and diamonds yes|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like 5 IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|mamos: so this should be a gain for Israel|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!|pg||
nt|mamos: too late he dropped dead :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may have dropped dead on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still might work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: my principle is simple a jump rebid always guarantees a suit with no more than one loser except in very exceptional circumstances when u are really fixed for any altgernative|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told 4-6 H+D|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen:)|pg||
nt|sommer: sryyyyyyyyyyyy Roland for the G word:(..mistypo|pg||
nt|kemperg: many Dutch play 2N nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: inv+|pg||
nt|yuval10: though kibitzers suggest that NS' style of play is to invite with very "heavy" hands|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: try for a 5/3 fit |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if he pushes to 3nt or not |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s a good xcontract|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was minimum, 4 enough|pg||
nt|santyclz: That solved that problem, I was worried about a 4@c cue bid.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 losers, better not|pg||
nt|andreasw:  He Might...:)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: soory 6 in N|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|arno11: good idea to stay in 3N...|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite  but my juniors when I was captain bid  but if you don;t think you can buy the hand don;t give free information|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - double-dummy 6 NT is rather dold|pg||
nt|hawe45: cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: Stripe tailed double|pg||
nt|mamos: 1280  is an "interesting score"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it was XX |pg||
nt|davidstern: Just so you know 120+120+120+120+50+50+200+200|pg||
nt|davidstern: +300 for game =1280|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@S was something like 0+15 HCP with 5card spade and no interest in slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: why dbl in S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what s woiuld have bid if e passes|pg||
nt|mamos: I think 2@D by North might have been wiser :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: If it would've promised 6@d's, north would've bid 2@d I think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead according to the bidding|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice try here|pg||
nt|kemperg: French captain confirms 4-6|pg||
nt|pelu: so prob 9+ red cards with longer @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i hope this gets whacked and defended properly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes he did |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 quick tricks need a 9 th |pg||
nt|sybarra: vul,  probably tempting |pg||
nt|jcomyn: spose he thought n had something for 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: French girls captain|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Laura asking about French weak 2 openings|pg||
nt|mamos: either pass is some forget or a little unwise opposita partner who passed originally|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll ask the players after the board|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
nt|the saint: West doesn't have a big enough club fit to justify 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul this is ridiculous|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W should have 4 card support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H+1@S+@C+1@D=8|pg||
nt|bg: anthing but a club will make it hard to find 9th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C in bad position for the Q@C |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double of 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouchhhh|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Looks like -1:(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahalim: asking for a @D lead  ?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
nt|kemperg: I have a younger partner, so I use them a lot|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: price of lack of discipline|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East had already told his cards, so why bid 5@c|pg||
nt|santyclz: or HHx with Hx in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kemperg: No @D cue, always end in4|pg||
nt|santyclz: One would assume - and might make 5 anyway;.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
nt|tomi2: he was on lead himself|pg||
nt|mamos: a little surprised tht North has sold out to 3@h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: K telling her partner something?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: to m ake a voluntury call holding no more than 3 to the K and a stiff in pard's other suit is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|the saint: Ducked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has eight tricks here now   can he find a ninth?|pg||
nt|po-s: North did have a heavy hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thats seven tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jameslee 2: rule of 7 he duck 1 @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: help from opps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: no down 1 in toptricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not have been the greatest duck in history|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it has grosvenor elements about it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aflac...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N want's to retain trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N expects p not to have trumps anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so that way ducking wouldn't cost anything|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  bad breaks in the majors are gong to make the play tricky|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, are you that sure 1 NT will make ?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east hassnt promised 6 @cs|pg||
nt|bg: EW not on same wavelength |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as spec notes - have you discussed with partner whether the pass of 4@Sxx by Eats suggests he wants to defend or nothing to say|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2NT GF mainly in DK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: o yes still 1down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive reviewed board 1 which i was late for and there was a 10 imp swing there when the dutvh giels here went off in 3n the french declarer made the correct technical play of cashing ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: the AK @s in case !q dropped and then fell back on the heart finesse which worked|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now trumps and this will go down a lot|pg||
nt|the saint: To be fair, one nation's juniors who I would certainly not expect to be reticent in the auction are the Finns!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most of the reticence has come from s.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes or a 50% position |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, NOW it sure will|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: the dutgch girl here simply chose the losing spade finesse which happened to be wrong so that was not luck but incorrect card paly|pg||
nt|lestergold: so to be fair that swing was caused in this room in effect|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if he takes the A@d no matter|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - here we also comment to play @S first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Maybe can win on an endplay?|pg||
nt|yuval10: she sry|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry, missaw the first @d, south took the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: position is now correct, but north on lead with @dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: makes then|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no endplay, Grönkvist shrugged and conceded down 1.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|m_niemi: -6!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2: he can exit with a high club and if that is ducked passively|pg||
pc|h7|nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: yes sorry i had been late|pg||
pc|d7|nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||
nt|the saint: Only -3|pg||
mc|7|nt|xenya: a real horror for the German team -- the'd better wipe it out of their minds as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|tomi2: in amsterdam the comming rounds start very fast, you get the chance to make it better very soon. 6 matches a day...|pg||
nt|mamos: next :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but after a small @d from S its not clear how to play. And I have seen worse thing happend then 1 NT going down on this board even after @dA on @dK|pg||

nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead 2 x @S|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@H shows @S one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must go folks dinner time here leaving you in very many capable hands thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: explained as Majors by east|pg||
nt|davidstern: I only have nightmares about my own bridge. A good friend told me once thta I should only worry about my bridge if I worry about partner's I dont have enough faith to play with ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: him/her|pg||
nt|sybarra: my dutch friends will explain slaap lekker|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not the right time for the Moysean @h slam.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no sry W can pitch @d :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if you play 9 you can get down even with @d A onside|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lebensohl|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@h is 2-3 @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: so south does not have to check for a heart fit but ccan either invite to game or simply bod 3nt and try to make|pg||
nt|kemperg: using 2@C with 3card, 2N gives 4crd|pg||
nt|sommer: Bergen makes that not necessary, you see|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my money on 6c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we think 2NT is constructive?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@c would have been 'pass or correct'?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Always lead TRUMP|pg||
nt|davidstern: Newswires announcing death of Elizabeth Taylor|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT invite now?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh never mind, Probebly it will always make one way or another|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: c u|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: maximum hand in N what to bid?|pg||
nt|bg: 4 hearts makes as long as E is patient uhtil he gets to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4NT sounds like a good option?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true x@S+x@S entry in dummy or @H finesse by opps played :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=|pg||
nt|mamos: Spade lead will curtail his efforts to mae many more than seven tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: this was one good example of why transfer bids work; if n was on lead, a d would be much easier for the def|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding seems sensible despite both being maximum|pg||
nt|mamos: East is "fearless"|pg||
nt|kemperg: I know, but we use 3@C/@D different|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this may explain the 3@h bid.  Perhaps the 4 level shows a big hand as they play.|pg||
nt|the saint: The strong option in the multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks mike.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Tim there you are |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4Nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we might make too many |pg||
nt|mamos: i think we always were making too many  for 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w is even more fearless|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@S?|pg||
nt|sommer: if you play sayc, you can use jump in opposite MA to show 10-12 with 3cards..with 2/1, 1NT followed by 3@S..or?|pg||
nt|kemperg: good suit, inv. not forcing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
nt|bg: by fooling around with the 3 dia bid E has given N an option to bail out in 4nt which will only be beaten by a non heart lead|pg||
nt|daman: It will be hard to beat this contract|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so too :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't forget the bidding space won|pg||
nt|daman: 8 toppers with a myraid of ways for 9|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N +3 on 4|pg||
nt|mamos: interesting that on this board the Swedish bid 1NT at both tables|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Here the swedes takes control over the bidding and play 1 NT on both tables|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR plays very agressive opening|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wrong sided clubs :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C cue comfirming @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright now 3h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why did s not crack 3D|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think anyh partner would have done same|pg||
nt|mamos: too be fair the pre-empt warns of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@H lead ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@D|pg||
nt|pelu: in bord 7 France in 3@C X - has to guess @HQ to make - W didnt - and down 1|pg||
nt|mamos: so some work for declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, If I rememebr right they play 9-12 NT or something ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gowdy: well a heart they could life with  but ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is leading!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry other side leads ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is shaking his head, east says wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of in the rules :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 SpaDES 3 diamonds 2 Clubs and an extra red trick|pg||
nt|sommer: ..SW on the same side of the screen...S didnt think about a panther double:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South needs to cash @h now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|mamos: well Herats looks lik eten tricks now  but wasnt cold so perhaps this will turn out ok|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good bid 0 are they playing minor key-card|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???? |pg||
nt|mamos: I think 3Nt was  just a bit timid |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: Erwin, you trying to give us heart attacks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@c = puppet Stay|pg||
nt|lestergold: a sabage layout...|pg||
nt|pelu: if u only sse EW-cards looks easy, but @Ss 4-1 great problem|pg||
nt|mamos: very easy to go off|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: ho9wever im nor convinced they would have found best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: should this be whacked?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@s = 4@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: NS had a chance to go plus, but not anymore|pg||
nt|santyclz: Judging from the length of the huddle, I would assume not.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: and 4@d is -4 too:)|pg||
nt|sommer: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: strange 4@h bid|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky again for DK, that USA went the same 3 down in 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, see board 8 & 12|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Sime can lead the @sK, hoping for 3-3 spades, and forcing West to duck|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161, Eng 161, Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he is banking everything on hearts, which will be less successful|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes eight :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|puncher: yes with the club entries might have been better to go for spades|pg||
nt|mamos: it certainly wasnt intended as a Spade cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: we landed....how ever we got there   (dont ask) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I got all the alerts from W|pg||
nt|mamos: ok   we arrived|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: doubles are always t/o John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: evcen when p doubles 1nt?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E will be crushed|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ohh no did not see 5@C |pg||
nt|bg: France now has 9 imp lead as a result of the mix up on the double on board 3|pg||
nt|kemperg: if that is cue S has a problem, @H Q not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5d now|pg||
nt|pelu: and also close to make in OR: @cK, @S to A and now @HQ ducked and @H again - but decl did'nt take the finess|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Not many cards are at the right place in the def for dec on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs to be patient here|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I guess its itching in w:s fingers now wanting to turn @h. Lets see if he can hold himself ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: the question is if he can be sure of how many @h's his partner has|pg||
nt|pelu: @S again will work fint for defense|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he know it's 2, then playing @h might be the best thing as he only needs 9X  from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Fisher up to now has taken all the playing time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: so far the def has been perfect I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c duck by East was very elegant|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: But he had all the problems|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: nothing else to do |pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Chiu very surprised seeing @dK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  i think he failed to appreciate the defensive problems that he *might* cause by leading the @sK|pg||
nt|peachy: W does best to return pds suit|pg||
nt|ahalim: I hope thay kanow what they are doing|pg||
nt|kemperg: on the internet site from BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: and defensis time :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: do much for your goulash Mike....|pg||
nt|ahalim: *know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: they do indeed|pg||
nt|ahalim: well bid|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like declarer will lose 6 tricks for 1 down -- still NS have an easy no-trump partial|pg||
nt|mamos: doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: im trying to think whether sungkle dummy it is technically correct to play a small spade from hand to the 6 as u c a afford 2 spade losers so long as u maintain control of the hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: d weill hardly be led|pg||
nt|kemperg: than 1 up|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E will duck the @d|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, the was misstake nr 1 I think|pg||
nt|mikael_w: really nice def if e took this and returned @h3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Welllllllllll|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a make now|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt pard open 1 @D???|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: well i see that @h got away in open room i csn imagine how cash rtwo spade and a @d tov ace end of defence|pg||
nt|pelu: still ok for defense|pg||
pc|d5|nt|idc: Am told that North led a @d in other room, making declarer's task easier - this may go down here|pg||
nt|idc: That slam on Bd 21 - 6@c is better than I first thought, a very good contract in fact|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he knew they were 3-3 --no double lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i prefer hearts to herats|pg||
nt|santyclz: Meanwhile the open room has caught up to us.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and then @d to A and @h2. But remember its alot easyer for us looking at all cards :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: 4@C misunderstood?|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|sybarra: Houston we have landed is what the astronauts say |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they seemed to know what they were doing,  just scared the rest of us|pg||
nt|hawe45: East will regret, that he skipped a @C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: in fact 4 rounds of spades does it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and see you nest match!|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many swings here despite the swingy nature of the boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: almost falls out of his chair now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|garnetts: spade discard ---hmmmmm  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Better to cash the @cak before crossing to hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: :) http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
pc|sT|nt|garnetts: probably expecting better diamonds from partner |pg||
nt|kemperg: then 4@H strange|pg||
nt|sommer: very...hiding those @D's looks very strange|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idc: Looks like SOuth switched to @dT at trick two - may have been right to do so but not this time|pg||
nt|arno11: shld now make shld hacve ruffed diamond then !T Q  pitching his heart loser and coming to 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45: he still makes it easily|pg||
nt|arno11: @c Q I meant|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: cereless play - why not start ducking a @S - the loose (on normal sits) 2 @S and a @C - even with @Ss 3-2 problem now - only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: even double dummy not simple|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all this is a hand where u have a few problems in the club suit so u need to prepare a cross ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing for NI |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west discards @d on third spade 4th spade does the buysiness|pg||
nt|mikael_w: not now, well played to play the last @d|pg||
nt|yuval10: now K@s and @h, but can he see that?|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@s that is|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now @s and a small @h|pg||
nt|mamos: top Spade now and endplay |pg||
nt|mikael_w: @s Q that is offcurse|pg||
nt|pelu: can take @SQ and play @H to 9 = 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45: Oh - trouble now|pg||
nt|arno11: now how does he make with an error?|pg||
nt|arno11: without|pg||
nt|kemperg: trying to prevent @C start, but partner also believed he had no@D control:(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: this 3nt makes on a lucky day... spades 4-4, @DA with E for example|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|peachy: East should see he can do no better than 4 tricks for defense, this was an excellent attempt !|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think this will be a gain for EW    pretty standard contract|pg||
nt|peachy: true|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|dK|nt|lestergold: its savage |pg||

nt|newmoon: bd 13:  13 imps to N.I. when 3NT makes @DA, 4@Cs and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|newmoon: interesting misfit here|pg||
nt|newmoon: u open 1@H, David?|pg||
nt|xenya: so the gadget has worked nicely|pg||
nt|xenya: it seems EW were not quite sure about the combined strength of their hands|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So 1 down after all that|pg||
nt|puncher: hi all :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: and hello Ian|pg||
nt|idc: G'day Sam & Roland|pg||
nt|puncher: but that was quick!|pg||
nt|sybarra: but nicely done |pg||
nt|mamos: ok  well I say "Well done"  I hate you lot to watch some of my bidding :)  Good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 9 and 10 still to come|pg||
nt|mamos: two more boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4 herats agsain|pg||
nt|tomi2: vuln 2nd seat this is very much "bottom of range"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nice spade situation makes game easy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they reach game|pg||
nt|lestergold: would a world class wizard have made this contract that is the question|pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR h opened 2@H, leader expects 41|pg||
nt|sommer: nice possible 3NT again NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, I dont use the movie|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mm could be trouble for someone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 15 the Israeli NS bid to 4@h and went one down|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, Israel is getting closer every board now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: interesting hand since 4@S seems better than 3NT--but no way to bid it I think|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|puncher: good effort|pg||
nt|xenya: i see, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||
nt|ady: club guess |pg||
nt|dagold: or one of these constructive 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold: is fine|pg||
nt|dagold: as Espen has done|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib said:  "or one of these constructive 2@h"|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be at the "speed table" |pg||
nt|ralfwil: two more boards!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Things are getting a little out of hand for Belgium.|pg||
nt|tomi2: they might be missing 5 tricks but how often are opps not able to catch them in time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike you get the last 2 hands,  I have to catch a train |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry all,  and have fun |pg||
nt|kemperg: north|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another easy contract - getting there might not be as easy|pg||
mb|p!|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||
nt|mamos: A poor result for US from OR   East put too much confidence in his cards and partner's overcall|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S?..|pg||
nt|sommer: no|pg||
nt|kemperg: too weak for me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play here for 6@h|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not with a trump lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can throw a @d on the 3rd @s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
nt|rich89: x better than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had the italians been doing this to the hyngarians i could have said made spaghetti of them but today no pasta for lunch i'm afraid|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Vincent!!! great job|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @Sducks and a flat board|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@d = @h, 1NT = 18-19 bal. |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D a ht raise of some sort|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a good raise   |pg||
nt|mamos: better be a good raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although they rate to pick some up on 27.|pg||
nt|bg: E opened 2 spades in other room led to a lebensohl auction to stop in 3 dia|pg||
nt|peachy: makeable, anyway:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I was thinking of 4s|pg||
nt|mamos: It's easy to be wise :)  but for us oldies watching it does seem at time that mistakes are made by rushing play - technically most of these players are excellent  -- better than me ...|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure but need to be a little more patient with the cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  on any lead?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1 @d ruff and 1@s ruff appear to be enough|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK with trump lead also|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed you do not want to be in it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: anyway, one can sympathise with S's decision to bid 3N, considering the state of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
nt|bg: W pass good decision  in other room W bid 2 clubs and that led E to double 4 spades whichmakes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4h|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope that's not reverse Drury.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
nt|kemperg: isthat forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dangerous approach|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bull at a gate stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: South's suit is good enough for trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to miss 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: also hard to make :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h   may be some mini splinter or some Bergen like raise|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree don't like 2@c  at this vul|pg||
nt|bg: if pard made a two level overcall I would double 4 spades also|pg||
nt|mamos: "1-under mixed raise" Im authoritatively told|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree  -- it was East's confidence in his partner's overcall that was misplaced :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers|pg||
nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Sorry, backwards)|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d FG XT-NT and now probably 3 @h's|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, this looks like a flat board, If they just bid 3 NT now its time to get some coffey for me :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can hold 2 @S in 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3nt in this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: will most likely also be one off|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finn S bid 3NT, N removed|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wouldn't want to be there but you might conceivably get a @sq lead.|pg||
nt|the saint: With the @S 9 wrong that just delays the inevitable...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT has a chance, this has none|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1NT 15-17 here?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh oh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happened the c suit - sorry forgot it doesnt exist any more|pg||
nt|yuval10: *2 @h showing 3@h's, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 3 x @S and a @D will endplay South|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was French E,  I guess SEF went out the window for the french jrs |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think there weas much chance of missing game on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fighting for part scores is one of the most fataql bridge diseases|pg||
nt|sommer: me2..despite, he may be able to trans and show 5-4 min with singleton @S.. still stopping in 4mi!..?cant trans and invite below|pg||
nt|sommer: ..last part out|pg||
nt|santyclz: Let's hope it's not normal Drury.|pg||
nt|kemperg: whats reverse Drury?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is not so easy against a @d lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Return to the base suit is the weak hand rather than 2@d being the weak hand.|pg||
nt|mamos: North does have a hand with little to reccommend it|pg||
nt|kemperg: thats normal for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Alok Daga|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Alok|pg||
nt|puncher: hi there|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not a fan of MUD leads but they can be difficult for declarer to read too|pg||
nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: havent seen any alert but im not sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 im told|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 14+5-card suiit = 15|pg||
nt|kemperg: you cant do without|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not so hot on a d lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: as in no hope?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but s will hardly pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: Technically in Drury a 2@d bid shows a sub-minimum, reverse Drury is perhaps more common than "normal" these days.|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes but will W lead a @D from AJ10x ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|henryb:  I doubt it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jack is technically correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought you meant what West would lead back after a diamond to the ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  i'd invite showing a heart stop and four spades if partner was in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs care|pg||
nt|lestergold: now defence have to cash their tricks in teh right order|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be clear which is not the same as easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks again to Johan Gronkvist in the kibitz for explaining NS' system|pg||
nt|mamos: yes cant see any excitement here|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can....if declarer doesn't play @c's right away to knock out E's entry, but i agree he's likely to do so|pg||
pc|d3|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
nt|sybarra: dear me,  e/w....where did our jrs go?|pg||
nt|mamos: East has a good hand West has some tricks   come on lads   bid B% &*( game|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 1/2 hour is not super fast for 10 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N should make but not laydown|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??? did not expect that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not often the israel team gets it wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: next round we have a big match: Dutch Juniors vs. Sweden, 3 and 4 in the standings|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know what 2@c wa?s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: man up as we say!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I cannot conceive of a passed hand where 3N is the right contract with the South hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: me neither|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i third that|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep, I'd be with the field on this one.  Going down as usual.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, they are so far behind that they cant lose a lot anymore but win some vp if those games are somehow working|pg||
nt|Walddk4: North showed his hand with Drury first|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT maybe but not 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahalim: that means a @D from W and a @H back|pg||
nt|arno11: action over for now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks promising  until trick 3 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: then the nature of his hand, balanced|pg||
pc|h2|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous  in the mean time |pg||
nt|lestergold: westknows that only hope is to play partner for A@d and Q@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt would have some fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or actually this trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: with @D not breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 12|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5-0 distribution not nice feeeling when you push a close game |pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@C is good with this layout, but not reasonable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also inferences that East did not have four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!   (as always) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like you've forgotten my performance last year|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike and Hans for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|kemperg: not in Kleinman points|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So we must assign the blame to South|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally, I would pass 3@h with North|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H would have been interesting:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed 3@H looks like a sign-off|pg||
nt|henryb:  so when they lose 13, 3 of the imps go to North, the other 10 are rub of the green|pg||
nt|santyclz: You're blaming the Irish?|pg||
nt|kemperg: spoken by a golfer|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is a bad contract that happens to make|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I blame society|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well said roland|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous as we have one more hand in this set |pg||
nt|kemperg: same for  N|pg||
nt|yuval10: she again, sorry :)  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
pc|dA|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
nt|henryb:  I thought "rub of the green" was a billiards term|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cledver54|pg||
nt|peachy: singleton is unlikely, he would have led it on the go|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still making s thiunk|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
nt|arno11: flat board|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|the saint: I guess you would try to get a spade trick and then try for a partial elmination in clubs hoping for Kx and a failure to unblock - doesn't work here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 8 easy tricks the 9th can come from the club suit with the layout as it is but not an obvious source |pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really do that?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think someone put too much paprika in Miss Wagner's goulash|pg||
nt|pelu: decl cant be sure - only 8 tricks - need to remove the right A from Easts hand - here ut will work fine|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My guess is that it's from cricket, like many other terms|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone tell me why a 5-4 club fit is ignored in this room|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||
nt|bg: mis defense on board 5 cost Canada another bunch of imps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: first to a big thanks to   our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!  |pg||
nt|daman: cold    luckily|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson finding a nice safe line for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: do you have the system to invite, show a heart stop and 4 spades? I can show a heart stop and 4 spades but only game forcing not inviting|pg||
nt|sybarra: she had the warnings with X etc |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Erwin Mike, Shirley,and specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike, Germ  and Riccardo for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx my excellent fellow commentators and helpful specs see u again soon for some more white house high jinks|pg||
nt|kemperg: I''m done fore today, hae to play tennis and bridge myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: and not to forget operator who has kept us informed of interesting things|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: he played for a @C ruff but he should know that his partner likes to lead from three small...|pg||
nt|mamos: well done for bidding this -- (I think)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||
nt|lestergold: when u play for these kind of against the odd ruffs they never happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can aslo come from an endplay ity will come in the wash one way or abother|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing @S was better|pg||
nt|sommer: W has clearly shown, where @DA is:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||
nt|puncher: too double dummy to get that right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thanks to our specs.  We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.   @H@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: No leads to 5 losers|pg||
nt|kemperg: no definitly golf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Although the pitch is rarely green nowadays|pg||
nt|jcomyn: certainly not in india anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: Apparently it is both billiards and golf:  http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/rub-of-the-green.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: and the billiard blue|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|mamos: US heading for a big win|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: the play and defence here havent been very distinguished|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was one way|pg||

mb|2C|an|alert|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Our thanks to them. Any encouragement that is given to the dwindling number of young people playing the game is very welcome. (I could not even persuade my own son to take it ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: up...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not that I thought it was right to press too hard. He preferred football and lager drinking.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Just like David Burn|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Football?|pg||
nt|psridhar: i agree with your son 50% :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The lager part, that is|pg||
nt|chessmaste: David had an excellent football career as a Goal Post |pg||
nt|brolucius: Another outing for the two-way 2@C opening bid. Either a powerhouse 2@C or a weak 2@D.|pg||
nt|psridhar: easy 3nt to end the session |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|psridhar: in fact 3 rounds of @d will be hell for W|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was an interesting enough session. The most instructive deal was probably the one where South bid spades, rather than raising partner's hearts - which cost 12 IMPs.|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless he is the " keep the change" type |pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, the aggressive club lead found at both tables, which defeated the spade slam. Lead aggressively against a suit slam and passively against 6NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second half of this match in 45 minutes|pg||

nt|newmoon: oh, ok David.   enjoy the shopping|pg||
nt|dagold: :-)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't believe that |pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s could be competing for a partial it seems to me, to force e would have to bid 2nt or above.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker found the best lead, but likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok folks last hand of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 20+ minutes |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Why can't partner have @CK instead of @DA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its awlays weak partners i fimnd who do tjis to me i canr lead from nothing without them assuming its a stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then his defence is correct|pg||
nt|mamos: a chance for EW   to win back some imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: because he led the 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: does than bot tend to deny a high honopur in most cases|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you know what they lead from K87?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Belgium bid 6@c in 26|pg||
nt|the saint: Very good result for the Finns here|pg||
nt|kemperg: was not easy|pg||

nt|yuval10: both from East and from West|pg||

nt|vugraphzag: last board of this round, we'll continue at 7pm CET for the last round in the round robin|pg||
nt|andreasw:  So there was a flat board in this session:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: thx :)|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't throw a spade of course|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess you are better at predicting than me :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  possibly not, i don't think there are any invitational bids in any part of my system|pg||
nt|sybarra: with that a Our special thanks to Roland who "herds the cats" called  commentators.... |pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has 1NT opening|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10-12 bal or not|pg||
nt|sommer: "who offers against whom?" ..now|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like Sweden had a big win here|pg||
nt|kemperg: NS wer in 2@H on this board, 4 off|pg||
nt|yuval10: might ensure them a final-four berth|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pitiful:  4@h again |pg||
nt|puncher: as a rookie commentator I need to learn to reign in my predictions|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont but ive never heard of second highest from an honour|pg||
nt|tomi2: they lead the 8 but Weyand leads another suit with that holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so they shouold change their methods|pg||
nt|mamos: despite the Israeli gain on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: multi from east|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to get to 4@H   |pg||
nt|xenya: what is N to do now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undaunted...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember we are the "speed" table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They actually do lead the 8 from that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I dont like that convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator Tim Verbeek. Super job!  |pg||
nt|kemperg: but in both rooms|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Vincent, Raija, John, George|pg||
nt|kemperg: and kibs|pg||
nt|sommer: NS will for sure go to 4@S..soon, but then?|pg||
nt|kemperg: fitbid|pg||
nt|sommer: yep|pg||
nt|sommer: inv+:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good win for USA |pg||
nt|jcomyn: interesting hands but israel slightly off day|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This could well be Israel's first loss in the tournament|pg||
mb|2C|nt|puncher: most invitational bids are just transfers anyway at teams :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empts own @s-suit this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||
nt|po-s: cute hand - both sides make 3NT if on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: now less likely to play hopeless NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thx :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators James and Bruce for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|bg: schools could pick up here in 4 harts with correct guess in dai /clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: And thanks to organizers of this annual Junior Tournament, excellent chance for young players to gain some experience and meet other young players from around the world|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to stop in 3@H:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  One of my mentors suggests that South should take 15 of the 14 imps blame for bidding 2@d instead of 2@h. I think that is severe|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, they have lost 13-17 also|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: israel already lost to their schools team in the first match|pg||
nt|mamos: I think they are likely to get 24 back on this board Roland :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: a real psych|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||
nt|paulg:  rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
nt|santyclz: S passed a 10-12 nt.  As I said, most of the reticence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done by open to miss slam but it is uinlucky lets see what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: last board here - OR still habe 2½board to play - so Fishers lang time didnt mater|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: blue coming up..|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: or not|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass instead of 1N?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|idc: we will check|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C  looks a bit ambitious and has no hope with the bad break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone think E should pass instead of 1D|pg||
nt|arno11: wow|pg||
nt|kemperg: some imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board nice chatting with you John, thanks Natalia and succes playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||
nt|puncher: not the most exciting of boards at this stage of the weekend... |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to all of  the sponsors:   All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty Tim last board ty specs , Shirley,Bruce |pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@C is either 12-14 bal, natural but not 10-15 onesuited (as the 2@C opener) or any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: knew it|pg||
nt|sommer: ...woooo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are in deep  .... trouble now|pg||
nt|mamos: although West is having a go|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at that dummy and @dJ87   not so easy to play back @d  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im toldf that 8 9s the standard lead in poland from K87 |pg||
nt|gowdy: and I thought they may find slam !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: have been a plenty of voids today|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@H and then 3@H forces to game|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, th to Wessel, Mike 2x, Peter, see you next round|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how juniors can create swings on almost every deal when we arf used to three hands in four being as flat as pancakes normally|pg||
nt|mamos: North likes bidding Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks a little ambitious|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a do or die attempt|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: When tabling the dummy, Laura says: 'I think 10 or 7 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was the first 5. the other 10 for passing 3N|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that was a near one roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not sure why Padon decided against defending at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He also knows about the psyche|pg||
nt|kemperg: has N a choice?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How few tricks does he get in 2@C on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  certainly has four, possibly five|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is worse|pg||
nt|mamos: North is cofused I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: confused|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hw|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@C OK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: heavens EW not even bidding|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this is not the cind of boards you like to see when you are trailing in the match. offcurse Israel done know they are trailing now |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks germ me too|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks kibs, nice comments from polish peaple|pg||
nt|kemperg: W expects more from the fit|pg||
nt|sommer: ..like men!!..now beat it!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 board set?|pg||
nt|yuval10: we still have 11 and 12|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen miracles before in this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  you are special We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.  |pg||
nt|kemperg: N worried about the sigleton in S:)|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry wrong way - WE are to play 2 boards more|pg||
pc|h5|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks everyone  and Erwin   great work!  see you Tomorrow|pg||
nt|tomi2: letting south pick the best game, 3nt or 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe a German imp now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: people|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes indeed very helpful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kept the pot boiling nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead but the ;ads will get a second cracj of the whip and hard to see them getting itg wrong4|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
nt|mamos: agressive double again|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: and us on the straight and narrow|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to finesse S for @HQ now...........isnt it?|pg||
nt|sommer: imo, E is too weak for 4@D, but depends on agreements|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mamos: oh no I see 450 in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: The Israelian pairs are high up in the butler|pg||
nt|henryb:  already had problem with void.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead and d switch - AARRGGH|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did e not double - what did he know we dont|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
pc|cA|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
nt|mamos: but Im not convinced by 3@C after opening bid and response|pg||
nt|kemperg: 41@D beats it I think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Is this @c system build on getting the contract on the right hand:)?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
nt|mamos: well its a two-way shot in Diamonds I guess you have to work out which opponent has King|pg||
nt|mamos: and I agree double might put him off|pg||
nt|tomi2: 25-2 VP for the Netherlands|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if i got the typing wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are obviously playing a system where 3@D is not forcing to game.....|pg||

nt|mamos: thanks Vincent|pg||

pc|d2|nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 76@C might have helped|pg||
nt|mamos: or nine :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the frence West made 4@s on the hand with @Ss 4-1 - but here N had shown a red hand - but still long way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: now couldnt see the need to cash quickly perhaps wasnot that easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bye all|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering what !6 7 meant    maybe Smith?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the heart lead was a poor shot on the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: count?|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost guaranteed to give bioth a tricka nd a tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: can't ask them anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: everyone is gone|pg||

nt|mamos: this really is a quick board :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||
pc|cT|nt|kemperg: losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back in 15 minutes with Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer must guess @ds to make this|pg||

nt|mamos: no problem for this declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: will be a quick claim after 2nd trump|pg||

nt|mamos: I'd still be scratching my head   and thinking how much I hated two-way guesses|pg||
nt|mamos: well done so I think a deserved pick up for Israel on that board the souble didnt make much difference it was bidding  and making game that gained the imps|pg||

nt|newmoon: interesting 3NT here for n/s|pg||
nt|newmoon: a @C lead, as it happens, swing the timing for the defense|pg||
nt|santyclz: Transferring into that @d suit isn't for everyone.|pg||
nt|puncher: does any bridge player ever want to get beat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: this board is a chance for Israel|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|garnetts: potential for EW to get overboard if West opens |pg||
nt|xenya: i suppse E felt he had to do something|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson/Sime open 1NT a 5-card major less often than some pairs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  4@c, showing the black suits would be best from Short, if they played that|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: Since I would be bid 2@S on much worse than that--with a semi-solid suit I like 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: west has an automatic pass |pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|paulg:  as they can show an upper range hand using Gazzilli|pg||
nt|yuval10: but looks normal to stay in 3NT|pg||
mb|4C|nt|newmoon: a lovely lead-directing dble!!|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@c Astro?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: EW have 10 tricks in @S if @C ruff not found|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd be in 5@c doing down one|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I prefer to bid a 6 card major than than show 2 suits initially|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure not, but WBU want to win to help their  1 team and Scotland want to win to finish in the top half|pg||
nt|paulg:  so they are not 'dead' matches|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Now (unofficial) Eng 162; Wales 162; Ireland; 160; Scotland 154; WBU 150; NI 110    what a finish!|pg||
nt|pelu: the dutchgirls has played very well thehole way - a strong team with Laura Dekkers from the dutch women team (Silver in Ostende)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: there is a chance of reaching 6@S|pg||
nt|april7: actually now its a must with the double fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: slim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it would help if 3@d was forcing at this point  |pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: ASPTRO|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, thanks.|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwile NI reached 7@D on 24 (uggh)|pg||
nt|puncher: so who's your money on or would you rather not say?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Too close to call|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, not to West |pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: this will be played in 4@S|pg||
nt|xenya: i thought it would be a boring 4@S by EW but now i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|xenya: 14 imps|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 6 major 5 minor and I don't use Michaels|pg||
nt|puncher: Gazzilli certainly seems to be the toy of the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the 4-1 trump break is not going to cause a problem this time|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S making here|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|garnetts: 3@H feels like an overbid |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: how many @d's does 1@d promise?  if it's 3 then how can they know about the "double fit"?|pg||
nt|april7: and all aces, there is even a possibility for 7, but not making|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Ooh-er|pg||
nt|xenya: missing an ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  would you bid 4@c over 3@h?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they've done well as the club lead looks right|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes The opponents seem limited. As it happens so is partner |pg||
mb|4S!|nt|newmoon: @C10 lead here probably better...|pg||
nt|xenya: they gained 14 imps i meant|pg||
nt|paulg:  chances for making 11 tricks if the defence do not cash their diamond tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: but at this stage the overtricks won't help either of these teams very much|pg||
nt|paulg:  @s10 next|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: surely 6@c now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|newmoon: but the C5 is higher than the 4 on the 4th round|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: on rute for 6@C - making - need @CJ to drop - @Cs 2-2 or @hs 3-3|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|newmoon: contemplating whether to get to dummy and run the @HJ, playing East for 10x|pg||
nt|puncher: Murdoch just made 4@S on board 9 so the swings continue... |pg||
nt|paulg:  John Carroll led a diamond against the contract, rather than the safer heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: maybe N should have taken a sve here -- with his singleton diamond |pg||
nt|puncher: all gratefully received - we're still in with a shout after all... |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: not to be understood, the pass by E with this hand|pg||
nt|davidb: D-H  easy squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or QJ doubleton with N (then no guess), or singleton honour with South, then a guess|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mikael_w: yes. It even looks like 7@c would make as the cards are|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7@c won't make as you have only 11 top tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: ?? how - u have to give up a @H and ruff the 4. @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no 13th trick, which is rather irrelevant when he is in 6|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Yuval, you are right. only 11 tricks. I was only watching the @d-@h squeze mon S|pg||

nt|2hplus4: @C lead needed|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Unlikely from W|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence may block the diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: which might give them another shot|pg||
nt|2hplus4: True and nothing declarer can do about it Is there?|pg||

nt|puncher: Could be some fun here... |pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: pass by north and dbl by south?|pg||
nt|paulg:  deep finesse will be saying that 7@c by South is the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps all-pass here ( will save time too )|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|2hplus4: It did seem rather strange|pg||
nt|puncher: to avoid the heart ruff|pg||

nt|mikael_w: well, Now its almost even again after the really good start for sweden|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|xenya: but the final contract is probably correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: North has done well to pass--I might well have bid |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Even stranger|pg||
nt|paulg:  May be 2@d from West, weak with both majors|pg||
nt|puncher: welcome back all|pg||
nt|pelu: the swedes "never" pass :)|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|garnetts: East might also have just bid 3NT over 2@H unless he is really thinking six might be on |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3@c was pass or correct|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not the time to beak the transfer with 4@Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good decision by Grönkvist|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2N was a @h raise|pg||
nt|newmoon: with 3-4-3-3, deduct a point = he has a minimum|pg||
nt|xenya:  looks like pass is missing here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson might have bid 5@s on the way there|pg||
nt|pelu: two main boards in the match : 6@C/3Nt and board 4 twere Israel played game in the wrong suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Fisher may balance with 1NT now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1@s is 2-3 @s's and not 18-19 so was easy for him|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: well this is not the real auction of course |pg||
nt|paulg:  no, this is either the wrong auction or wrong board|pg||
nt|puncher: It's the best they can do|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: an odd choice with all that black suit cover --heart lead and spade switch beats it |pg||
nt|puncher: not the easiest of leads for south - trump likely|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  okay, i think this is close except that Soith opened 2@d multi|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|ady: a save for e/w in spades looks a bit difficult if the east hand gets forced early   but 5@D is ok    at most  500 if a sspade ruff is found|pg||
