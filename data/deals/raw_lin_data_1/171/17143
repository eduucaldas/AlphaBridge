nt|Walddk2: And beginners hate them even more|pg||
nt|ritong: to play, to defend, even to comment  a full nightmare|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i proudly do:)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ady: routine 3NT e/w   actually better played by east|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One student of mine refused to play NT contracts when we first started :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "I always go down", she claimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: EW hold too much strength to be swayed by this 3rd sseat mischief|pg||
nt|ritong: here you can use a small gadget|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: psche by south   unlikely to have any effect on the result|pg||
nt|ritong: since 2NT is not really useful|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: 2NT shows good hand with 4@h and 3@h is five|pg||

nt|lestergold: Germ hi|pg||

nt|sybarra: the operator will get them up shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra: i think we are in a mad scramble at the moment to catch up |pg||
nt|lestergold: a borderline 3n  available here for N/S which shouold be bid really|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1st example of youthful exuberance...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empting 2@c bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at these colours putting a spoke in is not soley confined to juniros|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it doesn't take up very much space|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Very thin game this|pg||
nt|ritong: if available|pg||
mb|1N|an|10-12|nt|psridhar: EW possess one of those 25 hcp combo that doesnt yield game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You forgot the mini, H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 9-12|pg||
nt|psridhar: can they make 3nt?|pg||
nt|ritong: not used to exotism with french pairs:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-12 really, but 9 good acceptable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If ever you can have 9 good|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psridhar: with no entry for @d defense seems helpless|pg||
nt|ritong: this will roll home peacefully|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3nt odds on to make now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not only can you make 3NT, you can make overtricks|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: How lucky for declarer that diamonds are 6-1|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: He thinks he is down I bet|pg||
nt|ritong: well being in 3NT with 25 balanced both hands is not really pushy|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and it seems declarer is forced to play for 6-1 @D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Until North starts thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: about what to do next|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: should lay down K@S    next|pg||
nt|psridhar: on a @C lead declarer wd hv been forced to guess @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right David|pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 6 card @D is so attractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would look silly to finesse in spades and lose to the stiff jack|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: this is odd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hmmm|pg||
nt|ady: taken entry out for spades    may be forced to finesse now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He knows diamonds are 6-1 by now|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: He is playing matchpoints|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: can still play K@S   abd put north in with next spade|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can still play @s king and another endplaying N|pg||
nt|ady: whatever view east takes  will be successful|pg||
nt|psridhar: unless he imagines S has JX in @s now with those @d-shd get clarified if he cashes @c ace |pg||
nt|ritong: i tend to think that @c A is the right polay|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|ritong: i do not solve all, but if south follows twice to @cs it s over|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|psridhar: but declarer brought this on himself|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psridhar: now guilty of not counting even|pg||

nt|ady: seems only 11 after all|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sensiblle result for e-w|pg||
nt|ady: looked like 12   maybe play not as it was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but are we sure not 12 operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Gold and Sid Ismail|pg||
nt|newmoon: hello all  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 off is not that bad considering |pg||
nt|ralfwil: He didn´t use a show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Mike Raif and specs|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry late|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which he should in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: is hussy politically correct expression?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what she comes up with here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: politically correct is for wussys|pg||
nt|santyclz: When it works it reinforces the behaviour. |pg||
nt|m_niemi: in vul Finns play 5M and 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes <i was, but now we are live|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Dennis |pg||
nt|bg: GM Shirley Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Tim it is |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we have the well-known - one more trich in @H than in @S|pg||
nt|hawe45: West as declarer and you make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a clash of systems, with Precision Club against 'standard' here and Carrot Club against 'standard' in the other room ... part of the reason for lots of swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thats junior opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Does NOT excist|pg||
nt|sybarra: does everyone pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: I prefer 2!@h weak|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south reticent again|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Bruce  raining here in DC |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it should not have|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah,  think a lot of folks would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: at this vul |pg||
nt|mamos: South must take some action here  double looks normal enough|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Get 2 @C from partner and I would not like having opened|pg||
nt|mamos: or a protective NT :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - I double , naturalle over 1 @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is a swedish proverb Mike - better late than never:)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 2@s  next|pg||
nt|mamos: in English we finish "better never late"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sporty South - 1400 or so|pg||
nt|hawe45: Could be|pg||
nt|m_niemi: opening w/ S hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a favourite irish expression|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|puncher: yes let's hope this match is as exciting as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might pass 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 3@c shows both majors  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N getting excited since he passed?|pg||
nt|mamos: and/or asks for more information from South|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its exclusive to Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Beter laat dan nooit :)|pg||
nt|mamos: West?????? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: majors i presume|pg||
nt|po-s: a conservative bunch these juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: I see no majors|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to pass the S hand  as a Jr|pg||
nt|gowdy: or senior|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
nt|gowdy: but back in|pg||
nt|m_niemi: p-p-2@h-3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant pass this out now|pg||
mb|2C|an|two way CBS|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to bid 4@s with N or you are done up0 like a kipper|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like check back |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no more ammo|pg||
nt|bg: this should be a good match  at halfway point France in third Canada8th only four make it to KO|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least I have pards that would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|rich89: italy lost a simple 4 @s :(|pg||
nt|mamos: no underbidding her|pg||
nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that c annot be right|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 20-20 hand, shouldn't be bid too high.|pg||
nt|gowdy: redicent eh|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
mb|2S|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why! @dK behind and @hA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will pass with confidence as S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for updated results|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: here 2nt is "super accept" and  3 @H is a retransfer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
nt|hawe45: If they play 12-14 NT - in my opinion the West-hand is too strong|pg||
nt|gowdy: unsure why not stayman  but very hard to find 6 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: And 6 @H is lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||
nt|gowdy: to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at fave vul south should protect with 2@H you need to contest these 20/20 hands to get the plus|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  I'm still reeling from the initial pass.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 clubs is invitational check back I believe 2dia would be GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, the Israeli jrs have been looking very strong this year |pg||
pc|dA|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: fast enough? :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they did well in Philly at the worlds (they won jrs)   |pg||
nt|bg: trans national mixed teams won by Daniel Lavee and co|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
nt|lestergold: once in a blue moon dummy has tghe  earth and ur partner has zilch and a misfit but more often u get done out of a game|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: declarer got tired of S thinking about ruffing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H in OR ends in 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @sK, @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2nd in hand should always be sound but by todays standards it was just about an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: teams changed a lot since then, the Israelis have two new pairs|pg||
nt|bg: problem arises when too much weidght put on Queens and Jacks for point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: France lost Bessis-Volcker|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the failure to protect was simply giving the opps an easy ride for no good reason|pg||
pc|d5|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it...|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade hook |pg||
nt|lestergold: maxi looks like this heart the ruff and a trump|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has good values, so 1@h opening is correct |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: place your bets  will he make ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sybarra: (unfortunately)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
nt|bg: ok now S had to continue Dia or lose it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: or this same|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||
nt|newmoon: plse stay tuned - we have a problem|pg||

mb|5H|nt|psridhar: East will bid i am sure -only what is the question|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: ah 5@H it is|pg||
nt|ritong: two elements here|pg||
nt|ady: west considering a raise|pg||
nt|ritong: first is : when preempted, keep low profile|pg||
nt|psridhar: may seem a stretch but i am in favour of bidding by the player who holds shortness in enemy suit|pg||
nt|ritong: second is: do not bid slam if you have a doubt about the price of a possible sacrifice, which is less than game bonus relatively often|pg||
nt|ady: looks like France will do well whatever happens from now|pg||
nt|psridhar: slam will be DOUBLED|pg||
nt|ritong: all that if you have a borderline decision, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north may sac|pg||
nt|xenya: N should bid now?|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: sound preempters would know what to do, but sound preempters do not hold AKQx of trumps facing the opening, so..|pg||
nt|psridhar: Needs partnership understdg on min and max reqmts of 3@s|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|xenya: the only objection is that EW might bid on to a cold slam|pg||
nt|xenya: but that is unlikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: unlikely ttat slam would be cold that is |pg||
nt|ady: so France restricted to 7 imp gain|pg||
nt|psridhar: only cause for W to change his mind about bidding slam is the 5@s bid has assured him of a void in E hand-but then E might hv valued it already in his 5@H bid |pg||

nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||

nt|m_niemi: EW may have some problems to find @s-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lestergold: and bridge is about creating problems for theopps|pg||

nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
nt|gowdy: x or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and avoiding you own|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East X = take out to @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so had to pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h now or 4@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet n/s flop into 4 @S somehow |pg||
nt|bg: nice pass by S tempting to preempt with 3 spades but pard will never know what is going on when suits or that bad|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||

mb|3H|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||

nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||

nt|hawe45: Louse suits both|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@s easy to East|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - thatÂ´s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
nt|bg: this transfer may bring a super acceptance of 3 spades in which case S will bid 4|pg||
mb|4C|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
mb|4S|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
nt|bg: sry daydreaming too early in the am|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: very nice 4@C bid by Sabourin, should get EW to 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly the W hand improved with the club bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: W probably worried about his @dkxx, a nd the 2 baby @S |pg||
mb|d!|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lousy|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive X by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
nt|the saint: What would West's initial double have been? Many play it as that hand or a really big one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and down he goes|pg||
nt|gowdy: back to par 100|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||

nt|bg: double not good for the Canadians|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly no play for 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an unreasonable contract in the abstract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
nt|the saint: North should have been able to read a singleton|pg||
nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|santyclz: No one else objects to the 4@h bid?|pg||

nt|gowdy: just asking :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I thought they bid aggressively in non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: well west alerted it, east didnt, so think your right Bruce|pg||
mb|4N|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
nt|hawe45: So now we know for sure, that E/W play 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now we know that North likes to bid !  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my club money game 3@c wouold be considered a routine conservative action|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: EW play different NT ranges in different positions|pg||
nt|hawe45: Rathar weak North for the 2 @C-bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this one was 14-17|pg||
nt|the saint: Will work now, becuase should be able to lead a club vs 3N|pg||
nt|bg: oops now France on different meanings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont know if 4NT was meant as asking aces or that is was quanti|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Robert asking partner if he is right|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the hand,  can S be asking aces?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
nt|sybarra: now Bruce, how to pick up the club suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like they are on the same wavelength, but my French isnt fantastic :(|pg||
nt|bg: easy Shirley just play K-A  :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s oj if they are very conservative vul about their 3@s bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants  go to the next button on the bottom to see the Witte House (White House) |pg||
nt|rich89: @H now? |pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch absolutgeluy mandatory here|pg||
nt|mamos: let off the hook there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will NS find the crossruff?|pg||
nt|mamos: South claimed 9 a couple of hands ago  will  ten test him ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: As always: Lead a TRUMP!|pg||
nt|hawe45: But here @D works better...|pg||
nt|gowdy: may start a high D for a look |pg||
nt|hawe45: East wants 300 instead of 100|pg||
nt|the saint: Smolen 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|gowdy: xx @C perhaps 4 @H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  thanks Alan|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get doubled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  500 now - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulg:  you think these seniors could all the clicks then?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hear the clicks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard does not have high spade honour u cant beat it|pg||
nt|the saint: Well South might hate his club shortage and try for a major fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: my granny would do that  but do the experts do the same?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer knows hes probably doomed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dummy trying to read my face, difficult to keep it in shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes probably does, why else does anyone lead into the @H holding|pg||
nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaime Lee|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: think better to finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
pc|c3|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: wel;l; he has decided to play pard for a club guard rather than play the 4/3 fit i wouold have gopne for the 4/3 fit on the grounds that even if north has a club card it might not ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be sufficient|pg||
pc|cA|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi all |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: the spade 8 confirming that hwe can ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: N didnt get it |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what on earth is this?|pg||
nt|mamos: nasty decision |pg||
nt|gowdy: Erwin did south thank N for the dummy ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ah that way, yes he did|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|bg: W has shown a long heart suit could have 3 clubs but not likely|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: well  Tadaaaa |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a really wild board all sorts of ways to get a really horrid result|pg||
nt|gowdy: was he nice looking at that pile of dung|pg||
nt|gowdy: change might to should|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzag: cant see his face|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
nt|paulg:  discards mean that declarer can lead towards @hJ safely|pg||
nt|the saint: I guess with that strong diamond suit, the 1N opener was too much of a distortion for me|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinks he has a natural heart trick but how can he hope to wenjoy that when he can see the establisheable diamonds sitting in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are not fantunes yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an appaling error|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with best defence 4@h dbl is -1100|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
nt|lestergold: it has to be the A and there has to be no card to knock out as well for 3N toc be viable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
nt|paulg:  both have prime cards and the breaks are very friendly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. A below par slam anyway|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: with both minor aces on N E must play a @s - and he did|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an insult to partner|pg||
nt|the saint: Make the King of diamonds the club king and it has merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome James|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  declarer will take the heart finesse in an attempt to make the contract, not with any hope|pg||
nt|paulg:  and probably go two down|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: well having chosen the distortion  the bidding has warned him of a likely big hoole in the club department|pg||
nt|bg: Hi James|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dagold: so a likely swing to England|pg||
nt|paulg:  although he can count Sime's hand now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jameslee 2: hi Shirley |pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  so he knows it is not working, down one then|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Bruce|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: i don't think N ruffed|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|hawe45: West "only" wanted 300|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: morelike raspberry tunes at the moment|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|newmoon: well... depends on the contract in OR... a real tough hand to bid and play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|2hplus4: In 6NT he would have ducked the spade and cashed @D first to give the extra chance of a @C@H squeeze|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: OR in 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: S angry with N|pg||
nt|mamos: phew say ew|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for broke,  |pg||
mc|10|nt|xenya: N is squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this went too fast for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh sorry thought he would hook the @D |pg||
pg||

nt|psridhar: with a weak hand he wd done that|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: bidding something else than 3NT is relatively dangerous|pg||

nt|sybarra: when my left opp bids nt over pard's suit,  not sure worth leading  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant rho|pg||
nt|garnetts: lightish opening bid ( and I would open this one) and a light dbl will likely get EW to 3NT |pg||
nt|dagold: would be amazed if it isn't 3N making to be honest|pg||
nt|xenya: -5?  |pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all, and take a pat on the back for being patient :)|pg||
nt|idc: I expect it will take a while to get the scores up to date (if it can be done)|pg||
nt|idc: but at least we will (fingers crossed) get to see some bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and deservedly  |pg||
nt|rich89: could be -2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||
nt|mamos: and presumably the defence to 4@S could have won five or six tricks with that cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s might be unlucky here too|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 13 to Finns bd 21|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4/3 fits when you have the high cards in the trump suit and good side suits etc is very often highly playable|pg||
mb|1N|nt|2hplus4: ???|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S seems a likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding comps expect you to find them on hands like this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board n 5 |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mamos: and is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: East is not timid|pg||
nt|hawe45: I open the North hand with 1 in my longest suit|pg||
nt|gowdy: now this is hard luck for NS  on a good day 6@D is cold  but not this day|pg||
nt|m_niemi: South bids now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d x'd,, so even if they'd x'd 2@d it would have been a loss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: flat hand open 1nt 4/3/3/3|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
nt|hawe45: 800 must do this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: Is 5 @D a winner - I´m not so sure|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: raise to 3nt |pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
nt|gowdy: as well he should|pg||
nt|bg: S hoping Dia Q wrong|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lead 4th best by E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand has 4 @C +2@H+1@S +1@D= 8 |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: with KQJ with west very unlikely to have the @SA so think he should finesse the clubs last board for a safety play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: needs a 9 trick somewhere |pg||
pc|hT|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead the @D 10, pls|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must discard @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ja - herzlich willkommen|pg||
nt|arno11: danke:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is pass for me|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Adam Mesbur is considering bad trump break, eliminations and entries to dummy|pg||
nt|gowdy: HI Arno|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jameslee 2: Q@S = first choice 50% finnesse |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dagold: best defence|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need to start clubs to try to find close to 9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but choing to rong player as the lead makes him all the rest @H |pg||
nt|bg: not easy has to duck next heart and play W for a doubleton dia honor|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: squeezzed on 3 suits lets see how he discards |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||
pc|c5|nt|paulg:  he may lead a diamond up at trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is this going?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|cK|nt|cameron_1: he must have run it|pg||
nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but it probably wouldn't have been 45 years ago.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|lestergold: soth needs to make a non commital lead on this auction eg @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it is by far the most important suit in so many systems|pg||
nt|gowdy: even my mother bids 1@S there and she would bid 1 nt with N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, sorry 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards liem this can  make on that line but declarfer may go forthespades|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on hearts needs that pesky T to drop which it does|pg||
nt|kemperg: On @S he is low on entry''s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 29 c0mbined on a fairly nisfitting han d is not great for a 6n contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dagold: Norman and Espen have been rewarded with 4 imps for their nice stop in 3@c on 19|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: true|pg||

pc|s2|nt|lestergold: opp an overcall it needs to be constructive and with a scrappy 8 count you wouldnt want to be|pg||

pc|dA|nt|lestergold: could play A and J of spades and if ducked rely on heart finesse for 12 tricks of course taht wont work here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in fact also a little bit nervous to be in 5@h too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer playing carefully|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest why it is so difficult to find a 5-4 club fit|pg||

nt|mamos: E maybe a little good for 1NT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|paulg:  and now he knows it was a boring hand|pg||
nt|puncher: board 18 a 5 imp gain to scotland when Irish stretched to a non-making 3N|pg||

pc|h4|nt|sybarra: she doesnt know yet the clubs are coming home |pg||
nt|hawe45: And do´nt forget, that with the @H Jack off-side, 4 @S X = 1.100|pg||

nt|xenya: well played for an overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  I like to make the opponents work for +800, but defence was very simple here |pg||
nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||
nt|sybarra: they might be surprised it is a push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well that was silly altho neither worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a junior push|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ghehehe :P|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing a heart ws surely hopeless at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Remembers me of last year, going one of in a 6NT with 12 tricks from top, winning 3 imps against 6S-3|pg||
nt|mamos: ugly Spade position|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I can barely see the table anymore, so maybe I'll have to take a break|pg||
nt|mamos: Some pairs play 3@d to show short @d  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what would 1NT-2C-3C be?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|10-14 6-7!H|nt|dagold: and 13 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  There was an appeal from the Wales-Scotland match yesterday afternoon. The decision has gone in Wales' favour and has resulted in another VP for them, the final result now being 20-10 VPs to Wales.|pg||
nt|puncher: surprising pass from John |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW do play 2NT as weak with both minors ... perhaps they need better suits at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|puncher: ahh|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h from South?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N very unlike to have singleton diamond |pg||
nt|arno11: He already showed his skills in bd 13 with a fine declarer play|pg||
nt|bg: spade 8 could be anything but best for pard to simply read it as top of nothing|pg||
nt|bg: besides he has an easy heart return|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes bruce pity true |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: agree with you Bruce|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: although I'm beginning to learn that it's dangerous to make such predictions |pg||
mb|2S!|an|invite with 1!H or GF !S|nt|2hplus4: Appeals are an unappealing part of the game. Why can't players just get on with the game|pg||
nt|puncher: 3@H enough second in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: one off|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an excellent 6@c|pg||
nt|bg: also E can count 15 points in N hand may hot have dia Q|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: with splitted @d honours and @h4-1, they can defeat 5@h|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 5 vanished|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: even withe 4/1 club break it looks pretty good|pg||
nt|sybarra: a makeable 3 nt,  not sure all will get there |pg||
nt|bg: EW playing 2 of a major reasonable hand and 2 Dia opening to show weak two in a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes they are playing with screens |pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: we didnt cash our tricks Er? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Nu er jeg der|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has gone down some slams today|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will see if they bid another|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: was 1@s a muddy the waters bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
nt|paulg:  this could be a gain as I think 4@h is more Carroll's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|rich89: is 1@s nat?|pg||
nt|rich89: y..|pg||
nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45: går i lobby nu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why would W bid 2@C, would bid 2@H for transfer and then 3@H or 4@D.|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond lead may give 9th  immediately|pg||
nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
nt|arno11: W cld make 3 NT on a @D lead but......|pg||
nt|the saint: Can just ruff two hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a sound slam 8 card fit combined 32 points control rich hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans is speaking to Roland I am sure,  not mind all |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 'brilliant dummy'|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting at N/S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E hoping the club suit comes in |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: East shaking his head|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||
nt|paulg:  and may feel the pressure throughout the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  might lead small club|pg||
nt|paulg:  although North's actions suggest the minors|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But @H lead is obvious I think|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Partner could easily have the ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he is thinking then Anderson now knows where everything is|pg||
nt|sybarra: was he smiling when he said that?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well em|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 1N raptor on N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: becoming dizzy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrongly directed with the ace of the 4th suit.  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
nt|arno11: W shld probaby act over 1@S  e.g. with 1NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if East opens, nothing will stop W|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has enuf to make anotyher move|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
nt|the saint: West is unlimited. You have a maximum pass so partner can't go overboard. Bid 3C to show support and develop the auction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
nt|gowdy: now the 3 @S tricks are blocked|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
nt|arno11: what wld X show for you guys after 1@D-X-1@S ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: poor play by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if that what happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: but undone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats inexperience|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
pc|cA|nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c might be taken as weak|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||
nt|sybarra: aka jrs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: north has shown a hand worth a game try on an uncontested auction of 1@s 2@s which would ne an acceptNCE WITH SOUTH'SHAND|pg||
nt|the saint: 2H sets up a game force|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I'm surprised that West passed when he has a normal 4@h call|pg||
nt|puncher: Other room are currrently playing 5@C doubled so a few imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson pretty sure that the ace of clubs is onside given the spade return|pg||
nt|the saint: So 3C can't be passed|pg||
nt|the saint: Many also use a lebensohl type relay in this position to cater for the weak hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2nt forces 3C  so 3 C is strong|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: looks like 1 down, maybe 2 -- but it won't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: where would he rather be 6 @C?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: probably a push if S opens 1N in the other room as well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: play  aow on the lead and let W be high on @sQ... Probably making|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must be discussed for every pair|pg||
nt|m_niemi: West passes some times forcing bids, so East didn't want to risk anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would bid 3@c with a minimum and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gowdy: "Ingberman" in north america|pg||
nt|lestergold: lower range of 3@c is suely no9t strong|pg||
nt|the saint: Hence why Ingberman/Blackout is played to allow a direct 3C to show values|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless partnership agrees that 2n only shows a minimum|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gowdy: for me penalty  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|dagold: technically he should cash the diamond Ace here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play low....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|puncher: WBU still 30 or so ahead of England, and Wales now in the 25 zone against N Ireland|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this auction points to the ned for a look at theirbidding methods|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ingberman is over reverses but some have extended it to 2-level jump shifts by opener as well.|pg||
nt|the saint: It is definitely worth playing it in these positions too|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|newmoon: he heard u|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|pc|s2|nt|lestergold: u cant balance angels on pinheads good trumps and a  couple of cards must be enuf|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|puncher: So Wales can't do much more, but England might perk up - just a case of whether they can do enough or not|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|santyclz: It can't be a winning strategy in the long run to allow your opps to play 1 level contracts unless you know they (and you) have no fit.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a stiff i meant to stay|pg||

nt|paulg:  unfortunately the crash meant that our operator could not catch up with the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  not Alan's fault of course, but unfortunate on an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Operation misfit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only 8 tricks at that point but defence is under a lot of pressure omn the run of spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but what shall W return when only minors left?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compliments to the players, they are playing at a fast pace:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good result for Austria(Österreich)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Another bad minor-break here|pg||

nt|m_niemi: Finns made 4@h in OR bd 23|pg||

mb|1C|nt|hawe45: Nederste linje med bl. a. grønne firkanter, ses kun halvt. Kan jeg rykke noget|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Fight between North and East here|pg||

nt|gowdy: I think not|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: If NT here, and a @H lead... is the timing out now?|pg||
nt|paulg:  upgrade from Walker, nice intermediates|pg||
nt|puncher: an unlikely 6@D here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be fun |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would open 3@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have jammed them up a bid  now a free ride really |pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer to bid my Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: 21-19 points   for this one looks less exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry guys, I'm almost faling asleep with the speed at this table|pg||
nt|mamos: did North really pass??? surely 1NT|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Took the middle road between 3@h and 4@c and went directly to 4@h.|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East acts: flush in @d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most british players i know would if pard say bids 3n u can play 4@s with confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or use:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a very ordinary 3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Problem is, that when you bid with this West-hand - partner will bring you too high|pg||
nt|arno11: 6 in a minor possible here but difficult to make....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w are not too flush here in a high level club contract|pg||
mb|2D|an|4th suit|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
nt|m_niemi: his shape is good suit texture not so good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4 th suit forcing 2@D |pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: try for a 5/3 fit |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if he pushes to 3nt or not |pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: good idea to stay in 3N...|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite  but my juniors when I was captain bid  but if you don;t think you can buy the hand don;t give free information|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - double-dummy 6 NT is rather dold|pg||
nt|hawe45: cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead according to the bidding|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice try here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i hope this gets whacked and defended properly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes he did |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 quick tricks need a 9 th |pg||
nt|sybarra: vul,  probably tempting |pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
nt|the saint: West doesn't have a big enough club fit to justify 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul this is ridiculous|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W should have 4 card support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H+1@S+@C+1@D=8|pg||
nt|bg: anthing but a club will make it hard to find 9th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C in bad position for the Q@C |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East had already told his cards, so why bid 5@c|pg||
nt|santyclz: or HHx with Hx in diamonds.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
pc|dA|nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: to m ake a voluntury call holding no more than 3 to the K and a stiff in pard's other suit is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|the saint: Ducked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
pc|c5|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jameslee 2: rule of 7 he duck 1 @D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not have been the greatest duck in history|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it has grosvenor elements about it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aflac...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N want's to retain trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N expects p not to have trumps anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so that way ducking wouldn't cost anything|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east hassnt promised 6 @cs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now trumps and this will go down a lot|pg||
nt|the saint: To be fair, one nation's juniors who I would certainly not expect to be reticent in the auction are the Finns!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most of the reticence has come from s.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes or a 50% position |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|m_niemi: -6!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||
nt|the saint: Only -3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|hawe45: Nice squeeze againt East now|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H can make|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so Blagov had better pull|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H making|pg||
nt|psridhar: Blagov needs to pull this to 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: not easy|pg||
nt|ritong: i must miss something|pg||
nt|ritong: why does 4@h make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No entry for the heart finesse several spectator tell me. Well, there is, you can ruff a good spade eventually|pg||
nt|ritong: ah yes ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: @s are 3-3 and @H kx inside how do u stop 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: ruff  a spade in west   and heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: You need spades 3-3 and @HK singleton or doubleton|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

nt|psridhar: i guess he went with odds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: bridge blind?|pg||
nt|ady: so good result for Canada|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, apologies|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cashing the ace is probably better|pg||

nt|idc: Welcome all, and we will hope that network problems in Wales will be gone now|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will be surprised by the 1@h bid on his right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D opening in OR was enough|pg||
nt|mamos: a part-score "steal" for NS|pg||
nt|hawe45: Minor-break again - how is the program???|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is not normal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it's kinda against the odds indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: I honest think that will be a push |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and also by a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|wendle: open room of Match 5C will remain open to announce official result (also available at www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he can double this for penalty|pg||
nt|puncher: are they 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not a scientific bidder  so I'd justt smack6@c on the table if I was West|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have  big hands again    with just two diamond losers but 5@S may be too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: no might about it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: pass missing|pg||
nt|gowdy: more shape hands the pute has gone crazy !|pg||
mb|3D!|an|now also alerted by west|nt|peachy: hi kibs , hi david :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: hi all, severe problems with internet at hotel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: working hard to get all tables up and running|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry you had to deal with all that|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently the 2@H opening shows a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: put it another way god didnt deal me 8 in the master suit to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - so far South´s risky bid has been a help for opps|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam in the offing? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid game?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Short expected a bit more?|pg||
nt|bg: E should jump to 4 hearts right away not likely to miss anything since pard passed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a big 7/5 @H/@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west cant believe it and is thinking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not 1 trick in parner to make 4@H |pg||
nt|bg: what is 3 dia obviously E is trying to show something but what|pg||
nt|bg: best with E type of hand just to haul off and bid what you think you might make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i would say it would be a good effort to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead 2 x @S|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@H shows @S one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must go folks dinner time here leaving you in very many capable hands thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: explained as Majors by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Always lead TRUMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: c u|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: maximum hand in N what to bid?|pg||
nt|bg: 4 hearts makes as long as E is patient uhtil he gets to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4NT sounds like a good option?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true x@S+x@S entry in dummy or @H finesse by opps played :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=|pg||
mb|4N|an|alerted by south....|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this may explain the 3@h bid.  Perhaps the 4 level shows a big hand as they play.|pg||
nt|the saint: The strong option in the multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks mike.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Tim there you are |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4Nt|pg||
mb|5C|nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
nt|bg: by fooling around with the 3 dia bid E has given N an option to bail out in 4nt which will only be beaten by a non heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wrong sided clubs :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think anyh partner would have done same|pg||
nt|mamos: too be fair the pre-empt warns of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@H lead ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gowdy: well a heart they could life with  but ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is leading!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry other side leads ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is shaking his head, east says wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of in the rules :)|pg||

nt|mamos: well Herats looks lik eten tricks now  but wasnt cold so perhaps this will turn out ok|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT???? |pg||
nt|mamos: I think 3Nt was  just a bit timid |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh whew|pg||
nt|sybarra: Erwin, you trying to give us heart attacks?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@c = puppet Stay|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: ho9wever im nor convinced they would have found best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: should this be whacked?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he did |pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3@s = 4@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: and 4@d is -4 too:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  Sime can lead the @sK, hoping for 3-3 spades, and forcing West to duck|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161, Eng 161, Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he is banking everything on hearts, which will be less successful|pg||
pc|cK|nt|puncher: yes with the club entries might have been better to go for spades|pg||
nt|mamos: it certainly wasnt intended as a Spade cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: we landed....how ever we got there   (dont ask) |pg||

nt|mamos: ok   we arrived|pg||

pc|cA|nt|garnetts: nothing else to do |pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i think he failed to appreciate the defensive problems that he *might* cause by leading the @sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: do much for your goulash Mike....|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like declarer will lose 6 tricks for 1 down -- still NS have an easy no-trump partial|pg||

nt|Walddk4: It's a make now|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well i see that @h got away in open room i csn imagine how cash rtwo spade and a @d tov ace end of defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|idc: Am told that North led a @d in other room, making declarer's task easier - this may go down here|pg||
nt|idc: That slam on Bd 21 - 6@c is better than I first thought, a very good contract in fact|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he knew they were 3-3 --no double lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i prefer hearts to herats|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they seemed to know what they were doing,  just scared the rest of us|pg||
nt|hawe45: East will regret, that he skipped a @C|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: in fact 4 rounds of spades does it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and see you nest match!|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many swings here despite the swingy nature of the boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: spade discard ---hmmmmm  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Better to cash the @cak before crossing to hand?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: probably expecting better diamonds from partner |pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: Looks like SOuth switched to @dT at trick two - may have been right to do so but not this time|pg||
nt|arno11: shld now make shld hacve ruffed diamond then !T Q  pitching his heart loser and coming to 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45: he still makes it easily|pg||
nt|arno11: @c Q I meant|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing for NI |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west discards @d on third spade 4th spade does the buysiness|pg||

nt|xenya: tough hand for NS, erven without the 2@S opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sure we will get player names up soon|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The bidding is not ridiculous so no need for them to be anonymous :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: even with that 2Nt Lebensohl, South's 3@C was a good guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would have bid 3NT I must confess|pg||
nt|ady: good pass from south   north might have been weaker than he is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner can easily have 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|psridhar: many might hv been tempted to 'show' those 19 hcp by bidding higher than 3@C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: be that as it may 3@d is no cakewalk |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but now spades can be played for no loser|pg||

mb|p|nt|pitiful:  2@d multi|pg||

nt|santyclz: Things are getting a little out of hand for Belgium.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
nt|rich89: x better than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had the italians been doing this to the hyngarians i could have said made spaghetti of them but today no pasta for lunch i'm afraid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D a ht raise of some sort|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a good raise   |pg||
nt|mamos: better be a good raise|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although they rate to pick some up on 27.|pg||
nt|bg: E opened 2 spades in other room led to a lebensohl auction to stop in 3 dia|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
mb|3N|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to miss 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: also hard to make :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can hold 2 @S in 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3nt in this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: will most likely also be one off|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finn S bid 3NT, N removed|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wouldn't want to be there but you might conceivably get a @sq lead.|pg||
nt|the saint: With the @S 9 wrong that just delays the inevitable...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT has a chance, this has none|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 3 x @S and a @D will endplay South|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was French E,  I guess SEF went out the window for the french jrs |pg||
pc|s9|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||

nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||

pc|d6|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||

pc|d7|nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
nt|arno11: flat board|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s8|nt|the saint: I guess you would try to get a spade trick and then try for a partial elmination in clubs hoping for Kx and a failure to unblock - doesn't work here|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really do that?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|h4|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sybarra: first to a big thanks to   our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!  |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson finding a nice safe line for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: do you have the system to invite, show a heart stop and 4 spades? I can show a heart stop and 4 spades but only game forcing not inviting|pg||
nt|sybarra: she had the warnings with X etc |pg||

nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2: he played for a @C ruff but he should know that his partner likes to lead from three small...|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||
nt|lestergold: when u play for these kind of against the odd ruffs they never happen|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||
nt|puncher: too double dummy to get that right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thanks to our specs.  We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.   @H@H|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: the play and defence here havent been very distinguished|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer did not have enough information to get the spades right and played the percentage line|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: they claim its down 1 and accept|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: perhaps E just did too much when he bid one more|pg||
nt|xenya: there's nothing he can do|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Top 4 advance to the semifinals after 23 rounds|pg||
nt|psridhar: the Ducth Girls are making the boys run...even at the bridge tbl :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dutch |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ritong: probably marion michielsen is among them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    around 1NT e/w|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: then it is extremely promising for the dutch ladies team in the near future|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: case for 1NT from east rather than double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maggie Ticha - Sigrid Spangenberg   Jamilla Spangenberg - Marleen Beuger   Judith Nab - Rosaline Barendregt     Laura Dekkers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: rosaline! spiderwoman! wow|pg||
nt|ritong: that s amazing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: she s really everywhere at the same time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: only the first 2 pairs have played so far I am told|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so no Roos yet|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1N instead of double here -- but the result would be the same|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psridhar: Blagov chooses his 4th best @D to his Pd's suit-but declarer had 7 tricks all the time|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Next match in 1 hour and 10 minutes is Israel Schools vs USA|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||

nt|xenya: just made -- well done|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|h3|nt|psridhar: if Blagov exits a @S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: 10@C from south might confuse the issue|pg||

nt|psridhar: finesse @h again and cash ace|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Current standings after 1st weekend on left at : http://www.scottishbridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt ok as long as pard understand for minors |pg||
nt|newmoon: and utters... "that hand... it is over!"|pg||
nt|dagold: I have to go I am afraid|pg||
nt|newmoon: oh, ok David.   enjoy the shopping|pg||
nt|dagold: :-)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't believe that |pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s could be competing for a partial it seems to me, to force e would have to bid 2nt or above.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker found the best lead, but likely to be flat|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok folks last hand of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 20+ minutes |pg||
nt|sybarra: schedule shows:  7:10 am Los Angeles, 10:10 am New York, 15.10 Paris, 2:10 pm London|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why can't partner have @CK instead of @DA?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its awlays weak partners i fimnd who do tjis to me i canr lead from nothing without them assuming its a stiff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then his defence is correct|pg||
nt|mamos: a chance for EW   to win back some imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: because he led the 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: does than bot tend to deny a high honopur in most cases|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you know what they lead from K87?|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Belgium bid 6@c in 26|pg||
nt|the saint: Very good result for the Finns here|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: thx :)|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't throw a spade of course|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess you are better at predicting than me :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  possibly not, i don't think there are any invitational bids in any part of my system|pg||
nt|sybarra: with that a Our special thanks to Roland who "herds the cats" called  commentators.... |pg||
nt|m_niemi: East has 1NT opening|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10-12 bal or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h again |pg||
nt|puncher: as a rookie commentator I need to learn to reign in my predictions|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont but ive never heard of second highest from an honour|pg||
nt|tomi2: they lead the 8 but Weyand leads another suit with that holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so they shouold change their methods|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ady: multi from east|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to get to 4@H   |pg||
nt|xenya: what is N to do now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undaunted...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember we are the "speed" table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They actually do lead the 8 from that holding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus  for results and standings|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I dont like that convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator Tim Verbeek. Super job!  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|puncher: most invitational bids are just transfers anyway at teams :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empts own @s-suit this time|pg||
mb|d!|an|4-5!S|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||
nt|po-s: cute hand - both sides make 3NT if on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: now less likely to play hopeless NT contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thx :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators James and Bruce for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||
nt|paulg:  rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
nt|santyclz: S passed a 10-12 nt.  As I said, most of the reticence...|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|idc: we will check|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C  looks a bit ambitious and has no hope with the bad break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone think E should pass instead of 1D|pg||
nt|arno11: wow|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||
nt|puncher: not the most exciting of boards at this stage of the weekend... |pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to all of  the sponsors:   All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty Tim last board ty specs , Shirley,Bruce |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at that dummy and @dJ87   not so easy to play back @d  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im toldf that 8 9s the standard lead in poland from K87 |pg||
nt|gowdy: and I thought they may find slam !|pg||
nt|m_niemi: have been a plenty of voids today|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how juniors can create swings on almost every deal when we arf used to three hands in four being as flat as pancakes normally|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen miracles before in this match |pg||
nt|sybarra: and to our specs,  you are special We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.  |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks everyone  and Erwin   great work!  see you Tomorrow|pg||
pc|dK|nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are obviously playing a system where 3@D is not forcing to game.....|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Erwin and all commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i find it hard to believe that fantunes would have let thru that contract for example|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: even vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: perhaps there's some excitment still to come... |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but can you fix the oesers?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: cash some winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hop is saying "what is going on??"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back in 15 minutes with Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|m_niemi: declarer must guess @ds to make this|pg||
pc|s5|nt|newmoon: will be a quick claim after 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos: and now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: needed a balcony finesse|pg||
