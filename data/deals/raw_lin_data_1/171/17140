nt|dan_ehh: 3@c is puppet stayman|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ts999: NS are in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Israelis not off to a good start in this match|pg||
nt|ritong: a @c shift now, and nothing he can do|pg||
nt|jwit: yes|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I can understand Birman's reluctance to bid 3N with Qxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ts999: must say it looks like excellent judgement in the CR to bid 3NT with just Qxx, I'm sure many would be put off by how vulnerable the stop is|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: now, is it clearcut, we will see soon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On he other hand, Dan, is an overcaller at the 3-level not a hot favourite to have AK?|pg||
nt|jwit: It would seem clear cut looking at that dummy|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: yes, but he'll still need 9 running tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: also, east has to refrain hopping trump Q if he tries low to dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: although he has to regain the lead to do that|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: and that would open a ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: either @c or @d|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: here, @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lack of intermediate spades makes it a hopeless task|pg||
nt|jwit: Declarer's best bet at this point is to find KQx of trumps onside, not a favorite|pg||
nt|cuttysark: @S9 would make a big difference|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: great distributional hands now...|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: up to it already!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: Anothet nice board|pg||
nt|kemperg: know that from Ivanhoe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S wont bid Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is a COMYN room in the Louvre|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 1 @h - 1 @s - 3 NT as a good hand and 3-6 in majors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Respect for the colors...|pg||
nt|viren169: QJx of @C are gold dust for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Fast claim at 9 tricks I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yoiu dont fancy anything here|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2@D is some kind of heart raise|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: my wife would like to go and see so perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe also show that he did not have much defence|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: slam now in H|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: good contract, 6@D makeble|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not too great an auction with 6@d throw against the wall|pg||
nt|jbgood: more common with Gazzili...|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure of E/W methods but 3N looks like an undisplined bid to me.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: they are in a fiorcing sequence what is wrong with south bidding 3@h to give north a chance to complet his hand description|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: what''s he hoping for?|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer making the defenders suffer a little|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kemperg: that makes it easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: and not wirh@S start|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mamos: It was in third Gad  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Since NS have all outside Aces and Kings defending is not difficult and wont make more than 9|pg||

nt|viren169: True...|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Yes, the computer loaded its Junior program today|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ritong: i would not try with alon's hand, not even would show @ss|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: I agree Henri|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Don't think North has enough to consider slam opposite a strong NT even with the fit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jwit: I think the 5 card suit and the two 10's make it worth a 4NT rebid, but 3NT was right on this actual hand.  Kept them out of trouble|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Arifin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: who is tallking about no trumps|pg||

nt|kemperg: sorry former remark was for a spec|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: We don''\t know those in Holland :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still not easy to get to 4H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|chick: I would think 2@H by E a reasonable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Yes... good agreement to have for 3rd and 4th postition|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes provided it is forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kemperg: often it is not|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: we often see on those types of hands a lazy 3n bid ending the auction not just at junior level i might add|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: looks as if they play compulsary double raise with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as pds in agreement..|pg||
nt|kemperg: I play 2@D = @H and 2@H= @D|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharkey: Looks like a coffee hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: mine is milk and 2 sugars thks!|pg||
nt|kemperg: works well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: transfers usually do|pg||
nt|kemperg: use them a lot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT better from W imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: transfers are useful for weak hands, but not that valuable when both sides have equal points|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting methods to get to 3 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but landed on feet|pg||
nt|kemperg: I need at least 12 and 12 of them|pg||
nt|kemperg: disagree on that|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahalim: @H 3-3, @DK onside, friendly for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes should makje in comfort|pg||
nt|chick: when the distribution of one hand is revealed, it can be better to keep the other one as the concealed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: NS use upside down signals|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and maybe even "right sided" it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: committed to slam now but......|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: of course we can see the h suit declarer cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: options not too many |pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, esp. after the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think he has to depend on the h suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that 3@s shows a minimum  hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|jbgood: the compulsary jump raise backfired indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will soon perk up a bit when they find out about the diamond position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: why not 2@C as 1@C means at least 3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||

nt|viren169: not sure about the J though!|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: next|pg||
nt|ts999: 3N seems like a bit of an overbid here...though effective in the other room|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: west's rebid is not esay|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli is waiting for you|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: somehow I don't think they're playing that|pg||
nt|ritong: one among the hundreds of hands it is useful to|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree, West has a difficult rebid. I like 2C followed by 2NT.  Gives partner a chance to bid a 5 card heart suit, or take a spade preference|pg||
nt|ritong: the hundreds of handtypes, that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In USA, Bart is more common than Gazzilli I am sure|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli is an artificial 2@c rebid showing doubt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that will change in about 20 years|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: you are very optimistic Roland|pg||
nt|ritong: showing doubt means " i have a good hand but no good bid"|pg||
nt|jwit: Unfortunately 2C may get you a pass from partner|pg||
nt|jwit: herre|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jwit: here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if it must be forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dan_ehh: some interpretation required|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ts999: I vaguely recall a conversation with dan mcintosh about the complexity of their system here...alice is probably able to show her hand, just taking her time to make sure she shows ...|pg||
nt|ts999: it correctly :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: James??|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT is a pretty lucky make, so I would not balme anyone for avoiding it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ts999: 2@C is certainly artificial and forcing, over which 2@S now shows a better hand than a straight 2@S rebid, presumably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: in my perso version, this would go 1@s 1NT 2@c* 2@d waiting 2@s " i have strength for 1@s 1NT 3@s but my suit sucks"|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 2C: forcing, clubs or a good hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 2H forced 2S, then 2NT showed a singelton in spades|pg||
nt|ritong: now, my perso version is a bit different from italian one|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: maybe not time nor place to develop here|pg||

nt|mamos: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slam time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: USA  off to a flying start|pg||
nt|kemperg: talking Dutch John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright sin sin thats irisah|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: Not a good hand for weak NT!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|semi-forcing|nt|sybarra: 6 clubs anyone?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make slam in  3 suits - rather un usual|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: tuff rebid for west|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pronounced shin shin|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can he handle it ?|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely avoided...|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ss not good enough for 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-3 h fit plays well|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|sharkey: East wont Pass.... after x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Pd is there to put you back in the hole!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may Pass...?|pg||
nt|ahalim: even in NT :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and grand in two|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3NT is code|pg||
nt|kemperg: but what code|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 3NT shows 6@s, says west|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: is 2@C  a suit do we know or just art gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Dennis|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: its a good contracft but a trump lead with this 4/0 break could run into difiiculties|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot enjoy the K@s|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold 3@C dbled to 3 tricks!|pg||
nt|chick: but a grand relies on 2 finesses, so it's not exactly a good bet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2NT here|pg||
nt|mamos: well South knows that they are in the slam zone |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well certainly wont handle that|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for East to read it...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: well |pg||
nt|kemperg: only 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: still not good|pg||
nt|mamos: so Im not sure 4@h is wise |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: convention card doesn't say 2@c is relay, so natural presumably|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks horribly nf|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: I know it sounds ridiculous to suggest Pass with Wests hand but unless E has a long Major game is probably not making|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WOW|pg||
nt|chick: I guess 4@H was forcing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: surprisse mee|pg||
nt|ahalim: there you are|pg||
nt|mamos: there must be something about this auction we dont know|pg||
nt|chick: ya, like a @D void? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a junior bid if i ever saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north bid 7@c, but now he has taken it back and thinking again|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  and who let him take it back ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east joking and replacing south's 4@h with 5@h|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm are juniors allowed to take bids back?|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice try by S - but to no avail|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: on a good day 7@c rolls in|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs 3/2 spade break and clubs 3/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not blame him really |pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a fair spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho perhaps grand slams requiring good breaks in two suits are a little dangerous|pg||
nt|viren169: Meanwhile this wont be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has 26 HCP; S opens and N bids - unless there are 60 HCP in this deck pd is blank !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, but S will have a heavy time|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best start for defence but @Cs have been bid and supported!|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's 3@C not a thing of beaty either..... youthful exhuberance I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an even bigger WOW|pg||
nt|chick: lol  the joke's on North when 7@C makes :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South's 4@H  was  .........  unwise|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think N's 3NT took up too much room|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew how he found the @d lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: may have been the NTTT rule |pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: (Next To The Thumb)|pg||
nt|hedyg: nearer to the thumb?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i doubt it|pg||
nt|jbgood: that rule was, is and will always be a joke, Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or as a nice young lady said to me - we play the eenie-meeni-miny-mo lead system|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|kemperg: E should not be unhappy with that lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: 7@c much too good for roland at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: actgually 3/1 in trumps and spades 4/1 still works does it not|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of table will be in 7 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 6 on this layout looks doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: He already knows|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think "we" are recounting our tricks|pg||
nt|ahalim: i bet N can't sleep tonight|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C was your joke Dennis?|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C by South wouldn't have been so crazy |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no, it was really there|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: but i might missed some joke around it|pg||
nt|hedyg: to watch the other table as well: http://vhv.bridgebase.com/vhv/handviewer.html?tableID=16311&h=http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/index.php?r=909755|pg||

nt|lestergold: spade lead was not obvious?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor did I|pg||
nt|viren169: and another good hand to reward the good play!|pg||
nt|mamos: South finds out his partner has 15-16 balanced or whatever and has  loads of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: officially you can take a bid out of you bidding box and put it back, i believe|pg||
nt|kemperg: another nice hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that wsas quick another slam|pg||
nt|chick: 14 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|kemperg: also  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: what a sensational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be written up|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: they will|pg||
nt|sharkey: S had a problem last hand.  Pd did indeed bid 3@C so shud expect more than @CJ - West need not have 26 HCP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5D possible|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: maybe someone will |pg||
mb|2C|nt|kemperg: Kees Tammens is typing already:)|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 1@S here (prefer dble)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Non Vul agree|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kemperg: X now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: E has passed a 7crd @D , won'do that again|pg||
nt|sybarra: this isnt  pretty |pg||
nt|viren169: normal neg dble by North finds the heart fit for N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Advanced cue of @H|pg||
nt|mamos: I bid 1@S  i find it works out best|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzag: as long as your bid is not on the tray|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: need to recover my breath after that needa coffee hand but i dont think this one is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a rather savage roland hand in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: Does N undestand 3@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or is 4@D cue?|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did, |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: both sides alerted 4@d|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 6@h is on as the cards are.|pg||
nt|sharkey: also 6@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: lucky, but it is|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@D cue agreeing hearts I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: so was 3@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: i suspected that implied @H agreement|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: usuall with A or K in pd's suit|pg||
nt|viren169: never cue void or singlton in pd's suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 20/20 |pg||
nt|sybarra: between the pairs |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: not first time at least...|pg||
nt|viren169: A/K or Qxx are useful holding|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT by N shud show additional values I think - if N evaluates this way|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect they will reach 6@H now. Both N/S are bidding the spots of the cards!|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@H is enough now... however I cant see South passing|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither side have underbid previously this match so no reason to change now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt N bid 5@H without @HK?|pg||
nt|viren169: West may tap it on the way out  holding AQ of @d|pg||
nt|viren169: North has shown the whole of their hand with dble of 1@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has shown @D honor - may be not Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: No need to bid any more unless requested to do so.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lestergold: good girl Shirley go to the top of the class|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: was it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d to encourage EW to bid 3@s|pg||

nt|jcomyn: whats 4nt re-doubled = 4|pg||
nt|mamos: what will North do if redoubled comes  do we know the score?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is writing ' X = good luck'|pg||
nt|mamos: 2320|pg||
nt|kemperg: testing opps system|pg||
nt|mamos: although +4 may be more  :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: saves the bother of grand so|pg||

nt|mamos: yes  not very exciting this one   unless .....|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 24 in OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|viren169: Not sure you have to alert 3rd in hand openings nowadays?!?!|pg||
nt|viren169: Mike, any comment?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E had his colours bid:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbgood: and S decided that he wouldnt support hearts higher than the 2 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe he was right|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|kemperg: will end in 5@S|pg||
nt|mamos: North getting a bit carried away here    presumably 1NT 12-14 ?  or is it 15-17?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will it? I wonder|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand at last|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean 3@H with what?|pg||
nt|kemperg: could have been expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: you either have the bid or you dont. he would not have bid it without the 2@s bid, why should he bid it now?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|viren169: 3@C looks normal over 2@S by North to me|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 sensible auctions by the Israelis on    2 and 3 netted 24 IMPs|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kemperg: then only 9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: you have to somtimes, competitive|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: not high|pg||
nt|mamos: you might not even make six when QJ is doubleton because you might finesse|pg||

nt|sybarra: yes esp. since diamond not led|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart finesse can wait til later for overtrick if it works|pg||
nt|lestergold: first things first rather than rear end about face a sit were|pg||
nt|kemperg: start @D, gives leader wrong route|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ts999: difficult to find the @DA lead probably, but a possible swing|pg||

nt|ts999: 2@S here is a constructive 2 as well, not a simple weak 2, for those thinking alice's hand was a bit too strong|pg||

mb|1S|nt|seb75116: EN Ouest RUFA|pg||

nt|kemperg: toendra in English I don't know, permafrost?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: 7@C with a @D start:)|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of RKCB with a void...|pg||
nt|kemperg: if 4@D was void then a problem now|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N will have the A of spade on the table before any diamond enters his mind!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very wise contract if staying there|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: he/she did|pg||
nt|viren169: if the opps reach 7|pg||
nt|kemperg: put that with my favorites|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps sneak through a heart finesse?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I should say spade cash, and it got ruffed|pg||
nt|kemperg: E trying to get a @D start:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: however poor 6@c is its a better spot than 3n !!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kemperg: thats it|pg||

nt|kemperg: of coarse a @S|pg||

nt|vugraphzag: east explaining 4@d as void, west as shortness|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will he switch to d|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 sp would work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s would too for that matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||

nt|lestergold: but not what the doctor recommended!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: where do they go?|pg||

nt|lestergold: well these french lads are not slam shy as we have seen|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hmm|pg||
pc|c8|nt|viren169: Now my heart  has increased!|pg||
nt|viren169: wd North.... phew!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|mamos: if 3@d is splinter showing singleton then 4@d  would show void|pg||
nt|viren169: yes...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: an accident with the Spades might do it|pg||
nt|mamos: I think declarer should cash four Diamonds|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: they were this time|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid they have actually reached the correct contract even tho 6@c happens to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets not be result merchants|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get 10/10 in the bidding competition for this|pg||
nt|kemperg: Looks like they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 5 it is much easier to make 6 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its always easy to make 8 when there is a one way no cost finesse available|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead you might even make 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west explaining that his partner should have something like 4351, but will be pleased to see 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: you wouold make 7 no might about it|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kemperg: if they play 2/1 it should be|pg||
pc|s3|nt|viren169: 4N was a poor choice of bids...|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Very amusing :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks right to me|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3@C is puppet stayman, 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but as I say, a little tricky.  If declarer tests hearts first, he must duck a diamond into the safe hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Needs a little care, but I am sure declarer will find a line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings after round 9|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think they play 3@S as a general slam try for @H, so 4N should be quantitative here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Israel 18 VPs clear of second, England dropped out of top 4|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In round 9|pg||
nt|ritong: if they land in 6NT, @c lead is protected, so declarer will start giving a @d immediately, then test both red suits if needed|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: I smell a misunderstanding...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5@C is certainly unusual - a Zia cue?|pg||
nt|ritong: a Kc answer, perhaps?|pg||
nt|jwit: Might have been responding to what he thought was Blackwood|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|ritong: i would take it for negative about @ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: me too|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well theylanded on their feet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It should probably  deny diamond support - NT auctions and keycard do not mix well|pg||
nt|jwit: Hopefully.  What would the panel lead from the West hand on this auction?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jwit: Spade seems reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: @h J|pg||
nt|jwit: also reasonable|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Needs the club finesse now and it doesn't seem to work - but we may be tainted by looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be fair, a cub finesse would give him the 12th|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well, the @C finesse is 50%, and @D breaking is less than that, so maybe he played with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Even if declarer caught  W with honor 9x of diamonds and the K of clubs, partner could just duck the diamond return when declarer put in the 8|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Or West could return the diamond honor|pg||
