pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem here for NS is that there isn't really a source of tricks in NS as south has no entries|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: ish also a veteran of the Rita Shugart team in US at one time|pg||
nt|chilloncan: connection there with Andrew Robson who is also a former partner and ongoing colleague of David Bakshi|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: the rip of 3@hx to 3NT should make it clear to north that south intended 3@d as natural|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2 down likely here losing 2 trumps, 2@h and 1@s|pg||

nt|chilloncan: without 7 of diamonds, attacking that suit is more or less going for 33 break. ducking first heart and attacking spades makes u heavy favorite to get an 8th trick in spades, and ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: playing the last two rounds of spades (or last one) may put pressure on opps|pg||

nt|frankaus: 90 in the bank looks good|pg||
nt|dburn: but del Monte may even make this now|pg||
nt|dburn: he can set up two hearts to go with three clubs and two diamonds, and I don't think the defenders can get enough tricks in time|pg||
nt|rodal f: If E play @H now we are right David.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he has to play hearts from his hand, giving up on the finesse, and he may be reluctant to do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: finfering @H|pg||
nt|harmon: he can finesse d's still be ok|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mrdct: north might try to sneak a @c through to the K but I doubt that will work|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: a competitive auction without the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h may be a better spot than 3NT, but there is plenty of work to do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|dburn: only three losers, but not necessarily ten winners|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chilloncan: EW wont be happy with this deal either, pathetic grist to the mill of recovery|pg||
nt|mrdct: so grue might have right-sided it here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1@s, 2@h, 3@d & 3@C|pg||

nt|chilloncan: havent read zelazny|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mrdct: even more interesting is that Curtis Cheek lead the @C4 in the other room and mustn't have been feeling too good when dummy came down|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish might introduce his @c suit now - but at what level|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c might be passed so perhaps 6@c now|pg||
nt|mwigor: surely 5@c would be a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: 3@C alerted but no explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: not many partnerships play 2H as Michaels by responder:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: Ish stick with the theory that @S = trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: grue fans might be content with 10 imps here with NS stopping in game|pg||
nt|mrdct: is east thinking?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfh: sorry, no, it's S thinking|pg||

nt|chilloncan: david's prowess will not be tested to the fullest on this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe a transfer - quite popular these days|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: 5S = do you have a club control    6C  = yes the ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s is still trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, after a spade to the king and ace South will feel a little victimized|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't want to play anything, but a heart is his best choice|pg||
nt|dburn: even that, though, may not be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: If. He have a good return. @H.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mrdct: well north-south have navigated this one to a makeable slam and a big swing|pg||
nt|mwigor: barbara travis points out that the play in 6@s is far from a formality|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dont think so, N need too many cover cards|pg||
nt|mwigor: declarer may well lose control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Les mumbling and grumbling|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in that order?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the other room declarer played the @SK from dummy at trick 1 which didn't work out so well|pg||
nt|dburn: if he plays a low heart, he will be victimized again after ace and another|pg||
nt|dburn: if he plays a high heart, declarer can ruff a diamond in the dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure so right:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: recurring theme for me..... players are 20+ minutes behind on clock|pg||
nt|dburn: the queen of clubs has also been suggested, but even that isn't any good|pg||

nt|dburn: still. Amoils can't see all the cards|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: had N cashed D ace before ruffing (double dummy), W would have to exit heart king on gaining lead with club king|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|dburn: so he will just try to ruff a diamond on the table and get overruffed by the short trumps|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|mrdct: looks like win @cA and exit a @c stright-away was the winning line|pg||
nt|mwigor: or low at trick one is ok i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N was worried about club ruff, and was cold whenever sopades 43, so he didnt play second club|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer's play is understandable|pg||
nt|dburn: another 13 IMPs to GIB, but only three to Grue|pg||

mb|1C!|an|c b short|nt|chilloncan: another unproductive layout for hungry trailers|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS reached an inferior 3@h contract here after north made a t/o dbl of 1@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe 5 or 6 IMPs at most|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a @C lead trouble 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact 4@s doesn't really have any play|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the better chance|pg||
nt|frankaus: to me it looks like a lot of losers for red 2@d  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: one doesnt get a buzz from opening weak 2D on this S hand, 6322 vul, but the thing is on the card...|pg||
mb|1S!|an|no major|mb|d|nt|mrdct: illustrating the general preference to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 fit as you get some pitches|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that brings the scores to the point where the last six boards have been a waste of time|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot of time, at that|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrdct: south has to decide whether to go for his major or his better suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: that might be 3@c by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|frankaus: 800 by the looks of it|pg||
nt|mrdct: Ish taking an advance save|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is going to go for 800 I think |pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting cards again David?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|chilloncan: a lot of the bids chosen by NS here are probably motivated by a belief that opps in other room will push very aggressively, so attempting to duplicate those tactical siutuations|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Ish: "good luck"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, East-West have a game if they can bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but I am not sure they can - or at any rate will|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrdct: 3@s has 5 losers i think|pg||
nt|dburn: but I'm a bit surprised del Monte chose 3@s rather than double|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: my own feeling is that 11 loser hands should not bid, even when they can raise 1S to two and even when they have a stronger way to do it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: but here NS have 130 anyway|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chilloncan: maybe 110 with handling charges caused by 41 trumps|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|dburn: 1@s was a transfer response, of course, so his first double showed spades|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: or maybe his first double just showed a good hand, so he hadn't shown his spades yet|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive he got a problem with the 1@S bid at N.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stole'd my color.|pg||
nt|dburn: becoming very popular, these transfer responses to 1@c - important to get the methods organized|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: seems more prudent to play high trump in dummy, as low ones may be needed to ruff spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mrdct: in a way this is a good board for grue as they have duplicated bad results in both rooms which compresses the damage|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this game was a tough assignment in any case|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: it appears that 2@s might have made six at the other table, so the score is actually 230 for Fleisher|pg||
nt|rodal f: A small loose anyway, but are we to hook @D or try @H 2-2?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h2|nt|dburn: but without a spade lead, I don't see 12 tricks in spades - hearts is a different matter|pg||

nt|vugraphzfh: Ish: "sorry"|pg||
nt|frankaus: if -14 is a good board then i hate to have a bad board|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: director has urged table to play faster|pg||
nt|mwigor: going back to the slam - i think ducking the club lead is 63% and playing for 4-3 trumps is 62%|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be exciting|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have 10 tricks in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: so any small feeling about the lead (ie that it is a singleton) is enough to swing it|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-17|nt|mrdct: on that hand moss also lead a @C and Kamil took the same line as Ish for -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes it is tricky to know how to assess the likelihood of singleton from the fact that a club was led, as the auction made that lead a substantial favorite to hit the baize|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1C is a very dangerous bid, just begging to be blown out of the auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: but NS have 6@c on ice|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: boring hand maybe they take less than 20min on it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrdct: when hampson delcarer in 6@s, he got a @h lead and could simply duck that and easily cater for @S5-2|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a bad game here for NS so a chance for Grue to extend the lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: easily? if heart loses he does not necessarily have enough discards if spades go bad|pg||
nt|mrdct: same auction so far in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@h passed around to south who dbls|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: apparently a trump was led, though - still, it will all come out in the wash|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|chilloncan: W hand may not seem like a 3D raise, but there is a tactice benefit as it takes opps above the level where they can support double|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: only if @h 5-1 i think (but what would I know!)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it's 5@hx in both rooms|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chilloncan: spec points out that the "scare value" of the strong club actually fnctioned as an inverted preempt here,|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Lucky layout? And =?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chilloncan: yes hence the "not necessarily"|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Turn NS hand and....|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|chilloncan: sadly we are unlikely ever to amass a sizeable enough database to decide whether the tactic is worth repeating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North needs to be careful|pg||
nt|mrdct: how can NS go wrong here?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS must cash the @D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: why - what declarer going to do with his @d losers otherwise?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: put one on the @S suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he has 3 entries|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so if North overtakes...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to do something other than leading a @D..|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess stranger things have happened - but it would seem to only make sense for north to overtake if he had an absoluely clearcut action to take that partner either wont realise ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: or wont have the card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree with all that - so why the delay?|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe he's having trouble counting up west's 16 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West doesn't actualy have the canonical 16 HCP, so this is hard for NOrth to read|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe the internet is broken|pg||
nt|mrdct: north will be worried that perhaps west has a @d honour so he can't see an obvious way to beat this|pg||
nt|harmon: I hope they get a time penalty this is ridiculous|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chilloncan: admittedly the duck has big odds in its favor|pg||

nt|tejjyid: but the result is correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect so also|pg||
nt|tejjyid: A lot to be said for a 6@C call from South|pg||
nt|mrdct: so tense stuff here with a couple of lost opportunties for NS in recent boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: who cares if it goes down, it's not at all stressful & probably cost 5 imps at worst|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plenty to be said when you see N hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ish could have less for 5C bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ISh could have been missing the @S A forexample|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it was SJ Simon who said not to defend these hands|pg||
nt|mrdct: F leading 158-112 in the other semi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you gamble with double doubled game/slam swings when you defend|pg||

nt|chilloncan: some would be uncomfortable opening 2C with stiff king and short spades, but at these colors opps are just going to let you bid. if opps NV, 2C  risks obstruction|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|brolucius: Levin made a Support Double, showing three-card diamond support (2@D would have shown 4-card support). West could bid 2@D on a minimum, so 3@D is a game-try.|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Because of the initial negative response, South can be sure that North cannot have enough for a slam.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H shows maximum of the 1@D bid|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1H IS forcing and could be a 4 card suit with a longer minor|pg||
nt|hedyg: which is probably 7 hcps|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is the Rodwell method that a lot of clubbers play over here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing low from dummy would risk going down when the lead is a singleton, so only a madman would choose that line. Oh.... sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||

nt|algraves:  East does not have KQXXX in @S and a @C honour|pg||

nt|brolucius: He is confident that East would have bid and is looking for an overtrick.|pg||
nt|algraves:  well the @H could be 4-0|pg||
nt|algraves:  one thing that is absolutely gauranteed is the the @S 9 is not a singleton|pg||
nt|algraves:  There is a reason that they are down there and we are up here|pg||

nt|vugraphzfh: sorry lost N pitch on 3rd @D|pg||
nt|chorush: GIB is saying down 4 regardless, but GIB knows wheere all the cards are. I think a heart might lead to down 5 in reality|pg||
nt|dburn: GIB would ruff in East. play a club to the king, a spade to the king, and duck a spade|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chorush: yes, that is true. but would declarer?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: another practise squeeze|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: then, it would ruff out North's @sA and make seven tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...is in the other hand, so to speak|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might right Ira but if a @H u will play @CA an slipp next for 800|pg||
nt|dburn: and now he really will go down five|pg||
nt|chorush: GIB has now changed his/her mind and says down 5|pg||

nt|kit: insurance of costing 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|algraves:  well against 6@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has gone down less than an opponent's game, which is generally reckoned as OK. Sacrificing is not a precise art (as we ALL know).|pg||

nt|hedyg: we continue in a few minutes?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, many thanks to Patty. Great session!|pg||
nt|algraves:  he needed to find a precise lead|pg||
nt|algraves:  their is a case for Grue to bid 6@C on the way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point!|pg||
nt|algraves:  but they prefer to play poker style in these auctions and as they say, you go home with who brung ya|pg||
nt|hedyg: that will just get them doubled and shut up Levin|pg||
nt|brolucius: Grue has four diamonds, when he might have had fewer, so he knows there are a large number of diamonds with South. In that case a diamond lead could be ruffed. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Are you from Texas or Oklahoma, Allan?|pg||
nt|algraves:  Vancouver Canada but we have a Oklahoma neighbourhood|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought so.|pg||

nt|algraves:  although in my case it was usually " what dumped ya"|pg||
nt|algraves:  really I doubt if Grue gave one second;s thought to 6 @C|pg||
nt|algraves:  but many others would and then would have bid it|pg||
