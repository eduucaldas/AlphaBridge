mb|3H|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||

mb|r!|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|chick: I would think 2@H by E a reasonable bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: Yes... good agreement to have for 3rd and 4th postition|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes provided it is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: often it is not|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: we often see on those types of hands a lazy 3n bid ending the auction not just at junior level i might add|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as pds in agreement..|pg||

nt|jcomyn: transfers usually do|pg||
nt|kemperg: use them a lot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT better from W imo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: transfers are useful for weak hands, but not that valuable when both sides have equal points|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|sybarra: interesting methods to get to 3 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but landed on feet|pg||
nt|kemperg: I need at least 12 and 12 of them|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahalim: @H 3-3, @DK onside, friendly for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes should makje in comfort|pg||
nt|chick: when the distribution of one hand is revealed, it can be better to keep the other one as the concealed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: NS use upside down signals|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: and maybe even "right sided" it |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we can see the h suit declarer cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: options not too many |pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, esp. after the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think he has to depend on the h suit|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|viren169: Declarer will soon perk up a bit when they find out about the diamond position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: is 2@C  a suit do we know or just art gf|pg||
mb|3N|an|15-17|nt|lestergold: its a good contracft but a trump lead with this 4/0 break could run into difiiculties|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot enjoy the K@s|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold 3@C dbled to 3 tricks!|pg||
nt|chick: but a grand relies on 2 finesses, so it's not exactly a good bet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2NT here|pg||
nt|mamos: well South knows that they are in the slam zone |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: oh well certainly wont handle that|pg||

nt|mamos: there must be something about this auction we dont know|pg||
nt|chick: ya, like a @D void? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a junior bid if i ever saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north bid 7@c, but now he has taken it back and thinking again|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  and who let him take it back ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east joking and replacing south's 4@h with 5@h|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm are juniors allowed to take bids back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: on a good day 7@c rolls in|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs 3/2 spade break and clubs 3/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not blame him really |pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a fair spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho perhaps grand slams requiring good breaks in two suits are a little dangerous|pg||
nt|viren169: Meanwhile this wont be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has 26 HCP; S opens and N bids - unless there are 60 HCP in this deck pd is blank !|pg||

nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, but S will have a heavy time|pg||

nt|jcomyn: an even bigger WOW|pg||

pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: I think N's 3NT took up too much room|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: 7@c much too good for roland at any rate|pg||

nt|Walddk2: hmmm  good question|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: I would have thought spades - dummy's suit. A diamond is normal since no-one really bid those|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Next grand slam|pg||
nt|xenya: chance for EW to strike back|pg||

nt|ritong: i do not think it asks for a specific suit  just means " you better find out, buddy"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree with 3@s from E? 3@h for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think I would rebid the 5-card suit before showing the 6th spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A grand here needs two suits to break 3-2, 68 x 68|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|nt|Walddk2: Now I need my abacus again|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Singleton jacks in the mix - better than just 68x68|pg||
nt|ritong: two thirds of two thirds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A tiny bit over 50%|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or any singleton heart in South (thank you Dan :))|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaf: 7 out of the picture now it seems|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has shown a diamnd void - not the mosy useful thing he could have, but West knows he can take care of any club losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Two 3-2 breaks 46%, then add the singletons you can cope with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does that not make it around 50?|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly|pg||
nt|ritong: anywas west has no idea about critical queens|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: so it would be ultrawild to go for it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: partner has shown no values in the minors - can he have no queens in the majors?|pg||

nt|lestergold: spade lead was not obvious?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor did I|pg||
nt|viren169: and another good hand to reward the good play!|pg||
nt|mamos: South finds out his partner has 15-16 balanced or whatever and has  loads of tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: officially you can take a bid out of you bidding box and put it back, i believe|pg||
nt|kemperg: another nice hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that wsas quick another slam|pg||
nt|chick: 14 tricks off the top|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what a sensational hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be written up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: they will|pg||
nt|sharkey: S had a problem last hand.  Pd did indeed bid 3@C so shud expect more than @CJ - West need not have 26 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe someone will |pg||
mb|2D|nt|kemperg: Kees Tammens is typing already:)|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 1@S here (prefer dble)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Non Vul agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: X now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: E has passed a 7crd @D , won'do that again|pg||
nt|sybarra: this isnt  pretty |pg||
nt|viren169: normal neg dble by North finds the heart fit for N/S|pg||
nt|sharkey: Advanced cue of @H|pg||
nt|mamos: I bid 1@S  i find it works out best|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzag: as long as your bid is not on the tray|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: need to recover my breath after that needa coffee hand but i dont think this one is|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a rather savage roland hand in fact|pg||
nt|sharkey: Does N undestand 3@S?|pg||
nt|sharkey: or is 4@D cue?|pg||
nt|kemperg: he did, |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: both sides alerted 4@d|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 6@h is on as the cards are.|pg||
nt|sharkey: also 6@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: lucky, but it is|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@D cue agreeing hearts I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: so was 3@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: i suspected that implied @H agreement|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|viren169: usuall with A or K in pd's suit|pg||
nt|viren169: never cue void or singlton in pd's suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 20/20 |pg||
nt|sybarra: between the pairs |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: not first time at least...|pg||
nt|viren169: A/K or Qxx are useful holding|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT by N shud show additional values I think - if N evaluates this way|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect they will reach 6@H now. Both N/S are bidding the spots of the cards!|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@H is enough now... however I cant see South passing|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither side have underbid previously this match so no reason to change now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt N bid 5@H without @HK?|pg||
nt|viren169: West may tap it on the way out  holding AQ of @d|pg||
nt|viren169: North has shown the whole of their hand with dble of 1@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has shown @D honor - may be not Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: No need to bid any more unless requested to do so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|lestergold: good girl Shirley go to the top of the class|pg||

nt|kemperg: testing opps system|pg||
nt|mamos: although +4 may be more  :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: saves the bother of grand so|pg||
nt|ahalim: in Holland this is called a Jansma double|pg||
