nt|greerm: good @C guess but an imp out|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: another flat board to please the welsh supporters|pg||
nt|greerm: delight even :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bg: chance here for France to pick up a few imps if they can find 6 clubs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|bg: N bid 3 spades at this point in other room makes ti tough to find slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: same here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|greerm: unusually that 3@S is a limit raise|pg||
pc|sK|nt|greerm: with a @H ruff risk, Robin Burns may eshew the trump finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|greerm: I predict @H to T then @S Ace then think :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|h2|nt|bg: other match closer but Sweden leading Israel Juniors|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|greerm: I think 1 imps MArtin, defence have 3 already|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: @D goes on @H now so flat|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS (FINAL UPDATE BEFORE RESULTS ARE OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED): Wales 170; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 101|pg||

nt|rmb1: South doesn't know how many tricks he is trying to defend|pg||
nt|hedyg: salut Riton :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi Henri|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1NT opening would be strong (V), so rebid is a weak NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: repeating the 5 card major is rather typical|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Lots of tricks outside trumps, just has to avoid losing tricks to small trumps|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: can now make 9 tricks by playing trumps|pg||
nt|rmb1: typically French or typical of Lhuisssier|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|jbgood: the point about rebidding you fivecard major is to be consistent - once you try to decide from time to time whether to pass or to bid, it tends to go wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: ask Henri :)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: frenchies are reluctant with the 1NT rebid short in pard's major|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: here, i would pass 1NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and the French speaking Swiss follow them :)|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: because of your poor suit quality?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I am consistent with my ideas, and bid 2 @s Henri:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: say pard opens 1@h, you bid 1@s with 5 and he bids 1NT|pg||
nt|ritong: there, he is 5332 for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: and, curiously, chances he holds 3@s are 2 to 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: right!|pg||
nt|rmb1: declarer is worried of running out of trumps.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|pc|s9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rmb1: the chances he holds 3@S are reduced by you holding length|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|ritong: three possible doubletons|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 in @ss and 2 in a minor suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|rmb1: but there are less spades for him to hold|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: suddenly a not so flat baord|pg||
nt|greerm: presume this showing @D and @H|pg||
