nt|kemperg: Hi Cornelia|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: this auction could well be duplicated however|pg||
nt|sharkey: S did it anyway - think North's 2 NT a bit pushy|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Gad|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree|pg||
nt|jbgood: one way of doing it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: england dropped out of the top 4 and are now in 8th|pg||

nt|kemperg: 54, he had a try|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting what you should break to on the last hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slam?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl well understood|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|viren169: great distributional hands now...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a winner here|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect we get beyond 3N pretty quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: up to it already!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: Anothet nice board|pg||
nt|kemperg: know that from Ivanhoe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S wont bid Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is a COMYN room in the Louvre|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 1 @h - 1 @s - 3 NT as a good hand and 3-6 in majors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Respect for the colors...|pg||
nt|viren169: QJx of @C are gold dust for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Fast claim at 9 tricks I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yoiu dont fancy anything here|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2@D is some kind of heart raise|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kemperg: my wife would like to go and see so perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe also show that he did not have much defence|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: slam now in H|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kemperg: good contract, 6@D makeble|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not too great an auction with 6@d throw against the wall|pg||
nt|jbgood: more common with Gazzili...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings after round 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but is will make 6 on this lead |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this might lead to 7|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: grand slam in hearts actually...|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the cue passed out...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcomyn: heavens to betsy surely h the agreed suit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|kemperg: yes with @C A onside|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure of E/W methods but 3N looks like an undisplined bid to me.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: they are in a fiorcing sequence what is wrong with south bidding 3@h to give north a chance to complet his hand description|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: what''s he hoping for?|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer making the defenders suffer a little|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kemperg: that makes it easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: and not wirh@S start|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: even A@c offside there are 12 tricks with one spade ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mamos: It was in third Gad  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Since NS have all outside Aces and Kings defending is not difficult and wont make more than 9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|viren169: True...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: South was not paying too much attention to N's 3@h bid...|pg||

nt|lestergold: ten in the reds A@s plus spade ruff doesnt matter about position of@c A|pg||
nt|sharkey: View pd passed hand shudnt be I think|pg||
nt|viren169: If N/S doubles... Pd may (should) pull it.|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no shortage of slams today but bidding not the best|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sharkey: I play 3 NT 3. & 4. is "think I can make it" - pd shudnt decide or pull.  |pg||
nt|viren169: 3N here for N/S|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Arifin|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: who is tallking about no trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a suit slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: a @d slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry former remark was for a spec|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: We don''\t know those in Holland :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still not easy to get to 4H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|chick: I would think 2@H by E a reasonable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Yes... good agreement to have for 3rd and 4th postition|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes provided it is forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kemperg: often it is not|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: we often see on those types of hands a lazy 3n bid ending the auction not just at junior level i might add|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbgood: looks as if they play compulsary double raise with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as pds in agreement..|pg||
nt|kemperg: I play 2@D = @H and 2@H= @D|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharkey: Looks like a coffee hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: mine is milk and 2 sugars thks!|pg||
nt|kemperg: works well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: transfers usually do|pg||
nt|kemperg: use them a lot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT better from W imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: transfers are useful for weak hands, but not that valuable when both sides have equal points|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: interesting methods to get to 3 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but landed on feet|pg||
nt|kemperg: I need at least 12 and 12 of them|pg||
nt|kemperg: disagree on that|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahalim: @H 3-3, @DK onside, friendly for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes should makje in comfort|pg||
nt|chick: when the distribution of one hand is revealed, it can be better to keep the other one as the concealed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: NS use upside down signals|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and maybe even "right sided" it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: committed to slam now but......|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: of course we can see the h suit declarer cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: options not too many |pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, esp. after the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think he has to depend on the h suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that 3@s shows a minimum  hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|jbgood: the compulsary jump raise backfired indeed|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will soon perk up a bit when they find out about the diamond position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: why not 2@C as 1@C means at least 3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about the J though!|pg||
nt|sharkey: it's perking - pls bide your time :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: now need to duck the @C and play spade to the Q|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Opps - S is making this interesting?|pg||
nt|kemperg: risky|pg||
nt|mamos: South only has eight tricks I think|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like on the right road to recovery!|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think this is a "club system" |pg||
nt|viren169: East needs to win and switch to a heart!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: that wasnt the smartest play|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he''s in trouble|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: he could not believe all the cards in S|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: polish club off course for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: play of hand likemshelling peas|pg||
nt|kemperg: had already 9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|sharkey: @H back wud have been better|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
mc|11|nt|viren169: had and has are two different things!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 up|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S S|pg||
nt|ahalim: wouldn't you play N for the @C K after the overcall ? |pg||

nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: USA  off to a flying start|pg||
nt|kemperg: talking Dutch John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: alright sin sin thats irisah|pg||
mb|1S|nt|viren169: Not a good hand for weak NT!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|semi-forcing|nt|sybarra: 6 clubs anyone?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make slam in  3 suits - rather un usual|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: tuff rebid for west|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pronounced shin shin|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can he handle it ?|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely avoided...|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ss not good enough for 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-3 h fit plays well|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|sharkey: East wont Pass.... after x|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Pd is there to put you back in the hole!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may Pass...?|pg||
nt|ahalim: even in NT :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and grand in two|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3NT is code|pg||
nt|kemperg: but what code|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 3NT shows 6@s, says west|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: is 2@C  a suit do we know or just art gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Dennis|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: its a good contracft but a trump lead with this 4/0 break could run into difiiculties|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot enjoy the K@s|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold 3@C dbled to 3 tricks!|pg||
nt|chick: but a grand relies on 2 finesses, so it's not exactly a good bet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2NT here|pg||
nt|mamos: well South knows that they are in the slam zone |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well certainly wont handle that|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for East to read it...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: well |pg||
nt|kemperg: only 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: still not good|pg||
nt|mamos: so Im not sure 4@h is wise |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: convention card doesn't say 2@c is relay, so natural presumably|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks horribly nf|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: I know it sounds ridiculous to suggest Pass with Wests hand but unless E has a long Major game is probably not making|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WOW|pg||
nt|chick: I guess 4@H was forcing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: surprisse mee|pg||
nt|ahalim: there you are|pg||
nt|mamos: there must be something about this auction we dont know|pg||
nt|chick: ya, like a @D void? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a junior bid if i ever saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north bid 7@c, but now he has taken it back and thinking again|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  and who let him take it back ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east joking and replacing south's 4@h with 5@h|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm are juniors allowed to take bids back?|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice try by S - but to no avail|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: on a good day 7@c rolls in|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs 3/2 spade break and clubs 3/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not blame him really |pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a fair spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho perhaps grand slams requiring good breaks in two suits are a little dangerous|pg||
nt|viren169: Meanwhile this wont be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has 26 HCP; S opens and N bids - unless there are 60 HCP in this deck pd is blank !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, but S will have a heavy time|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best start for defence but @Cs have been bid and supported!|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's 3@C not a thing of beaty either..... youthful exhuberance I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an even bigger WOW|pg||
nt|chick: lol  the joke's on North when 7@C makes :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South's 4@H  was  .........  unwise|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think N's 3NT took up too much room|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew how he found the @d lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: may have been the NTTT rule |pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: (Next To The Thumb)|pg||
nt|hedyg: nearer to the thumb?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i doubt it|pg||
nt|jbgood: that rule was, is and will always be a joke, Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or as a nice young lady said to me - we play the eenie-meeni-miny-mo lead system|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|kemperg: E should not be unhappy with that lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: 7@c much too good for roland at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: actgually 3/1 in trumps and spades 4/1 still works does it not|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of table will be in 7 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 6 on this layout looks doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: He already knows|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think "we" are recounting our tricks|pg||
nt|ahalim: i bet N can't sleep tonight|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C was your joke Dennis?|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C by South wouldn't have been so crazy |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no, it was really there|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: but i might missed some joke around it|pg||
nt|hedyg: to watch the other table as well: http://vhv.bridgebase.com/vhv/handviewer.html?tableID=16311&h=http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/index.php?r=909755|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: 3@C is puppet stayman, 3@H shows 5|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but as I say, a little tricky.  If declarer tests hearts first, he must duck a diamond into the safe hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Needs a little care, but I am sure declarer will find a line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings after round 9|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I think they play 3@S as a general slam try for @H, so 4N should be quantitative here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Israel 18 VPs clear of second, England dropped out of top 4|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In round 9|pg||
nt|ritong: if they land in 6NT, @c lead is protected, so declarer will start giving a @d immediately, then test both red suits if needed|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: I smell a misunderstanding...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5@C is certainly unusual - a Zia cue?|pg||
nt|ritong: a Kc answer, perhaps?|pg||
nt|jwit: Might have been responding to what he thought was Blackwood|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|ritong: i would take it for negative about @ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: me too|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well theylanded on their feet|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It should probably  deny diamond support - NT auctions and keycard do not mix well|pg||
nt|jwit: Hopefully.  What would the panel lead from the West hand on this auction?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jwit: Spade seems reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: @h J|pg||
nt|jwit: also reasonable|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: I like the @H jack|pg||

nt|dan_ehh: guess I was wrong, this won't work...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could there have been one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because he can't cash @SJ|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Needs the club finesse now and it doesn't seem to work - but we may be tainted by looking at 4 hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: To be fair, a cub finesse would give him the 12th|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: well, the @C finesse is 50%, and @D breaking is less than that, so maybe he played with the odds|pg||
nt|jwit: Even if declarer caught  W with honor 9x of diamonds and the K of clubs, partner could just duck the diamond return when declarer put in the 8|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: Or West could return the diamond honor|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: and west still has to find the right suit to play here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does she have a clue?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jwit: Club would seem dead wrong.  Partner must have the J of diamonds, since declarer didn't try that suit earlier|pg||
