nt|athene: as declarer ruthlessly plays out your singleton suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  smolen auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have now seen this hand make 5 and then 6|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: south should have let a spade go on the last diamond though|pg||

nt|007 joosth: do you lead your singl here  qith Qxx trumps  ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's pre mike, shirley|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: heart lead too likely to kill partner's holding|pg||
nt|athene: club looks fair enough i guess|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|athene: still there are layouts where a heart will work i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: you need partner to have quite a bit to beat this|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ofcourse|pg||
nt|athene: ruffing once from Qxx might not gain but ruffing twice is a bit more likely to show a profit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: that is why a singleton lead gets more attractive the weaker your hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: leading long suit, may find pards singleton |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: well, yes, but north won't get in much to give partner club ruffs|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||

pc|d3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||

nt|athene: remember at imps we are only trying to beat the contract|pg||
