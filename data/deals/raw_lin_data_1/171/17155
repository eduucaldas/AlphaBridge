nt|Walddk2: I have never seen this many hcp's before|pg||
nt|tomi2: do French juniors still have a stongbid for strong hands and one for even stronger?|pg||
nt|ritong: very possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: we know soon|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: What's 2@S, H?|pg||
nt|ritong: i was wondering|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@s means he can pass with a semi forcing in spades, I am told|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: In 3NT if you knock out @CK first on @D lead, does East have to guess whether to finesse in @h or @S? |pg||
nt|psridhar: 3N needs right choice of finesse in Majors|pg||
nt|tomi2: if south does not lead a spade that is|pg||
nt|psridhar: may be able to exit in 3rd @d to avoid that guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps you can cover 2 options: @SQx doubleton in South by playing top spades then finesse in @H?|pg||
nt|ritong: according to a reliable source, 2@c is a strong 2 in one major or any game forcing hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: lots of explaining by W but unable to hear any of it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: thus 2@s is similar to multi treatment|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer in other room DUCKED first @d and had to guess which Maj to finesse|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Yes, If you don't duck the first @D (was ducked at other table), then @d exit is possible|pg||
nt|tomi2: E knows the count in @D, they lead 3/5 even in NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Explanations are supposed to be in writing playing with sreens|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No whispering allowed|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobody writes ever in such situations|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: yes they are, but since when do juniors listen to what they're told? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do among adults my son :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ever watched Meckwell?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They write novels|pg||
nt|petergill: The @D duck is a good idea if North has @CK, so it seems to be best play|pg||
nt|tomi2: i was able to watch many sessions of top pairs playing in Philly last year. Meckwell were the only pair I observed, who wrote explainations for every bid they made, others ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: whispered, used their fingers arms etc. when it was enough|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning all, sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|petergill: I write novellas..., when Jeff Meckstroth was my screenmate at the 2008 World Championships, he approved of my written explanations|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Morning Liz|pg||

nt|tomi2: good morning... UK is one hour behind I guess? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Written explanations are of course superior for many reasons, one of which that they can't be misunderstood|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats not true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Whispering can|pg||
nt|psridhar: in CR South faithfully signalled for @s entry when he cleared @d  but declarer didnt believe -may truth is the best form of lie:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That may deend on how well you write...|pg||
nt|tomi2: never had a screenmate and couldn't read his handwriting?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: wouldn't be the first time someone misheard an explaination, have seen it happen a few times already this week.|pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, South's exit of @DQ perhaps was suit pref for spades, so heart finesse is the one to take|pg||
nt|petergill: ditto at this table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or how well you read English|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - long sentences are rather unfair on no-English speakers|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you can't read his handwriting, Tomi, perhaps you could ask him to use CAPITAL letters?|pg||
nt|petergill: North might have, say, KJx, J10xx in majors and need South to give true suit pref with @DQ exit (so North knows to discard spades and keep @H), so East also should trust @DQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: two friends of mine play a system with multi-meaning 1@C openings and 1@D responses, they have of course a filled conventioncard but they once prepared a set of small cards they ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: give their opps with the full explaination of 1@C-1@D to avoid minutes of writing and explaining :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d8|nt|petergill: another possibliity is keep two club entries to dummy and to play @HQ to see if it is covered - if not, then try the spade hook|pg||

nt|lestergold: a borderline 3n  available here for N/S which shouold be bid really|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1st example of youthful exuberance...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empting 2@c bid:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi bruce |pg||
nt|kemperg: racognized your name|pg||
nt|jcomyn: natalia i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: weak two diamonds or strong I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: O no dear|pg||
mb|3C!|an|puppet|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at these colours putting a spoke in is not soley confined to juniros|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike and Bruce @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it doesn't take up very much space|pg||
nt|sybarra: I beleive the operator is catching up,    |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing what does he leave the x in with i wonder|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a bad slam|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
mb|3D!|an|1 or 2 four card M|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this bidding system presumably weak no trump will get e/w too high pretty quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive isd hardly the word|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it did its work|pg||
nt|m_niemi: hearts length in left so RHO will overruff hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: a comfortable start |pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@C opening in a youth match|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have an exciting week of bridge planned with the jrs. |pg||
nt|lestergold: no @d opening by N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@d |pg||
nt|lestergold: not available|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case i'dopen 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D I ment|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: not so much mini as micro|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what i wasw asking is if the polish juniors are sons of well known fathers|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant bid it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree|pg||
nt|kemperg: I understood|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, it's the younger son of Krzysztof Jassem on South|pg||
nt|kemperg: only pepsicola is not there|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the likeliest outcome here|pg||
mb|3S!|an|4!h's|nt|ahalim: no problem here in 4@H I think|pg||
nt|bg: W can get two red aces but he has to cash them|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all from sunny Dortmund|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: This might go one off - @D not behaving and the @C Ace off-side|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for N/S has a  fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C as w2 in@D or something strong is very popular in the Netherlands, I do not like it|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: and Mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: gives your opps the chance to double 2@C, pass and double 2@D, bid directly or await things and balance later|pg||
nt|tomi2: north now knows his partner can't be too strong for his double, so he won't push to games in doubt. same as if S had overcalled / balanced, north has one useful information|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: list of all participants |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suppose taht E/W do not play negative double, East has a problem. Would then bid 2 @S|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon|pg||
nt|hawe45: 10th trick now|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought they were hutling towards a slam there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right tx|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25 pts to start with|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi michael|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here, so no hope |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a great contract even without this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Riccardo Rubino|pg||
nt|rich89: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ciao ricardo |pg||
nt|santyclz: Even at favorable, qjxxx at the 2 level is shall we say sub-optimal.|pg||
nt|the saint: South should have doubled 2D to show extras|pg||
nt|kemperg: but  3N makes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
nt|mamos: this will drift off could EW make anything much?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3CX more interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: amazing, wd:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am a great admirer of Jassem's book|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C asking for 4 and 5 card major - 3@D = no 5 card but 1/2 4 card, 3@S = 4 card @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK Wessel|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: morning Ricardo|pg||
nt|lestergold: east strong no trump opener they play in 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: reasonable contract that is not easy to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 6 fast losers her|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl shd try for a slow @H trick|pg||
nt|xenya: actually declarer will do well to get out for -1|pg||
nt|tomi2: will have to work for -1 only|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps the 2@c opening worked this time :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D would have worked as well or maybe better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a vfery impressive bidding sequence|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of nerve from W|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|gowdy: a trump lead in these 2 syuited auctions often work best  as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but look it has shut them up when they have a chance of a vul game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes Sandra Rimstedt must have high hopes of beating this|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mike Bruce and (@H) Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: helps tell why israel leading|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 "tricks , sp some work for decl|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of the reasons i do not like weak no trump because it forces you to a 2 level rebid with a 17 COUNT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I SHOULD SAY MQANY REASONS|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: no  messing  :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont mind the lead|pg||
nt|bg: good try by west when your own suits do not look promising try to hit partners suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Partner could equally have held J10xxx instead of 109XXX|pg||
nt|kemperg: with @H breaking yes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now a @d finess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats the point of playing take-out double when you hasve the perfect hand for penalties|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you dont know 3nt is making - you DO know 3D is going down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|peachy: The point of playing takeout dbl on the 3-level is well made by Mike Lawrence, Larry Cohen, and other bridge authors|pg||
nt|kemperg: right John|pg||
nt|peachy: No doubt leaving in this time would have been better|pg||
nt|kemperg: we wood|pg||
nt|kemperg: would|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - but here West should have played trumps - after the nice lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite   but some play it here as penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should have x available for takeout / show values|pg||
nt|mamos: not so easy |pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if clubs were 3/2 they would take a further 3 tricks with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed|pg||
nt|hawe45: But cross-ruff will appear|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt she the brazen hussy with her 10 count|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|c4|nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, halftime scores: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ireland 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I am "on" the other fashon of BBO, have no coq...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim time|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|the saint: I'm a little surprised, South isn't normally that reticent from what I recall|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  sry private|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: sorry I was here ready  they started without me  :(|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: can see 11|pg||
nt|mamos: may end up having to guess which  major to finesse in|pg||
nt|pelu: @S or @H finess|pg||
nt|mamos: that Heart discard suggest North has length in Hearts  so maybe declarer will get that right|pg||
nt|pelu: ecen chance, so @sAK ( the Q could drop) and @H-finess|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|jcomyn: wouldnt it help to bid s along the way|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cQ|nt|pitiful:  12|pg||
nt|puncher: Yes would nice for Scotland to hold onto, and even increase, their lead - though others might not agree :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised N did not try for ruff |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rich89: mistake of failla|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That's why Sridhar is so quiet. He is also watching cricket|pg||
nt|psridhar: N has problems here-first she has to believe her eyes|pg||
nt|tomi2: Rosaline likes bidding and declaring - it's such a good feeling to play with wher! you aways lay down your cards as dummy and relax :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: i.e what she is seeing is true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: Fav vul and 5422 (not 5332) shape = 4@H at this table looks preferable to 3@H chosen at other table|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|tomi2: me neither|pg||
nt|psridhar: quite thin for a Vul Vs NV overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because 1@S takes no room away and you are not exactly strong|pg||
nt|petergill: North does well not to get carried away, settling for 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thirdly, the suit is not that great|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: she'll grab them|pg||
nt|petergill: the danger in the play is to win @DA on @d lead, and play a @h, not knowing the spades are friendly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The French decalrer in the other room was determined to ruff a heart in dummy and so lost a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is just a question of counting to 11, provided that spades come in|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Can't cost to cash one top spade|pg||

nt|davidstern: With this now being round 14|pg||

nt|vugraphzag: yes, weak 9-11|pg||

nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like check back |pg||
nt|xenya: nice analysis :)|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly eight tricks|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has no more ammo|pg||
nt|bg: this should be a good match  at halfway point France in third Canada8th only four make it to KO|pg||
nt|lestergold: qith  experience they will learn the need for maximum pressure|pg||
nt|mamos: East's 4@d  secured a lead in that suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: the real pressure bid is 5@h by west|pg||
nt|kemperg: I played them, they not afraid of going high|pg||
nt|lestergold: many of us would bid a lot of hearts out of terror of an opposition slam|pg||
nt|mamos: and sometimes bidding too much  pushes the oppo to the contract we want to avoid :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but you have to know when to do it quickly|pg||
nt|lestergold: in fact |pg||
nt|lestergold: only a @d lead beats 6|pg||
nt|pelu:  @D lead defeat 6@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: by the way it should be a @d lead if 6 is bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least I have pards that would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|rich89: italy lost a simple 4 @s :(|pg||
nt|mamos: no underbidding her|pg||
nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that c annot be right|pg||
nt|m_niemi: just 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 20-20 hand, shouldn't be bid too high.|pg||
nt|gowdy: redicent eh|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice and low|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||

nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||

nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||

nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is   6 (Israel schools) v  7|pg||
nt|davidstern: 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|davidstern: minimum|pg||
nt|mamos: as the cards lie  lots of tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gowdy: here 2nt is "super accept" and  3 @H is a retransfer|pg||
nt|davidstern: But that said 1 trick on lead both heart and club honours oincide and diamonds ok|pg||
nt|davidstern: usual case when you are in 1 and swap NS when you bid 2NT|pg||
nt|ahalim: cannot see the 9th trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are missing spotcards here in clubs and spades to make an extra trick|pg||
nt|xenya: well it could make on a good day|pg||
nt|jcomyn: boy o boy that surely is weak|pg||
nt|kemperg: and passed 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Junior World Champion in Philadelphia last year...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
nt|hawe45: If they play 12-14 NT - in my opinion the West-hand is too strong|pg||
nt|gowdy: unsure why not stayman  but very hard to find 6 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: And 6 @H is lucky|pg||
nt|mamos: my head has exploded|pg||
nt|kemperg: lead says misunderstood|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can see why south is taking time|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H +@S but Bid of N ? pehaps jusy a weeeeeeak 2|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
nt|davidstern: No good switch here|pg||
nt|tomi2: he might be tempted to duck a heart directly. in case they are 4-4 this opens several squeeze chances|pg||
nt|peachy: Not necessarily, there is a style where first seat favorable systemic can open very weak, but of course I do not know their system|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||
nt|gowdy: to be sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: but at fave vul south should protect with 2@H you need to contest these 20/20 hands to get the plus|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes.  I'm still reeling from the initial pass.|pg||
nt|bg: 2 clubs is invitational check back I believe 2dia would be GF checkback|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, the Israeli jrs have been looking very strong this year |pg||
pc|d7|nt|puncher: yes so should be a comfortable make |pg||
nt|puncher: west endplayed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: fast enough? :)|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: they did well in Philly at the worlds (they won jrs)   |pg||
nt|bg: trans national mixed teams won by Daniel Lavee and co|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: as W is known to have 1 diamond at the most|pg||
nt|pelu: strange play|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  short conservative because his opener is minimum and they are non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: should scrape home|pg||
nt|lestergold: once in a blue moon dummy has tghe  earth and ur partner has zilch and a misfit but more often u get done out of a game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|newmoon: looks like a 15-17 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fairly comfortable as you have the @s10|pg||
nt|paulg:  might make an overtrick on this lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: declarer got tired of S thinking about ruffing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@H in OR ends in 3@S|pg||
nt|m_niemi: @sK, @cJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2nd in hand should always be sound but by todays standards it was just about an opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: teams changed a lot since then, the Israelis have two new pairs|pg||
nt|bg: problem arises when too much weidght put on Queens and Jacks for point count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: France lost Bessis-Volcker|pg||
nt|lestergold: cost 2 tricks in practice|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pitiful:  looks like declarer will lose 2 spades in the end|pg||
nt|lestergold: but the failure to protect was simply giving the opps an easy ride for no good reason|pg||
pc|s4|nt|2hplus4: Yes W quite conservative|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If they doÂ´nt cover, they doÂ´nt have it...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think it deserved to be hammered|pg||
nt|lestergold: didnt get the match points|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cameron_1: now 11|pg||
nt|xenya: so you just play 4 rounds of trumps, then run spades|pg||
nt|xenya: none of the key suits break evenly|pg||
nt|tomi2: the black suits break squeeze-friendly but not the hearts of course, if had he tried this|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl chooses the straightforward line of either black suit breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes or QJdoubleton in @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: now W|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S K|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: my guess is he takes the spade hook |pg||
nt|lestergold: maxi looks like this heart the ruff and a trump|pg||
nt|m_niemi: S has good values, so 1@h opening is correct |pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pitiful:  not sure how @s switch can be right|pg||
nt|paulg:  cannot cost to put the @d8 in|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: (unfortunately)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: not much to the play here -- we can relax|pg||
nt|2hplus4: With S long in @C and @S declarer suspects @H A falling|pg||
nt|bg: ok now S had to continue Dia or lose it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|puncher: so if you lead a trump you should lead a low one here - declarer could have played the 8@D for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: or this same|pg||
nt|mamos: @sK|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker and Short have a tendency to avoid thin games. They are often in the par contract but the trend is to bid these games and challenge the opponents to beat you|pg||
nt|davidstern: question now is how much west trusts the defenders|pg||
mc|10|nt|newmoon: north squeezed on 2nd @h now|pg||
nt|dagold: I mean in partners hand. Could just make 2@s with the points split 20/20 with 1N cold|pg||
nt|dagold: Nobody can double anything for penalty these days!|pg||
nt|dagold: 1N makeable so a chance of a good result for NI here|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: or 4@D?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North agrees with me|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petergill: Liz, would you rebid 2NT as South?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Me 3|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Diamond suit too weak for a jump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: that South hand is a rebid problem -modern players attempt to solve that by either 1N opg OR 3@d by agreement doesnt show gr8 suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I had expected a flat board here - wrong again|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4nt blackwood - 5@H we are missing an ace and the trump queen - 6@d who cares?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: N-S may regret it in a minute|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, she was past 5@D and I do not think one can signe off in 5NT after this start|pg||
nt|tomi2: well placed @DA and a revoke s her only hope now... :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Goes to show that 4NT is not suited for keycard ask when a minor is set|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@s would be puppet for 5NT i guess|pg||
nt|petergill: I play that 1@D - 1@H - 3NT shows a hand too good to rebid 3@D ... North's bidding seems very pushy opposite a non forcing 3@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: A slam where u hv no play for a one loser in trumps, hmm|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I play that 4@D here is keycard - otherwise it is a pretty poitless bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: they are not such an experienced partnership to have agreements in that situation|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: but then 4@D as keycard here leaves you the chance to show natural slam interest|pg||
mc|11|nt|petergill: I think that having pushed the boat out with 4@D, North should bid 4@S over 4@H, South bids 5@C, North bids 5@d, end. |pg||

nt|paulg:  they will open 1@c in the other room but probably get a similar result|pg||
nt|puncher: it's all so public these days too - with all of us watching over their shoulders - it adds to the pressure of a long weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: the joy of jrs, "keep the game moving" |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s is not a junior contract omn thiose cards actually not a senior one either|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont  understand WEst's play  :(  panic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy to bid 16 opp ten and lots of wasted values like 8 points not needed its effectively a combined working 19 points|pg||
nt|mamos: South has proved he can count to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mss rimstedt will get busy here|pg||
nt|po-s: he doesn´t want opponents tu suffer|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now some fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: well south has a weak 2 for me even tho he has 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahalim: S to N : " Not my day to-day: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Vincent is it Tim?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the folly of youth with an 8-count|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes it is|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe  i wondered Girls Team|pg||
nt|kemperg: wich team is it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: first part score for a while|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: or 1@D and jump to 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to see any result here other than 3n+2|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: I even think my grandmother would get to 6 @S's|pg||
nt|m_niemi: for me too|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has finally found the bidding box|pg||
nt|gowdy: those don't look like 4 @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly John|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW may have some problems to find @s-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm generally more worried about my opponents than the vugraph audience|pg||
nt|kemperg: will this end in 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there something wrong with 3 nt?  can you make it?|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could try a small diamond when W had pitched a diamond, risking 3 down, but preserving some chances|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: the girls team|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: and bridge is about creating problems for theopps|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??????:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: which he joined earlier this week, they havent enough players in the girls team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is getting very confusing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
nt|gowdy: x or 2nt ?|pg||
nt|gowdy: and avoiding you own|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East X = take out to @s|pg||
nt|m_niemi: so had to pass|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@h now or 4@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet n/s flop into 4 @S somehow |pg||
nt|bg: nice pass by S tempting to preempt with 3 spades but pard will never know what is going on when suits or that bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like goulash dealer having fun|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hmm I surely disagree with pass on first hand with a 74|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@D promises 5 coards if balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: it didn't look like clubs were breaking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this will be interesting|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and the singleton @H not so easy to pinpoint |pg||
nt|lestergold: a most unusual double fit here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and many of us do not speak dutch that well |pg||
nt|sybarra: I only know some of the swear words |pg||
nt|davidstern: Battle of the black suits here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north might bid 4@d now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will no doubt end in a number od hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
nt|hawe45: Pass is a clever option with the West hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Louse suits both|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now 4@s easy to East|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@H wd not be my bid here|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@H?|pg||
nt|tomi2: think he can rebid his 5 card @D here simply|pg||
nt|ahalim: agree Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: i would certainly rebid diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - thatÂ´s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
nt|bg: this transfer may bring a super acceptance of 3 spades in which case S will bid 4|pg||
nt|tomi2: he already showed 5 but better upgradng akqxx to 6 than 432 to 4 cards|pg||
nt|xenya: now they are in real trouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south did not alert the 2NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: not for an Irishman John|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought I was the only one who played ona a ladies team|pg||
nt|kemperg: !2S = @C?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by E?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no 3s|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl neg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no point|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@S looks like 5 spades and three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Vincent|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thought so|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec confirmed|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this guy is incorrigible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to George Holland|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
nt|bg: sry daydreaming too early in the am|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: very nice 4@C bid by Sabourin, should get EW to 5@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly the W hand improved with the club bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: W probably worried about his @dkxx, a nd the 2 baby @S |pg||
nt|mamos: 2@s  enough to buy the hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three clubs losing 2 spades and two diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lousy|pg||
nt|xenya: N won't pass|pg||
nt|tomi2: north must think his pd is 2452 but he stops the black suits well. maybe he passes this|pg||
nt|jcomyn: awww both wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
nt|m_niemi: aggressive X by W|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi George|pg||
nt|kemperg: no bet|pg||
nt|mamos: coffee  I think|pg||
pc|c6|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
nt|the saint: What would West's initial double have been? Many play it as that hand or a really big one|pg||
nt|m_niemi: and down he goes|pg||
nt|gowdy: back to par 100|pg||
nt|mamos: this is not an auction of beauty|pg||
nt|jcomyn: love to know how he thinks p will ever get in|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes definitely so brb|pg||
nt|pelu: S could still have a 4 card @S - so 3@S by N would also be a normal bid - but balanced and extra values - so 3NT very OK|pg||
nt|kemperg: +1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: 5 @D X = 500|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in 1 hour and 10 minutes is Israel Schools vs USA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy not vul|pg||
nt|bg: double not good for the Canadians|pg||
nt|xenya: if only a natural 4N was availble here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: south also alerted 4@c, but did not alert 4@d. North alerted 4@d|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: sadly no play for 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not an unreasonable contract in the abstract|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer doesnt know he has nine tricks   so easily|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
nt|davidstern: So it looks like EW have sold out cheaply|pg||
nt|tomi2: North now clearly overbids his hand|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@S is rkcb in hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction has gone out of hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
nt|the saint: North should have been able to read a singleton|pg||
nt|gowdy: the @C 2 was a mistake  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: he could have signed of in 4@H leaving his partner with a chance to bid on|pg||
nt|mamos: East is enjoying it   but North amd South are on different pages of the manual|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps in different manuals|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|santyclz: No one else objects to the 4@h bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|tomi2: no - they are not. they just misjudge their hand - but i think both know each meaning of each bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will find out automaticlly|pg||
nt|mamos: that the clubs are blocked and the Diamond Ace onside|pg||
nt|mamos: he will but he needs to think|pg||
nt|pelu: Netherland have great tradition and a lot of great results in women team - it looks like a new generation will follow that rute|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will have cashed 9 tricks by that time so can safely lead a @d up|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry im wrong he will have cashed 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i will be surprised if discards are not such that it will be safe to try a @d|pg||
nt|pelu: id he takes his 9 tricks and play @D from dummy he will have 10 @CQ block the suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: however east has to find 3 discards on @hs|pg||
nt|mamos: eventually I think he will play @hQ  and then will relax|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers in West (23) has only played bridge for 4-5 yeard - I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: In the CR declarer played the AK of @s on board one, before trying the @h finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@S on board 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: either its not a coffe hand after all or its a coffe and cakes hand |pg||
nt|kemperg: in OR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
nt|kemperg: E afraid of 5@S' in W|pg||
nt|rich89: 3@s in the other table|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those of you that asked |pg||
nt|hawe45:  SPADE NOW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but I was sleeping...|pg||
nt|mamos: defence in control now|pg||
nt|ahalim: or some pages are missing :)|pg||
nt|daman: S should be ablke to make this on a simple endplay|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now he gets squeezed blind|pg||
nt|daman: able*|pg||
pc|s5|nt|puncher: good try by south to get partner in to lead the spade through - just not to be on this hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES|pg||
nt|lestergold: North seems confident that south cannot get a club loser away on @ds|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dagold: nice contract to stop in here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry misclick|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h I mean.|pg||
nt|ahalim: rhis will be bloody|pg||
nt|mamos: what was 2NT Tom?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
nt|hawe45: TRUMP BACK|pg||
nt|tomi2: a general gametry, forcing|pg||
nt|kemperg: E ha d9 pts more than promised, but W knew that by inference|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: defence needed to set up Diamond trick to keep it to ten  +1  now|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding,  and holding 4 @H's   X doesnt see right |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rich89: 2@h is 8 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Roland |pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT  should have been a warning ?:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: watching talented but inexperienced players reminds how much experience counts for at bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: that confidence could have been misplaced|pg||
nt|davidstern: Can anyone see anything EW could have done better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bg: X cannot be right with super fit in clubs and no spade winners|pg||
pc|dK|nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not with 3 spades?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trump|pg||
nt|kemperg: inference, word I know from the books of Terence Rees|pg||
nt|kemperg: Reese|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
nt|tomi2: fron N's point of view 3nt showed a decent hand with 2452 distr.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit pointless|pg||
nt|kemperg: when I remember it well, read those in the 60's|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told North is a she i do not know why names are not given as Miss or mrs. or Mz so we know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: giving your age away now|pg||
nt|mamos: French team have started well  -- do we have link to scores  the one I had yesterday seems broken|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: lost the play :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has burned boats for a clever manouvre in @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: before entries were destroyeed a small @d from hand...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: but nine tricks are available not that I can count |pg||
nt|sybarra: we in a claim?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with this bidding. a void when partner asks for aces...|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, just asking kindly :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: and now.....the end is near....with apols to Sinatra|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why keep the two little spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 7 of spades is an entry?|pg||
nt|kemperg: it is|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 in Easts hand could play a role if he tries to endplay him in @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: but no use now|pg||
nt|kemperg: not completly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||
nt|paulg:  back-seat driving, i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats the simple way of grabbing the @d trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but not 4@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as Liz pointed out|pg||
nt|petergill: With a minimum for 4@D and bad diamonds and no long side suit as a source of tricks, I think 4NT was a vast overstatement by North|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Bit harsh, Peter - opposite xx/KQx/KQJxxx/Ax where would you like to play?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (well that isn't quite the hand, but you get the drift :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3H|nt|tomi2: playing 4@D as simple KC you are not able to judge anymore - you are simply asked to tell partner about your keycards... you cant stop the auction or suggest to play 4@H like ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Barendregt did here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Liz - 5@D on club lead and hope we make 5@D, 4-1 trump break threatens 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, as I said that was not the hand  meant, but I still think you are being hard on North|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The problem comes with the rebid that suggests a better suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 3: South can always bid 6@D over 5@D, on my sequence, when 6@D is on|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I must agree with Liz. I expect a much better suit for 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: THAT  is the problem of making thin Vul O/C Rosaline|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Peter doesn't|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would also have treated south's hand as some NT|pg||

nt|lestergold: my fingers are butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: we do need to find you a commentator spell checker :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll do that for ya|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we all felt that was not an automatic slam to reach many experienced pairs would mess this hand up|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3 @C ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would think a 5@H in tempo .... |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont think D was meant als penalty|pg||
nt|sybarra: I had a spec suggest:  X = interest in bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: some kind off want to bid 5@H, but let partner think with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: but must say I have never seen that|pg||
nt|mamos: East perhaps too timid with good clubs and a bit of a Heart fit|pg||
nt|tomi2: would have been a nice play if they stoped in 4@H :)|pg||
nt|xenya: well played, yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: went to school at 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: only +1??|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yea, I asked the players.. after the @d finesse things went rather quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: last hand was a red save hand I think - 5@D was only one down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it´s better to show the void on S - and N will not be happy!|pg||
nt|mamos: someone has turned the distributiononometer up|pg||
nt|ahalim: is this a goulash tournament ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: after the first match with those hungarians...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pass!!|pg||
nt|gowdy: good !|pg||
nt|davidstern: Anyone for 6 of a minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: what a deal here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow some fun here in bidding very suitable for polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be exciting|pg||
nt|bg: could be X not meant as penalty but then EW  not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was pretty popular in Holland, Brink Drijver were playing it, but now they stopped playing it|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to rework the system notes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ... you might want to call it that :)|pg||
nt|mamos: thats not timid  what was 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: don't know that|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|mamos: the dutch dealing prog has been set to "wild"|pg||
nt|the saint: I've seen worse 3@C bids 1st NV|pg||
nt|gowdy: just asking :)|pg||
nt|m_niemi: I thought they bid aggressively in non vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: well west alerted it, east didnt, so think your right Bruce|pg||
nt|sybarra: but E could be playing a 4/3 in hts |pg||
nt|bg: E should bid 3 clubs good heart fit and W has a spade shortage|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thisd hand should keep w quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
nt|hawe45: So now we know for sure, that E/W play 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
nt|gowdy: and now we know that North likes to bid !  :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: in my club money game 3@c wouold be considered a routine conservative action|pg||
nt|davidstern: Fit showing jump in competition|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D a @S raise |pg||
nt|tomi2: both german pairs have no 2@D weak opener in their system|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dodgy aul h fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: must have blocked one of the majors somehow|pg||
mb|d|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 1@S   |pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: EW play different NT ranges in different positions|pg||
nt|hawe45: Rathar weak North for the 2 @C-bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: this one was 14-17|pg||
nt|the saint: Will work now, becuase should be able to lead a club vs 3N|pg||
nt|bg: oops now France on different meanings|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: dont know if 4NT was meant as asking aces or that is was quanti|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Robert asking partner if he is right|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at the hand,  can S be asking aces?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont really understand the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now a cue by E and off we go |pg||
nt|davidstern: No defence and good play hand why bid so low|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 7 surely|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S  7@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
nt|sybarra: now Bruce, how to pick up the club suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like they are on the same wavelength, but my French isnt fantastic :(|pg||
nt|bg: easy Shirley just play K-A  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: would you bid 3 or 4 sp?|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree David bid once and high|pg||
nt|davidstern: Depending on mood and partner - indifferent to either|pg||
nt|davidstern: Probably 4@S but ..... on another day 3@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: NEVER ON ANY PLANET would I bid 1@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: white v white, so always a crap shoot |pg||
nt|sybarra: agree, no way you get me to bid 1 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
nt|davidstern: West's made it a little hard on partner|pg||
nt|tomi2: I don't agree to that double, it should show spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: testing thei system|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s oj if they are very conservative vul about their 3@s bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants  go to the next button on the bottom to see the Witte House (White House) |pg||
nt|rich89: @H now? |pg||
nt|lestergold: ht switch absolutgeluy mandatory here|pg||
nt|mamos: let off the hook there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will NS find the crossruff?|pg||
nt|mamos: South claimed 9 a couple of hands ago  will  ten test him ?|pg||
nt|hawe45: As always: Lead a TRUMP!|pg||
nt|hawe45: But here @D works better...|pg||
nt|gowdy: may start a high D for a look |pg||
nt|hawe45: East wants 300 instead of 100|pg||
nt|the saint: Smolen 4@S, 5@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: just what south wanted to hear!|pg||
nt|gowdy: xx @C perhaps 4 @H|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play transfers in this situation, 2@C would have shown @D'S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but no matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  thanks Alan|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may get doubled|pg||
nt|hawe45:  500 now - or?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice start fo decl.|pg||
nt|kemperg: prefer 2N opening on E|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hmm another interesting contract|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@C from South|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  you think these seniors could all the clicks then?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hear the clicks|pg||
nt|lestergold: if pard does not have high spade honour u cant beat it|pg||
nt|the saint: Well South might hate his club shortage and try for a major fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: my granny would do that  but do the experts do the same?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: that solves the s situation|pg||
nt|peachy: East's bidding has pinpointed spade singleton so 3NT started to look bad|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WHACK?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
nt|tomi2: should north have opened 3@D maybe? nonvuln but 2nd seat|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer knows hes probably doomed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dummy trying to read my face, difficult to keep it in shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes probably does, why else does anyone lead into the @H holding|pg||
nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jaime Lee|pg||
nt|davidstern: 800 versus 920|pg||
nt|davidstern: 940 if you are inspired in clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: EW did well in the end|pg||
nt|sybarra: )|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord where are they going|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: think better to finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: Losing 2 hearts 2 diamonds and club -4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
nt|xenya: E has figured out that @Ss must be 4-4 on the auction -- a nice piece of inference|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXRERAWHACK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: EXTRA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
nt|xenya: not worse that 4-4 i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: claim|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
nt|tomi2: now north has no single trick and cant expect his partner to have Ax of @D and to find the lead... something went wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: for another huge score|pg||
nt|mamos: just  couple of trumps to lose|pg||
nt|peachy: 4D was the last making contract but 5D is just unlucky while 4H has  a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|jcomyn: christmas has arrived early|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: nice defense by East|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed |pg||
nt|pelu: best: take @SA and strat red cross-ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: wel;l; he has decided to play pard for a club guard rather than play the 4/3 fit i wouold have gopne for the 4/3 fit on the grounds that even if north has a club card it might not ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: be sufficient|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: OK East making his opponents suffer|pg||
nt|tomi2: e will corrently fight for an overtrick here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why so long to play|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|kemperg: eastern egg|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it is EASTER arrivinbg early|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N with stiff A or K not bad|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi all |pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: the spade 8 confirming that hwe can ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: N didnt get it |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what on earth is this?|pg||
nt|mamos: nasty decision |pg||
nt|gowdy: Erwin did south thank N for the dummy ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: ah that way, yes he did|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
nt|bg: W has shown a long heart suit could have 3 clubs but not likely|pg||
nt|mamos: Id like to claim quickly so they have plenty of time to discuss where they went wrong :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@D rebid on board 3 led to 6@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: well  Tadaaaa |pg||
nt|mamos: and we are left to wonder what would have happened after 1@c 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry 1@d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: concede a h and claim|pg||
nt|jcomyn: as you said 1s 7s wqithout all this mucking about|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a really wild board all sorts of ways to get a really horrid result|pg||
nt|gowdy: was he nice looking at that pile of dung|pg||
nt|gowdy: change might to should|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzag: cant see his face|pg||
nt|tomi2: they will talk in bavarian, so we won't undestand this :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 7 is 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe can u see the line|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
nt|paulg:  discards mean that declarer can lead towards @hJ safely|pg||
nt|the saint: I guess with that strong diamond suit, the 1N opener was too much of a distortion for me|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinks he has a natural heart trick but how can he hope to wenjoy that when he can see the establisheable diamonds sitting in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are not fantunes yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an appaling error|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with best defence 4@h dbl is -1100|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
nt|lestergold: it has to be the A and there has to be no card to knock out as well for 3N toc be viable|pg||
nt|ahalim: there is the overtrick|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: must admit I would not have led a spade |pg||
nt|paulg:  both have prime cards and the breaks are very friendly|pg||
nt|daman: the young players make good use of the red cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H K is needed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|newmoon: now the @C gets ruffed|pg||
nt|dagold: Espen and Norman know this is  a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats all folks|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes. A below par slam anyway|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dummy reversal|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: with both minor aces on N E must play a @s - and he did|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: or 4?|pg||
nt|lestergold: and an insult to partner|pg||
nt|the saint: Make the King of diamonds the club king and it has merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome James|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  declarer will take the heart finesse in an attempt to make the contract, not with any hope|pg||
nt|paulg:  and probably go two down|pg||
nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
nt|lestergold: well having chosen the distortion  the bidding has warned him of a likely big hoole in the club department|pg||
nt|bg: Hi James|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|the saint: Yes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: so a likely swing to England|pg||
nt|paulg:  although he can count Sime's hand now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why did w not sdign off in 4d or bid 2d the first time|pg||
nt|kemperg: inOR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jameslee 2: hi Shirley |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  so he knows it is not working, down one then|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Bruce|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless the hundred honours held bt opps all fall on 1 trick it could have been difficult|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: i don't think N ruffed|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|hawe45: West "only" wanted 300|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: morelike raspberry tunes at the moment|pg||
nt|daman: more trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe playing minor reverse|pg||
nt|peachy: I like 1H, normally not good to hide a major suit on the one level with a weak hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - when you need them to go wrong you maut give them a chacne to do so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's aserious error to keep all those clubs I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South could have beaten it by pitching a club instead of a spade|pg||
nt|psridhar: Dutch girls were 2nd going into this round and with this scoreline their spot in Semifinal may be threatened?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: they were up by a lot so still have some margin even with a bad score here.|pg||

nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||

nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||

nt|xenya: S was going to get squeezed anyway|pg||

nt|xenya: a heated discussion is under way no doubt|pg||
nt|tomi2: the german pair will have to refocus on the remaining boards, still 6 to go. they know they are far behind now|pg||
nt|mamos: slightly odd auction in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: might be duplicated here|pg||
nt|tomi2: they play forcing NT and the 2@C response from N will be multi-meaning... but maybe south will pass 1@S with no king and ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: helmich-hop play some sort of Gazilli, so 2@c was forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2: their 1@S opening is limited to 18hcp, so a game is far away|pg||

nt|mamos: This table is going to be in time trouble|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi colored|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
nt|lestergold: bidding comps expect you to find them on hands like this|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board n 5 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with a few sacre bleus and things|pg||
nt|peachy: NS are the older of the Israel teams, currently in first place|pg||

mb|r|an|bid your Major|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||

nt|gowdy: now this is hard luck for NS  on a good day 6@D is cold  but not this day|pg||
nt|m_niemi: South bids now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@d x'd,, so even if they'd x'd 2@d it would have been a loss.|pg||
nt|tomi2: Ellerbeck might see his problematic rebid after 2@C gazilli|pg||
nt|mamos: quick auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 3@D by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: flat hand open 1nt 4/3/3/3|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer did well to make eight in OR|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think it was misdefended there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but makes anyyway|pg||
nt|mamos: this isnt much like bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: with his attitude this is inevitable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
nt|hawe45: 800 must do this time|pg||
nt|hawe45: Is 5 @D a winner - I´m not so sure|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: raise to 3nt |pg||
nt|sybarra: did W bid 2 @D?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why Mike|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
nt|gowdy: as well he should|pg||
nt|bg: S hoping Dia Q wrong|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lead 4th best by E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand has 4 @C +2@H+1@S +1@D= 8 |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: with KQJ with west very unlikely to have the @SA so think he should finesse the clubs last board for a safety play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: needs a 9 trick somewhere |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so what is it|pg||
nt|mamos: is this Strong Club do we know?|pg||
nt|kemperg: Is that forcing???|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 1s-2s-3s surely|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: a club limit raise I am told |pg||
nt|mamos: presumably balanced 10ish :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead the @D 10, pls|pg||
nt|davidstern: I think it is a very strong club.....dont know|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: its artificial yes didnt find a convention card jet|pg||
nt|lestergold: after second double north is very cautious holding some values and 5 hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: THE Israeli Juniors  have a fantastic record in the tournament so far averaging 22 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
nt|mamos: ah   a sort of inverted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so were 2@H and 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: but for the ruff,  5 @c would be ok |pg||
nt|daman: I would never have passed the N hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nasytherr|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Must discard @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ja - herzlich willkommen|pg||
nt|arno11: danke:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a sane contract at last|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps ahve to find a club or trump lead to beat 4 which is after all a fair contract vulnerable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: north is pass for me|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a better hand than he thought I believe|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mamos: i heart was lead which definitely helped :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||

nt|gowdy: HI Arno|pg||
nt|mamos: oh thats very ill disciplined|pg||
nt|davidstern: Making me ill anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: so do you lead your singleton or you ace |pg||

nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably need to start clubs to try to find close to 9|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but choing to rong player as the lead makes him all the rest @H |pg||
nt|bg: not easy has to duck next heart and play W for a doubleton dia honor|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: squeezzed on 3 suits lets see how he discards |pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  he may lead a diamond up at trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  trick 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: where is this going?|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer needs to plan for ten tricks, give up club and two hearts and hope spade finesse is working|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec told me 2@S forcing|pg||
nt|peachy: Club of course disappears|pg||
nt|peachy: if hearts were splitting|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cameron_1: he must have run it|pg||
nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agreed, but it probably wouldn't have been 45 years ago.|pg||
nt|lestergold: may have devlaued the K@s altho i think this is poor policy against preemptd at fave vul when opps rarely have a decent suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very disciplened pass though|pg||
nt|pelu: Laura Dekkers was on the Netherland silver-team in Ostend (women team)!!!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: soth needs to make a non commital lead on this auction eg @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it is by far the most important suit in so many systems|pg||
nt|gowdy: even my mother bids 1@S there and she would bid 1 nt with N|pg||
pc|d8|nt|newmoon: yes, sorry 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards liem this can  make on that line but declarfer may go forthespades|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on hearts needs that pesky T to drop which it does|pg||
nt|kemperg: On @S he is low on entry''s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 29 c0mbined on a fairly nisfitting han d is not great for a 6n contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dagold: Norman and Espen have been rewarded with 4 imps for their nice stop in 3@c on 19|pg||

nt|lestergold: true|pg||

nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: even withe 4/1 club break it looks pretty good|pg||
nt|sybarra: a makeable 3 nt,  not sure all will get there |pg||
nt|bg: EW playing 2 of a major reasonable hand and 2 Dia opening to show weak two in a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: and yes they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|kemperg: cricket?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thayare juniors Mike - what you suggest comes with age and experience|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: we didnt cash our tricks Er? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Nu er jeg der|pg||
nt|m_niemi: EW has gone down some slams today|pg||
nt|m_niemi: will see if they bid another|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep - a rout|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: was 1@s a muddy the waters bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt presumanbly  now|pg||
nt|kemperg: transfer like we play them|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard to reach tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||
nt|paulg:  this could be a gain as I think 4@h is more Carroll's style|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
nt|rich89: is 1@s nat?|pg||
nt|rich89: y..|pg||
nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45: går i lobby nu|pg||
nt|rnmalik: why would W bid 2@C, would bid 2@H for transfer and then 3@H or 4@D.|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond lead may give 9th  immediately|pg||
nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
nt|arno11: W cld make 3 NT on a @D lead but......|pg||
nt|the saint: Can just ruff two hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|the saint: 3N is a lazy bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: this one is a sound slam 8 card fit combined 32 points control rich hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes:(|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe   |pg||
nt|peachy: To answer kibitzers, http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hans is speaking to Roland I am sure,  not mind all |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 'brilliant dummy'|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards spitting at N/S here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E hoping the club suit comes in |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: East shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West does not have an easy lead |pg||
nt|2hplus4: Nor the next time he gets in|pg||
nt|paulg:  and may feel the pressure throughout the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  might lead small club|pg||
nt|paulg:  although North's actions suggest the minors|pg||
nt|2hplus4: But @H lead is obvious I think|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Partner could easily have the ten|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he is thinking then Anderson now knows where everything is|pg||
nt|sybarra: was he smiling when he said that?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: well em|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 1N raptor on N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think south was worth 4@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: leads also to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: becoming dizzy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrongly directed with the ace of the 4th suit.  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: anything home and hosed|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going down two, a good save against 4@s or 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
nt|arno11: W shld probaby act over 1@S  e.g. with 1NT|pg||
nt|m_niemi: if East opens, nothing will stop W|pg||
nt|mamos: and North has no reason to go on|pg||
nt|mamos: except the enthuisiasm of youth and confidence in partner's declarer play|pg||
nt|sybarra: and why not? |pg||
nt|mamos: both NS have nice hands 14 points but good tricks and shape |pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has enuf to make anotyher move|pg||
nt|sybarra: they have not been beaten up yet |pg||
nt|bg: I would have bid 3nt with S hand after two hearts too close to only bid 2nt North might easily have passed 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 45 minutes is USA v Denmark|pg||
nt|lestergold: jx @d becomes big when pasrtner has reversed and rebid @ds |pg||
nt|lestergold: but not many pauirs even at open level would find 6@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: girls in OR have 1 disaster after the other|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps after anugly 1N opening|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doubling 3@h into game was not a very good shot|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
nt|the saint: West is unlimited. You have a maximum pass so partner can't go overboard. Bid 3C to show support and develop the auction|pg||
nt|mamos: Germany need something alittle more exciting if they are going to get back some imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
nt|gowdy: now the 3 @S tricks are blocked|pg||
nt|sybarra: then ou get a club lead and all is well |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 ever 9 never here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well that takes care of that|pg||
nt|lestergold: board 4 holding 4 to the J|pg||
nt|kemperg: and giving away a spade trick|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
nt|arno11: what wld X show for you guys after 1@D-X-1@S ?|pg||
nt|xenya: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||
nt|peachy: Th French team also has wnjoyed sucess in past tournaments|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: poor play by declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if that what happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: but undone|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thats inexperience|pg||
nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
nt|mamos: ive always thought thee should be a new card in the bidding box  "Undo"   could I try that one again ::)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@c might be taken as weak|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||
nt|sybarra: aka jrs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: north has shown a hand worth a game try on an uncontested auction of 1@s 2@s which would ne an acceptNCE WITH SOUTH'SHAND|pg||
nt|the saint: 2H sets up a game force|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  but I'm surprised that West passed when he has a normal 4@h call|pg||
nt|puncher: Other room are currrently playing 5@C doubled so a few imps to Scotland|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson pretty sure that the ace of clubs is onside given the spade return|pg||
nt|the saint: So 3C can't be passed|pg||
nt|the saint: Many also use a lebensohl type relay in this position to cater for the weak hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: 2nt forces 3C  so 3 C is strong|pg||
nt|peachy: in U25|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 1 down, maybe 2 -- but it won't make|pg||
nt|sybarra: where would he rather be 6 @C?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: probably a push if S opens 1N in the other room as well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: play  aow on the lead and let W be high on @sQ... Probably making|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  being told that 13 points is a strong opening bid :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: best by E|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45: Must be discussed for every pair|pg||
nt|m_niemi: West passes some times forcing bids, so East didn't want to risk anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: but would bid 3@c with a minimum and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|gowdy: "Ingberman" in north america|pg||
nt|lestergold: lower range of 3@c is suely no9t strong|pg||
nt|the saint: Hence why Ingberman/Blackout is played to allow a direct 3C to show values|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless partnership agrees that 2n only shows a minimum|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gowdy: for me penalty  |pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to dash folks but p[lenty of you cu later|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the  @d auction was ridiculous|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dagold: technically he should cash the diamond Ace here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play low....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|puncher: WBU still 30 or so ahead of England, and Wales now in the 25 zone against N Ireland|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand was bid rather well considering how light n/s open|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: however this auction points to the ned for a look at theirbidding methods|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ingberman is over reverses but some have extended it to 2-level jump shifts by opener as well.|pg||
nt|the saint: It is definitely worth playing it in these positions too|pg||
nt|sybarra: well see......thats why you bid it |pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks John!|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thanks John|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d i mean|pg||

nt|tomi2: transfer advances after 1@C allow more precisious bidding for all players at the table - but they are forbidden in some major tournaments in the USA|pg||

nt|petergill: South is originally a passed hand, so North should pass|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Small heart lead might fix this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Double is rather fruity|pg||
nt|petergill: but chooses to double, very dangerous|pg||
nt|psridhar: Did N notice her pd is a passed hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: sometimes u miss that with screens and bidding tray in play|pg||

nt|tomi2: I would trust on partners two club tricks here, but it turns out to be the best defense|pg||
nt|psridhar: If declarer 'trusts' the X of 3@C he may misguess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can't double without @HA|pg||

nt|sybarra: my agreements with splinters are may be unique, but I dont have xxx (or jxxxxx) in an outside suit |pg||

nt|hawe45: Problem is, that when you bid with this West-hand - partner will bring you too high|pg||
nt|arno11: 6 in a minor possible here but difficult to make....|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w are not too flush here in a high level club contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Pass alerted by east, not by west|pg||
nt|pelu: S was on the france junior gold-team in 2009 (Brasov) - and 2 x spangenberg on NL-girls in 2007 - Silver - so we have real topclass here!|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho i would nevber have jumped to 3@d with such an awful suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think both of them take some blame for that auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
nt|sybarra: ehaa....every hand an adventure!|pg||
nt|mamos: West had better not think she has defence|pg||
nt|bg: The doudle is cards vut as happened in last match partner thought otherwise and allowed -590 vs makinf game themselves|pg||
nt|bg: double|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Israel NPC reaches for more heart medicine?|pg||
nt|peachy: this looks like transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
nt|m_niemi: his shape is good suit texture not so good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4 th suit forcing 2@D |pg||
nt|jcomyn: very odd|pg||
nt|kemperg: think it is|pg||
nt|daman: I would pass as North|pg||
nt|peachy: It is a current trend, to use transfer bids in a lot of sequences|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N was the better choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|mamos: do we know 1NT here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dekkers and Robert very surprised the tray came back without further bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: must be 4/5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 1NT hearts and diamonds yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!|pg||
nt|mamos: too late he dropped dead :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may have dropped dead on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|kemperg: mee too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still might work out well|pg||
nt|lestergold: my principle is simple a jump rebid always guarantees a suit with no more than one loser except in very exceptional circumstances when u are really fixed for any altgernative|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told 4-6 H+D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: try for a 5/3 fit |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if he pushes to 3nt or not |pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4s a good xcontract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|arno11: good idea to stay in 3N...|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite  but my juniors when I was captain bid  but if you don;t think you can buy the hand don;t give free information|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - double-dummy 6 NT is rather dold|pg||
nt|hawe45: cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: Stripe tailed double|pg||
nt|mamos: 1280  is an "interesting score"|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it was XX |pg||
nt|davidstern: Just so you know 120+120+120+120+50+50+200+200|pg||
nt|davidstern: +300 for game =1280|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4@S was something like 0+15 HCP with 5card spade and no interest in slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: why dbl in S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what s woiuld have bid if e passes|pg||
nt|mamos: I think 2@D by North might have been wiser :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: If it would've promised 6@d's, north would've bid 2@d I think|pg||
pc|c8|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
nt|hawe45: Best lead according to the bidding|pg||
nt|gowdy: nice try here|pg||
nt|kemperg: French captain confirms 4-6|pg||
nt|pelu: so prob 9+ red cards with longer @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i hope this gets whacked and defended properly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes he did |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 quick tricks need a 9 th |pg||
nt|sybarra: vul,  probably tempting |pg||
nt|jcomyn: spose he thought n had something for 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: French girls captain|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Laura asking about French weak 2 openings|pg||
nt|mamos: either pass is some forget or a little unwise opposita partner who passed originally|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll ask the players after the board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
nt|the saint: West doesn't have a big enough club fit to justify 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: at equal vul this is ridiculous|pg||
nt|m_niemi: W should have 4 card support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H+1@S+@C+1@D=8|pg||
nt|bg: anthing but a club will make it hard to find 9th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@C in bad position for the Q@C |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting double of 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouchhhh|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahalim: asking for a @D lead  ?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
nt|kemperg: I have a younger partner, so I use them a lot|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: price of lack of discipline|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
nt|m_niemi: East had already told his cards, so why bid 5@c|pg||
nt|santyclz: or HHx with Hx in diamonds.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
nt|tomi2: he was on lead himself|pg||
nt|mamos: a little surprised tht North has sold out to 3@h|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: K telling her partner something?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
nt|lestergold: to m ake a voluntury call holding no more than 3 to the K and a stiff in pard's other suit is asking for trouble|pg||
nt|the saint: Ducked?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yep|pg||
pc|hK|nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has eight tricks here now   can he find a ninth?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: rule of 7 he duck 1 @D|pg||
nt|kemperg: help from opps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: no down 1 in toptricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may not have been the greatest duck in history|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho it has grosvenor elements about it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Aflac...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: N want's to retain trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N expects p not to have trumps anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: so that way ducking wouldn't cost anything|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
nt|lestergold: east hassnt promised 6 @cs|pg||
nt|bg: EW not on same wavelength |pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes as spec notes - have you discussed with partner whether the pass of 4@Sxx by Eats suggests he wants to defend or nothing to say|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: o yes still 1down|pg||
nt|lestergold: ive reviewed board 1 which i was late for and there was a 10 imp swing there when the dutvh giels here went off in 3n the french declarer made the correct technical play of cashing ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: the AK @s in case !q dropped and then fell back on the heart finesse which worked|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|m_niemi: now trumps and this will go down a lot|pg||
nt|the saint: To be fair, one nation's juniors who I would certainly not expect to be reticent in the auction are the Finns!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Most of the reticence has come from s.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes or a 50% position |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
nt|lestergold: the dutgch girl here simply chose the losing spade finesse which happened to be wrong so that was not luck but incorrect card paly|pg||
nt|lestergold: so to be fair that swing was caused in this room in effect|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right - here we also comment to play @S first|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzag: sorry, missaw the first @d, south took the ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: position is now correct, but north on lead with @dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: makes then|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|m_niemi: -6!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: he can exit with a high club and if that is ducked passively|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: yes sorry i had been late|pg||
pc|dT|nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||
nt|the saint: Only -3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: a real horror for the German team -- the'd better wipe it out of their minds as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|tomi2: in amsterdam the comming rounds start very fast, you get the chance to make it better very soon. 6 matches a day...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|petergill: Looks to me like 2NT showed various good hands. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|petergill: South's spade holding is well-placed as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: the double gave them 2 imps now and if they scored 500 it would turn 7 into 12, so 5 extra imps. compaired to the potential minus, if the contract had made it is still a long term ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: loser - even given the state of the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: A good habit to develop is for South to decide, as soon as it goes 2@H X, whether to double 4@S or not, if it is later bid to 4@S - that way, you don't give out vital info by a ...|pg||
nt|petergill: slow pass of 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: How can you tell?|pg||
nt|tomi2: the opening gives west a chance to find the bad breas|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: If declarer divines from the biding to remove South's red suit cards, South might get endplayed in black suits later|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North has shown hearts and a minor? SO he cannot yet be sure which minor|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: So far, so good for declarer - best as the cards lie is to keep playing red suits whenever possible|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They sure can play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A joy to watch|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: What can South do? Concede?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they had good boards caused by they good play and too advantage of their opps mistakes - this is the way to score in an event like this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Roos knows she has two options. Choose the plague or cholera, none of which is pleasant|pg||
nt|petergill: West picked the 4-1 trump break from the slow pass of 4@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Time to throw in the towel|pg||
nt|tomi2: 10 imp swing for NL on the board where @H lead let 3@C make|pg||

pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: French defence to 3NT on board 10 not the greatest|pg||

nt|hawe45: Yes - so far South´s risky bid has been a help for opps|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam in the offing? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid game?|pg||
nt|tomi2: north can open this hand 2@C if he feels he needs to do somethingk|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C is 10-14 with 6+@C and no 4 card major in their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Short expected a bit more?|pg||
nt|bg: E should jump to 4 hearts right away not likely to miss anything since pard passed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a big 7/5 @H/@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west cant believe it and is thinking|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not 1 trick in parner to make 4@H |pg||
nt|bg: what is 3 dia obviously E is trying to show something but what|pg||
nt|bg: best with E type of hand just to haul off and bid what you think you might make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pitiful:  i would say it would be a good effort to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Lead 2 x @S|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@H shows @S one way or another|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must go folks dinner time here leaving you in very many capable hands thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will bid 4@H |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: explained as Majors by east|pg||
nt|davidstern: I only have nightmares about my own bridge. A good friend told me once thta I should only worry about my bridge if I worry about partner's I dont have enough faith to play with ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: him/her|pg||
nt|sybarra: my dutch friends will explain slaap lekker|pg||
mb|p|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lebensohl|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm|pg||
nt|tomi2: so south does not have to check for a heart fit but ccan either invite to game or simply bod 3nt and try to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Always lead TRUMP|pg||
nt|davidstern: Newswires announcing death of Elizabeth Taylor|pg||
nt|mamos: 2NT invite now?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: c u|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: maximum hand in N what to bid?|pg||
nt|bg: 4 hearts makes as long as E is patient uhtil he gets to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 4NT sounds like a good option?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true x@S+x@S entry in dummy or @H finesse by opps played :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H=|pg||
nt|mamos: Spade lead will curtail his efforts to mae many more than seven tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: this was one good example of why transfer bids work; if n was on lead, a d would be much easier for the def|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bidding seems sensible despite both being maximum|pg||
nt|mamos: East is "fearless"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, this may explain the 3@h bid.  Perhaps the 4 level shows a big hand as they play.|pg||
nt|the saint: The strong option in the multi|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks mike.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Tim there you are |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4Nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we might make too many |pg||
nt|mamos: i think we always were making too many  for 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w is even more fearless|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
nt|bg: by fooling around with the 3 dia bid E has given N an option to bail out in 4nt which will only be beaten by a non heart lead|pg||
nt|daman: It will be hard to beat this contract|pg||
nt|peachy: I should say so too :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: don't forget the bidding space won|pg||
nt|daman: 8 toppers with a myraid of ways for 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we wrong sided clubs :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why did s not crack 3D|pg||
nt|mamos: yes  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: ii think anyh partner would have done same|pg||
nt|mamos: too be fair the pre-empt warns of the bad breaks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@H lead ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Q@D|pg||
nt|pelu: in bord 7 France in 3@C X - has to guess @HQ to make - W didnt - and down 1|pg||
nt|mamos: so some work for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gowdy: well a heart they could life with  but ....|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is leading!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry other side leads ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is shaking his head, east says wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: its sort of in the rules :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3 SpaDES 3 diamonds 2 Clubs and an extra red trick|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 3@c = puppet Stay|pg||

nt|mamos: very easy to go off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ho9wever im nor convinced they would have found best defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: should this be whacked?|pg||

nt|m_niemi: 3@s = 4@h|pg||
nt|ahalim: NS had a chance to go plus, but not anymore|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: and 4@d is -4 too:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  Sime can lead the @sK, hoping for 3-3 spades, and forcing West to duck|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ire 161, Eng 161, Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 103|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he is banking everything on hearts, which will be less successful|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|puncher: yes with the club entries might have been better to go for spades|pg||
nt|mamos: it certainly wasnt intended as a Spade cue|pg||
nt|sybarra: we landed....how ever we got there   (dont ask) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I got all the alerts from W|pg||
nt|mamos: ok   we arrived|pg||

pc|d5|nt|garnetts: nothing else to do |pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  i think he failed to appreciate the defensive problems that he *might* cause by leading the @sK|pg||
nt|peachy: W does best to return pds suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: do much for your goulash Mike....|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: looks like declarer will lose 6 tricks for 1 down -- still NS have an easy no-trump partial|pg||
nt|mamos: doomed|pg||
nt|lestergold: im trying to think whether sungkle dummy it is technically correct to play a small spade from hand to the 6 as u c a afford 2 spade losers so long as u maintain control of the hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Welllllllllll|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a make now|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt pard open 1 @D???|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: well i see that @h got away in open room i csn imagine how cash rtwo spade and a @d tov ace end of defence|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|idc: Am told that North led a @d in other room, making declarer's task easier - this may go down here|pg||
nt|idc: That slam on Bd 21 - 6@c is better than I first thought, a very good contract in fact|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: I bet he knew they were 3-3 --no double lol|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i prefer hearts to herats|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: Houston we have landed is what the astronauts say |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: well they seemed to know what they were doing,  just scared the rest of us|pg||
nt|hawe45: East will regret, that he skipped a @C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: in fact 4 rounds of spades does it too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: last board and see you nest match!|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many swings here despite the swingy nature of the boards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: spade discard ---hmmmmm  |pg||
nt|santyclz: Better to cash the @cak before crossing to hand?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: probably expecting better diamonds from partner |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|idc: Looks like SOuth switched to @dT at trick two - may have been right to do so but not this time|pg||
nt|arno11: shld now make shld hacve ruffed diamond then !T Q  pitching his heart loser and coming to 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hawe45: he still makes it easily|pg||
nt|arno11: @c Q I meant|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: cereless play - why not start ducking a @S - the loose (on normal sits) 2 @S and a @C - even with @Ss 3-2 problem now - only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: even double dummy not simple|pg||
nt|lestergold: after all this is a hand where u have a few problems in the club suit so u need to prepare a cross ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: this may be a swing for NI |pg||
nt|lestergold: if west discards @d on third spade 4th spade does the buysiness|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45: Oh - trouble now|pg||
nt|arno11: now how does he make with an error?|pg||
nt|arno11: without|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2: this 3nt makes on a lucky day... spades 4-4, @DA with E for example|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: East should see he can do no better than 4 tricks for defense, this was an excellent attempt !|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think this will be a gain for EW    pretty standard contract|pg||
nt|peachy: true|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||

nt|kemperg: north|pg||
mb|d|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||

nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||

nt|peachy: makeable, anyway:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I was thinking of 4s|pg||
nt|mamos: It's easy to be wise :)  but for us oldies watching it does seem at time that mistakes are made by rushing play - technically most of these players are excellent  -- better than me ...|pg||
nt|mamos: for sure but need to be a little more patient with the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: anyway, one can sympathise with S's decision to bid 3N, considering the state of the match|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
nt|bg: W pass good decision  in other room W bid 2 clubs and that led E to double 4 spades whichmakes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4h|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
nt|kemperg: isthat forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dangerous approach|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bull at a gate stuff|pg||
nt|peachy: South's suit is good enough for trumps|pg||
mb|2N!|an|forces 3!c|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|gowdy: hard to miss 4 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: also hard to make :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 3@h   may be some mini splinter or some Bergen like raise|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree don't like 2@c  at this vul|pg||
nt|bg: if pard made a two level overcall I would double 4 spades also|pg||
nt|mamos: "1-under mixed raise" Im authoritatively told|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree  -- it was East's confidence in his partner's overcall that was misplaced :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bejaypers|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can hold 2 @S in 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3nt in this board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: will most likely also be one off|pg||
nt|m_niemi: Finn S bid 3NT, N removed|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wouldn't want to be there but you might conceivably get a @sq lead.|pg||
nt|the saint: With the @S 9 wrong that just delays the inevitable...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: 3NT has a chance, this has none|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1NT 15-17 here?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh oh|pg||
mb|3N|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 3 x @S and a @D will endplay South|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it was French E,  I guess SEF went out the window for the french jrs |pg||
nt|jcomyn: I dont think there weas much chance of missing game on this hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: fighting for part scores is one of the most fataql bridge diseases|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Sam is a debutant commentator. I wonder if she knows that co-commentators expect to get a drink from newbies :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Alok Daga|pg||
nt|alok_daga: hi all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Alok|pg||
nt|puncher: hi there|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm not a fan of MUD leads but they can be difficult for declarer to read too|pg||
nt|alok_daga: btw what was 3nt?|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: havent seen any alert but im not sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 im told|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 14+5-card suiit = 15|pg||
nt|kemperg: you cant do without|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'd invite showing a heart stop and four spades if partner was in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needs care|pg||
nt|lestergold: now defence have to cash their tricks in teh right order|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be clear which is not the same as easy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: you very seldom get a good score if opps.play at 1 level|pg||
nt|dagold: some Kibs do not like the side 4cM|pg||
nt|sybarra: dear me,  e/w....where did our jrs go?|pg||
nt|mamos: East has a good hand West has some tricks   come on lads   bid B% &*( game|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 1/2 hour is not super fast for 10 boards|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N should make but not laydown|pg||
pc|sT|nt|newmoon: my shpellingg iss garbage these dayss|pg||
nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: man up as we say!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yep, I'd be with the field on this one.  Going down as usual.|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, they are so far behind that they cant lose a lot anymore but win some vp if those games are somehow working|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahalim: that means a @D from W and a @H back|pg||
nt|arno11: action over for now...|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks promising  until trick 3 |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: still, -2 not too bad|pg||
nt|dagold: here for example the handwill not play so well facing many hands with 4-card spade support|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous  in the mean time |pg||
nt|lestergold: westknows that only hope is to play partner for A@d and Q@h|pg||
nt|gowdy: 3nt would have some fun :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: or actually this trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: with @D not breaking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for standings after round 12|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5-0 distribution not nice feeeling when you push a close game |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: i think E is to blame here|pg||
nt|idc: same lead as other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also inferences that East did not have four hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!   (as always) |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: seems like you've forgotten my performance last year|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike and Hans for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|kemperg: not in Kleinman points|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dagold: probably need 5 spades opposite|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me start some thank yous as we have one more hand in this set |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
pc|d2|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cledver54|pg||
nt|peachy: singleton is unlikely, he would have led it on the go|pg||
pc|dA|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still making s thiunk|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S was OK i think, but not 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||
nt|paulg:  it cannot cost to lead diamond here|pg||
nt|arno11: flat board|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|the saint: I guess you would try to get a spade trick and then try for a partial elmination in clubs hoping for Kx and a failure to unblock - doesn't work here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now 8 easy tricks the 9th can come from the club suit with the layout as it is but not an obvious source |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he really do that?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  from the carding he knew Walker had @cQ7 or @cQ75|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think someone put too much paprika in Miss Wagner's goulash|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: not on this layout though|pg||
nt|bg: mis defense on board 5 cost Canada another bunch of imps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: first to a big thanks to   our terrific operator  Erwin Huzen. Super job!  |pg||
nt|daman: cold    luckily|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: guessed    potential swing|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson finding a nice safe line for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|puncher: do you have the system to invite, show a heart stop and 4 spades? I can show a heart stop and 4 spades but only game forcing not inviting|pg||
nt|sybarra: she had the warnings with X etc |pg||
nt|kemperg: ty Erwin Mike, Shirley,and specs|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thank you to my fellow commentators Mike, Germ  and Riccardo for sharing your time and insights.  Always interesting, enlightening and fun!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx my excellent fellow commentators and helpful specs see u again soon for some more white house high jinks|pg||
nt|kemperg: I''m done fore today, hae to play tennis and bridge myself|pg||

nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2: he played for a @C ruff but he should know that his partner likes to lead from three small...|pg||
nt|mamos: well done for bidding this -- (I think)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||
nt|lestergold: when u play for these kind of against the odd ruffs they never happen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can aslo come from an endplay ity will come in the wash one way or abother|pg||
nt|kemperg: playing @S was better|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Unconfirmed, but current live ranking: Eng 163; Ireland 160; Wales 160; Scotland 154; WBU 149; NI 112|pg||
nt|puncher: too double dummy to get that right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  well q@h lead sort of helped the guess|pg||

nt|peachy: *first seat|pg||
nt|sybarra: And thanks to our specs.  We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.   @H@H|pg||
nt|kemperg: No leads to 5 losers|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: true or an inspired club lead and a heart switch|pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: not that it will make much of a difference either way on this hand|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|mamos: the play and defence here havent been very distinguished|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was one way|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  declarer did not have enough information to get the spades right and played the percentage line|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: they claim its down 1 and accept|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: perhaps E just did too much when he bid one more|pg||

mb|2N|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||

nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
nt|santyclz: S passed a 10-12 nt.  As I said, most of the reticence...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well done by open to miss slam but it is uinlucky lets see what happens|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||

pc|h5|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks germ me too|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks kibs, nice comments from polish peaple|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||

nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|gowdy: thanks everyone  and Erwin   great work!  see you Tomorrow|pg||
nt|tomi2: letting south pick the best game, 3nt or 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: maybe a German imp now :)|pg||
nt|peachy: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: people|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes indeed very helpful|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kept the pot boiling nicely|pg||
nt|lestergold: helpful lead but the ;ads will get a second cracj of the whip and hard to see them getting itg wrong4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
nt|mamos: agressive double again|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: and us on the straight and narrow|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: oh no I see 450 in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: The Israelian pairs are high up in the butler|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead and d switch - AARRGGH|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
pc|cA|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
nt|mamos: but Im not convinced by 3@C after opening bid and response|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
nt|mamos: well its a two-way shot in Diamonds I guess you have to work out which opponent has King|pg||
nt|mamos: and I agree double might put him off|pg||
nt|tomi2: 25-2 VP for the Netherlands|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if i got the typing wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: how about 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are obviously playing a system where 3@D is not forcing to game.....|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|peachy: webpage http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||

nt|daman: ciao everyone|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Erwin and all commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i find it hard to believe that fantunes would have let thru that contract for example|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board, thanks to our operator Vincent, Mike and John, see you again in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto tx|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks Vincent|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: even vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: perhaps there's some excitment still to come... |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but can you fix the oesers?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope   I t will be flat of course :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 76@C might have helped|pg||
nt|mamos: or nine :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the frence West made 4@s on the hand with @Ss 4-1 - but here N had shown a red hand - but still long way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: now couldnt see the need to cash quickly perhaps wasnot that easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: bye all|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering what !6 7 meant    maybe Smith?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however the heart lead was a poor shot on the bidding|pg||
nt|kemperg: count?|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost guaranteed to give bioth a tricka nd a tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: can't ask them anymore|pg||
