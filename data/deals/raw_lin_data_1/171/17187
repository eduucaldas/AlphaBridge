mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like an IMP to Hans|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe in Oz, but over here it is a shiraz hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D must have promised fit  [makes sense by passed hand even if never clearly talked about]|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2H has something going for it, but it is dangerous in a way that is often overlooked. when a preempt is this pure, it risks pushing opps to a gane they can make because their hands ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: are pure too. at the ame time, there is a different danger in holding too much defense for a preempt: shortish long suit, side singleton, and ace of long suit|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: is X for blood|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: so, play penalty X's|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how much more difficult is the E hand to bid over 2@S|pg||
nt|super nova: typically X is correctable. i.e pass is this is your weak 2.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no real problem tomake a t/o X, surely|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  the point is they can't over 2@H when you open 2@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: over 2@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you aren't getting the point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: am I not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: multi makes it easier on the opponents...  easy 2@H rebids and cardX...  it has a huge downside|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: anything that gives the opponents additional ways to describe hands is a bad thing...  cardX really helps the opponents|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well, it's a tradeoff, like all 2 bids|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they get to open 2@H & 2@S with another set of weak hands|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugrapha4: so it's "preempt more often" vs "maximum effect weak 2's"|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i open 2M with all of them...  i don't buy that excuse at all  :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: well, that's an approach :) |pg||
nt|bigtrain: actually marty bergen once told me that the most effective bid in bridge is the weak 2@D bid...  he never gets a good result when the opponents opened it|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mrdct: a couple of pairs in the Hans team don't play all of the national events, so it make sense that they didn't accumulte the maximimum PQPs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: very disciplined pass by Jacobs|pg||
nt|mrdct: in NS system his only option would be 3@S i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that depends on who is formulatinfg the rules that contitute the discipline|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or higher :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: this is more of a challenge|pg||
nt|chilloncan: cannot see point of 2S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|chilloncan: not best time for a speculative double of stay,man:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: or puppet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it takes up little room, and pd can hardly read you for this hand. if pd raises that rates only to help opps diagnose degree of fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: well it's unlikely to go for a number and if he happens to fit a fit with partner they are positioned to compete|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS are a little bit hamstrung with no weak 2 available|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i count 7 spades there, so lack of weak 2 not an issue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there aren't many other hands that fit Jacobs' sequence other than hand that others might open with Multi 2@D or Weak 2@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are plenty of such hands, depending on style. for example 64 in majors|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the meantime how does 6@c go?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no longer uncommon for vul weak 2 to include 7 card suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: true, counting suit lengths has gotten harder as average age of players ever rises|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: grateful for the 8@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: doesnt matter given grosvenor can never lead them|pg||
nt|chilloncan: interesting, the alert on 3H suggests that the call does not deny 4H, so responder could becone declarer in that suit. contrary to fundamental premise of puppet|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they play here, bill's 2@s would certainly have been successfulk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney did open North hand with 2@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are playing a variation of the Fantunes system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Ish's DBL vs 3@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: lets see how robust the @sK still is as a stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: not sure the EW potential disaster can be linked causally to the NSseuqence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dan Neill put together a file to explain a lot of Fantunes -- but we've already seen some bids that don't fit or aren't listed at all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chilloncan: also contrary to Hinge's apparent vow not to declare:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: df will cash K@D then take 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i guess @h10 is best now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: cashing @dK wont work|pg||

nt|chilloncan: dey aint no justice|pg||
nt|mrdct: no great disaster with 2@h the contract in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i make DelMonte DBL instead of 3@C a contributor too|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C|an|bad raise or 10+ raise|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 5+|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you may not lose IMPs on THAT deal but it is a cumulative MATCH, and the lost opportunity for massive gain  counts everuy bit as much in the tally|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h ruff will beat 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  a @D raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a @d raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems Jacobs will start with 2@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: certainly 3X was an alternative, but if E had been 4522 for example, 2S cou;d have been going for a lot against no game. N was perhaps a favorite to have 4 hearts on the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it is a question of not getting too high|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks Michael!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d for the majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugrapha3: this would be a good board not to have great agremeents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or just starting a force?|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: i like 4@c now (assuming its a splinter)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure hope bid was alerted on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ought to be, since 3C forcing after cue|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  7N is 88%. 7@d is a little worse because there could be a ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you could win IMPs playing imn a diamond partial against a really good team|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: surely 7NT is better than 88%|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other match (ladies?) both tables stopped in 6@d|pg||
