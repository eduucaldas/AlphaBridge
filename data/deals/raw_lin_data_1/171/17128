mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|sharkey: N opened 1 NT|pg||
mb|d!|mb|1D!|nt|ady: some sort of play for 3NT  e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|sharkey: 26 HCP between them|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt looks easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: And opening lead likely to give up a trick|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume EW playing a strong @C system...|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning the aggressive double|pg||
nt|jwit: club lead best, but very difficult to find|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Kibs inform me they're not - transfers and 1 NT rebid shows 18-19|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, we all tend to try to disturb big @c auctions|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D shows 4+ @H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: in CR north opened a mini 1NT  and south responded 3@C  pre-emptive   west doubled   and east bid 3@H   all pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - very active in CR - oaid off|pg||
nt|sharkey: *paid|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 6 or 7 imps to Sweden|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|ady: will win this with 10@H  and play on diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|cameron_1: Hi all good morning|pg||

nt|vugraphzag: sorry for being late|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: had some issues starting the broadcast|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good mornin g Shirley, Erwin and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: We are on catch up here it seems |pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|dagold: Good afternoon Everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson is looking for a superaccept, otherwise will pass|pg||
nt|kemperg: hi Shirley and Erwin|pg||
nt|sybarra: E being very restrained here I think |pg||
nt|mamos: hi shirley   a truly worldwide competition this year with Japan Canada USA and Venezuela|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: begorrah theres a nt for you|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: light double from south   with only 3 hearts|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd guess sime/matheson|pg||
nt|kemperg: and Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and herm hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm all from rainy Wash. DC |pg||
nt|lestergold: Germ hi|pg||
nt|lestergold: names would ne nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: the operator will get them up shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra: i think we are in a mad scramble at the moment to catch up |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this bidding system presumably weak no trump will get e/w too high pretty quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive isd hardly the word|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@C opening in a youth match|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have an exciting week of bridge planned with the jrs. |pg||
nt|lestergold: no @d opening by N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@d |pg||
nt|lestergold: not available|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case i'dopen 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D I ment|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: not so much mini as micro|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahalim: no problem here in 4@H I think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: list of all participants |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suppose taht E/W do not play negative double, East has a problem. Would then bid 2 @S|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here, so no hope |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a great contract even without this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Riccardo Rubino|pg||
nt|rich89: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ciao ricardo |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
nt|mamos: this will drift off could EW make anything much?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3CX more interesting|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: morning Ricardo|pg||
nt|lestergold: east strong no trump opener they play in 2@h|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes Sandra Rimstedt must have high hopes of beating this|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of the reasons i do not like weak no trump because it forces you to a 2 level rebid with a 17 COUNT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I SHOULD SAY MQANY REASONS|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock sorry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now a @d finess|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if clubs were 3/2 they would take a further 3 tricks with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt she the brazen hussy with her 10 count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|s6|nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, halftime scores: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ireland 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I am "on" the other fashon of BBO, have no coq...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|ady: dangerous 3NT with that spade holding   but only realistick game|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the challenge here's to get to 3 NT |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: what's 1@S - transfer to 1 NT?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C makes with very favourable diamond lay|pg||
nt|ritong: that should be not so tough|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: North is a little strong for 3C bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW were active in CR|pg||
nt|ritong: that s right jon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: the alternative is a bit awkward, though|pg||
nt|ritong: reversing in a virtual suit|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, it is awkward but with that suit, and those controls, I think I would opt for 2D|pg||
nt|ritong: rebidding 2NT with single @s can also create problems|pg||

nt|lestergold: sorry late|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which he should in my opinion|pg||
nt|mamos: is hussy politically correct expression?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what she comes up with here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: politically correct is for wussys|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Hi everyone! (again)|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not --  depending on defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Sound opening even though flat and 11 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|cameron_1: @d looser in end game I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d doesn't look like an acol 2|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi David|pg||
nt|dagold: Hi Sid|pg||
nt|2hplus4: @S suit worth more trhan one HCP|pg||
nt|puncher: Any weak NTs in the whole event? I'm a fan but others don't seem to be these days...|pg||
nt|paulg:  This is a clash of systems, with Precision Club against 'standard' here and Carrot Club against 'standard' in the other room ... part of the reason for lots of swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: Thats junior opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Does NOT excist|pg||
nt|sybarra: does everyone pass the N hand?|pg||
nt|mamos: I prefer 2!@h weak|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|dagold: I would bid on Souths hand I must admit|pg||
nt|lestergold: and it worked|pg||
nt|lestergold: but it should not have|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah,  think a lot of folks would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: at this vul |pg||
nt|mamos: South must take some action here  double looks normal enough|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Get 2 @C from partner and I would not like having opened|pg||
nt|mamos: or a protective NT :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I just saw Scotland bid this to 6@S via Kokish relay |pg||
nt|sybarra: we are putting in contracts and leading and claim|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT  for n/s   no reall problems|pg||
nt|newmoon: me 2|pg||
nt|xenya: a routine 3N -- whether E preempts or not|pg||
nt|paulg:  At least you approve the 4-card majors here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - I double , naturalle over 1 @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is a swedish proverb Mike - better late than never:)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 2@s  next|pg||
nt|mamos: in English we finish "better never late"|pg||
mb|1S|an|*|nt|dagold: could make a game facing the right weak notrump type|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a favourite irish expression|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|cuttysark:  Some oftThe Northern Irish still play weak NT |pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||
nt|puncher: yes let's hope this match is as exciting as the last one|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime might pass 1NT|pg||
nt|mamos: North's 3@c shows both majors  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N getting excited since he passed?|pg||
nt|mamos: and/or asks for more information from South|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think its exclusive to Sweden|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Beter laat dan nooit :)|pg||
nt|mamos: West?????? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: majors i presume|pg||
nt|po-s: a conservative bunch these juniors|pg||
nt|mamos: I see no majors|pg||
mb|d|nt|puncher: Well I'd have opened 1@C before 1@S - except that it'd be a 1NT for me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|2hplus4: Tight game missed Declarer perhaps able to endplay S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Walker has been conservative holding three small clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: u have to bid 4@s with N or you are done up0 like a kipper|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: well Houston we have landed (maybe) |pg||
nt|mamos: South not excited :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: !|pg||
nt|xenya: N had a choice of how to tackle his hand -- the double was easy, but what next?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least I have pards that would open 4 @H |pg||
nt|rich89: italy lost a simple 4 @s :(|pg||
nt|mamos: no underbidding her|pg||
nt|mamos: here|pg||
nt|ahalim: juniors Mike remember|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: its a risk i agree but its a bigger risk not bidding it|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl by N |pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: 3NT better than 4@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  I believe 2@c is puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|mamos: South may be a bit |pg||
nt|lestergold: strikes|pg||
nt|mamos: nervous now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why! @dK behind and @hA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not a classic vil overcall|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I will pass with confidence as S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html  Competitie (left), White House Juniors 2011 for updated results|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think its good enuf with a 6 card suit and a couple of high caRDS|pg||
nt|po-s: hard to bid game now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr west sees 9|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  how many tricks?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably 10?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: y|pg||
nt|xenya: the 6-0 trump split may seem annoying but it hardly hurts|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the @sK surprisingly well positioned this will play well for declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: after a long weekend of watching it is good to have swingy boards to finish to keep us all awake|pg||
nt|paulg:  Matheson would like to bid 2@s, but Sime has not shown any values|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s now is probably the bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: E is very close to a yarborough  (but for that pesky 10) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: was this a multi by west?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: or x if you want|pg||
nt|lestergold: but u canr pasws|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All you need is to play opener for the @S King...!|pg||
nt|mamos: BNorth needs to find the @sK  --preferably by playing the Ace !|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hand of course is unmanageable|pg||
nt|lestergold: for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h can be let thrualthough it should not make on best defence of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not a classic preempt, but at these colours many like to preempt more or less randomly  |pg||
nt|puncher: now will do |pg||
nt|po-s: thought I - apparently these guys know each other...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cameron_1: what they cc says anyway :)|pg||
nt|mamos: theplay will be swift|pg||

mb|d!|nt|jwit: Can hold it to 4 with a diamond lead or switch if heart led|pg||

nt|paulg:  they will open 1@c in the other room but probably get a similar result|pg||
nt|puncher: it's all so public these days too - with all of us watching over their shoulders - it adds to the pressure of a long weekend|pg||
nt|sybarra: the joy of jrs, "keep the game moving" |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s is not a junior contract omn thiose cards actually not a senior one either|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont  understand WEst's play  :(  panic?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first slam|pg||
nt|mamos: East may not be expecting an opposition slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: may not be that easy to bid 16 opp ten and lots of wasted values like 8 points not needed its effectively a combined working 19 points|pg||
nt|mamos: South has proved he can count to nine|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mss rimstedt will get busy here|pg||
nt|po-s: he doesn¬¥t want opponents tu suffer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I even think my grandmother would get to 6 @S's|pg||
mb|2D|an|*|nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm generally more worried about my opponents than the vugraph audience|pg||
nt|kemperg: will this end in 2@S by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: is there something wrong with 3 nt?  can you make it?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: somewhat strange 1N by E|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s is an old fashioned Acol Strong Two|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What kind of 2@S is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is either natural, gf, or a good heart raise|pg||
nt|puncher: I'm sure some prefer the good old days when you went off for the weekend and your bad bids and plays weren't scrutinised by all|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean J@s not needed combined 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and se does not play kokish|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and the singleton @H not so easy to pinpoint |pg||
nt|lestergold: a most unusual double fit here|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Might go off though Shirley :)  |pg||
nt|copeyj: good morning all|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|pitiful:  north might bid 4@d now|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will no doubt end in a number od hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  morning captain|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|xenya: E will overcall now?|pg||
nt|xenya: holding 4 hearts i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: back to real time|pg||
nt|sybarra: East is the only female at the table  btw|pg||
nt|sybarra: well that is one way to get to 3 nt|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W might be not SO experienced - that√Ç¬¥s all|pg||
nt|mamos: another stiff K|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west was thinking E had @sq due to @s2|pg||
nt|po-s: and sometimes, if a spade lead had beaten 3NT, claiming causes more pain|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: no...|pg||
nt|xenya: this might go down quite a few on accurate defence|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Doesn't look like an Acol 2 to me|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards available at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2@d shows a minimum|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is the upside that you see all the bad bids and plays of everyone else|pg||
nt|lestergold: is 4@h necessary?|pg||
nt|rich89: mmm :(|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S lead coing?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *coming?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h is enuf south has defensive values not min no reason to fear opposition game|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass was lot of pressure on E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@h i meant|pg||
nt|mamos: if East has @SQ  no rush to play Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: I imagine 4@c shows fit and good Clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d wont be what south wants to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Certainly prevented EW finding @C fit|pg||
nt|puncher: this is true and somewhat comforting for all of us watching them now! |pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@H more than enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he was impressed with his ht suit......|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  good bid by the Irish, 9 tricks even on a non-spade lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north is worth another move surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: with hearts breaking badly looks like one off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Match 2 in 1 hour and 10 minutes will feature Netherlands Juniors and Venezuela|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead seems to beat 3 NT - might be too late now|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes some sort of fit-bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Norman didn't like his hand much when he opened the bidding and he doesn't like it any more now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  david will lead the @d ace?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: Isnt the problem with 4@d that you dont feel 100% happy passing as north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that is my guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: @D2 anyone?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically u bid 3@h which will almost certainly stop west from bidding if north has shape with little defence and say 4 or 5 hearts he can complete the barrage to 4!gh if necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Would Sime have doubled 3NT holding the @sQ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pitiful:  fooled us all|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit mousy not vul|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: a heart lead beats 3NT --but no chance of finding it |pg||
nt|lestergold: ye norfth has done well knows that partner does not know about his stiff heart|pg||
pc|hA|nt|garnetts: North might even get another chance to lead ace and another heart |pg||
nt|lestergold: its called you have a PARTNER|pg||
nt|lestergold: but why has south given up with this monster|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me |pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising that South didnt up the Heart pre-empt   maybe he's old beyond his years|pg||
nt|po-s: If South had supported perhaps they might have found the scrifice|pg||
nt|mamos: most people I know over 60  would have put 4@H  on the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know what 2D mean|pg||
nt|mamos: once you get past a certain age youve gone for 1100 so many times you stop caring|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: http://tinyurl.com/4jtuxus for the results|pg||
nt|po-s: most likely 2D was multi|pg||
nt|mamos: something that includes balanced 19 counts I'd guess|pg||
nt|po-s: if only strong East would have done something other than passing over 2H|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|hT|nt|newmoon: Open Room started with the last 2 boards.  They have comparfisons... we don't|pg||
nt|kemperg: E afraid of 5@S' in W|pg||
nt|rich89: 3@s in the other table|pg||

nt|mamos: defence in control now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|puncher: good try by south to get partner in to lead the spade through - just not to be on this hand|pg||

pc|s2|nt|newmoon: more control in @C than in 2@H, yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  West might have considered 3@c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mamos: defence needed to set up Diamond trick to keep it to ten  +1  now|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|2hplus4: Vul v Not with 3 spades?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garnetts: very nicely done |pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: that was not what i meant by accurate defence|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally EW are just a bit short of 9 tricks in no-trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: im told North is a she i do not know why names are not given as Miss or mrs. or Mz so we know|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: no frills on this one from Norman|pg||

nt|garnetts: I think we are going off line again |pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|xenya: EW needed to engineer a spade ruff to beat it by several tricks, probably 3 |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: I don¬¥t agree with this bidding. a void when partner asks for aces...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|xenya: at an early stage|pg||

pc|c5|nt|lestergold: as witnessed by the fact that players who win bermida bowls are oftgen pushing 65/7074|pg||
pc|c3|mc|11|nt|xenya: he would have made 2@S if he had gone up with the king -- plying for either 3-3 in trumps or singleton 10 |pg||

nt|sybarra: we do need to find you a commentator spell checker :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: I'll do that for ya|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we all felt that was not an automatic slam to reach many experienced pairs would mess this hand up|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: last hand was a red save hand I think - 5@D was only one down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d is not textbook|pg||
nt|copeyj: I reckon Bell will overcall with the west hand next door, but we will see|pg||
nt|ady: could get too high here   |pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h looks normal now to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: Norman was just telling me this morning about a "Crouch 3@D opener" in the Spring 4s last year which went for 800 Peter - it was a significantly worse hand than this one|pg||
nt|paulg:  something to be said for 2@c by Sime|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps 1NT?|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N for me I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  or even 1@s, but I'd like a better suit|pg||
nt|puncher: i certainly don't like pass but then I don't have many green cards in my box :)|pg||
nt|puncher: 1N at least has the advantage of getting the values across|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you do have somewhere to run|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it¬¥s better to show the void on S - and N will not be happy!|pg||
nt|mamos: someone has turned the distributiononometer up|pg||
nt|ahalim: is this a goulash tournament ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: after the first match with those hungarians...|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: pedestrian 3NT looking at just e/w cards, but goes off on @DK lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not an obvious defence perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should be exciting|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: although it was non vul it's fair to say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was not suggesting i follow the rules|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it was not meant as a critisism|pg||
nt|copeyj: I know :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 5@h now|pg||
nt|copeyj: I find 3@D quite scary, but I am applying for my bus pass in 12 months time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you would be more at home in senior bridge simon|pg||
nt|cameron_1: bezerk might be a better word|pg||

mb|4H|nt|2hplus4: Cards lie well for slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not what N wanted to hear but he has an easy call -- PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: trust partner|pg||
nt|xenya: and blame him afterwards if thins go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that includes 20-22 balanced|pg||
nt|puncher: seems a shame not to be able to bid those clubs!|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Sime reads my blog, so he knows my preference|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it is East thinking here|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree that 1@S would be fine with better pips|pg||
nt|kemperg: well done E|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s very restrained for a junior|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: yes, it will go down now from either side|pg||
nt|paulg:  EW play canape, so they often often a 4-card major rather than a longer minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when it is clubs, since they don't like that suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@d is interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: with Ax you need to declare|pg||
nt|dagold: facing say Qx or Jxx|pg||
nt|xenya: turns out that E didn't like the double too much either -- probably it was a support double|pg||
nt|puncher: no difficulties for declarer here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has great hand and this vul. pard should have a good suit at least |pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s very questionable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: difficult hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: the splts are horrible|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S usually shows spades but not that many --no double or overcall then cue bid when partner balances |pg||
nt|jcomyn: the poor d suit aszgtsain|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: Sorry about this folks the internet is very poor from the venue and I think we are going down again|pg||
nt|dagold: so I would try 3N|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps Ian wants to cater for 5@c|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs to find partner with Qxx @D for 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: A little surprising  North didn't bid on first round  maybe no way to show @c  after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|mamos: very aggressive from East|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: even so, i don't understand the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: i do the bids in twos because of mouse click noises|pg||
nt|kemperg: but make's|pg||

pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: surely 4nt by w|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dagold: Interesting|pg||
nt|dagold: this may make|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like Multis that include strong and wqeak hands. Stops you preempting immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  their card is slightly confusing with different descriptions, but I think 2NT shows 20-21 balanced|pg||
nt|sybarra: beautiful faciltiy, a refurbished tennis club with still active tennis courts |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry missed that|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: and right next to the olympic stadium :)|pg||

nt|mamos: and now tooooo high|pg||
nt|sybarra: whack! |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Friendly match it is|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|newmoon: if he draws 3 trumps, then plays @Ss, South can force his last trump...   tough one|pg||
nt|cameron_1: hi|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: hi Cameron|pg||
nt|dagold: if he plays on spades first he may have more chance|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps a ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my no dbl? |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|mamos: when opponents bid too much we need to double to teach them a friendly lesson :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hJ|nt|newmoon: yes, but threat of a @C ruff then...|pg||
nt|xenya:  but S is not finished yet -- and neither is W |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: can go off now since if he plays on spades|pg||
nt|xenya: funny hand, funny auction -- but EW won't be amused |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard to know if they can have a weak two in 4th, or an immediate two in 4th seat|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 10 minor cxards|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: again not an easy hand to handle|pg||
nt|mamos: going to need that entry in the dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|puncher: The Scottish EW were in a disciplined 3@S on board 1 hence the 6 imps|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: the spade 8 confirming that hwe can ruff |pg||
nt|sybarra: N didnt get it |pg||

nt|mamos: this is a really wild board all sorts of ways to get a really horrid result|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|xenya: i have some difficulty counting the undertricks here |pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, a severe blow |pg||
nt|paulg:  discards mean that declarer can lead towards @hJ safely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dagold: good play by Norman although Espens carding showed a doubleton|pg||
nt|lestergold: thinks he has a natural heart trick but how can he hope to wenjoy that when he can see the establisheable diamonds sitting in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are not fantunes yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is simply an appaling error|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and with best defence 4@h dbl is -1100|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: -3 as a spectator suggests? |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: but landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|dagold: no 9 on the second round|pg||

nt|sybarra: when my left opp bids nt over pard's suit,  not sure worth leading  |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant rho|pg||
nt|garnetts: lightish opening bid ( and I would open this one) and a light dbl will likely get EW to 3NT |pg||
nt|dagold: would be amazed if it isn't 3N making to be honest|pg||
nt|xenya: -5?  |pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all, and take a pat on the back for being patient :)|pg||
nt|idc: I expect it will take a while to get the scores up to date (if it can be done)|pg||
nt|idc: but at least we will (fingers crossed) get to see some bridge|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would hope so|pg||
nt|sybarra: and deservedly  |pg||
nt|rich89: could be -2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wonder what coach of n/s says????|pg||
nt|mamos: and presumably the defence to 4@S could have won five or six tricks with that cross ruff|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@s might be unlucky here too|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can they bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes noticed thast|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: ???|pg||
nt|puncher: 4@S seems a likely spot|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: no, just 4 -- quite likely|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This time E has 3 tens to make up for lack of points and balanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand for south to keep quiet|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of the great defense we have seen (esp. in the Vandy) was when the pards followed each others lead in defense|pg||
nt|mamos: slam chance at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: and is back|pg||
mb|2C|nt|dagold: danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@c is a nice bid, although here 5@c might have caused major problems|pg||
nt|xenya: that score will not be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d presumably a limit raise|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate scores having been entered correctly, AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|mamos: East is not timid|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: Looks like 4@H is an ok spot here|pg||
nt|paulg:  as East can never get in, 3NT looks a better spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must admit I hate 2N openings with this shape and quality|pg||
mb|2D|nt|2hplus4: Again game making|pg||
nt|puncher: that's true|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 4@h is the normal contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  it could be lucky that you don't really have the entries for the double heart finesse|pg||
nt|paulg:  West's raise shows invitational values or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  West might take the push with a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|idc: The score from the other room was initially 6@c making, but has been changed to 6NT going -1|pg||
nt|idc: If so, Sime did very well to lead @hA, since it makes on a non-heart lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how in heavens name can w pass|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding and hand dont match|pg||
mb|3H|nt|newmoon: North contemplating his good hand:  "is there more than 4@S here?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen has done well to only bid 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i would bid 1@H as S, then pass any rebid by N|pg||
nt|mamos: would you use Stayman here?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: NO! only 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dagold: and nice double from Noramn since 5@S would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|2hplus4: This is odd.|pg||
nt|paulg:  easy double for West|pg||
nt|2hplus4: A gift for EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: I oftgen opt to open a Hearty with these hands knowing that if its passed out we are rarely missing a game|pg||
nt|kemperg: then 1 or 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: this is a peaceful one|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  did South believe that the double was takeout, by a passed vulnerable hand, rather than just diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why would S bid 3@S? Vul|pg||
nt|paulg:  or was he just competing in diamonds|pg||
nt|2hplus4: 800 or 1100 depending on where they fight it out|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like 800, more if they bid 5@d|pg||
nt|idc: undo operator - i expect this is by E-W?|pg||
nt|paulg:  As 1@s is limited, no thoughts from West of a slam despite the perfect heart holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  we can see there is not much to this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: Adam in a trance|pg||
nt|sybarra: dashing to 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: no lead that great for west - diam doesn't cost|pg||
nt|paulg:  quite a few options for declarer to consider, more with the lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: think N name is Fruscoloni|pg||
nt|lestergold: also leaves more space when there is a misfit as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Dunno, Italian names ain't my strongest point|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a @D to the Ace - and you pay 1430|pg||
nt|mamos: a MAKING Slam is about guessing DiaMONDS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me very optimistic with 4@d|pg||
nt|po-s: did 4s show a minimum?|pg||
nt|mamos: this is mean|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an excellent slasm and no asttempt|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dagold: and 800 available here|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Adam Mesbur is considering bad trump break, eliminations and entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dagold: best defence|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C an excellent contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well we all know clubs vanished as a suit many years ago|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: AND OF COURSE ABOUT wEST GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO GUESS WRONG|pg||

nt|paulg:  or not.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@S I think|pg||
nt|lestergold: overboard it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a good contract even if spade behave club also have to bhave for this to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N cant make either a scards lie|pg||
nt|mamos: oops sorry  shhh|pg||
pc|s4|nt|newmoon: maybe -4 a'la'gib|pg||
nt|xenya: that might have got us too high -- but now it's EW who seem to be overboard|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you south will come under pressure on the run of tghe clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H 2@D, 6@C and @S in NT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: soth needs to make a non commital lead on this auction eg @d|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and it is by far the most important suit in so many systems|pg||
pc|c4|nt|newmoon: yes, sorry 800|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards liem this can  make on that line but declarfer may go forthespades|pg||
nt|lestergold: good lead at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing on hearts needs that pesky T to drop which it does|pg||
nt|kemperg: On @S he is low on entry''s|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 29 c0mbined on a fairly nisfitting han d is not great for a 6n contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dagold: Norman and Espen have been rewarded with 4 imps for their nice stop in 3@c on 19|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: true|pg||

pc|h3|nt|dagold: Rosen/Jones got in the way in the other room|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: could play A and J of spades and if ducked rely on heart finesse for 12 tricks of course taht wont work here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and in fact also a little bit nervous to be in 5@h too|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: declarer playing carefully|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone suggest why it is so difficult to find a 5-4 club fit|pg||
nt|mamos: to be  fair West had excellent majors and p poor Clubs|pg||
nt|mamos: E maybe a little good for 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|nt|paulg:  and now he knows it was a boring hand|pg||
nt|puncher: board 18 a 5 imp gain to scotland when Irish stretched to a non-making 3N|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he had cashed the @sJ, then West would have been endplayed|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: she doesnt know yet the clubs are coming home |pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|rnmalik: imo after opening of NT by E, very difficult to find @C fit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: she is very lucky indeed to even have a play for this contract|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

pc|cK|nt|lestergold: well she has chucked her 12th trick away|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kemperg: 6@C -1 in OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: now she is forced to finesse spade and give up heart|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: so depending on spade finesse for contract maybe thats better odds than playing for 3 heart tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: he has seen...oh well never mind|pg||

nt|paulg:  I like to make the opponents work for +800, but defence was very simple here |pg||
nt|paulg:  you have a sinking feeling with contracts like this .. taken three failing finesses and you know that there was a winning line somewhere|pg||
nt|puncher: likely to be flat though|pg||

nt|mamos: ugly Spade position|pg||

nt|jcomyn: what would 1NT-2C-3C be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: and 13 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  There was an appeal from the Wales-Scotland match yesterday afternoon. The decision has gone in Wales' favour and has resulted in another VP for them, the final result now being 20-10 VPs to Wales.|pg||
nt|puncher: surprising pass from John |pg||
nt|paulg:  EW do play 2NT as weak with both minors ... perhaps they need better suits at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|puncher: ahh|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@h from South?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N very unlike to have singleton diamond |pg||
mb|1N|nt|puncher: although I'm beginning to learn that it's dangerous to make such predictions |pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Appeals are an unappealing part of the game. Why can't players just get on with the game|pg||
nt|puncher: 3@H enough second in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: one off|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: with splitted @d honours and @h4-1, they can defeat 5@h|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 5 vanished|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Rosen also bid 3@d but tried 3N over 3@h, probably figuring he had suggested doubt|pg||
nt|xenya: and another quiet board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|paulg:  You would just go with the Director's ruling?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: NS may overreach here with cards lying badly|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is takeout without spades, a method popular in Europe|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why have a director. Just assume the opponents are not cheating and accept what happens|pg||
nt|paulg:  this was a case of misinformation where a splinter was not alerted but said to be natural|pg||
nt|paulg:  unsurprisingly this caused the opponents not to appreciate their fit|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the lead you can afford a loser in every suit, so some may play the @hA first|pg||
nt|puncher: things could get interesting now|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c from Walker?|pg||
nt|puncher: yes at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: Espen would be able to bid if he was in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H=@S no doubt|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially when eight tricks is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Joe|pg||

nt|jcomyn: now might go overboard|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: not that 1N rates to make on this layout |pg||

nt|kemperg: X was @S I think, good bridge|pg||

nt|mamos: or Spade for that matter :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Ill stop after this one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cameron_1: pretty chunky 2N overcall not sure with two tens it was right|pg||
nt|dagold: dangerous in the middle of a live auction, mainly because partner will expect more|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@S likely shows exactly 3 cards |pg||
nt|santyclz: Pass by s shows ...|pg||
nt|xenya: safe contract :)|pg||
nt|2hplus4: I don't like playing bridge with or against Philadelphia lawyers|pg||

pc|cA|nt|2hplus4: Not a conclusion you really can draw against Short or Walker|pg||

nt|sybarra: we try to make Erwin laugh as commentators |pg||
pc|c2|nt|dagold: Should be an easy make|pg||
nt|dagold: Either ruff two hearts in dummy or set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|dagold: depending on the defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kemperg: afraid of 4-1/5-0|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u its easy for teh defence to help declarer on this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead is easy but what next?|pg||
nt|lestergold: another high heart declarer will surely duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: defence have to be extremely careful not to open @ds for example|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes the defence shd be passive|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u a @d at trick 2 works|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: Ortega, keeps leading spade honors |pg||
pc|c9|nt|dagold: ruff hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|paulg:  of course, playing 4-card majors makes it more difficult for East|pg||
nt|mamos: no  chnce for this contract with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a friendly lay out|pg||
nt|lestergold: stes up 2@d tricvks to go with 2 @hs and a @s|pg||

nt|lestergold: what was the rush hearts were likely to be continued|pg||
nt|mamos: yes @hK looks wrong at Trick 1    or 2    and defence just has enough tricks to defeat now|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 3NT was ever making realistically  |pg||
nt|lestergold: it tkaes careful defence to beat thjis if declarer ducks two rounds of hearts i|pg||
nt|ahalim: only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: more to the point defence have 6 tricks to come now altogether|pg||
pc|h4|nt|puncher: yes 4@C was enough to not allow them to untangle their best spot|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: bd 2 paid off for the dutch kids |pg||

nt|jwit: West could have been squeezed for another trick if declarer cashed hearts first ending in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: And yet another fairly flat board|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: easy 10 tricks for e/w in 3NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ritong: 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: whoa|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i suspect some misclick|pg||
nt|ady: can make more if spades not led     but may go wrong in club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: I do too, however she bid 4NT|pg||
nt|jwit: Very aggressive 4NT by East, though I don't know what range is for 2NT|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ady: if declarer plays on clubs   north should contribute the 10 2nd round|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: if they make exactly ten, they should score 631  accuracy bonus|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: will likely make 11 tricks as cannot afford the club finesse|pg||

nt|paulg:  unfortunately the crash meant that our operator could not catch up with the play|pg||
nt|paulg:  not Alan's fault of course, but unfortunate on an interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Operation misfit :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only 8 tricks at that point but defence is under a lot of pressure omn the run of spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but what shall W return when only minors left?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compliments to the players, they are playing at a fast pace:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Nederste linje med bl. a. gr√∏nne firkanter, ses kun halvt. Kan jeg rykke noget|pg||
mb|2D|nt|paulg:  Fight between North and East here|pg||
nt|paulg:  NS may bid 4@s if Matheson supports in competition|pg||
nt|lestergold: what do u do with 8 spades vul but only one high card and not in spaxdes?|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   this is where I have results |pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: E would like to look for @H fit and play in 3@C Can he achieve that?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|newmoon: If NT here, and a @H lead... is the timing out now?|pg||
nt|paulg:  upgrade from Walker, nice intermediates|pg||
nt|puncher: an unlikely 6@D here|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be fun |pg||
nt|lestergold: i would open 3@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have jammed them up a bid  now a free ride really |pg||
nt|mamos: i prefer to bid my Spades|pg||
nt|mamos: 21-19 points   for this one looks less exciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry guys, I'm almost faling asleep with the speed at this table|pg||
nt|mamos: did North really pass??? surely 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|2hplus4: Obviously not|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think most cannot do that these days, playing 2@c.... 3@c as game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think most british players i know would if pard say bids 3n u can play 4@s with confidence|pg||
nt|sybarra: or use:  http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/index.html   Competitie (left), then White House Juniors 2011 for results|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: bold but sensible double|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, in that case n-s weren't robbed.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3@c shows a fit so Short might be tempted to bid on|pg||
nt|paulg:  i was thinking more of getting to the better game|pg||
nt|paulg:  which is probably 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sime will just bid 4@s now|pg||
nt|paulg:  and East will be on the spot ... and the one thinking now|pg||
nt|mamos: looks a very ordinary 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  but West's pass is deafening|pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: Excellent grand slam in a balck suit here as long as they promise not to lead diamonds :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd prefer to double with the North hand rather than introduce that club suit, although it would complicate things later on|pg||
nt|paulg:  South a little fixed now and may just raise to 4@c|pg||
nt|puncher: hand for the bad 2N for south - to show a minimum opener with 6 diams|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think 3@h is likely with nothing in hearts when his partner has failed to double|pg||
nt|sybarra: you might miss 4 @H though Mike?|pg||
nt|mamos: op????|pg||
nt|mamos: undoo??|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh thats better|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: South checking cards re the club bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: internet problems at hotel folks, sorry for breaks|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 3@s it might not have been very easy for e/wto reach this meakeable game|pg||
nt|mamos: NORTH 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzc: rewiring tomorrow morning so should be back to normal|pg||
nt|dagold: unlikely heart lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: 9 tricks only, it seems on a @H lead, else 11|pg||
nt|dagold: looks like a bidding missunderstanding |pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 3N showed or was thought to show 4/4 M or something?|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops|pg||
nt|dagold: anyway another 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|mamos: or Imight misss a nice safe Spade part-score|pg||
nt|mamos: noooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: East will be relieved that west has four small hearts |pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@C puppet?|pg||
nt|newmoon: even so, 3N T a sign-off|pg||
nt|dagold: have seen 3N played as 4/4 majors|pg||
nt|dagold: in that structure 3@h= spades or no major|pg||
nt|newmoon: if 3@D = 1 or both 4xmajor, 4@D would ask for 4M|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT could be 3=3-4-3 hand|pg||
nt|dagold: 5 more imps to England on 21 for 620 to NI and 800 to England|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Not sure of the wisdom of that|pg||
nt|paulg:  if the clubs were breaking then it would need accurate defence to beat 3NT, but when they are 3-1 Walker does not have the tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm guessing our operator lost the play with the crash of the connection, always difficult in these circumstances|pg||
nt|2hplus4: What causes all these crashes?|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Poor phone connection?|pg||
nt|paulg:  You can imagine that everyone except Short taking their time on this hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  It will be the wifi in the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  the problems this weekend have all been in the closed room|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that should be a consideration in future when considering venues|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect the signal strength is not great in that area of the hotel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Part of the problem is the devolved nature of the adminstrators|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bridge Great Britain relies on the home unions|pg||
nt|paulg:  The home union typically asks a district to run the event|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Yes but surely an audience of over 1000 should be considered|pg||
nt|paulg:  and each district ends up running an event every seven or eight years, so never has the experience|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Why not write it down and pass on the experience gained?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Because there is no-one co-ordinating it all|pg||
nt|2hplus4: So all bridge in Britain is as badly run as the SBU?|pg||
nt|paulg:  he does not need two diamond finesses, but has the entries for them anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: matheson says should be stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: but if I bid spades, I would then bid hts|pg||
nt|sybarra: if bidding the same |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i do not like this 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: hello everyone|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|garnetts: just claims 11 |pg||
nt|xenya: a contract to my taste|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: variation of standards with overcalls e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  might bid 6@c now|pg||
nt|mamos: EW more likely to make game in Spades than Hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: you have two suits with all ur points in them as well|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: not 100% about the bidding, just took over|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Does this auction call for the lead of the highest card in your hand?  Lindsay doesn't think so.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@d is probably keycard blackwood (kickback)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulg:  with 4NT showing 2 keycards and no @cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i must admit that I thought this was the stronger form of weak raise|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 or 10 tricks looks likely here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: sime gave adam stronger version|pg||
pc|s6|nt|puncher: seems I've missed some excitement!|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S Q saves the contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dagold: this is ok on careful play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: That is the problem with 3@C |pg||
nt|puncher: the dodgy connections are infectious|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short knows that it is on the club finesse, but his club intermediates are good.|pg||
nt|paulg:  the cards are very friendly and every chance of a gain|pg||
nt|paulg:  but eleven tricks nevertheless|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|puncher: this will be a fortunate make for scotland but we've all been in worse :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: I think South might have just bid 5@C over 3@C since it would be a picture raise|pg||
nt|garnetts: Since the clubs break maybe lose 2 imps to 4@S making five |pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps not everyone, but we certainly have|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes: Sweden v Norway|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @s8 and W will make|pg||
nt|ahalim: can make now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: not now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|ady: maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 2 club tricks and 2 diamonds from now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oops|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 (or even 12?) available here -- but EW could hardly achieve that  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: frankly, i don't see what he was trying to achieve with that lead -- remember that E had shown at least 4 spades |pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: actually 5 clubhs a heasrt 2 @s and a @d is enuf|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  3 @c tricks|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Ireland 161; Eng 160; Scot 153; WBU 152; NI 103|pg||
nt|lestergold: open 3@s and arent e/w pretty stuiffed up|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|newmoon: interesting would been a @C back after ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so, in a sense, they did quite well|pg||
nt|mamos: that was odd|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe my prediction of 9 was a little double dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  it is always easier when you see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|newmoon: and another @D|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Perhaps he was thinking that west had needed a @S stop and was hoping for 4441 @s distribution.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c6|nt|puncher: Short feeling happier now|pg||

nt|paulg:  Sime will be surprised by the 1@h bid on his right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D opening in OR was enough|pg||
nt|mamos: a part-score "steal" for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and also by a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|wendle: open room of Match 5C will remain open to announce official result (also available at www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he can double this for penalty|pg||
nt|puncher: are they 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes|pg||
nt|mamos: Im not a scientific bidder  so I'd justt smack6@c on the table if I was West|pg||
nt|mamos: NS have  big hands again    with just two diamond losers but 5@S may be too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: no might about it|pg||

nt|vugraphzzc: hi all, severe problems with internet at hotel|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: working hard to get all tables up and running|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry you had to deal with all that|pg||
nt|xenya: apparently the 2@H opening shows a weak hand with both majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: put it another way god didnt deal me 8 in the master suit to pass|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - so far South¬¥s risky bid has been a help for opps|pg||
nt|sybarra: slam in the offing? |pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid game?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: Undo?  (Ihope)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid the slam because Walker showed a huge club raise in the context of passing over 2@h|pg||
nt|puncher: But unfortunately looks like 4@H made on board 5 in the other room - it was a spade lead and then a club switch|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Short expected a bit more?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i would say it would be a good effort to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: or as Roland says:  "What do you call an 8 card suit?"   (Trumps!)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S transfer I assume |pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - West bid 2 @S...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not depends on agreements,  I play 2 nt as honor 3rd or better|pg||
nt|sybarra: *and now|pg||
nt|mamos: often shows a Club honour  depends  on agreements|pg||
nt|mamos: it seems bizarre to bid on flat 10s and not bid on all that stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: now what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: seems she will bid something|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@h? 2@d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but if she dos will it showe some support for s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i vote for D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rich89: xx??|pg||
nt|lestergold: Well i must admit that this mixed hungarian partenrship is making goulash of the italian pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: lets try it one more time|pg||
nt|garnetts: why not |pg||
nt|puncher: but he can't have much more for passing over 2@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe XX is honor x,  (kx, qx or some such?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: Don't make me laugh out loud, the players won't appreciate that :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs set as trumps already |pg||
nt|sybarra: cue bids coming up |pg||
nt|mamos: East wont like his soft cards in the majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may hear 3 @H p 3 @S |pg||
nt|hawe45: But he will like @D K-Q|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: you can always point to pc and say "silly commentators"  telling jokes|pg||
nt|lestergold: the e/w pair would if they knew why u were laughing|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is this redouble meant to mean?|pg||
nt|ahalim: they may get too high|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now 3D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is not alerting, south is alerting bother 2@D and 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: yay   well passed|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised Matheson did not bid 3@s (or even 4@s)|pg||
nt|mamos: ah perhaps 2@D was transfer?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is one transferring and the other not|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I believe N was bidding naturally|pg||
nt|mamos: in thart case  North will jump to 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  for my money north might have bid 3@s then bid 4@h next but maybe they would not be on firm ground|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@h is much better by south|pg||
nt|idc: last time we saw a hand, Scotland gained 14 for bidding a different slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  5th club, @d10, @sQ?|pg||
nt|puncher: board 5 played the other way up which made things easier for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: nice fitting hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: hate 3@D and the second double |pg||
nt|xenya: 4N --quantitative -- looks reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Right sided.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think the redouble is honor and one  |pg||
nt|lestergold: means i like the sound of my own voice|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the @S suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told I am correct as to the redble |pg||
nt|sybarra: by someone who should know, like the coach  |pg||
nt|lestergold: is it not somewhat ambiguous in such an auction might allow pard to think that yhou actually had ur overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: North must have seen her partner's bidding before|pg||
nt|mamos: or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north is now waving her hand over 2@D and 2@H a bit and smiling |pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is clearly con fusion here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|puncher: Possibly so if they don't play bad 2N|pg||
nt|sybarra: good sac????? |pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was right south did think pard had his overcall|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeah|pg||
nt|lestergold: good sac against the 4@h they were never bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: acyually 4@h is off in any case|pg||
pc|h3|nt|idc: on Bd 21 - not a great slam at all but as the cards lay it was more successful|pg||
nt|puncher: my dodgy connection is proving a little tiresome|pg||
pc|hA|nt|puncher: With a bad 2N available they could have shown a 5/5 shape in the minors - 2N would be artificial showing 5/5 in minors or 6 diams - both minimum openers|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Walker now|pg||
nt|puncher: Open room in 4@S on the previous 6@C board so a gain for Scotland - looks like this is not to be a flat match|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short encouraged in clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: yes this is not easy|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: serious 3 nt?  do "we" play  that?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: it takes a spade lead to beat the slam |pg||
nt|garnetts: well it could be worth someone might have doubled this--strong case for east to |pg||
nt|garnetts: worse not worth :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: to beat 4@h spade spade cah K@d and play third spade|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think, that 3 NT from East was a bad bid - why not just 4 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D by E?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - or 4 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont like 3 nt either |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 4 @D |pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not yet|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  but he is still going to make this I think, West will have to concede a heart or spade|pg||
nt|puncher: Carroll opened 3@H after all so board 22 looks to be flat|pg||
nt|paulg:  with spades 3-3 I think you need to get a heart ruff to beat 4@s on this hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||

mb|d|nt|april7: EW might reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or 1@s....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|april7: only if W reopens ofcourse, but with 8 P ? but its possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Credit the miss to the lack of limits on the opening bid?|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm not saying that 6N was ideal on that hand, but it may well be bid in the other room|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was first hand in the open room |pg||
nt|sybarra: all speculation was wildness|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland I think you were commenting there |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: looking for an adverse save |pg||
nt|sybarra: red v white saves not often best|pg||
nt|garnetts: loses a couple of imps|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if I like the 2NT bid or not |pg||
nt|dagold: they work ok with 6-4 in the majors if not too heavy a hand since opps tend to have wrong shape to make t/o double|pg||
nt|newmoon: and reserve 2@D for gabrage weak 2's|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hard for us to believe that Walker-Short could play too quickly for the operator :)|pg||
nt|rich89: x better than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: well had the italians been doing this to the hyngarians i could have said made spaghetti of them but today no pasta for lunch i'm afraid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dagold: with short majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  Must have been declarer|pg||
nt|puncher: depends what they had for lunch|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is limited to 16 points|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D a ht raise of some sort|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a good raise   |pg||
nt|mamos: better be a good raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: partnership tester - is the West hand (which of course has not yet passed) a reasonable take-out?|pg||
nt|april7: perhaps the vulnerability kept W from not bidding, but to play at 1 level, only with opps.suit in hand,I would have X|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H looks mysterious but hopefully W knows what he is doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I must say,  the lady (east) at the table is NOT bashful |pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: ...rbage|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this makes with the 3-3 @D split with the jack onside so no guess|pg||
nt|idc: Result from other room just in - 3NT -1 by East|pg||
nt|paulg:  A much easier hand for Matheson to bid when his partner has already passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: can u arrange an intro in that case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not be a success I am afraid |pg||
nt|kemperg: some points for Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: N led the @sA, no director called'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sweden v Norway next, in about 25 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@D transfers contract back to south|pg||
nt|puncher: 2@S seems a little conservative but north is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: I play it that way,  (not sure the world does)  but that means 2 @H is 13 cards and 3 hts |pg||
nt|sybarra: saved by N |pg||
nt|mamos: saved by North|pg||
pc|h2|nt|puncher: what would you do if partner wasn't a passed hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I should just use copy/paste |pg||
nt|mamos: Hearts or herats  didnt make much of a showing there|pg||
pc|h6|nt|puncher: 3N looking like a normal spot but the poor @D break kills it|pg||
nt|paulg:  @hA and club switch will keep it to nine tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically about 50% contract|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must be careful now!|pg||
nt|lestergold: so cannot criticise|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW playing Blue Club, so 2@s only promised five|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double or the t51d bid Shirley?|pg||

nt|idc: Bad Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: man up as we say!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dagold: traditional advice was not to preemtp with side 4-card major|pg||
nt|dagold: nowadays players like to get in on as many hands as possible|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like the same story as on the previous hand -- this time EW didn't realise they were too weak for 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: There seems to have been a difference of opinion on how strong a x of 1nt was.  |pg||
nt|santyclz: If w had a raise of 2@s e surely had a pass.|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that it really did not matter what happened in that thin 3NT|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|paulg:  as the club slam attempted in the other room was less than thin|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Difficult for eitrher to come in|pg||
nt|paulg:  Only going to happen if East opens|pg||
nt|puncher: other way round surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am cheap, just diet coke|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahalim: that means a @D from W and a @H back|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh he doesnt kn ow |pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing not even 3h|pg||
nt|mamos: low scoring match so far|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|2hplus4: Needed to lead @CK to beat this.|pg||
nt|puncher: unlucky but a flat board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: though W's 3@S perhpas looks a bit odd|pg||
nt|santyclz: I have  problems with all the e-w bids after the x, but see more excuse for 2@s than either of the later bids.|pg||
nt|xenya: he is about minimum for his double|pg||
nt|vugraphzzc: E has already shown values by not taking out X of 1NT, so when he bids 2S instead of doubling 2H it sounds stronger than it is|pg||
pc|d2|nt|idc: Declarer can turn to spades when they dicover the bad @d break, but that only makes 8 tricks before the defence set up 5|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes although boards look swingy|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you would imagine more competition from juniors|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dagold: but 2@h is a slight gamble|pg||

nt|sybarra: long gone Erwin|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dagold: and definitely my style too|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm impressed by the easiness of EW's auction -- looking at their hands, slam has some chance |pg||
nt|paulg:  South can suggest doubleton heart because his partner knows he cannot have doubleton|pg||
nt|puncher: does N have to avoid playing a club now to stop declarer shortening his trumps?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  1@d was not alerted but showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but should have seen the danger of a heart loser disappearing up the swanee|pg||
nt|po-s: bad techniqu in trumps - if all four in West|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mamos: maybe ducking Trick 1 better |pg||

pc|cQ|nt|peachy: an aggressive first weak two (if 2H were weak two) might possibly have changed this hand destiny|pg||
nt|idc: I like that @sQ play - on the bidding declarer cannot have 3 spades, since they never supported the suit|pg||

nt|lestergold: does than bot tend to deny a high honopur in most cases|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you know what they lead from K87?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|newmoon: thx :)|pg||
nt|xenya: N didn't throw a spade of course|pg||
nt|puncher: I guess you are better at predicting than me :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  possibly not, i don't think there are any invitational bids in any part of my system|pg||
nt|sybarra: with that a Our special thanks to Roland who "herds the cats" called  commentators.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  4@h again |pg||
nt|puncher: as a rookie commentator I need to learn to reign in my predictions|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont but ive never heard of second highest from an honour|pg||
nt|tomi2: they lead the 8 but Weyand leads another suit with that holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so they shouold change their methods|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: multi from east|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to get to 4@H   |pg||
nt|xenya: what is N to do now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undaunted...|pg||
nt|xenya: yes :)|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2@S if weak ( and what else could it be?) looks almost perfect|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember we are the "speed" table|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They actually do lead the 8 from that holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: most invitational bids are just transfers anyway at teams :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|newmoon: South never passes, playing Junior bridge|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps a major suit struggle this time?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think EW will bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: but then if he ism playing pard for that why lead a trump as theen pard cant have the A@d and the @ds can providfe discards for heart losers|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be the same problem if they lead 3rd and he plays the 7...|pg||
nt|po-s: cute hand - both sides make 3NT if on lead|pg||
nt|mamos: now less likely to play hopeless NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime decides the anaemic distribution is not worth searching for a thin game|pg||
nt|paulg:  rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: when i see that @d holding in dummy i think we need to get busy Roland|pg||
nt|lestergold: not play a passive trump back|pg||
mb|4N|nt|xenya: pass is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt looks like minors, others might use it as a xfer to 3@c (lebensohl-ish).|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|santyclz: The response makes the xfer more likely.|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully E didn't intend it as the minors|pg||
nt|paulg:  the England team won the Premier League on a split tie after an appeal, you could see them repeating that today!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|idc: WIth South holding a 15 count, passed out in other room looks a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|idc: we will check|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C  looks a bit ambitious and has no hope with the bad break|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone think E should pass instead of 1D|pg||
mb|5H|nt|yuval10: hi Mike|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is an IMP event|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 4@D is "pick-a-major" - he can't underwrite game, but any kind of fit will produce a reasonable play|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're probably joining somewhere in the middle of this tournement|pg||
nt|xenya: he did not|pg||
nt|puncher: sticky cards perhaps|pg||
nt|puncher: not the most exciting of boards at this stage of the weekend... |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Major suits are for children, Jim|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at that dummy and @dJ87   not so easy to play back @d  |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im toldf that 8 9s the standard lead in poland from K87 |pg||
mb|6C|nt|xenya: still a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its amazing how juniors can create swings on almost every deal when we arf used to three hands in four being as flat as pancakes normally|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher: a lot more flat boards in this half of the last match - I guess Wales must be quite relieved by the lack of potential swingy hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Carroll/Hanlon play 14-16 1NT, so they will be in 1NT too|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen miracles before in this match |pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: even 4@S was ok here, as it happens|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4@H I meant|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont mind 1@d   |pg||
nt|jcomyn: then very difficult to stay out of slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|newmoon: playing check-back, 3@D would deny 4@H AND 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe not|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks if "we" can find them |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  test hearts, claim|pg||
nt|puncher: It's certainly going to be close - quite exciting and some swingy boards to keep us all awake in the last match of the weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as the top three are playing the bottom three ...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Hmmm.  BBO|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Well 4@H had good chances and 3@S makes|pg||
nt|sybarra: friendly lay out   (no IF) |pg||
pc|hA|nt|newmoon: then show 3@S before 4@H, in their way|pg||
nt|sybarra: q and I think she was home |pg||
nt|sybarra: no?|pg||
nt|kemperg: !Q better, but home?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D pitches |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt say no hope mike|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: got  10 now    probably thats all|pg||
nt|xenya: particularly if they freely preempt with hands like S's|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg:  when none of the bottom three want to get beat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: spades 3/3 helps a big bunch|pg||
nt|mamos: indeed maybe overtrick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Thanks Erwin and all commentators|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i find it hard to believe that fantunes would have let thru that contract for example|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: even vulnerable|pg||
nt|puncher: perhaps there's some excitment still to come... |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but can you fix the oesers?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: just kicked me out.   Was it something I said?|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: cash some winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: Hop is saying "what is going on??"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: he wanted to bid game quickly and avoid intervention, he figured out slam against a passed hand Partner will be tough |pg||
pc|cK|nt|kemperg: losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: back in 15 minutes with Sweden v Norway|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|newmoon: will be a quick claim after 2nd trump|pg||
nt|mamos: and now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: needed a balcony finesse|pg||
mc|11|nt|sybarra: his name is Gerband right?|pg||
nt|mamos: defence have found his winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: its Gerbrand |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, Gerbrand it is :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry misspelled it at first|pg||
nt|mamos: great stuff|pg||
nt|mamos: really enjoyed|pg||
nt|mamos: out to teacxh beginners tonight|pg||
nt|mamos: I know I know|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh that it. thanks all|pg||
