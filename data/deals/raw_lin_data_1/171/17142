nt|kemperg: 54, he had a try|pg||
nt|viren169: Interesting what you should break to on the last hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: AH|pg||
nt|jcomyn: slam?|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl well understood|pg||
nt|mamos: not quite sure if that really happened but NS certainly not optimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzag: N ducked @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: great distributional hands now...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a winner here|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect we get beyond 3N pretty quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: up to it already!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: Anothet nice board|pg||
nt|kemperg: know that from Ivanhoe|pg||
nt|mamos: though these 3NT contracts are not that easy  - it did just seem as if NS didnt really think a great deal about the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S wont bid Vul|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there is a COMYN room in the Louvre|pg||
nt|jbgood: some play 1 @h - 1 @s - 3 NT as a good hand and 3-6 in majors|pg||
nt|kemperg: it were 9 tricks after the 3d@H|pg||
nt|peachy: a light third seater opener is possible, if partnership employs that tactic|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|sharkey: Respect for the colors...|pg||
nt|viren169: QJx of @C are gold dust for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Fast claim at 9 tricks I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yoiu dont fancy anything here|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose 2@D is some kind of heart raise|pg||
nt|kemperg: I prefer 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
nt|mamos: yes |pg||
mb|2H|nt|kemperg: my wife would like to go and see so perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe also show that he did not have much defence|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H04@S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: slam now in H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: good contract, 6@D makeble|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is not too great an auction with 6@d throw against the wall|pg||
nt|jbgood: more common with Gazzili...|pg||
nt|kemperg: wouldnot like that|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings after round 8|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is will make 6 on this lead |pg||
nt|jcomyn: this might lead to 7|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1up|pg||
nt|peachy: They of course leave this alone, W has trumps, plus the auction did not indicate they necessarily have a fit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|jbgood: grand slam in hearts actually...|pg||
nt|jbgood: and the cue passed out...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: heavens to betsy surely h the agreed suit|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump was better|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kemperg: yes with @C A onside|pg||
pc|h6|nt|viren169: Not sure of E/W methods but 3N looks like an undisplined bid to me.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lestergold: they are in a fiorcing sequence what is wrong with south bidding 3@h to give north a chance to complet his hand description|pg||
nt|mamos: rehi |pg||
nt|mamos: gosh they play fast|pg||
nt|peachy: Shah prob will start trumps now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kemperg: what''s he hoping for?|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer making the defenders suffer a little|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: that makes it easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tempo lost? 9?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: and not wirh@S start|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: even A@c offside there are 12 tricks with one spade ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|mamos: It was in third Gad  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since NS have all outside Aces and Kings defending is not difficult and wont make more than 9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|viren169: True...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|the saint: I think I prefer a double from Tommy rather than 3N - keeps all options open|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: looks like only 7 tricks and a big swing for Japan|pg||
nt|hedyg: why no @H bid by anybody?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: or maybe 3@d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is not like he has something to protect in his hand|pg||
nt|the saint: Another reason why X is better. Can always bid 3N as a last resort|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||

nt|hedyg: the pass by S did not deny 4@hs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: i lost track, sorry|pg||
nt|the saint: The English juniors have been programmed to be sound with their two level overcalls. Never really a chance of EW coming in next door|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@c was gf, why not show his hand?|pg||

nt|lestergold: ten in the reds A@s plus spade ruff doesnt matter about position of@c A|pg||

nt|viren169: If N/S doubles... Pd may (should) pull it.|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no shortage of slams today but bidding not the best|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: I play 3 NT 3. & 4. is "think I can make it" - pd shudnt decide or pull.  |pg||
nt|viren169: 3N here for N/S|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Arifin|pg||
nt|mamos: 20-20|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|lestergold: who is tallking about no trumps|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was a suit slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: a @d slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry former remark was for a spec|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: We don''\t know those in Holland :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still not easy to get to 4H|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@h or 1@s?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lestergold: ok|pg||
nt|chick: I would think 2@H by E a reasonable bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Yes... good agreement to have for 3rd and 4th postition|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes provided it is forcing|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we see NS by a good fight?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kemperg: often it is not|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: we often see on those types of hands a lazy 3n bid ending the auction not just at junior level i might add|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: looks as if they play compulsary double raise with 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: As long as pds in agreement..|pg||
nt|kemperg: I play 2@D = @H and 2@H= @D|pg||
nt|mamos: wow|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a Wald hand also? May we see 4 in a major?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Yokoi will have enough to go|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: Looks like a coffee hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: mine is milk and 2 sugars thks!|pg||
nt|kemperg: works well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: transfers usually do|pg||
nt|kemperg: use them a lot|pg||
nt|ahalim: 3NT better from W imo|pg||
nt|mamos: confidently bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: transfers are useful for weak hands, but not that valuable when both sides have equal points|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting methods to get to 3 clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but landed on feet|pg||
nt|kemperg: I need at least 12 and 12 of them|pg||
nt|kemperg: disagree on that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahalim: @H 3-3, @DK onside, friendly for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes should makje in comfort|pg||
nt|chick: when the distribution of one hand is revealed, it can be better to keep the other one as the concealed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: NS use upside down signals|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: and maybe even "right sided" it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: committed to slam now but......|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yep|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: of course we can see the h suit declarer cant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: options not too many |pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed, esp. after the 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think he has to depend on the h suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: or that 3@s shows a minimum  hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|jbgood: the compulsary jump raise backfired indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: Trumps sit favorably for declarer, he doesn't know it yet though like we do|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S will give a problem|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|viren169: Declarer will soon perk up a bit when they find out about the diamond position.|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: why not 2@C as 1@C means at least 3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and dats dat|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|viren169: not sure about the J though!|pg||
nt|sharkey: it's perking - pls bide your time :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|viren169: now need to duck the @C and play spade to the Q|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: Opps - S is making this interesting?|pg||
nt|kemperg: risky|pg||
nt|mamos: South only has eight tricks I think|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like on the right road to recovery!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think this is a "club system" |pg||
nt|viren169: East needs to win and switch to a heart!|pg||
nt|mamos: well done by South|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: that wasnt the smartest play|pg||
nt|kemperg: now he''s in trouble|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: he could not believe all the cards in S|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: polish club off course for NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: play of hand likemshelling peas|pg||
nt|kemperg: had already 9|pg||
nt|mamos: sigh|pg||
nt|mamos: West must know what he will do when a trump is lead  - important to give declarer a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: West might have done better to anticipate the h lead and duck smoothly. Think about it before it actually is led|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: @H back wud have been better|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|jcomyn: alright sin sin thats irisah|pg||
nt|rodal f: Anyway I belive u would play for the % I belive. No other signals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Not a good hand for weak NT!|pg||
nt|kemperg: 54@S was playable, 53 problems, good decision to open 1@H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6 clubs anyone?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: can make slam in  3 suits - rather un usual|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: tuff rebid for west|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pronounced shin shin|pg||
nt|peachy: These are young players so it is normal to not have acquired all the good expert habits yet :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I agree that declarer should get it right but we all have gone off in contracts we should have made|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: can he handle it ?|pg||
nt|viren169: nicely avoided...|pg||
nt|hedyg: @ss not good enough for 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-3 h fit plays well|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: East wont Pass.... after x|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Agree by Mike as with Raija:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Prevents NS bidding 3N|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: Pd is there to put you back in the hole!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may Pass...?|pg||
nt|ahalim: even in NT :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true|pg||
nt|rodal f: But was that %:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: and grand in two|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok so 3NT is code|pg||
nt|kemperg: but what code|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 3NT shows 6@s, says west|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: is 2@C  a suit do we know or just art gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Dennis|pg||
nt|mamos: yes its a "confident" overcall and it will stop opponents bidding 3NT   whether it was wise is another issue|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: its a good contracft but a trump lead with this 4/0 break could run into difiiculties|pg||
nt|lestergold: cannot enjoy the K@s|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold 3@C dbled to 3 tricks!|pg||
nt|chick: but a grand relies on 2 finesses, so it's not exactly a good bet|pg||
nt|jcomyn: prefer 2NT here|pg||
nt|mamos: well South knows that they are in the slam zone |pg||
nt|mamos: some work again for the ninth trick but declarer in control|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|lestergold: oh well certainly wont handle that|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy for East to read it...|pg||
nt|mamos: it looks like it makes as well|pg||
nt|peachy: good lead though to no avail, |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west asks about the DBL. South telling it just shows points|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: well |pg||
nt|kemperg: only 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: still not good|pg||
nt|mamos: so Im not sure 4@h is wise |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: convention card doesn't say 2@c is relay, so natural presumably|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks horribly nf|pg||
nt|kemperg: play the @Ssuit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: I know it sounds ridiculous to suggest Pass with Wests hand but unless E has a long Major game is probably not making|pg||
nt|viren169: true|pg||
nt|jcomyn: WOW|pg||
nt|chick: I guess 4@H was forcing :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: surprisse mee|pg||
nt|ahalim: there you are|pg||
nt|mamos: there must be something about this auction we dont know|pg||
nt|chick: ya, like a @D void? :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a junior bid if i ever saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: north bid 7@c, but now he has taken it back and thinking again|pg||
nt|mamos: lol  and who let him take it back ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east joking and replacing south's 4@h with 5@h|pg||
nt|chick: hmmm are juniors allowed to take bids back?|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice try by S - but to no avail|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   not my choice of lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard layout but @H helps.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a good day 7@c rolls in|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs 3/2 spade break and clubs 3/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not blame him really |pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a fair spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho perhaps grand slams requiring good breaks in two suits are a little dangerous|pg||
nt|viren169: Meanwhile this wont be a walk in the park!|pg||
nt|sharkey: W has 26 HCP; S opens and N bids - unless there are 60 HCP in this deck pd is blank !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks, but S will have a heavy time|pg||
nt|viren169: not the best start for defence but @Cs have been bid and supported!|pg||
nt|sharkey: North's 3@C not a thing of beaty either..... youthful exhuberance I suspect|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an even bigger WOW|pg||
nt|chick: lol  the joke's on North when 7@C makes :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South's 4@H  was  .........  unwise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: I think N's 3NT took up too much room|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i knew how he found the @d lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: may have been the NTTT rule |pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: (Next To The Thumb)|pg||
nt|hedyg: nearer to the thumb?|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL ok|pg||

nt|jbgood: that rule was, is and will always be a joke, Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or as a nice young lady said to me - we play the eenie-meeni-miny-mo lead system|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|kemperg: E should not be unhappy with that lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: 7@c much too good for roland at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: actgually 3/1 in trumps and spades 4/1 still works does it not|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of table will be in 7 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its a good 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 6 on this layout looks doomed|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think "we" are recounting our tricks|pg||
nt|ahalim: i bet N can't sleep tonight|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C was your joke Dennis?|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C by South wouldn't have been so crazy |pg||

nt|sharkey: or is 4@D cue?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: not first time at least...|pg||
nt|viren169: A/K or Qxx are useful holding|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT by N shud show additional values I think - if N evaluates this way|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect they will reach 6@H now. Both N/S are bidding the spots of the cards!|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@H is enough now... however I cant see South passing|pg||
nt|sharkey: Neither side have underbid previously this match so no reason to change now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt N bid 5@H without @HK?|pg||
nt|viren169: West may tap it on the way out  holding AQ of @d|pg||
nt|viren169: North has shown the whole of their hand with dble of 1@S|pg||

nt|rodal f: Reverce to come|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: I am surprised E sat silently |pg||
nt|lestergold: all on the hearts thisn contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to q of ht lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead may well be the key factor|pg||
nt|lestergold: aheart lead will give the game away|pg||
nt|kemperg: All the dutch open 2@S at E|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont tell me east at these colours is in the tank|pg||
nt|sybarra: a muderberg bid  showing 5 @S and 4+ minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes and with 5-6 they will|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still a possible swing:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: talk about backing into the auction!|pg||
nt|viren169: nice hand for 4@H or 5@C here|pg||
nt|peachy: very nice, so far|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: after he started thinking,  maybe felt he had to bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: more dangerous then the 2@S opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: east writing something to north about his 3@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: im,agine 3 slams in a row|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: dont like 3h|pg||
nt|hedyg: agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 3nt even less|pg||
nt|hedyg: Qx and Qxx overvalued|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@C lead would have done a better job here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: note probably says "I forgot to open" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and send 3nt into orbit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mamos: getting home in 3nT too|pg||
nt|viren169: Not easy to stop in 3N|pg||
nt|viren169: but was a good try...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Slam try but where is the @H?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kemperg: lol|pg||
nt|lestergold: well that isa junior bid|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H not pretty but will come home on most lines|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@S down on @H lead, 4@H also down|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: naw 6h not on|pg||
nt|rodal f: One A |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D was correct, 4@H would not tell the strength|pg||
nt|mamos: not so keen on /wood with a void|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|mamos: yes I like 4@d|pg||
nt|peachy: 4H wouold have shown the shape, strength was already given|pg||
nt|peachy: but I still like 4D to avoid stopping at 4H|pg||
nt|rodal f: Liked it to Germ. System agreements.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mamos: might have been easier to start with Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Declarer will win and should play 3 round of hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: Now Ax of @S will defeat this contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: strength for game, not this bulk|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps easier, but 2D is the correct bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|kemperg: @D requiered|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: partner has made a simple ovefcall and you have a misfitting hand with square root of very few playing tricks and stick neck out deserve the guilotine|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|sybarra: he didnt lead from qxx did he?|pg||

nt|mamos: yes  not very exciting this one   unless .....|pg||
nt|kemperg: on 24 in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: a super light opening 3rd in hand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: specs tell me they lead 2nd|pg||
nt|kemperg: and made|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but the d suit will never surface|pg||
nt|mamos: EW had better not get too enthuisiastic in Clubs 3@C alrerady too high|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   head in the lions mouth|pg||
nt|kemperg: N had other idees about the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: Not sure you have to alert 3rd in hand openings nowadays?!?!|pg||
nt|viren169: Mike, any comment?|pg||
nt|kemperg: E had his colours bid:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: and S decided that he wouldnt support hearts higher than the 2 level|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe he was right|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh    now West has made an assumption|pg||
nt|mamos: which will turn out to be false|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@C would have been majors?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|kemperg: will end in 5@S|pg||
nt|mamos: North getting a bit carried away here    presumably 1NT 12-14 ?  or is it 15-17?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will it? I wonder|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffe hand at last|pg||
nt|hedyg: with what?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to get busy in h|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: no double, no trouble.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: No  no need to alert  in England nor in Europe|pg||
nt|viren169: thks|pg||
nt|rodal f: Shold W check E's hand a bit better by a X?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|lestergold: could u find a duller hand than this?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean 3@H with what?|pg||
nt|kemperg: could have been expensive|pg||
nt|hedyg: you either have the bid or you dont. he would not have bid it without the 2@s bid, why should he bid it now?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: 3@C looks normal over 2@S by North to me|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 9/10 tricks here in 3@S|pg||
nt|mamos: 14-16 ty op|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 sensible auctions by the Israelis on    2 and 3 netted 24 IMPs|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe so, apparently 2C was not available, this is a leap of faith|pg||
nt|mamos: or some other conventional defence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kemperg: must be 15-17 or 14 -16, tostong for 12-14|pg||
nt|jcomyn: screech of brakes|pg||
nt|kemperg: strong|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahalim: we have a Mostradamus in our midst :)|pg||

pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: what are the odds of QJ doubleton in spades|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: then only 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: you have to somtimes, competitive|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mamos: West and East need to be clear about their agreements :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: not high|pg||
nt|mamos: you might not even make six when QJ is doubleton because you might finesse|pg||
nt|ahalim: but QJx onside is also good enough|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: good defense|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@H on bd 15 netted +17 imps!|pg||
nt|viren169: to Israel|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems so. If so capp could been used. 2@D=color|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|lestergold: strange line i must admit afterv spade finesse i would want to ensure my seven tricks withc 3@s @h @c 2@ds before sopeculating with the heart suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes esp. since diamond not led|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR also in 7@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: heart finesse can wait til later for overtrick if it works|pg||
nt|lestergold: first things first rather than rear end about face a sit were|pg||
nt|kemperg: start @D, gives leader wrong route|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|mamos: we crashed during Board 15   seems 6@h was made cant help think that was very lucky|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kemperg: No he has no rentry's|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: sorry private|pg||
nt|viren169: probably the reason we crashed!|pg||
nt|viren169: The Internet could not cope with the bidding!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 6@h made after a spade lead, ruffed. 2 rounds of @h and @d towards the king. When the !q dropped it was claiming time|pg||
nt|kemperg: safetyplay|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c9|nt|lestergold: could  go off on this line if clubs were badly placed|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely not when vulnerable|pg||

nt|mamos: another tricky hand   -- no game for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|seb75116: EN Ouest RUFA|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a great contract as it needs both black suits to nehave less than 50%|pg||
nt|mamos: you have some work to do in 5@d|pg||
nt|kemperg: toendra in English I don't know, permafrost?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: sure do|pg||

nt|mamos: but cant argue with success|pg||
nt|kemperg: will N believe the sign|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: while N thinks, EW are discussing a possible double of 2@H on the last board.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: 7@C with a @D start:)|pg||
nt|viren169: Not a great fan of RKCB with a void...|pg||
nt|kemperg: if 4@D was void then a problem now|pg||
nt|viren169: I think N will have the A of spade on the table before any diamond enters his mind!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very wise contract if staying there|pg||
nt|kemperg: rub of the green we say in golf|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice 3N|pg||

nt|mamos: well done 3NT has nine tricks on a Spade lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: 4 sp would work |pg||

nt|lestergold: but not what the doctor recommended!!|pg||
nt|kemperg: where do they go?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: hae me doubts|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: an accident with the Spades might do it|pg||

nt|lestergold: lets not be result merchants|pg||
nt|lestergold: they get 10/10 in the bidding competition for this|pg||
nt|kemperg: Looks like they knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|sybarra: in 5 it is much easier to make 6 |pg||
nt|lestergold: its always easy to make 8 when there is a one way no cost finesse available|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead you might even make 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west explaining that his partner should have something like 4351, but will be pleased to see 2 clubs|pg||

nt|mamos: i agree Germ  but as so often in these situations if partners are on diffeent wavelengths|pg||
nt|kemperg: accidents can happen again|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: hapeens to me too|pg||
nt|viren169: some form of light bergen here (I guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: amazed 2s allowed to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@H seems to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kemperg: ÈW had problems with the 1@D opening|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4-4 h fit never found|pg||
nt|jcomyn: at least noit yet|pg||
nt|rodal f: Partscore I precume, but a lucky on at NS if they try.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: e/w combined 20 or comnsiderably more than n/s 's|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: lebensohlish?|pg||
nt|lestergold: some 20s are bigger than others in other words|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks more like good/bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that adjective Shirley|pg||
nt|lestergold: can we also use flaneeryish smolenesque etc|pg||
nt|viren169: or a light fit-jump.|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like it was bergen|pg||
nt|mamos: NS can do well in Clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: baclwoodish suhhested|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yikes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not best fit we'v seen but NT seems ok.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or this.|pg||
nt|peachy: 1S was fine, 2S I dont understand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: junior 6-counts much better than ours|pg||
nt|kemperg: too optimistic, S did not dbl|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry N|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: won't bid game|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2N the brakes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: we could also add bonkerish loonyesque etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: have more fun with that than usual |pg||
nt|lestergold: could have a shirleyesque comment?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6NT works too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6D|pg||
nt|hedyg: by south|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm does it?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but it is off in open room|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4341 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: a Rolandish slam|pg||
nt|viren169: a slight improvement to bergen is to reverse the meanins of 3@C and 3@D|pg||
nt|kemperg: why no dbl by E then|pg||
nt|jbgood: what about a grand spade slam then?  |pg||
nt|jbgood: (in theory...)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true but highly unlikely dont you think|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT=lebensol u mean? Yes.|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think so|pg||
nt|mamos: last board of this set coming up  -- do we know what time the next set starts?|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8.35 pm|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: 20.35|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: CET, that is, so in 35 minutes.|pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7.35 pm GMT|pg||
nt|mamos: i have some catering to organise :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|jbgood: spades never get into the picture|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: so by avoiding the cold slam England makes imps|pg||
nt|kemperg: CR is behind|pg||
pc|s9|nt|viren169: and hence Reverse Bergen!|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree... looks normal to dble 3@C|pg||
nt|jbgood: so the only denomination slam cannot be won is @cs...|pg||
nt|mamos: no bidding 1@s abd then 2@s is the worst of all worlds in this sort of situation|pg||
nt|peachy: Since EW have game, even 800 is not in this case a huge swing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Serve one for me:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e  for results and standings|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match (now in theory): Israel Juniors vs England, 1st vs 4th before this round|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@Sx on 17|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: a juniorish bidding sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: Israel are marching on... without any response from Denmark at the moment.|pg||
nt|rodal f: As many have exspeienced. Tell a story only once.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isn't there a TD around? They are way behind|pg||
nt|mamos: uggggh   |pg||
nt|vugraphzag: sorry, was 1 down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how did thnat make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kemperg: looks like a massive score|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: but things woud have been awful if EW did not have game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: this is a very mousy contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|lestergold: thats the beauty of a rolandish point count division|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to the sponsors:  the City of Amsterdam, Herman Drenkelford, Max Abram and Peter Sisselaar and the organizer Kees Tammens.  All of us at BBO appreciate you bringing this ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: fine event to us..  Much enjoyed by so many vugraph fans around the world.   |pg||
nt|lestergold: minus for whoever dares to declare|pg||
nt|sybarra: And  finally to our specs.  We enjoy your comments that keep us on the straight and narrow.  |pg||
nt|viren169: Last hand coming up here|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: next match will be USA-Canada|pg||
nt|mamos: that makes more sense|pg||
nt|chick: Movie is right|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but you cant argue with success|pg||
nt|hedyg: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to Dennis Stuurman , our very capable operator at the White House in Amsterdam. Well done!|pg||
nt|hedyg: to  my talented fellow commentators John Comyn, Germ Kemper, Jon Sveindal and of course Roland Wald for donating their time to guide us through these boards.|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps time for a beer:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might better.|pg||
nt|mamos: that did look the bidding of an inexperienced player|pg||
mb|p!|nt|lestergold: Cheers Shirley and Germ and Dennis and all|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new lebensol to come?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mamos: 5@D has three losers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: tx hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Our appreciation to Herman Drenkelford, J.P. Sisselaar, Max Abram and the city of Amsterdam for sponsoring this nice tournament once again, and to the NBB and Kees Tammens for ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: making sure that this event is brought to BBO vugraph and inviting us all to participate|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kemperg: Hope to see you all again soon, I'l be here the rest of the day|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks Dennis, Gad, Mike , Carl and specs, an entertaining round|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT has no play|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back at 11:00 am Los Angeles, 2:00 pm New York, 19.00 Paris, 6:00 pm London|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: nothing can keep us on the staright and narrow|pg||
nt|viren169: Nothing really make on this hand but I suspect N/S will climb too high|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for the helpful and kind messages. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: thank you all|pg||
nt|mamos: so despite some opportunities this has been low scoring --  in our last match the total imps were 70+  here just three small swings|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by Vincent is enough, 2@H or 3@H the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here we are at vul Mike. Do we feel this right?|pg||
nt|kemperg: or 2@S by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: boards 17 and 18 still waiting to be played in the OR, have some swing potential there. Otherwise it's been a fairly flat session, yes.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: Dennis, you are doing a great job, we all know yours is the toughest of all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Id bid @s with North  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: so Denmark may get a chunk of imps back|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S has some play... but not much!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west alerted 1@s, but east takes it as natural|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty all, see you again|pg||
nt|kemperg: he will|pg||
nt|rodal f: Back to B15|pg||
nt|mamos: dont like 2@D   and certainly dont like it as natural|pg||
nt|kemperg: you think its natural?|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: S alerted it, but saw no alert on the N/E side of the screen|pg||
nt|mamos: wellit didnt show both majors did it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: especially when E/W had bid and supported them!|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: more true for you maybe :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: no, 2@S my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Unlucky that 7@C goes down|pg||
nt|peachy: E does well to protect|pg||
nt|kemperg: last board of the day, Dennis ty, time for a nightcap|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: tomorrow we will start again at 12 o'clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: local time that is|pg||
nt|peachy: But he might have done better with 2NT, to imply clubs with longer diamonds|pg||
nt|kemperg: Rodal, Raija, Mike thanks|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mamos: West knows she wants to bid Hearts :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@C is good bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Could be a good board for Canada|pg||
nt|mamos: for me it would ask partner to pick best major|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Thanks everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@D?|pg||
nt|viren169: Good hand where everyone has something to say!|pg||
nt|kemperg: they need it|pg||
nt|mamos: it just leads to an unclear auction  South's slow pass suggests he didnt understand|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: it was W thinking, not S.|pg||
nt|mamos: we are going to end up in 3@h in a minute :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: who's thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: ok|pg||
nt|mamos: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: right now it's E|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 12CET|pg||
nt|peachy: Great job, Dennis|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: South has other ideas|pg||
nt|mamos: well this may be better than bidding game|pg||
nt|kemperg: ty|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: six black tricks   ta very much|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S have done well but will lose a few imps when scoring up!|pg||
nt|mamos: dont think East really wanted to see his partner ass|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but in 7 can u ever get it right|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|mamos: pass|pg||

nt|rodal f: Tx all. Specs included and see u a next segment.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|viren169: Thanks all... a few entertaining hands!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: will E give the Q|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|mamos: East's overcall   and West's perfectly reasonable raise have lead to playing far too high a  contract :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: thx all,  I have a meeting I have to get to   enjoy the rest of the day :) |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kemperg: dennis|pg||
