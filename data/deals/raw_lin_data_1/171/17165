nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: We won't repeat what you say then.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Were you in that team, Calle? :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a good slam for NS|pg||
nt|athene: a reasonable slam here|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|athene: needs one or other minor to behave itself|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: W is going to have a problem.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We know he was because we saw him being knocked out of the main event|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to bid slams which depend on someone having the right void, though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: a good hand and no heart stopper|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|santyclz: Add distinct shortness in the other major and you have a recipe for disaster.  E, however, has him covered.|pg||
nt|chick: If W can stand to stay in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: N's pass not the right start |pg||
nt|rnc: Yes Roland, I was on the no 1 'Boye Brogeland Fan Club', even though I was not playing any of those matches... :)|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought north could bid 3@C over 2@H?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cicus: NS playing a limited system?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: don't know what their agreements are, but the usual 2@H 3@H stopper asking bid would have worked here|pg||
nt|santyclz: N passed in the other room and e opened a weak 2@s which made the hand easy.|pg||
nt|athene: 12 tricks is a lot|pg||
nt|athene: south isn't covering the @SQ  after east opened a weak 2 in the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or at all, probably :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|rnc: Me too|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4 finesses working|pg||
nt|chick: I agree Bill, I would have also|pg||
nt|athene: of course playing strong club it's easy|pg||
nt|rnc: Yes, they are playing 1@C 17+|pg||
nt|athene: but even playing standard i would still bid 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A ship without a captain is like a monastery without a monk|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|chick: 6-5 worth a lot|pg||
nt|cicus: even if not, I could not bring myself to pass over 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Go play!|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rnc: This will get Mixarna somewhat back in business.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: 170 always more embarrassing in a minor than a major :)|pg||
nt|rnc: Minimum in high card points, but good distribution. Hard for South to visualize a monster like North's, even if I would have raised to 5@C. It's teams after all.|pg||

nt|santyclz: I don't know if these are 6-man teams.|pg||
nt|mr murray: hi|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|athene: south has a bit more than a 3@C opener, first seat NV against V, for most people|pg||
nt|athene: sorry east has|pg||
nt|athene: how about 4@C?|pg||
nt|athene: a difficult auction for EW now|pg||
nt|rnc: Anyhow, some badly needed IMPs for Mixarna.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you play that as showing hearts, don't!|pg||
nt|athene: this is exactly why many good players really stretch the top end of their 1nt over 1@S|pg||
nt|chick: This may sound a little rigid, but I think that 6-5 or better belongs in at least a game|pg||
nt|cicus: they have another chance here|pg||
nt|athene: they don't want to double 1@S and commit to rebidding 2NT after a minimum advance from partner|pg||
nt|athene: which might have nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems 3NT can be made|pg||
nt|athene: still maybe 19 really IS too much|pg||
mb|1S|an|4+!s|mb|d|nt|santyclz: There is a downside to transfer preempts at the 4 level.|pg||
nt|athene: but i bet there are some strong players who would just bid 1nt with west|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some would double with north|pg||
nt|athene: you certainly don't need much more|pg||
nt|chick: not I :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe it is a bit thin|pg||
nt|rnc: Both are 6-man teams, however Mixarna play with only five - one is on holiday for three weeks. Fredriksson-Westerberg is not a regular partnership, actually they are playing ...|pg||
nt|rnc: together for the first time.|pg||
nt|cicus: ducking spades twice with the @HQ as entry for a lot of finesses|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: why would anyone choose a holiday over playing bridge on vugraph? there's no understanding some people...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, after double and 2nt, east should be giving it a third with that 6 count|pg||
nt|athene: you have to judge which card north has|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|cicus: true|pg||
nt|athene: you could give up a diamond to reach dummy for club and heart finesses|pg||
nt|athene: or give up the club for diamond and heart finesses :)|pg||
nt|athene: just a bit of a guess really|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|santyclz: 2 words - SCUBA diving.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: west would like his partner to play it - @SQx, @SJxx, that sort of stuff|pg||
nt|athene: sadly, @S10x isn't a stop even if the lead runs up to it :)|pg||
nt|rnc: Some partnerships, my own included, play 1NT after (1S)-DBL-(Pass) as negative, 0-6 hcp - a sort of 'mini-Lebensohl'. Other bids shows 7+.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: right, herbert negative but only for 1@S - that might be a reasonable idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|cicus: and even makes the declaration in the right hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnc: Yes, only for 1@S. That helps a lot with those 18-19 balanced opposite.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnc: Good point. Maybe she didn't realise that her team - she is the captain by the way - would be able to qualify for the finals :)|pg||

nt|athene: well, if NS in the other room play 4-card majors, that 2@S bid is *really* weird|pg||

nt|mr murray: he wont like it|pg||

mb|2D|nt|athene: if 2@S is a 'strong' weak-2 he will be less inclined to bid 3nt though|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: as opener more likely to have enough entries to get his suit going|pg||
nt|chick: Don't know what the alert on 2@S is, but S has an opening hand in my book.  By opening higher, he now can't show the spades or the distributional value of the hand|pg||

nt|rnc: ...Just for your information, the hcp-bonus of 21 IMPs for team Blandat is for today's 32 boards only.|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer works out the lie of the cards he can make it here, playing on hearts to get two tricks there|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Thanks Calle|pg||
nt|athene: and trying to draw trumps, keep control of diamonds AND set up hearts is pretty much impossible too|pg||
nt|athene: so he just gives up on making the contract|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnc: Let's hope we got as close a final as the previous two years. Five IMPs after 96 boards if I remember correctly.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Interesting format.  Sounds like a lot of work.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: it's easy to get overboard when you have a shortage in opps' suit but only a modest fit for partner - the hands often don't play that well|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pc|d8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|athene: it was perhaps hard for declarer to put north with all those cards in spades and diamonds, given he had the clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d9|nt|athene: the @HQ there would be a killing move in some situations|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: the only way to work it out was if declarer read the lead as a doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: that would let him pick up hearts AND give him a good clue as to the other suits, as clearly north must have other suits he is really unwilling to lead from|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|athene: if dummy had no entry and declarer wanted to bring in the hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: because if north ducks, and declarer finesses, south has to duck too to kill the suit, which gives declarer a "free" heart trick|pg||
nt|athene: as the play had gone it wasn't really necessary but still it didn't really hurt :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|athene: still it might get quite tricky actually|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: the key is that north can't get his partner in to play hearts|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: north doesn't want to play a low heart here in case declarer has the jack - that would give him an extra entry to hand to finesse clubs|pg||
