nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not showing my age, just showing my knowledge of old movies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne match also exchanged about 100 imps last set for a negligible change in the match|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman had only a sevn-card suit but it might easily have been 8-card.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2010 Team Trials online for both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches playing same boards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann asks about 4D.  Gitelman writes: "I think splinter"|pg||
nt|harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|harmon: Team captain here so iahve to behave:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick break|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-8 HCP  or  9+ with no more than 1 King|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  this is RM Lite version -- he's FULL RM savant|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT shows 12+ W/5+@h|pg||
nt|harmon: I assume 1n some GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hefty constructive raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lots of losers|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: NS play a version of Precision   EW 2/1 with lots of special agreements|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ HCP  unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|harmon: see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12+ HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rhelle: 1NT by North is normally 12.5 - 15|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Bill|pg||
nt|dburn: this is catching up, not real life|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfe: green cards placed delicately on the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar sees them when the tray comes back, puts his cards down and his hands to his temples|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nice easy board to start the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar leans back, crosses his legs, still thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is great to see the top stars bid these competitive deals - a very difficult area for most of us.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's strength limited by failure to open Precision @C|pg||
nt|ritong: and leading a @c from Jx is highly unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visibe using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play what Kokish calls  "somewhat timid kaplan-sheinwold"   weak NT except  3rd seat vul|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, heart positive with extras, three natural bids...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...and a difficult call for Greco|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D unusual with 4333; you would expect a scrambling 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: fingering @DA and @DQ|pg||
nt|ritong: +|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: this probably isn't the real auction|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have no idea what is going on - looks like a transcription error|pg||
nt|sybarra: good flop as Henri says?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with a potential trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads/carding  3rd/5th vs suit  4th vs NT    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure both matches playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = any 8-11, FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other rooms are visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  [one window per table]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: psychic cue??|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - looks that way|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably strong @H rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North passed, it would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2010 Trials   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll give link for EW as soon as they're identified :)|pg||
nt|athene: but it has worked out ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: but both contracts have issues of trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lauria is asking about 4nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: to watch multiple tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|dburn: not Blackwood|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Liz :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think NS are in 2@d|pg||
nt|harmon: 4d probably says I like from previous bidding 4h says I hate it|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to bid Blackwood for hearts, but not sure how he can organise this|pg||
nt|athene: swap south's minors though and 3@D would take them past their best spot of 3@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: @h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swap south's minors and Gitelman won't reopen|pg||
nt|athene: the disadvantage of bidding a scramble in this sort of situation, though, is that you are painting a big target on yourself to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: saying "hey opps, i don't have any long suit, please start the doubling"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this way|pg||
nt|dburn: 4NT over 3NT would sound natural|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: he needs an entry to his partners hand to beat this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW CC  http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/LevinWeinstein.gif|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@h - 8-11, any shape?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 5@S showed specifically @S & @C|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 4@s4m?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well actually it does NOT include 8+ HCP, 5+@S  [1@S]   all other positive responses to 1@C show 12+ HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Score not correct,  real score is 41-25|pg||
nt|dinos1: but 3N showed NT hand|pg||
nt|harmon: 5 is in danger on Ace of clubs lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil in 4@S North|pg||
nt|dburn: Hampson may have to pass here just to get a plus, but I don't see how he can|pg||
nt|dburn: Kamil and Fleisher actually did remarkably well|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: being one tempo ahead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down Attitude, standard Count    NS  standard count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: no he doest|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has three top tricks - the club ruff is for down two|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess that after the ruff, Grue can pick up the hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can handle it all|pg||
nt|ritong: he can|pg||
nt|ritong: fred has two @cs|pg||
nt|dburn: and so did Hampson|pg||
nt|athene: yes it's possible that gitelman had some thoughts of "equal level conversion" i.e. he was intending to correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right this did look familiar|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Jacki: welcome Ira chorush|pg||
nt|athene: but i still think using 2nt a lot in these positions is better as it lets you double with more hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Spade switch is clear, but West can give a suit preference card anyway.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: and as everyone knows, the aim of the modern player is to double for takeout as often as possible, if not more so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: part of decision from Moss COULD [keyword] be that if EW bid 3@S  @D lead better than @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: here you have to rely on the @h finesse, but it worked so 2 imps for diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss that 5N was pick a slam,  Gitelman thought it was choose 6 or 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Joanna, thanks |pg||
pc|h9|nt|chorush: This is an agressive 6 spade contract which might make on a good day, which this is not|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: whether he will or not is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: what does Diamond need? about 3 imps a board? slightly less|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  EW Greco-Hampson playing their form of Precsion    NS Fleisher-Kamil playing 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other semi-final   thru 25   Grue 176  Kang 137|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: that should give a decent range of different auctions |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: two and a half won't quite be enough|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, someone who can perform division at 3am :) good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ritong: it was not, as 5@d is a make|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: if he ran the jack of hearts and lost to a stiff queen, he would go down an awful lot|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: we have some technical problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Grue 57  Kang 35|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, can you pls enter pass out for every unplayed hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter as long as total is 1 larger than Fleisher|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: then replace with actual results|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd of 4 16-board segments for the Vanderbilt Cup Semi-Finals|pg||

pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman: "I have to admit it occurred to me you were psyching there"|pg||
nt|hedyg: picked up the Q@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but judging by that, he did well|pg||
nt|brolucius: A splendid opening board for us.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry i just walked in and I'm afraid I missed the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we lost our connection|pg||
nt|ritong: and we start with slammy hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the match ends with board 64 [unless tie]  winners play in Semi-Finals tomorrow   losers  maybe watch vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: previous set was WoW about these|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome a well rested Henri|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me Kamil-Fleisher lucky that there was no slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room already on  19   i fear the rooms aren't linked :(|pg||
nt|athene: no, a spec was asking about that|pg||
nt|ritong: sheesh|pg||
nt|athene: one thing i have noticed playing against computers is that often just on the basis of running simulations [i.e. dealing many hands and seeing what works double-dummy], they favour ...|pg||
nt|athene: 3-card suits over 4-card suits against 3nt, much of the time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow --  Grue 144  Kang 123   last time i checked Grue had huge lead|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea is they are more likely to strike a 5-card suit in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John -- we're linked up now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
nt|ritong: interesting hand, regarding style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2010 Trials Convention cards online for both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IFF that really was the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt the other room really had that auction - the operator may have been catching up somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=good 14 to 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to @D and 3 nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they play   3@C=@D  [weak or FG]|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think brad will content himself with that, shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well Shirley's sequence should be mild slam try  otherwise just 1N-3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: matter of agreements re the transfer sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|sybarra: or another sequence maybe be game force stayman...and..|pg||
nt|ritong: one is moss' hand is really good and justifies more than a mild try|pg||
nt|ritong: an other is, when you transfer for @ds and bid 3NT afterwards, there must be a reason  for us, it shows @c shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room has already crashed once -- are we in holding pattern because of connection or is Brad in the tank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
nt|athene: strong notrump from east gets raised to 3 and how can south find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|athene: but with the weak notrumpers EW, we get a different auction|pg||
nt|dburn: understandably - no point in leading your side's combined 8-card fit if it's going to break 4-4|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: don't worry - the play is not likely to be too fast for you to keep up with from now on|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on page 240 of the system notes right? |pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 142|pg||
nt|ritong: will levin repeat @ds or raise @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
nt|dburn: sadly, Martel and Stansby do not play strong no trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator from other room just announced  "Bobby Levin is not feeling well, so Fleisher-Kamil are playing this set"|pg||
nt|dburn: at least, not very often|pg||
nt|athene: difference in notrump range is a big swing-generator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get well Bobby|pg||
nt|athene: either you reach different contracts or (more often) you play them the other way round|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: EW put maximum pressure over South|pg||
nt|hedyg: shhhhhhh! dont give them ideas!|pg||
nt|wstuart: Have Chips and Lew changed to a str NT vul?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: always thinking  about chips?  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: but it seem as if he has a 5@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone believe that was a typo??|pg||
nt|athene: lots of random swings, so good for trailing team i suppose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well at least im here now for the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally so:)|pg||
nt|harmon: Yes it showed fleischer opened 7h in the third quarter thot was agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c looks like a decent contract - not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  4@H Ace Ask   taking control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i should say Key Card Ask      5@C=2 without Q|pg||
nt|dburn: still, South has even less reason to lead a heart once North did not overcall, but...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
nt|dburn: South's hand is so bad that he may lead one anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room 3NE -50|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north wanted the @H10 - or even the @H9 - for the overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're looking into getting rooms linked up|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if non-imp scoring would change Levin's choice of rebid|pg||
nt|dburn: this may not get a "thank you partner"|pg||
nt|athene: 5-card suits are what you want to beat 3nt - yours or partner's|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   not sure what 3@S is  AFTER the super-accept|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: 1st leader change of the set  --  how many more will we see?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, there wasn't much North-South could really do|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|harmon: timely 3c bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the person leading that charge for leads is Kit Woolsey|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||
nt|harmon: theyve crossed rooms|pg||

nt|ahollan1: short break between sets 1&2  3&4   long break at the half|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually raise on 3 is more appealling with WEAKER trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with strong trump ruffing risk is that declarer might have very weak holding to cover opponent's trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember -- modern game bids 1M with suit of 5432|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old days the response of 1Major required some suit quality  but  now we be with xxxx  [5432]|pg||

pc|s5|nt|chorush: yes, and a fat 13 imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: levin should hold this to down one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: underbid|pg||
nt|ritong: i won t have time to develop about the transfer sequel|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to be critical, but perhaps it was "lazy" bidding at other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i recall that focusing more on lead from 4 rather than 5|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and back in the 80s  Paul Marston authored an article  "Canape Leads"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wstuart: No real problems discarding with Katz's hand.  Martel is hoping for a miracle, but it doesn't appear to be a religious holiday for him.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Greco shakes his head (behind screen) when @C ruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: 9 and 10 of @d indicate doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin asks about Q lead|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson would play jack from J109|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: promises J or shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: and low at some point from 109x|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: A@S?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if one of the majors was bare, West might have made an unlucky choice of lead. It was adventurous bidding by N/S that could have worked better.|pg||
nt|dburn: true, and I guess if South had a couple of aces, the unstopped major might well be 4-4 anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|dburn: downgrade previous comment to "mildly optimisitic"|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: was worth 4NT imho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs use Rusinow Leads  [2nd of touching honors]  but only versus NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Henri |pg||
nt|sybarra: something more that 3 nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Bertens-Bakkeren 1N opener can be half point less at the top -- but still|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even 3 @H cue?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, the fact that opener denied interest with 3@d enters the pic|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: Kamil bid 3N directly over 3@C|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel may have to give North a spade trick sometime, but that's not nearly enough for Hampson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  seems Chip has many choices of play for down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know that Lew holds @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: well, at some point he may have to throw @hK under the ace to achieve down two|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may be reluctant to do that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel also doesn't know that dummy's @S aren't a threat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example  give declarer @SAKJx|pg||
nt|athene: well, this is a bad result for people who wanted a close finish|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: bertens decided slam was at best on a finesse, likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when transfer is any strength, rebid of 3@H/@S usually shows shortness|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he did play the A@S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: now he knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the @HK unblock gets easier now|pg||
nt|dburn: if dummy's spades were a potential entry, Hampson might have cleared the diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: cant Berten's make the cue in @H? |pg||
nt|sybarra: (other room)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: it probably shows a shortness, either in @h or @s,according to agreement|pg||

nt|ferlema: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: I would not have opened 1@H, either, unless in the context of a strong @C system.|pg||
nt|passell: 15 and a good 6 card suit seems too much to make a light invitation|pg||
nt|ritong: hi mike welcome|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes we agreed on that point|pg||
nt|passell: hi   this is quite a match|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C  -- and could be 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|passell: congrats to the Berg teams great performance througout this event|pg||
nt|passell: they were way to tough for me yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set was exactly 100 imps exchanged for net difference of about 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just threw the imps in the air|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and they landed....|pg||
nt|dburn: weak no trump for East-West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: So, I tihnk their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 4rd only).|pg||
nt|ritong: might need an other coffee:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good 14-17   [i think]|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Stanbsy hasn't got a four-card suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens overcalled 1N rather than Moss' DBL   looks close to me|pg||
nt|harmon: Stansby mightve returned the 8 of clubs when in help Stansby a bit|pg||
nt|dburn: so 1@c for Stansby|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then transfer lead to partner??|pg||
nt|dburn: so maybe he will lead a heart anyway - but I doubt it|pg||
nt|athene: a very aggressive balance in the other room but i think it has a lot going for it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C4 is ATTITUDE  i.e. NOT a count card|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a singleton, after 1nt p p, you want to bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those for a long time -- still don't understand how they can ever work|pg||
nt|athene: because partner is often going to lead your singleton and that will usually be bad for the defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry for the confusion, tables did not link|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  i don't believe airplanes can really fly|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it does make a difference if the singleton is an honour|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: results are correct here, bidding -play not exact|pg||
nt|dburn: they work if you are the kind of person who never leads four-card suits - partner needs to know whether you are leading from three low or five to some honours|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||
nt|chorush: you are probably correct Wayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historically   that is really 14+ to 17|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 7 comes from three small, when north would not lead from KJ7 here|pg||
nt|ritong: so greco will duck twice|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping his precious 10|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer sits behind brad.  our first as opposed to the mob hovering at the zia-hamman table|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = @h, 9+, unbalanced|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman, after sitting still for a minute, grabs the pass card off his tray|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = 4+@c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: he had no real reason to get involved here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- i'm sure i would have bid 1N at the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and other potential swing|pg||
nt|passell: sorry i had to miss the last quarter|pg||
nt|ritong: gee|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - he'd have done that anyway with 18|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: a strong @c?|pg||
nt|dburn: by the look of things|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL by Fred would absolutely deny 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board   Diamond-Platnick play a Big Club [very similar to Greco-Hampson version of RM Lite]|pg||
pc|h9|nt|passell: this may actually make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he can't really risk hearing @D from partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually looking again,  it just might make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1@D tends to deny 4-card major|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|harmon: err Martel|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: bottom of touching H|pg||
nt|dburn: this isn't straightforward - he can probably make it, with this rather favourable club layout, but he will have to work hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upside-down count & attitude for NS   their CC doesn't mention Smith  that's a bit of a surprise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no smith for NS, this was asked this afternoon|pg||
nt|athene: well, 5 imps back here i guess|pg||
nt|athene: @DJ falling so he has four diamonds and three aces |pg||
nt|dburn: in fairness, he would have had those whatever Stansby led - this swing was because of East's decision to bid at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: if people think it is worth playing 2-tier weak-twos (2@D bad, 2major good) then there is surely a stronger case for it here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|harmon: another 6c hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@s = at least 55 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = relay|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they had toy for East to show ALL of   Good Hand [for non-1@C], 6@D, 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond in 3@H West|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. balancing 1nt|pg||
nt|dburn: whether East would have bid 4 IMPs behind rather than 40, I do not know|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D says "I have a major, DON'T do anything pd" and 2@H/@S says "i have a real overcall"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle: 3@s = eaxctly 3=5=0=3|pg||
nt|passell: will take careful defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because of room crashes  some bidding in movie may be operator shortcut trying to catch up|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: thanks John|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a hard job to do|pg||
nt|wstuart: Let me type tihs more accurately**So, I think their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 3rd only).|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble with that is that it ties up a lot of bids for one-suited hands|pg||
nt|athene: yes, true|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents figure it out|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c stack is hidden|pg||
nt|ritong: and south did not lead his singleton|pg||
nt|passell: yes club lead down for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: however, north might switch to a @c in order to open trick(s) before @ds are good|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a trick short|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: lacks a tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but a tap in the long trump hand  kills it doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 53  Nickell 13-0 for the set  now leads Fleisher by 20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some would say  the only true "precious" card is The Beer Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have the URL that explains details/history of Beer Card?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: 3NT is to play|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe 6NT now?|pg||
nt|harmon: =h-5|pg||
nt|passell: then they have to be careful to play a trump next|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  both pairs playing 2/1|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: intra-finesse in @S seems reasonable   especially after learning about North's red suit length|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that still isn't 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h shows a @h picture - can't have 3, he would have supported them earlier|pg||
nt|sybarra: now (single dummy) what do you do next with Fred's hand?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 8 tricks to lose, so -3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did @H10 clarify or confuse further??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Gitelman in 1@SX East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spy on other tables via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    [one window per room]|pg||
pc|h8|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||
nt|rhelle: At first glance this looks as 1 of 2 finesses. 5@c tricks, 2@d, 1@h, 2@s = 10. An extra trick can be developed in @h or @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: so finding trick 12 is what it's all about - before giving away 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|chorush: well, that got him up to 8|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: had @H2 out but put it back|pg||
nt|passell: unreal|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand that shows weakness of double dummy software -- much more interesting when defense can't see the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman went down much faster|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|wstuart: Specs ask if a 1NT rebid could conceal 1 or 2 4 card majors the way Martel-Stansby are playing, and I believe the answer is yes, they tend to rebid 1NT to show the Strong NT when ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: possible.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rhelle: this trick will not be what South was waiting for|pg||
nt|rhelle: Chances are that the @sQ is with West now - he can see 6@h and 2@c in East already|pg||
nt|harmon: needs more than that|pg||
nt|rhelle: So he needs a double squeeze - @s@d against West, @h@d against East. But he has no @d entry ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: Not enough entries to ruff the @ds high either|pg||

nt|harmon: Are they playing same boards in other match??|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he is preparing for the possibility that clubs are bad and that Hampson is 5-3-4-1|pg||
nt|kit: if that is case, he has only 8 tricks and defense has 2 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: if clubs ok he will always make 9 this way; if not he has a slm chance|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, hearts being 4-4 that is true, but what if hampson 5-3-4-1?|pg||
nt|kit: if he is, knocking out spades works -- defense has only 1 hearts, 1 diamond, 2 spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and as mentioned  weak NT except for 3rd seat Vul|pg||
nt|athene: a bit wet of west not to open that hand, isn't it?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wstuart: if Lew finesses he can make, but I doubt he will do that.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Maybe however.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interesting choice here at T1|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nvm|pg||
nt|chorush: he is going to make 11 tricks whether he finesses or not, in my opinion|pg||
nt|wstuart: @H lead gives it away|pg||
nt|wstuart: I was looking at the play before I saw the @H lead.|pg||
nt|dinos1: @cA - SP for @d ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs would say Weinstein auction shows 3@S rather than allowing 4|pg||
nt|dburn: Greco going quietly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco passed kinda disgustedly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but brad has a particular talent for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting   i wonder if 2N was forcing  |pg||
nt|athene: i guess Jx isn't the best holding ever|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dburn: question of whether this goes down quickly or slowly, I guess|pg||
nt|chorush: Only way to have beaten this contract is with a club lead and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  3rd/5th leads vs suit     EW 4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move swap @DK and @Hx  that may be good enough|pg||
nt|athene: you know they will be opening it in the other room, so if you want to avoid swings, you open it?|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if he feels that not opening hands like that is what got him the lead in the first place, he might as well carry on with it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good lead -- but with @C behaving  declarer has time to establish 9th trick in @D|pg||
nt|dburn: surprised he didn't lead a spade - after all, who leads from a four-card suit nowadays?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if partner has long @S -- how good are they after 1st seat pass?|pg||
nt|athene: moss knows there is no problem on 3-2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking about 4-1 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: club players, faced with this sort of situation, take the "let's try them and see" approach, but by then it might be too late|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems either way -- start with duck trick 1, @D to jack at trick 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure anything is gained by testing @C first, but don't quote me|pg||
nt|athene: if clubs are bad, you might want to play spades, try for 3 clubs and 2 in each of the others|pg||
nt|athene: you would expect martel to overcall 1@H with @HQJ10xx and a side entry, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not - it does look as though their style is quite cautious|pg||
nt|dburn: if you found 4-1 clubs, you might want to play diamonds for four tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cheek opened the West hand  and ended up playing 2@H!!!|pg||
nt|athene: moss is probably hoping that clubs ARE 4-1 because then he might gain a big swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss "sorry"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 21   Grue [ 21 seed]  161  v  Kang [ 41 seed]  123|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our teams were seeded   Diamond  3   Fleisher  7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y thanks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: 2NT artif prolly any gf hand with no suitable rebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of gazzilli, just upscaled|pg||
nt|bg: letssee|pg||
nt|ritong: you think he should act?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just the manner, softly placing the card on the tray|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c5 - @d SP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room  and quick @CA @D @C @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS play reverse count and attitude - so the 4 is from an even number|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  just some tool for Weinstein to complete shape|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6|pg||
nt|dinos1: good try to hide low @c's|pg||
nt|kit: Levin giving his own suit-preference signal with 6@C -- he wants the higher suit|pg||
nt|kit: 3 higher clubs, 2 lower, so Platnick should get it right|pg||
nt|dinos1: well if S has 532 then W has 4 clubs and bid 2N?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||
nt|ritong: unless ha has real good news|pg||
pc|hT|nt|harmon: be nice to tavel tod but that has dangers|pg||
nt|harmon: we know its safe but......|pg||
nt|harmon: travel to a diamond|pg||
nt|harmon: I type like doo doo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C mechanism to show weak 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   3@C to show GAME FORCE 6-4|pg||
nt|drewsky: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: it seems that a top @c lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ritong: hiya drew|pg||
nt|drewsky: a direct 3@H or 3@S would have been 5-5 and 6-4 respectiuvely, and Non forcing|pg||
nt|drewsky: relay to major 5-5 and 6-4 forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pull up a chair, and relax, this is going to be a long session|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  other room also 1N -200|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Jacki: did you use our payment screens?  b/c your deposit didn't go through.  The error message usually means a wrong card type (it's a drop down menu) or a wrong CVV number|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond stops in 2@S after  Platnick Semi-Force 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: weinstein has few options at that point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting that Diamond did NOT show @H|pg||
nt|drewsky: A trump lead probably would have defeated this contract for sure.|pg||
nt|ritong: ya drew|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson considered his lead for a long time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @H strength trump sure seems like 1st or 2nd choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weinstein "sorry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin pacing in empty room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss also tried @C6|pg||
nt|athene: he might play a club to dummy and a spade up, trying to lose a spade to east first (with the assumed long hearts)|pg||
nt|athene: if the spades are split|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: here, pachtmann had relatively good news|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman seems always in control, never on tilt, never in a hurry|pg||
nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|chorush: Eventually, declarer will lead a diamond toward the dummy and on the showout, will take 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match   Grue off to quick 25-0 lead after 3 boards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: what?|pg||
nt|dburn: Stansby can afford one diamond loser but not two, so adopts the best play for doing that|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: with talent|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: he ruffed the queen? really?|pg||
nt|harmon: 6c hand was played from otherside and got a spade into the KJ made it easier I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|wstuart: but still would lsoe 2@C, 1D and 1S?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dinos1: only 1 ruff?|pg||
nt|ritong: fleisher is in a real state of grace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: darn  i was called away and missed it  --- how did play finally go??|pg||
nt|athene: hold up in hearts, diamond finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: it hasn't gone anywhere, unlike you|pg||
nt|ritong: his direct overcall 2@c at unfav is a model of bravery|pg||
nt|athene: declarer is going to test the clubs in a minute and the hand will become very boring|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h7|nt|rhelle: that made it cold|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|ritong: so, north had relatively good news, but not enough to make a move|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman gesturing like he's counting something out|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drewsky: Most would say that these 2 teams are BOTH considered 2 of the top 3 or 4 teams in the United States, so they BOTH want to beat the other so badly that they will take a long time ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: to complete this match.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lurker check or is he really going to scrounge for extra trick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chorush: no diamond will be lost; delarer will pitch his two losing diamonds on the AK of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if memory serves  this is rematch of finals from 2010 Team Trials AND 2010 Spingold|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly it was - Fleisher has done some extremely good things for his side in this match|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|bg: these club discards are risky if W swithches now it is not safe to set up hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the Rubber Match|pg||
nt|dburn: North onlly has the singleton @dK in the textbooks, but no harm in trying|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wstuart: ah, of course.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of good front runners   Nickell now 20-0 for the set  leads Fleisher by 27|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many don't know the term "rubber match"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: In Rubber Bridge   [before 4-deal/Chicago]   2 games out of 3 won a Rubber|pg||
nt|ritong: surprising move by greco anyway|pg||
nt|drewsky: For many many years, the Nick Nickell team was always considered the 'chalk' in the national knockout events. Lately both the Diamond team and the Fleisher team have been added to ...|pg||
nt|drewsky: that 'chalk'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so if 1 win each   the 3rd match is the Rubber Match|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer is known 6430, not sure how @d A can be good|pg||
nt|drewsky: 10 imps to Fleisher here....|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps KJx with him and two trump tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: after 4 hands, table is at least 12 minutes behind clock|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: i bet brad will try some joke about that at the table  he s facetious|pg||

nt|kit: Kamil did well to stay silent it looks like|pg||
nt|kit: right -- would make support dbl with 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I think the pass by Kamil was 0-2 spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|kit: and if West had passed, would bid 1@S with 3.  So they can't take your support double away by passing.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||

pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||

pc|sK|nt|kit: now king of spades through, forcing ruff and overruff|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c7 - both values (@s ruff and @hK)|pg||
nt|kit: seems like 1NT would have been better bid than 2@D, but perhaps they don't play it as natural.|pg||
nt|kit: oh wait -- South showed spades|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl also knows N's shape :)|pg||
nt|kit: right -- if South had 4 hearts, would have bid 1@D, not 1@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one window per table|pg||
nt|ritong: two trump tricks with that J643 holding are really unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: well next|pg||
nt|kit: that is silly -- partner must have stiff ace of clubs, and declarer must have ace of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just another push|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hedyg: Liz is going to have a tough time if they play and claim so quickly|pg||
nt|chorush: Very friendly diamond layout for this slam, presuming it is reached|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know their methods assuming there are methods for hands like these|pg||
nt|drewsky: Open 3@H or 4@H at these colors ? I would open 3@H, but I am conservative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice that system allowed 2@D rebid -- i thought original KS needed better hand for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: True, though it doesn't really require a friendly layout to make.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Live streaming available here:   www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  If anyone knows the names of the players at the table, share with us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Kantar created the convention where 3N showed solid MAJOR|pg||
nt|dburn: Gitelman did open 1NT at the other table - not sure what his range was for that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
nt|sybarra: open a browser for each room you want to see|pg||
nt|ritong: moss will probably bid 4@s directly|pg||
nt|ritong: to me it is a textbook 3@h at unfav  but i am VERY conservative reg preempts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: half of the scoreboard keeps reading as a beercard since you started to talk about the beercard @D7|pg||
nt|athene: hard for NS to double 2@D here|pg||
nt|dburn: only playing the last set because Bobby Levin is not well, apparently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: story from way back     BJ Becker went into tank for something like 50 minutes -- partner left, took a walk|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: there is a rumour about this, yes  hope for the best|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||
nt|ritong: after the raise, that is|pg||
nt|kit: interesting choice by Levin -- he figures he can bid 2@S later over red-suit competition|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good 14-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Mind you, they don't miscount very often either.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss did bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when returned  asked  "how'd it go"     answer:  "it was cold"|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think Katz would close the bidding with 6 hearts here, unless he thinks he has a good way to get to 7 if it is there|pg||
nt|robbg:  Levin facing|pg||
nt|rhelle: systematically, NS have to open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
nt|dburn: but whatever it was, he went down two in it, so a swing to Fleisher|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: a diamond wn't work so well|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: normal 3@s opening, but it has the effect of pushing East-West into a game they would not have bid left to their own devices|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting options for Stansby because of transportation issues|pg||
nt|ahollan1: has to start with -- is @HJ rusinow showing Q  or a shortness shot|pg||
nt|dburn: still, there are those who would open 4@s even at this vulnerability; Fleisher needs to hope that Kamil isn't one of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction in other room   Kamil led @Sx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so leads are 3rd even/low odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting arguments for that versus 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both sides make good cases|pg||
nt|dburn: never heard of anyone leading 5th from six cards|pg||
nt|athene: Ax in partner's suit can often be costly but it would have worked better here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: 2@d is 18-19(20)|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: seems right to show immediate @C support with lousy @S suit  [and expected bad split even if partner has 4@S]|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy bid   |pg||
nt|ritong: experts hate leads from xxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction would have been interesting after 4@H opening|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: 9 easy tricks from top|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is visibly sitting on the benefits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry, got knocked off the internet but didn't miss any of the bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard promises 4 @s and opener|pg||
nt|ritong: i think they can raise on 3 now and then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 is ATTITUDE|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: seems normal|pg||
nt|wstuart: (RKC = Roman Keycard Blackwood) where there are 5 controls -  the 4 aces and the trump K.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "that's too fast", takes time to study dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: just trying to avoid big swings|pg||
nt|ritong: if he was not doing that, he would certainly raise @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss wrote: if you bid 1NT, X would be takeout. haven't discussed here|pg||
nt|ritong: which were freely bid by his pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now he knows no @D in N|pg||
nt|kit: worked quite well, as Weinstein was able to compete to the right level|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weinstein "not more @D's?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitleman-Moss in 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/low  developed after 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|ritong: i think third from six is rather common|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|harmon: 4d could be beaten2 so this is better|pg||
nt|rhelle: it bites them here ... 4@h or 4@s looks solid|pg||
nt|harmon: they play canape??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those a lot in the 70s/80s  and to be honest  i have no idea how/why they work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  soo sorry vs suit 3rd/5th|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: a @c now and...|pg||
nt|athene: Ax in partner's suit especially unappealing with only one trump|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: why @c rather than @H?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, just to keep the relays symmetrical - it's an exception|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cheek also received @S lead to make 3N|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Stansby didn't, and he didn't guess what the heart lead was from|pg||
nt|dburn: so if Greco plays a diamond now...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...I don't see how Stansby will make this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think as simple as   makes without @D shift |pg||
nt|dburn: of course, Greco doesn't know what @hJ was all about either - he may think it was @hJ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st discard of @S5 encourages @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it not absolute directive|pg||
nt|harmon: no|pg||
nt|harmon: suggest d|pg||
nt|dburn: well, Hampson's bdi encouraged spades, so to speak - more important may be that encouraging spades discourages hearts|pg||
nt|harmon: 9 of s if he had led from J10 of hts|pg||
nt|dburn: but it really is a very deep position for Greco to play a diamond, when declarer might easily have the jack|pg||
nt|harmon: Eric usually takes his time but almost ALWAYS gets it right|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if he gets this one right it will be a truly impressive effort|pg||
nt|harmon: tansby mightve played hts 1st as a kib pointed out|pg||
nt|athene: with more trumps you hope that at least if your lead costs a trick you might get something back with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H7 don't return @H    certainly @C ruff in the picture now|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe, but leading from a king not all that attractive either - especially when you rather hope partner doesn't have an honour, because then you should have bid the suit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bg: some may try to run club 8 now but not at imps risk of losing 4 dia tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he probably knew that anyway - he would not expect Cheek to lead from @dAQ108 only against 2NT - all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how so you say that in French Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: oy²|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice H @H|pg||
nt|passell: great lead ace and a diamond for sure he would go down|pg||
nt|ritong: he s not home and dry, but indeed would have been tougher|pg||
nt|passell: may still make on a dbl squeeze  but great guessing involved|pg||
nt|passell: he will probably play to ruff in queen of diamonds  then guess the end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than  it works   was there any reason Muller could find @C shift|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t think moss can afford to check if @h was an underlead or not|pg||
nt|ritong: so many winning other solutions|pg||
nt|passell: club shift would be bad he would be forced to guess the dia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room the opening lead was @D    then @C10 shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is club shift, with 106xx |pg||
nt|sybarra: you just dont have a club spot in the S hand|pg||
nt|passell: maybe he will guess it anyway since a low dia wasnt shifted to  he might have without the queen|pg||
nt|passell: a truly great hand of cat and mouse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cool inference Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree MIke,  can be making, -1, making, +1 etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok +1 optimistic|pg||
nt|ritong: somehow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike previous board which was different set of animals|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: Stansby DID open 4@H - DBL - P - 5@D end|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wstuart: They claim should come right after Katz tries to sneak a @C through.|pg||
nt|harmon: See thats GREAT partnership defense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jillan:  NIckell again please|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bg: if N doesnt keep his two spades E could make 4 on an andplay|pg||
nt|ritong: now the real tough part|pg||
nt|ritong: will take ages, prepare sandwiches|pg||
nt|athene: well, a singleton trump is out too - maybe he should have refused to lead anything|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: better be fast sandwiches?|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: there are a lot of informations/inferences to gather up|pg||
nt|ritong: for starters, why did the guy underlead?|pg||
nt|ritong: has he really underled?|pg||
nt|ritong: why the @d A first?|pg||
nt|ritong: why not a @c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: next is can you afford to duck @D?|pg||
nt|ritong: etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: etc etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: this makes my head hurt |pg||
nt|sybarra: and I am not even at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about some port and stilton?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he asked about the diamond 7 earlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brad had time to relax while defense struggled with previous board -- he's just wearing them down now|pg||
nt|ritong: also, in general, players tend to delay crucial moves|pg||
nt|ritong: here, if brad hops @d K, from his point of view he s not dead already when @d Q does not drop|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: very, very well done|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: after a ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 2nd ruff was with a natural trump trick|pg||
nt|dburn: true - he can't lead a heart from a four-card suit, after all|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the sequences over 1@C - 1@H are idenctical to the 1@h opening|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: presumably Moss' pass denied 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Fred knew @SK was cashing|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: this wasn't a good day for Louisville in the NCAA tournement - the local college, led by coach Pitino, surprisingly lost to 14th seeded Morehead st. 62:61|pg||
nt|ritong: @d ruff looks clearcut|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: now hoping there were 14 @D in the deck|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: and after that, decide squeeze or hook|pg||
nt|sybarra: more choices|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think he has the count ye|pg||
nt|sybarra: *yet|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: although he cross ruffs his threats, so no real choice  sorry|pg||

nt|jillan:  Nick bid hearts first so he should be playing right|pg||
nt|wstuart: Right - Nickell was playing it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east took a short break|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@D will make on this deal, but it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
nt|jillan:  can't they make 6@D here as the cards break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all players are back now|pg||
nt|chorush: This hand should be played in the very good 5 diamonds. 3NT undeservedly gains 2 imps so justice not served|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry I played the wrong card brad played the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: he guessed it?   |pg||
nt|dburn: crikey|pg||
nt|athene: another big board for NS in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you duck a spade lead and then it's ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N-3N  and i think something wrong with my eyes|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might not get a spade lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect push   [hard to find @S lead without peek]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east tried a 1NT overcall in other room i d be surprised to see gitelman duplicate this|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, they are surging ahead now|pg||
nt|athene: right, heart looks pretty normal|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wstuart: aside from being off the @SA, 6@D requires both the @H finesse and 2-1 @D which will fail 22% of the time.|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  do you confirm the score operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I had him in the dummy when he was in hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: Levin quickly has limited his hand with simple raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: assuming 1@s is the response here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@s does not include 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  push at 5@D +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open Precision 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal   or  17+ bal|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jillan:  I know the percentage BUT you can't argue with the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sadam Hussein would describe this as the mother of all misfits.|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South will do well to go plus on these|pg||
nt|passell: well guessed when he ruffed the diamond north was squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought 1@S was 8+ HCP  and all the other positives 12+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 amazing hands in a row for declarer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure is a space-saving agreement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D is 100% game force|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, KQxxx facing the singleton are not awesome, although opener must have goodies onside to offer this " minisplinter"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|harmon: when they restarted Geoff shda passed:)|pg||
nt|ritong: with four small trumps|pg||
nt|kit: classic preempt, although at favorable maybe should open 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    2@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: it was alerted but no one gave any info|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit do you think 4@H opening more likely in 1st seat than in 2nd?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't always open 4@H :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
nt|ritong: this might get bloody|pg||
nt|passell: escaped the ouble  fred knows he is doing well  not chancing an accident|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|rhelle: EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|ritong: at 50 a piece, though|pg||
nt|ritong: so hampson should get highly interested|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c may be hearts - not sure of the methods here|pg||
nt|harmon: maybe depends on shapes too|pg||
nt|harmon: Walter??????|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2@s may be "good hand but not heart support"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
nt|sybarra: N  has the hands my pards usually have :(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: declarer now has problem -- he may think he has to take quick pitch|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @h to A, @h|pg||
nt|kit: and if he does, West gets ruff, and no dummy entry for heart finesse|pg||
nt|dinos1: but if E has 2@c and @hKxx it's wrong|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: no trumps etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: alot of pointing alerts with no written explanations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H Key Card ask for @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C=2 without Q|pg||
nt|dburn: Martle doing what he can to get a spade shift - maybe from the king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 23   Grue 172  Kang 137|pg||
nt|dburn: after all, Stansby could have that card instead of @hK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
nt|dburn: don't know what this means at all - maybe 5@s demands a club control, maybe just a general invitation|pg||
nt|harmon: I have a feeling the he has shown at least 6-5 in de blacks|pg||
nt|dburn: one would hope so, at least|pg||
nt|harmon: 6s needs 4-3 break|pg||
nt|dburn: six clubs probably the best slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have thought that 65 would have an unexpected jump response to the 2@C "@H Ask"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i meant 66|pg||
nt|dburn: since you can ruff a spade in the South hand, but how you can figure that out I don't know|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead: either a small trump or the @dK|pg||
nt|harmon: prob d3 uless defense slips|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: or even pitch that spade on the ace of diamonds, of course|pg||
pc|s9|nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
nt|dburn: but it would be a bit hard to go down in six spades, even so|pg||
nt|harmon: yes kibs I see|pg||
nt|harmon: might get a trump laed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 5-2 @S split just too much for 6@S -- after @C lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||
nt|harmon: 6s is cold on clead|pg||
nt|harmon: solves his problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WE know that duck @C works -- but at the table  Kamil won Ace then ruff to hand ...|pg||
nt|harmon: IM being flooded lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and WE know that @CA and @C works -- but is that odds on after @C lead??|pg||
nt|dburn: no, not really|pg||
nt|dburn: operation successful, patient dead on arrival anyway|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jillan:  it has ONE virtue - it makes|pg||
nt|harmon: need to start spades for 5th trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd start with @h ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby seem to be on their way to slam too|pg||
nt|harmon: dukce was poited out now its cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they played this board backwards|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like winning a red ace and playing a small club is the correct (and winning) play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st one in from Peter Boyd -- win @HA  duck @C  then jettison @CA|pg||
nt|dburn: still, he may be forced to make it now|pg||
nt|harmon: duck|pg||
nt|harmon: well don Geoff|pg||
nt|harmon: I like Geoff one of the few guys in acbl that has less hair than me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh    this is cute position too with @H coming in|pg||
nt|harmon: he has 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a true claim to fame??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: so do we have a guess re 2 @C?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he really, though, or was that just to annoy N/S?|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, when opps go down a bunch, the first reaction should be " hey, did we have something to play" instead of " har har har  suckers"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all the matchpoints|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|bg: Fred may regret tossing Dia|pg||
nt|bg: now if S ruffs a dia he cannot get off dummy without E playng another dia but he can discarf a club now Fred doent have anther dia|pg||
nt|ritong: far sighted, bruce|pg||
nt|yuval10: other room has already played twice as many boards as played here|pg||
nt|bg: if he ruffs a club now he has to finesse the dia|pg||
nt|sybarra: trans. to @D?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wstuart: To expand on my answer from above, the @H finesse is 50% and 3-0 @D is 22%, so the slam will fail 61% of the time (0.5 * 0.22).|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: Commendable bidding from EW will cost them 1 imp|pg||
nt|ritong: no big deal, except for you maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: if you get dizzy, just enter the final score|pg||
mc|9|nt|hedyg: well it is what he said|pg||

nt|ahollan1: somebody didn't shuffle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D opening??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: new leader  only 58 boards remaining|pg||
nt|kit: probably start 5@D-5@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems so :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: and then? 6@h?|pg||
nt|kit: and Weinstein needs to find the 6@H call|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should|pg||
nt|kit: Platnick may take a save over a slam -- but maybe not, fear of pushing them into a grand|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, he has void, ace, @s tolerance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue-Cheek +1660  in 12@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're 6 boards ahead of their other table|pg||
nt|dburn: Stansby trying to knock out the late club entry to the hearts, I guess|pg||
nt|harmon: Heart back mightve concerned him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will Stansby open??    |pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: Lauria played too quickly there as it was clear to not play a third spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@C opener was 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D-5@S-6@D-6@S/DBL-end|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ritong: they prolly have a tool to show 5@s 4@h limit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||
nt|dburn: but 6@s is pretty good - not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: result is accurate|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he might very well have ruffed high|pg||
nt|ritong: pant pant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, 3NT was hard to defeat on previous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11  game force|pg||
nt|kit: clear to double for club ruff and hope to have another trick I think|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: That's true, Wayne, when you compare it with 5 of a minor but not when 3NT is an alternative|pg||
nt|harmon: sometimes opening light gets you, this was one of em|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco probably surprised how quickly his drek improved|pg||
nt|kit: although it doesn't work well|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: sorry BAL 9-11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: If Hampson didn't in context of Big Club -- no way Stansby opens|pg||
mb|2D|an|4 card raise|nt|dburn: Martel didn't overcall either - but he is 40-odd ahead, not 40-odd behind|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open 2@C  that will really change tone of auction in other room|pg||
nt|ritong: we often observe that, but again, see how experts are reluctant with stiff aces|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff ace is "total control" of the suit, but in reality it is an inactive card|pg||
nt|dinos1: but dangerous with @sKJx under|pg||
nt|kit: Levin might get the spades wrong though|pg||
nt|ritong: where is larry cohen when we need him|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well my copy of convention card also says 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so same auction as Grue-Cheek table|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||
nt|marinesa: many pairs play 2h is 5s,4h 0-9 and 2s is 5s,4h and 10-11 something in this range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Stansby  buys 4@H south  after  2@C-2@H-3@C-P//4@C-4@D-P-4@H//end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 4@H North|pg||
nt|ritong: here, i guess hampson, with small singleton in @c and @s Ax would have passed, offering pard to go on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: long ause by each player at every opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to mention -- even if you lead Ace from AK -- at 5 level and higher that should switch back to King from AK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is you need to know whether or not to cash out   and  higher chance that you'll want to lead unsupported Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Ace gets attitude   and King gets count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco-Levin (screenmates) talking inaudibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope this hasn't been discussed already ....|pg||
nt|ritong: inactive card means it will be unuseful to develop tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think NS play Rodwell's  Inversion   where  others play DBL in Forcing Pass situations as "don't bid"  i think this DBL says the opposite -- i'm ok with you bidding more|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is, for intermediate/advanced player, it is awesome to hold stiff ace in opponent s suit|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not bad, of course, but not as great as one might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: singleton Ace overrated in a lot of situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   since this is probably NOT a Forcing Pass situation   DBL may just say "extras"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: looks like 1 off, another 11 IMP swing|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe -2, actually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if they've increased min for 1@C, maybe they've reduced min for 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hampson-Levin discussing soory|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin head in hands shking it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marinesa: especially precision pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D shows a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: on the previous hand that is|pg||
nt|algraves: a lot of work to do in slam , KX spades is very favourable of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: a joke it is for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: any shortness, 3@H ask and 3@S= singleton @C|pg||
nt|dburn: to say nothing of 4-3 diamonds with the king right, and the heart finesse on should North lead the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this method appears on their card.|pg||
nt|dburn: Hampson unwilling to enter the auction without four hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well controlled auction|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: 6@c demands several good news|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|eamongall: i played against Moss and Gitelman .... never played Stansby Martel but they were in same events |pg||
nt|ritong: as david underlined, targets are different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco was caught speeding with 4-card overcall|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: the @h 9 had for purpose to diagnose if south has a stiff honor|pg||
nt|ritong: noone would cover with Hx(x)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: if 3@S was shortness   North hand has gotten much worse|pg||
nt|ritong: of course i am not aware about tarzan's subtleties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially opposite passed partner in system that opens light|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wstuart: very true, Ira|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: however, it seems that 3@h should come from Hx rather than xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we had a system expert doing commentary last set - but it is very late where he is now  [poland]|pg||
nt|ritong: just my (uninformed) two cents|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: why tarzan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could also have been just shape showing|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: weiss/muller|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not the only facetious one around this table, seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid, anyway. They are over the first hurdle of a two-hurdle-race.|pg||
nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@C a relay rather than showing @C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: weiss/muller, sounds like wiesmuiler who played tarzar in 1930's (also champion swimmer)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 58  Nickell over Fleisher by a mere 4 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell original  2 seed    Fleisher  7|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, we had few opportunities to observe it, but muller is a rreal tough guy, especially in the opening lead compartiment|pg||
nt|sybarra: Johnny Weissmuller....correct spelling |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  3 seed and Berg has risen from  22|pg||
nt|kit: big problem here|pg||
nt|kit: would South double with KJx of spades?  That is what Levin is wondering|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D opening could have been 2290|pg||
nt|dinos1: u thk S played J from Jx?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||
nt|harmon: Fleischer leading Nickell 20-0 after 6|pg||
nt|dburn: Larry Cohen is no doubt wondering how it is that North-South have ten trumps and eight tricks, while East-West have eight trumps and nine tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: but the board will not necessarily be cancelled on the grounds that it is unlawful|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfe: and did not see what went under SK|pg||
nt|chorush: that's true, and not known by most players|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|harmon: Hey if Alfredo agrees with me I cant be tooo wrong|pg||
nt|brolucius: He didn't agree with you very quickly...|pg||
nt|harmon: as long as he did lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: We will see if he agrees with Allan by finessing in clubs next!|pg||
nt|rhelle: defence needs to be careful not to be thrown in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delay was NOT all player  --  i'm told connection played a role too|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: at 3 years of age, chickenpox is not so bad as at 10 years of age|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco thinking, all other players have left the room!|pg||
nt|ritong: nervous atmosphere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just me and Greco, kinda eerie|pg||
nt|ritong: 9 comparisons left after that one|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|algraves: lol, easy when you see all the cards|pg||
nt|harmon: Q of d my prediction|pg||
nt|ritong: so 13 it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Weinstein bid 5@C without shortness somewhere??|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: you probably know him as Olympic Swimmer|pg||
nt|ritong: ya sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: tarzan is just a comics hero:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he played Tarzan in movies |pg||
nt|sybarra: (black and white movies btw)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  Weissmuller did win a number of gold medals before becoming hollywood's tarzan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case we forgot --- nice stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell lead no just 2    5 boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn: that may come now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders will be muttering to themselves under their breath. 'How many finesses is this guy going to take?!'|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|harmon: ok Q of d now|pg||
nt|hedyg: ruff a @c first|pg||
nt|brolucius: The famous English player, Jeremy Flint, used to advise that you commit a huge amount of energy to the important boards. Operation Big Deal. That is exactly what Versace is doing.|pg||
nt|dburn: ace of hearts also not impossible, just to see whether he needs a heart pitch at all, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that's probably too risky if the king doesn't drop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss'  @S2  upside down count|pg||
nt|ritong: time running out etc  fat lady etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was asked so i'll tell the room     Fleisher-Kamil play 2@D as weak 2@H/@S opening  [wagner but often called multi]    Gitelman-Moss play natural Weak 2@D  but this hand/suit ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong for vul opening|pg||
nt|ritong: but still hopes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|harmon: thats better A|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: ensuring 10|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Gitelman wasn't thinking about duck -- just continuation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other Semi-Final match     thru 5   Grue 130  v  Kang 84|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: or   it was system glitch that caused delay|pg||

mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|kit: 5@C quite likely overcall|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dinos1: 2nd 9-carder today)|pg||

nt|kit: I only see 8|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, only 8 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I really think Kamil should have bid 5@C|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Greco will probably try 5@H|pg||

nt|dinos1: pd opened strong @c|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: the striped-tail ape double -- doubling opponents before they get to cold slam|pg||

nt|dinos1: yes but how to bid it? :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|kit: simple -- take a save over 5@H|pg||
nt|passell: not likely|pg||
nt|dinos1: only way :)|pg||
nt|kit: that would be what I call a good save|pg||
nt|harmon: mike wouldntve doubled Ira in 6s|pg||

nt|ritong: notice greco's 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: arguing the score now|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with 1@s might be less efficient|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss thought there were only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: Versace has very good feel at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Fred was in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: looks normal to reach 3NT with these two hands|pg||
nt|dburn: blimey|pg||
nt|ritong: a big fat juicy one NOW please|pg||
nt|ritong: eech|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this is a big board, but not necessarily for Diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@c a make though|pg||
mb|4C!|an|good 4!H|nt|vugraphzfe: possible correction on board 38|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: due to dispute|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry everyone -- i don't know if there is webcam this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil-Fleisher used transfer in comp to make North declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby does play Namyats |pg||
nt|dburn: true - maybe they do have a shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought 9 solid tricks might be too heavy|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@h cheap for East-West, though|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: Namyats = Stayman spelled backwards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stayman wrote about the convention but i think it was created by his partner  Vic Mitchell|pg||
nt|ritong: as usual:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 5 clubs within a hair of making here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: west claims he played the hand due to wrong information|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = 9+, 4+@h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|passell: yes seems very likely|pg||
nt|ritong: strong @c for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@D|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - although Doowkclab would be rather difficult to pronounce, I have often wondered why there is no convention called Rebreg|pg||
nt|ritong: you mean doowcalb, buddy|pg||
nt|ritong: with a k for the road|pg||
nt|ritong: go fred!|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks he is the one with the short hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: if Fred does go, so will Martel|pg||
nt|athene: hard to bid six here i think; missing a lot of key cards|pg||
nt|ritong: i m afraid so, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: kinda same hand as this afternoon starting 5@D-5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel did good to NOT push them|pg||
nt|dburn: so Fred might win an extra 100 points or so just by passing|pg||
nt|athene: in theory these artificial openings give the defending side a lot more room, but this room is not much use unless you have firm agreements exactly what shows what|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then 6@D-6@S|pg||
nt|athene: direct 5@C, delayed 5@C, double then 5@C, etc, etc|pg||
nt|dburn: he might do that, it's true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: given the chance, i bet Chip saves against 6@C    but will that happen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: If E bid 5@H, i bet auto 6@C|pg||
mb|6C|nt|algraves: NS can remind themselves that slam is natural to bid and almost every line makes|pg||
nt|kit: yet another possible slam hand|pg||
nt|dburn: if 2@s is not forcing, will North bid over it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: will eldad suggest slam?|pg||
nt|harmon: 6c here not the worst contract ive ever seen|pg||
nt|dburn: been in worse slams than 6@s on these cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3s alert|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, than 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-21   maybe specifically 19-20 ins 1st/2nd seat   i'm not sure if they do same as meckwell/greco-hampson|pg||
nt|dburn: I'm pretty sure he will save, if the question arises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there was similar hand yesterday??   the sessions starting to blend together|pg||
nt|athene: moss might bid 7 now and martel might save over that too|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: although it is certainly true that I have also been in worse slams than 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but not as many of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D game-forcing|pg||
nt|chorush: We are back to the nearly 5 club hand|pg||
nt|jillan:  can you make it double dummy Ira|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs behave, so no big deal|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he won't|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: close call    terrible @D holding   but 3 bullets|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|dburn: wrong again|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bg: 3nt makes but hard to bid|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = 4@d, 5+@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to know what EW understanding is about outside cards|pg||
nt|athene: stansby is quietly confident at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that's not the 1st bet i've lost          this set|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: nope|pg||
nt|harmon: 3n a good result spade lead beats 3n|pg||
nt|kit: the double of 3@C may backfire, as now Platnick will know to upgrade his hand if Diamond makes a move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 3@H  showing @C stop???|pg||
nt|dburn: not that close, I don't think - I certainly would not bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: 1@H-2@D-3@S= show2 5+@H-5+@C 12-14|pg||
nt|algraves: that is an interesting treatment , lots of merit in it |pg||
nt|chorush: I don't see how unless you get a trump lead or a heart and a heart continuation|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnerable brad would try|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@h = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 4+@S forcing   if 4@S then 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bg: true Henri this is an imp scale type of hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jillan:  I ment you personally >)(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auctions -- go figure|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly everything behaves |pg||
nt|passell: 2dia was a winning bid if he had rebid 1nt fred would be hard pressed to raise|pg||
nt|kit: But no move by Diamond -- I think he should make one try, and that is all Platnick would need|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  in the other room    5@D-5@S-end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: non vulnerable possible gain is not much bigger than possible loss|pg||
nt|ritong: so, better go quietly and avoid adrenalina rushes|pg||
nt|ritong: not that brad tends to avoid that:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d = 3=5=4=1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry possible correction from down 3 to down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with two baby hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if Moss thought hand was balanced he would open 1N [good 14] rather than downgrade|pg||
nt|passell: one reason I am on the side line I would rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N -- YOU MADE ME BID|pg||
nt|ritong: not anymore|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose Martel might have been worried about pushing the opponents to seven|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: we see that everything behave, declarer does not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 10    Grue 43  Kang 19|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly an inference|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco pulled out 3@D, put it back|pg||
nt|ritong: landing in anice lil spot|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to ira chorush|pg||
nt|chorush: hi everyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: tried to bid 3@D twice, BALK the second time|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, hi ira:)|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly he wa making his decision while Fred was making his|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match pushed this board  at  5@HX -100|pg||
nt|dburn: which was why his pass came as fast as it did|pg||
mc|12|nt|chorush: you need to lead trumps twice from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry we were disconnected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike - would you do that in your Big Club partnerships too?|pg||
nt|passell: probably open 1nt as it is in range for the big clubbers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 to play    Nickell now over Fleisher by ONE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so all of the specs who said North shouldn't bid 6@D on 23 -- take a bow  [on THIS hand]|pg||
nt|athene: he could sac against six and then just pass against 7, and his pd knows he needs a sure trick outside hearts?|pg||
nt|ritong: that was appetizers  now the main meal please|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Break|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but difficult for Greco to evaluate his hand that way|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman showed interest when the tray came back.  usually is very stoic|pg||
nt|ritong: good time to have a gadget for minors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
nt|rhelle: as 1@d is artificial, 4@d must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: North is looking for a save,|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: and will be surprised his partner's suit is @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N very anti-systemic according to my copy of their CC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best retort:  they also play flannery, or they also think it's bizarre? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@D = 6/9 4 cartas|pg||
nt|ritong: greco has not a great hand, and the @ss behind him do not improve matters|pg||
nt|ybob: sry private|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time i did not intend double entendre -- but it turned out to be decent straight line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- Levin thinks hand too good for 3N??|pg||
nt|kit: wonder why Levin bid 4@C with heart stopper.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: and 4@c is P/C then|pg||
nt|kit: I think he may have thought 3@H Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe he treats 3@H as 2-suiter|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems so|pg||
nt|kit: if so, they might not even reach game|pg||
nt|kit: and that could win, as slam goes down on spade lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder they have misunderstanding in simple seq|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their ACBL convention card from 2010 Trials doesn't mention this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: NS have 7 losers hope they do not vul get them into unprofitable sac|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|dburn: and seven making on a fluke if you accidentally bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel must now have a way to show his strong NT|pg||
nt|harmon: he knows his suit is clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: north wrote to east that he "thought 3d showed diamonds but not 100% sure"|pg||
nt|harmon: pard asked for d stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D meant to be mixed??  or is that their preempt|pg||
nt|chorush: I think it is mixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Most experts play that 2 spades is Nickells weakest action|pg||
nt|rhelle: does he? Partner can't have @ds after the precision 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: at least that is what the note said|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure how east kept a straight face during that explanation|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that's the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: fred: really?"|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, he knows now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|harmon: Eric might might just bid 6h|pg||
nt|chorush: Which seems an overstatement, if true|pg||
nt|kit: always possible they changed recently, and one of them forgot the change|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: Pass would be stronger|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: 2NT forcing, no doubt a useful treatment, but Versace is a bit cramped for room now|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5NT = pick a slam, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i scrambled thinking 1st seat favorable MIGHT be 9-12 but nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing "Leaping Michaels"  (2@H)-4@C/@D  shows @S & the bid minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: serious discussion by EW now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so common treatment for (2@H)-3@H to ASK stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: clearly misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: Lauria has shown 16+ with 5+@d 4@H and no 3@ss|pg||
nt|rhelle: asking partner to choose between 6@d and 6@h|pg||
nt|rhelle: great bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel Stansby CC says  "SCR vs Big @C"   but i don't know what that means :(|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|algraves: pick a slam sort of bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT probably denies 6 @ds now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes 5NT= pick a slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: and a great save|pg||
nt|ritong: martel will  know several things|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: pachtmann lost a big chance imho|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h will sound bizarre to fred's ear|pg||
nt|ritong: if any:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL either Responsive  [since hampson essentially bid 3@H]  or specifically showing @D length  [suggested by Weinsteins 4@D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row where opening bid made huge difference in rest of auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@D meant as natural|pg||
nt|chorush: I think this will be set 1 for a strange sort of push|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: contract has play, but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3@H would have been responsive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfe: fred writes: not discussed. 2245|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, fred is super happy|pg||
nt|ritong: he had the right tool for a hand which is usually very tough to negotiate|pg||
nt|mslair: can't sign off in 5 hearts   I think he will bid 6 hearts  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss bouncing nervously|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ritong: @s Q10 is awkward|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 13   Grue 45 v Kang 19|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: just bid 4@s and check what happened after smoke clears up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss also writes 2245|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss: he doesn't know anything about my hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfe: north says "i guess 3d asked for stopper"|pg||
nt|harmon: lotsa of exciting boards here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: pick one yourself?|pg||
nt|rhelle: hahahahaha|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfe: south claimed trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play  FLEISHER leads Nickell by 6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rather than color rank shape of normal crash|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@c "you pick one", 6@d "all right", 6NT "not that one"|pg||
nt|algraves: well bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' double was a very good tactic; he really wanted the opps out of 3NT looking at his club holding|pg||
nt|jillan:  well done!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. this table is WAY behind|pg||
pc|h5|nt|algraves: well he was probably no 0454 as no 3@C so 6@C 1453|pg||
nt|harmon: 6n wrong sided but safe|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 3 cards in @D Versace would probably have bid 4@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks  EVERYONE|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: three trumps with north, and no raise from south|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chorush: Nickell will shift to the heart king and Katz will have nothing to lose by overtaking it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our other room is on break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without @S ruff -- martel just needed one more of @S8 or 9 to have a chance|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|harmon: found out they stuck by system unless eric overbids with 3s|pg||
nt|dburn: he has a chance|pg||
nt|ritong: he clearly has a chance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh 7 IS good enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bad|pg||
nt|athene: he just needs to catch singleton 8 or 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some consolation for going wrong on previous board bidding|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: they've picked up imps on last 5 boards for a 21-0 run|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he still has a guess|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|ritong: south did not lead a top @c either|pg||
nt|athene: @S89 doubleton? that has to be against the odds|pg||
nt|ritong: he s not likely to hold AK|pg||
nt|dburn: but he is not likely to get it wrong - restricted choice, and all that|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: north could have only six diamonds but there is so much evidence stacking up that the spade was a singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @D10 return all will be clear|pg||
nt|ritong: south would probably do something different with @d Kxx|pg||
nt|ritong: in the bidding and on lead|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and declarer is going to see the diamond count in just a moment|pg||
nt|athene: unless south plays a small spade right now?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: did Greco give declarer a chance for extra trick by failure to split honors?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit of a Grosvenor|pg||
nt|chorush: Weinstein has picked up 2 pieces of news, both bad.  Trumps are not splitting and the club ace is wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: put him to the guess whilst north could be 2-3-6-2?|pg||
nt|dburn: he could be, but that @dK lead was maybe not from three|pg||
nt|athene: sure, i think he would have got it right anyway|pg||
nt|athene: but might as well make him work as hard as you can for his six imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we should mention   martel's play of @Cx toward 9  was crucial to glean all the extra info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss could NOT afford to rise with Honor doubleton or  martel could setup @C trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Hampson could have scored both of his trump tricks on this line|pg||
pc|c5|nt|algraves: some might open east hand 1NT or if 1@D then rebid 2@C afraid to reverse with marginal reversing values so credit to Lauria for just bidding naturally |pg||
nt|ahollan1: ooo  2nd overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will say " sry mate" and weinstein " np  i would do same"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: at least 25 minutes behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good on them for that -- single dummy  it is decent contract |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but more important  always good to show partner you're on his side|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: levin had a tough decision to make|pg||
nt|ritong: his side found @ds, which is not obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the pip|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h8|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: well, Hampson isn't planning to take any heart finesses, but he won't have to|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: running the four would be cutest|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|dburn: well done|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: loud discussion from hall, kibitzer gail greenberg hurries to close door|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he claimed 7 on a squeeze but ns objected|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director has been nagging the players about being slow now he says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they might not be able to play all the boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just another push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, if game is cold and his counterparts find @ds too, it would be an important loss|pg||
nt|dburn: Stansby, who has to cling to the hope that he can beat the hand somehow, won't keep hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2010 trials    http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/MartelStansby.jpg|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: So Katz' double transformed a loss to a gain. Hard to blame Stansby for thinking that 3NT wasn't going to make|pg||
nt|rhelle: another testing board|pg||
nt|chorush: Big opportunity here for diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match this was push at 7@S=|pg||
nt|dburn: may set a record for the smallest finesse ever taken in the Vanderbilt|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the wonders of our game  -- that partscore got back the 6 imps lost on the slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: hard for NS to cause much damage here, 5@H way too expensive|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|harmon: they were right too|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  how to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 boards played, 45-45. Incredible match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond-Platnick really put on pressure in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/GrecoHampson.jpg|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@S is just natural Game Force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   there is another 7@S hand coming   it was a swing in Grue match|pg||
mb|2C!|an|drury|nt|dburn: were they? wasn't North going to be show-up-squeezed in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry i always try to say when declarer claims t1 because people ask why I didn't type in the cards that went by|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually other room only on 59   but other match at least 4 boards faster|pg||
nt|ritong: muller has to move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good interference in our room too|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@s is @s and @c, since likely 2@s would be forcing already|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  13 is that pushed grand|pg||
nt|chorush: They have received the same sort of preemption here with one important difference: Greco knows that Hampson has a GAME FORCE with spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director just walked in, warning upcoming|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room it went 1C-1D-1S so North's hand was very ill-defined|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: mrs greenberg is brad's mom|pg||
nt|algraves: so cheek and gure play negative doubles after 2NT unusual|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: south said he was able to pitch|pg||
nt|chorush: A double by Katz here might have turned what will be a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes a double from Katz wold have made it a bit simpled for Nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 2@s hoping pard can bid NTs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco hand is HUGE on this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  Fleisher has read Kit's book -- opens 3@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: :)|pg||
nt|kit: interesting that Weinstein redoubles -- I would think most expert pairs bid 1@S on that hand rather than show points|pg||
mb|4S|nt|harmon: grue coulda pitched his q of d|pg||
nt|dburn: he was right about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, south has a rockcrusher for @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can Hampson envision @H void?    no way they bid the grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but big gain just be getting to 6level|pg||
nt|chorush: Since Hampson has received a grand slam invitation, he may be able to bid it now with his trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note Martel did NOT violate NT range of 12-14  [sometimes will open 11 not vul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: no diff|pg||
nt|wstuart: Surely Nick will bid here, prob 5@C rather than 4NT.|pg||
nt|chorush: Mind you Katz has a terrible hand but he does have what he knows are a wasted AK of hearts|pg||
nt|wstuart: wrong again.|pg||
nt|dinos1: and now 3@s will be GF?|pg||
nt|kit: and Platnick's takeout double with 2-1 in majors wouldn't be a popular choice either|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, sry, PH :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  Fleisher in 3@HX|pg||
nt|kit: can't be GF, as passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue needed Q10 of d|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|chorush: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Tough decision between 5@C and 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: that will be 11 tricks and 3 IMPs - bringing the match exactly level|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he s not certain small slam will be bid other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be good hand for partnership discussion  --   greco's choices of 5@H, 5N, 6@D  ....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|dburn: pity, really - meant he had to use Drury, a method fit only for Visigoths and Vandals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29  Hampson in 12@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wstuart: hmmm|pg||
nt|jillan:  don't think Nickell tought pass was NF|pg||
nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|ritong: and an accident, like a @c ruff, can happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well last few hands we've sure seen some      weird|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher in 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't make - but this will|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: makeable|pg||
nt|ritong: auction is crystal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: create doubt -- might help explain how Diamond team won the World Championships in Philly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rosenblum Cup|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a deciding board|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, GIB would lead a club and duck it, but Martel will lead a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if moss thought that passing his hand was a mildly swingy action?|pg||
nt|athene: or just that it was the best action available|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: guess @ds and bye bye clara|pg||
nt|bg: personally I am not a fan of not bidding out shape the 3 club bid could be an artificial force in some structures I would bid 4 clubs over 3 spades and show the shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought @CK to @D finesse was mirage|pg||
nt|ritong: a decision, al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems extra chances if low @D from hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the guess is: who has @d Hx|pg||
nt|ritong: when south can have @d HHx, i agree small to ten is better|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been easier in hearts, this|pg||
nt|jillan:  this will cost....|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: pass over 1@s is three @ss and mini values|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chorush: will be down 2 since Martel won't get th diamond lead he was hoping for|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to diagnose what went through their minds, but the difference between the two auctions is brad's surprising double|pg||
nt|dinos1: still better quickly to show the main value - good @s suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east says he forgot pass was forcing|pg||
nt|athene: it could work well if they bid in the other room and declarer perhaps finesses against south's @SQxx or something|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: now of course, if north ducks smoothly..|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble is " please look closer"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: and pass over 2@h is " no, really sorry mate"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: brad sees dummy, calls director, suggests ginossar has broken tempo over 2@S|pg||
nt|ritong: my perso style would be a fitjump in 2@s after pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spoiler alert -- y'all will freak out when you see West @H holding on  29|pg||
nt|ritong: i prepare the shriek|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: showing 5@s 4@d inviting values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: none of these players will pass immediately with no problem as some others do|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades, declarer will have to pick up the trumps|pg||

mb|2S!|an|to play|nt|algraves: how does he make after the ruff sluff?|pg||
nt|chorush: Its a good question Al, but with his Jxxx of trumps I personally don't think he would bid 6D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the real point    opponent interference makes confident small/grand slam bidding very difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "if"   what a wimpy word Al|pg||
nt|harmon: 6h from the short side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have had more than their share of strong 1@C this set|pg||
nt|ritong: don t think martel will gamble this out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with 3 to score   O'Rourke leads Nickell by 7|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think DBL showed a 5+ card minor + 4 card major?|pg||

nt|ybob: sus aperturas van de 11 a 15, 1@C de 16 +|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H or 1@s?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 4+ @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since other room didn't get to slam    small vs grand  insignificant imp difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director "you need to hurry"|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel may be a little worried at this point|pg||
nt|dburn: now, is Moss in a force?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: It's interesting that Martel didn't jam with 3@H here - I guess he thought he had enough defense with both majors that he wasn't worried about getting outbid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: diredctor "the boards ween't that hard at at any other table"|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match has finished 1st Quarter    Grue over Kang  57-35|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hampson " i promise we won't play ant faster with you standing over the table"|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|dburn: most pairs play that if East bids a minor, South's pass is forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've seen agreements that DBL forcing to 2@D, 2@H and 2N|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: 3@h = 4=6=2=1 exactly|pg||
nt|chorush: battle of nerves here|pg||
nt|poohbear: The  " I hope they run " redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice Support DBL even when Hampson's 1@S implies 5+|pg||
nt|chorush: 4Hxx down 2 with trumps led early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i say implies since not sure if they'll bid 1@S with really good 4-card suit|pg||
nt|dburn: some play the same way if East bids 2@h also|pg||
nt|athene: forcing over 2minor seems sensible|pg||
nt|dburn: but most give up over 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  especially when major runnout shows 5+ suit|pg||
nt|athene: firstly the level is low enough you are very likely to have somewhere to go; secondly if you double them and it makes, it's not a game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and minors often a scramble with |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: 3@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought previous set 1N was Semi-Force     maybe Semi over 1@H and absolute over 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: can t be 4, since 2@d denied 4@h imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room on board 31|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|harmon: he cant unless ht onside that was my point|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: I try to get the info the write down on notepads and pass around but sometimes no one asks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North has choices ... 3@s = strong relay, only asks controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = weak relay, asks for max and controls|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|harmon: before everyone yelled at mne lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Not that often that 2NT is right as "save" over 2 spades; here it is going to make when 2 spades also would have made (I think)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d = signoff, asks partner to bid 4@h, so that he can pass or bid the final contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's PASS 0-4 HCP|pg||
nt|harmon: This is Davids usual rubber bridge hand(eric's)|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel's likewise, but at least Hampson has a maximum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco visibly not happy with 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously Greco too strong to be able to play the hand -- other situations Hampson would be able to transfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have our room been slow or  the other room fast?|pg||
nt|dburn: both, or neither|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that they're on final board|pg||
nt|ritong: that s the question|pg||
nt|athene: hard for the defence to get anything going here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: lets see if fred can save 1 imp making 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss trying to find an escort to leave the room and ginossar tells him just to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some back and forth between boards about the alleged tempo break|pg||
nt|wstuart: is it better for katz to dbl again?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 4@s = a slight invitation|pg||
nt|chorush: potentially 600 coming provided a trump shift is made after the first club lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|wstuart: Asked by a spec;  I think His DBL of 2@S is probably more strongly penalty oriented.|pg||
nt|chorush: Depends on what their methods are. They might as well not play 2 spades dbld because I don't think they will beat it. Could be wrong though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  thru 29   Grue 186  Kang 150|pg||
nt|athene: they can't take trumps out and set up and cash two hearts - declarer pitches on the fourth diamond long before that happens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joe Grue has already won a National event in Louisville -- the North American Pairs  [formerly  Grand National Pairs]|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: whoa baby   Fleisher just picked up another 10    2 to play  Fleisher leads Nickell by 16|pg||
nt|ritong: fred could try for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: like 4@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Fleisher vs Diamond would be rematch from final of the 2010 Team Trials  and  final of 2010 spingold??|pg||
nt|ritong: his hand is limited|pg||
nt|ritong: but he took the low road|pg||
nt|ritong: (confidentially, he knows brad can be overactive in finishing situations)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: asking for @H shift instead of giving away @C position|pg||
nt|dinos1: and dcl may think E has @h suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: fred the magician can only make 3 if N plays 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|ritong: he has 8 on top and NS can try to establish a long @s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: try to code THAT into GIB/Deep Finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: just seen the auction at the other table, where Greco took another fearless action|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director said if tray passes back within 25 seconds it is not a break in tempo|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: and @H5 doesn't help clarify |pg||
nt|dburn: I guess, if the auction started 2@c-2@d-2@h Kokish, you might have a shot|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@S by no means automatic with such a balanced hand and empty suit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|harmon: Diamond will jump out to a huge lead this board 1 matbe 2 imps!!!:)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: but still it is love all|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: but the way the Fleisher team has played, the Diamond team has had to do a lot of hard running to avoid being annihilated|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: cashing time|pg||
nt|bg: or leads a third dia:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you all think the 4@H bid is ok?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves: yes , ptich heart on third diamond , Q@S, low@S to J|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe @H6 discard on @CA did|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that would apply over 1@C-1@D//2@H|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|ritong: good move|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: specs all bid 2@d|pg||
nt|ritong: and anyways, knowing the @c shortness, his @c holding was not pretty|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Greco should get this right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nearly 30 minutes behind|pg||
nt|chorush: A spec has pointed out that Levin's redbl will cost only 3 imps relative to passing and that it had the potential to turn a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if hampson had played !AH @H  then might be harder for south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22 minutes remain on clock   so according to new/frequently documented ACBL rules -- we may see some boards removed from play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: toughest play now is   "smooth duck"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: but the overcall gummed up the works|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|algraves: club finesse , A and @H|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|kit: this can make with spade guess -- and since he knows East has 4 spades, maybe that is his best chance?|pg||

mb|p|nt|harmon: how|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: if brad opens, they will prolly be in 4NT|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grue-cheek, the speed demons  are on board 16|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3NT wasn't cold - if East had a club stop, it might not have made|pg||
mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious that Moss opens playing 2/1  and Verhees did NOT playing a Big Club system|pg||
nt|dburn: then, he has the ace and jack of spades, and the lead is in dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP  (3)4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're 7 boards ahead of their other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 1 board to play   Grue +40   so there's 1st Finalist|pg||
nt|dburn: blood in the water|pg||
nt|dburn: but South may not quite have enough to double this, then sit for 2@h doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1@s = 9+, 4+@h, unbalanced|pg||
mb|2D!|an|pick better|nt|harmon: potential slam here|pg||
nt|rhelle: so NS are now in a GF situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but my copy of CC has been wrong a couple times this set :(|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative is to pass and then x 2@H for t/o - but he hasn't quite the right shape for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 4NT swish|pg||
nt|harmon: hts havent been played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comparisons thru 8   Grue 143  Kang 86|pg||
nt|dburn: wonder what Martel is thinking of doing? doubling? passing? saving?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: NS play precision so 1@D can be many kinds of hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: apparently NS don't open bal 11 with Precision 1@D   [makes sense with North hand -- especially vul]|pg||
nt|dburn: the last of those|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wstuart: very nice slam - hard to bid.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he has to, tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for specs unfamiliar with the treatment    2N showed Balanced Game Force   a totally new concept that was introduced in 1920s|pg||
nt|bg: this pair obviously use 2nt as a balanced openig bid vs others who use Jacoby--both styles have their merits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that sounds right according to their pre alert|pg||
nt|ritong: i love that 3@h bid|pg||
nt|ritong: meaning " i would open 3@h"|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S isn't likely to gain a lot of imps, but double just might|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he thinks that even if north can pass, with four decent hearts, they are under east, so it won't be worth that much|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he does know that West is 2-2 in the majors and not 3-3, so he might have taken a swing at it|pg||
nt|ritong: if by any weird way they land in 3NT, he will make per force|pg||
nt|athene: if you have to bring those spades in, you play for the drop, yes|pg||
nt|athene: knowing east has four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil never bid  Gitelman in 3@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|wstuart: Did east miss his chance by not splintering over the 2@H rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, Wayne, slam is quite good and hard to bid. I always have trouble when I don't start with a direct forcing raise. Let's see if Katz does better than I would|pg||
nt|dinos1: no intermediates at all!|pg||
nt|wstuart: my ass is sore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin "i liked it alot, .... obviously!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: stansby retracts his lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: some danger here - if Greco thinks that's a singleton, he might...|pg||
nt|harmon: cant beat the hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might cash the @HK before a second @D which saves the day (partially)|pg||
nt|dburn: he can beat it, but not if he wins this trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute position|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: long pause by Greco, "sorry" with shake of head|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DA is right only if hampson can ruff 2nd round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  ducking feels like might lead to later endplay|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: second "sorry"|pg||
nt|dburn: even if that diamond were a singleton, it could still be right to duck - but not if declarer had the ace and jack of clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: so this is a truly awful problem for Greco - but after his earlier defence to 3NT, I would back him to go right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that's where Greco is  ---  what if Geoff did NOT lead singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if only it were that easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: retraction plays   and    reduction bids|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chorush: Most partnerships have a rule that there are generally no new suits bid at the four level. So 4D is a cue for heartswith slam interest|pg||
nt|harmon: huge lead probably gone now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: while saying that I myself would have let this through an hour ago|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: what a lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dinos1: @hK is rather over so will play @hA low @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like tough problem for Diamond at trick 2  -- starts with what Platnick's carding is when dummy shows singleton @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  in context of standard carding  ---  what should 3rd hands play show at trick 1?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz the tables dont seem to be connected?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jillan:  well done Nick|pg||
nt|chorush: vwd and will duly make|pg||
nt|wstuart: a well earned push/|pg||
nt|ritong: all these considerations about preempting pard etc are not really reliable  preempts are precise bids  here muller has a textbook 3@h good suit, no outside values|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfe: fred calling cards so softly moss has to ask|pg||
nt|chorush: In slam bidding, there is a special responsibility placed upon the partner who holds the AK of trumps. His partner is doing all this inviting without them, so... should strain to ...|pg||
nt|chorush: accept|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now    was martel bidding 2@H because 45?   yep :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know  there was a @S loser either way|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wstuart: from a spec:  "I don't understand the bidding - West seems to have pushed to slam when East should have been the one doing so?"|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: meckwell went for 1100 on final board  against a vul game -- so it really does look like Diamond v Fleisher  tomorrow in the Semi-Finals|pg||

nt|passell: moss may raise 5dia though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other SemiFinal  thru 25   Grue [ 21 seed] 97  vs  Kang [ 41] 53|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H denies 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and establishes Game Force|pg||
nt|athene: come on fred, repeat the winning formula|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 only?|pg||
nt|ritong: he certainly won t pass|pg||
nt|athene: could bid 7 - then martel might sac|pg||
mb|6D|nt|passell: hard not to|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Many play that the higher cue is more trumps and less HCP then the lower cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h also promises at least 1 control, so North will be wondering what to do next. 6@d looks possible|pg||
nt|harmon: can he have 2 controls??|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s asks for controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: bd 9 6NT +1|pg||
nt|passell: well done|pg||

nt|ritong: now martel smiling|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 2@S-P-P-4@C/@D often @H & the minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have been relay for more info    not sure about implications of direct 3@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: just not sure if 6th @C shown|pg||
nt|chorush: different pairs have different uses. Could be 2 spades shows 4 card support and 2C shows 3. Each to his own|pg||
nt|passell: needs 2 3-2 breaks and a lot more|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: i think double dummy defense can set this 4    starts with @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: now a battle of undertricks|pg||
nt|ritong: three looks like a lot of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then they must untangle @S winners while retaining transportation in @H -- extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|bg: rebid of the minor usually shows 6 with 3 hearts better to raise hearts with unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ritong: but|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Bruce -- but there is slight impact playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|ritong: try @c hook, loses, a @h back|pg||

nt|passell: yes not putting him in dummy made it fool proof|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, that was rubbish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is bidding  16 -- the final board of 3rd Quarter|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 to 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just the kind of hand EW want at this point|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if their opponents had made 6NT at the other table, they might not want it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to have sequence that shows invite with exactly 4333|pg||
nt|dburn: 6NT was... well, I've seen worse|pg||
nt|passell: moss gittleman having their way here  their team mates dont suspect they are in this great shape|pg||
nt|warrens:  isn't it about 70%, either a finesse or 3-3 @C's or a black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot worse, to be honest - almost convincing myself it's a good contract|pg||
nt|passell: yes  at least 70 percent slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i would be very sad not to be in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: having seen Brad in action -- might just bid 6N here|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||

nt|ahollan1: still 12-14  but notice not vul  11 snuck in|pg||
nt|athene: we were mentioning about preferring not to lead 4-card suits against 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: let's see fred's take on that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: ginossar/pachtmann not having fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell v O'Rourke showing  Nickell +7 with 2 to play  there is possible scoring error of 3 or 4 imps [it would be in favor of O'Rourke]|pg||
nt|hedyg: live streaming from the OR: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|dburn: but it would have been wrong to bid eight - that really was against the odds|pg||
nt|dinos1: trf to trumps shows good raise, 2@h wd be weak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great work getting explanations into BBO record!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table in Grue-Kang match only on 12    don't know if they're under time pressure or not|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: Chpis turn to get his lead directing DBL in|pg||
nt|chorush: will Katz think his hand worth a raise?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip's|pg||
nt|ritong: but things do not come to slam|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you have a choice between a suit headed by the ace and one without, you go for the suit without the ace, normally|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: untouchable today|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S instead of 1N means Moss ON DEFENSE gets 100 honors|pg||
nt|bg: not much joy in this hand eather|pg||
nt|ritong: but imps no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: even if few|pg||
nt|hedyg: far left is Cayne, far right Amoils|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like 10 tricks on a low @c lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N?  wow  that wasn't on the list of bids to consider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both matches play same boards, ours cannot restart before the other match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or if they do -- we won't get to see boards on vugraph until 2nd match restart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rhelle: with the @hs breaking 22|pg||
nt|dburn: when did this match start?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chorush: Nick won't|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's interesting that EW do'nt ahve any special methods here to try and get the contract played by the hand that has a @C stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: long ago|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, on approximately what day?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: 2:25 ago|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson and the director won t go to holidays together|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting non-strength showing reverse in comp   when partner has implied no 4-card major|pg||
nt|ritong: this is true essentially when a slam choice occurs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very close decision from Platnick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss @D6 upside-down count |pg||
nt|ritong: if you pick the non aced suit, it cannot go x to the ace x ruff|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: but as we see  Weinstein obviously does bid 1N over DBL with 4-card major  so good to have partnership agreement|pg||
nt|harmon: great result for Fleischer in OR|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chorush: Guess that is commentator's curse|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's reasonable to play pass to say he doesn't have any reason for a @C lead to come up to his hand, then try and get the major suit contracts played by east, who might have a @C ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: and a @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d by Versace would have shown both majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @C 9 was upside down count - the @s2 upside down attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: so North has an odd number of @cs and likes @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likes decent 5-card spade suit opposite expected short @H in partner's hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: he knows pd has stiff @h |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now he just has to find 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing all hands  he can even make overtrick --- but at the table ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein wants to kill dummy's @C suit but can't do all of   knock out @HA  knock out @DA  tap dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think this might make double dummy.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what?|pg||
nt|athene: tricky - @HQ perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @D10 @CA @C   let opp open up majors or give dummy entry to @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: please   don't ask what to pitch from dummy on 2 @C tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but abandoning a diamond winner in dummy might not work out so well|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't really have much to go on|pg||
nt|athene: except he probably knows south led from Q10xx and hence won't have any more appealing lead|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ10xx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|ritong: best is to duck that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred fidgeting with quitted trick, hand folded|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  bigtrain [Walter Johnson] says if scoring error  it would be Nickell +1 with 1 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing our match had ANY spectators|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: with bbotv can watch more than one room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- never thought about them  even though one is ME|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred finally fans his cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we who logged in to watch this match  saw a lot of very solid play from Diamond|pg||
nt|passell: unreal taking this position with a monster game going|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West hand looks like NT to me too|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: bd 12 5 imps to Grue, 4@H -3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 28 - 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Fred faced his hand to hurry things along|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @s to A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room  Mike Passell just referred to EW  as  Levinstein  :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: ))|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: wow   i'm told in other match  one room played 1NXX+1  South|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dinos1: after dcl will find out E has 3@d and 3 trumps he'll fin @cJ|pg||
nt|dinos1: ruffing fin i mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 28 where EW made 4@H    the other room in 3N  by NORTH|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: south playing @CQ then @C10 to show spade strength|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|h2|nt|chorush: Yes, squeeze looks like it will work|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: suit-preference signals are very important defending against the auction 1nt p p p, as the defence often really don't know where their strength lies, even quite late into the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D definitely wrong   soo which major??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bg: sometimes better to use only two entries to play on side duit like clubs which requires two finesses  and jus lead spade away from king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa    de ja vu|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wstuart: if he can ruff 2@C and strip squeeze N he might do it.|pg||
nt|wstuart: complictaed, let me think....|pg||
nt|wstuart: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H3 ducked endplays declarer|pg||
nt|athene: well, or @HAK10|pg||
nt|athene: martel just takes his tricks for one down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all the hands -- doesn't seem moss can go wrong as long as he follows suit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe moss is wondering what sequence of plays he should follow to persuade south to unblock @HJxx if he holds that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chorush: Nick will have to believe Chip's diamond 9|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: plus in both rooms is good     when one is game  better |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|dinos1: now @s to 8, @d ruff, claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but kudos to Chip for playing 2 trick better|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves: he had to draw exactly 2 @H then play on clubs. Lauria can win thrid club and play @S but you ruff in dummy and ruff club and play last heart to dummy to draw trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: bd 13 2@s by E|pg||
nt|ritong: moss might act brutally here|pg||
nt|athene: some would never open 4major with two aces - if you have that agreement it's easy to pass north in tempo and perhaps persuade east to do something rash|pg||
nt|athene: passing looks normal anyway actually |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 scores in  Fleisher leads by 37 over Onstott    Berg over Lynch by 74|pg||
nt|chorush: One moral of this story is that when you play cards to help partner, it may help declarer as much or more. the diamond 9 was a tipoff, with the K he would have no reason to ...|pg||
nt|chorush: discourage a diamond return|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT on these auctions shows specifically long and good @D since 2NT would be bid on 18-19 bal hands.|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Nick's hand is too good for his action|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nice point, Ira|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, he|pg||
nt|chorush: Both sides make exactly 3 of major on this hand. A triumph for the law of total tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this is wrong"|pg||
nt|algraves: he was playing east to be 7411 I think|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c = mild invitation|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@h needs 3-3, 6N - @c3-3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: on the other hand, 1NT with four trumps, a singleton and a king would be fancy|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should redouble anyway, but it's possible the 4@H opener has already done the work|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nickell will end set trailing O'Rourke by 8|pg||
nt|lc: The triumph was for the 3@H bid -- which looks ugly, but forced East into the wrong guess.|pg||
nt|dinos1: specs want pass, but pd hasnt to have @dA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hands|pg||
nt|dinos1: hardly pd has 4@s4@c - wd X 1@h then|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bergen would bid 1@S-3@S   that might convince East to Pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing upside down -- @H4 was just too tough to read|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably easier to find 9 tricks in 3@S than in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which really?   3@S with West   or   Pass from East??|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean 1) would bergen preempt two passed hands and 2) would west give up?|pg||
nt|ritong: esat*|pg||
nt|ritong: east**|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure 3@S -- descriptive     East Passing -- that's why i said "might"  only 5 trump, 3 quick outside losers [3@S won't have Ace]|pg||
nt|dinos1: german, zeit = time|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: last board.  thanks all for watching.  quarterfinals start tomorrow at 1pm EDT|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play variable 14-16 and 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Jan must have reconnected|pg||
nt|algraves: they play more like 13 to bad 16|pg||
nt|wstuart: An interesting consideration on these 3NT rebids is what opener's holding in responder's suit is - it's reasonable to define it as with showing 1 or less or 2 or more.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: There are many slam hands where that is the crucial and hard to determine peice of information if you don't ahve a specific agreemnt.|pg||
nt|rhelle: very hard to see ... you see, even at this level they slip up in defence|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: but teams can agree to start earlier|pg||
nt|ritong: an other difficult decision|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we have the scores now, great!|pg||
nt|algraves: versace right on the rule of 2 or 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|algraves: 7 tricks, no outside defense, classic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was corrected about King lead -- normally that is strongest playing Rusinow vs NT  --  but after unable to overcall 1@D  what hand wants partner to unblock??|pg||
nt|ritong: an exciting board to boot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when raised, what to do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 1pm EDT = 5pm GMT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S easy  -- Moss 4@S probably easy too  since @Dxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're actually ahead of other room now!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of this set    nice job from our operator  John Schwartz|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D= at most 1 king|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - great decision by Fleisher to double 3NT for a spade lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  0-1 controls  [A2 K1]|pg||
nt|ritong: other room after 2NT 3NT fleisher found a winning double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told BBO schedule might be wrong   and actually  10am Louisville time|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rhelle: 1@d = 11-15, 3+@d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|dinos1: X now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is a real chance for Fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: five diamonds (even six diamonds) look vastly preferable to 3NT|pg||
nt|wstuart: Prob 2NT showing the str NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D tends to deny 4@H/@S  UNLESS strong enough to at least invite over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|dinos1: now right-sided 3N?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: enterprising 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Open Room  Greco thought a long time before passing 3@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: short break and then 2nd segment|pg||
nt|dburn: this may not work so well for Greco - he can't beat 3NT from Martel's side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2N=20-21   west seems too good for that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if in 4@S, i think declarer has a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: take the plus|pg||
nt|algraves: and lauria adds his three tricks and there you have it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wot hapen there?|pg||
nt|wstuart: but Chip will likely just kick it in to 3NT knowing he is facing at least some @H wastage for a slam.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could bid 3@h, just to make sure|pg||
nt|wstuart: true, they still have chances here|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@d now or 1M?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too good to guess the major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great call David|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: good match, shakes hands with opps.  fred: good play cashing @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok  this time for sure   11 am Louisville|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: thsi must imply a @D fit.|pg||
nt|ritong: no tilt|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Stanby probably will bid 3S|pg||
nt|ritong: muller is a great player|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and quick refresh now shows Grue [original 21] beat Cayne [ 4]     Fleisher [7] over Nickell [2]|pg||
nt|mslair: this is a nightmare|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match is on 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h looks like a make - especially with the @d Ace before the king|pg||
nt|rhelle: a game on pretty minimal values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play precision so 3@S weaker than playing 'standard'|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 11 EASTERN IS CORRECT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room North opened 1NT - for reasons he better understand than I|pg||
nt|rhelle: and they made slam tried, all the way to 5@h :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this was a very exciting set, been a long time since I saw so many swings|pg||
nt|rhelle: at this level, that is - my Monday night game produces them as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note partnership agreement that allows Platnick to PASS the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|athene: three down now|pg||
nt|athene: so 3 imps to fleisher i guess|pg||
nt|ritong: and a deserved victory  they polayed great all along|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
nt|lc: I always tell my students : "Don't lay down"  or "underlead" aces.  I hope they don't see this deal. :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard for NS - S consider his @dK as losing card, and N consider @dQ as wasting oe)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in real world ...|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the situation is a little different than DBL by 2nd and and cue from advancer|pg||
nt|dinos1: still i wdnt bid 2@d if i were going to pass any response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i still would have expected Q forces bid to confirmed fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lc: Of course, after @CA, @C, West would have to switch to SPADES -- not DIAMONDS to beat it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Sergey  -- but WITH AGREEMENT can certainly see the appeal|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfe: my computer is having some problem|pg||
nt|algraves: now Versace will have to guess TX in trumps to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little bit more Liz! |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now they need to not overstate their values.|pg||
nt|wstuart: VWD for Martel-Stansby!|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a reason they have won so many championships.|pg||
nt|dburn: so Fleisher will take a lead of 41 into the final quarter - but if the deals are anything like this lot, there will be plenty of chances for Diamond to get those back|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chorush: looks like this one can't be beaten|pg||
nt|wstuart: (VWD = very well done)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: Diamond also in 4@S on  14   but Stansby never bid with North hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not sure they'd get to game|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  was fun|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sometime your yesterday|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: even if our heroes lost:-|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: ciao a tutti|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, as I told - tuff hands for bidding|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Deutsch [original  16]  dethrones the defenders Monaco   152-91|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|ritong: see you to morrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ok, we're done, see you tomorrow|pg||

nt|ritong: see you all to morrow for further adventures|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rhelle: anyway .. thank you all for watching some exciting and great bridge|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the Fleisher team is playing very well - its captain not least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how long the break will be -- depends on when other match finishes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: closing, back in a few minutes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: merci a tous   see you soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they finished all boards!!   that was far from automatic 25 minutes ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  15 minute break after other room finishes|pg||
nt|chorush: actually "only" 20 minutes late|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2 minutes late|pg||
nt|chorush: with screens they allow about 2:15 for 16 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all rooms will start at the same time, with duplicated hands|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  30 so you can watch them finish after negotiated claim here|pg||
nt|dinos1: thx all, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 1 hour 50 minutes|pg||
nt|dinos1: bye|pg||
