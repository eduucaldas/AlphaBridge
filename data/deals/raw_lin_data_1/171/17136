nt|mamos: strongest teams with work pressure and studies|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mamos: though East does have a monster hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: Diamonds play pretty badly @HA ace and ruff spade and ruff overruff and heart ruff with jack|pg||
nt|pelu: can u make 7@C on @C lead??|pg||
nt|davidstern: 7@C probably only fails with the actual 4-0 trump break|pg||
nt|pelu: can N be squeezed in Major?|pg||
nt|mamos: the black suit breaks are very cruel |pg||
nt|pelu: so a @S-lead best for defense|pg||
nt|davidstern: Copuld make 13 on a high crossruff except the second spade gets knocked off|pg||
nt|davidstern: All very very very cruel|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: In the CR it made on a club lead when north got squeezed in the major suits|pg||
nt|davidstern: Eats ruffed two hearts in dummy using diamond and diamond ruff as entry|pg||
nt|mamos: the Polish pair are both experienced in School and Junior bridge  is this a newish partnership do we know?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: needs a spade lead to beat 7@C   |pg||
nt|ady: on a trump lead  A@H is cashed and heart ruffed   back with a diamond and ruff a heart  ruff   ruff a diamond   and run trumps  and north gets squeezed in the majors|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@D  3 controls|pg||
mb|5H|nt|davidstern: Results at http://tinyurl.com/6amku6e change 1-6 to see previous results|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west can ask about Q@C |pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|pelu: 5NT = @CQ and no Kings|pg||
nt|ady: not sure of theri methods  5NT may confirm Q@C   but no outside king|pg||
nt|ady: Polandill do to come out unscathed here    first they have to bid the grand slam   and then make it|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: black suit breaks unkind   not allowing spade suit to come in|pg||
nt|mamos: first hurdle over come  now can they make?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: still have to take the right line  and not attempt to set up spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont think I would make this. |pg||
nt|mamos: I think  I would fail  |pg||
nt|ady: this may still go wrong   their is potential of 3 club ruffs  and discarding a heart on 2nd spade winner     that will not work|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer got a trump lead at the other table and did play to squeeze North   so very well done indeed|pg||
nt|ady: declarer on trump lead in CR has little choice of plays when seeing clubs 4-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: Despite some kind specs I am almost certain at the table I would fail on this hand|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pelu: the Squeeze worked automatic - and was only chance when he in trick 1 got @C's 4-0 - on a @D-lead looks like a cross-ruff best chance - and down 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ruffing two spade high and only going down on 4-0 trumps looks excellent. The trump lead seriously steers declarer to the right line|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: at this table declarer does not know of bad trump break so has no reason to think that Spades cannot be set up|pg||
nt|davidstern: Must fail now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|davidstern: Looks easy club to dummy and ruff spade and cliam until North shows out of trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure a plan with odds - very bad luck for Igla|pg||
nt|davidstern: This is a truly excellent hand worthy of some writing|pg||
