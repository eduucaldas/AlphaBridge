mb|2H|nt|mrdct: helen snashall is a very agressive player so it wouldn't surprise me if she doubled|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: smart passed pretty quickly, Lachman thought for a bit|pg||

nt|caitlin: 3N E-W|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds just not 4-1 and you are at least breaking even by trying to get the spade away|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: W could have tried for clubs to break nicely.... before trhowing diabmond entry then only 2 down|pg||
nt|athene: yes sure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: but the diamond would work out except when diamonds are 4-1 :)|pg||

mb|5C|nt|caitlin: 12-14?|pg||
nt|athene: but still an ace and Kx in opener's suit is quite a defensive hand for a 2-suiter overcall|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: i think east should double on the 1st round |pg||

nt|mrdct: perfect shape and all that|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: these are 10 board matches. The second match is due to start in 18 mins|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|athene: south might be tempted to do something here, with such a max|pg||
