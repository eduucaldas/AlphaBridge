nt|dburn: mind you, if South views this as a strong no trump....|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|arobson:  East can make 3NT, otheriwse no EW game|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no - for the Rabbit, 2NT is forcing since the Hog always bids game|pg||

nt|arobson:  This may not be so bad|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but what, i don't miss them|pg||
nt|lestergold: not so easy for Erichsen to doubl;e because from hism point of view there is no  guarantee of 6 plus defensive tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: no, but you can't pass - maybe he thought this was a forcing auction|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lestergold: probably but what is Selway supposed to bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|dburn: double, if he can't think of anything else to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: SElway cannot envisage a game with no further action from E and vul why risk a penalty if there is a misfit  which will normally meanthat 2@h isnt making in any case|pg||
nt|dburn: if pass was forcing, "no further action from East" means nothing - East could have any number of points|pg||
nt|arobson:  I doubt any bid was forcing|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: thats a very good def :)|pg||
