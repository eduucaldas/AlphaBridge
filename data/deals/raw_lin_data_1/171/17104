mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|johnlowell:  Board 25 looks like 7 or 8 (on non-@S lead) IMPs to Kang as their teammates found 5@D|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay -> 2!d|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|forced|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|johnlowell:  2@C is a puppet to 2@D, here to play, but could have started an invitational sequence|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|algraves:  well the active EW precision auction claims another victim, 4@H a pretty good contract|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kjadams: expect the spade bid showed 4.|pg||
nt|johnlowell:  Grue's 1@S bid probably kept N-S out of 4 of a major ... if he had made a more traditional @D raise, they likely would have found it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|algraves:  its like you need a lot of discussion to play against the precision diamond|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|algraves:  for eg here you could have X by North to the 3@D bid as a game try|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d9|nt|algraves:  a sort of extended maximal double|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|algraves:  when you know the opps have a probable 9 card minor fit|pg||
mc|11|nt|johnlowell:  well, that's it for this table|pg||
nt|algraves:  and they may have shafted you earlier in the auction|pg||
nt|johnlowell:  it will return around 8:00 PM US Eastern time|pg||

nt|dburn: not certain to be bid here, but fairly likely after this start|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth's cards are very soft, but the early action by South will help|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: My guess is North will X for takeout|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: now an easy 4@H for South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: I'm sure he will, but then a question of whether he bids game|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or not so easy|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h? how many times do you want him to bid that hand?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: once properly will do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: well, double was perfectly proper - but he isn't exactly bursting with extra values for it|pg||
nt|algraves:  4 good players missed this game. maybe it is harder to bid looking at only 2 hands than we think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think Al might have the answer|pg||
nt|dburn: and both players might have taken dim views of their diamond holdings on this bidding|pg||

nt|dburn: he may get this right - West didn't open 1NT, which he might have done with @hAQ and the rest of what he has shown|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: but he didn't (reasonably enough), so Kang will end the quarter rather better than he started it|pg||
