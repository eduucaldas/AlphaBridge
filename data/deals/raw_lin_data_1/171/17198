mb|p|nt|janm: What would everyone do with the East hand over 1@c (whether natural or strong :))?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C  = forcing [as are all 1-suit openings]  usually 14+ HCP, could be 2@C with strong NT|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2N!|nt|janm: Some number of @hs or 2NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: 2@C= red suits for me|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jan -- how are pairs treating the Fantunes 1@C opening -- is it  strong & artificial, 2+, nat ... |pg||
nt|janm: Interesting - you'd think they'd have discussed whether this 1@c was to be treated as natural or artificial - I'd treat it as natural, because most of the times when you want to ...|pg||
nt|janm: bid, they have the hand with club length|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|janm: Some ambiguity here, I guess - possibly 3@c showed a good 3@h bid? Or at least was so interpreted?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Jacobs doesn't know what his X means but Thompson has explained as showing @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with Board 16  so we won't see comparisons for a while|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Richman unsure of what is going on - he believes 2NT undiscussed over this 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rooms weren't linked last set, so not sure if current running total is correct|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Yes 7-1 is the score|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: so score reflects how boring those hands were :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a very low scoring affair, no idea other match|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude  [reverse smith vs nt]|pg||
nt|janm: However it was reached, 4@h isn't unreasonable - only 3 top losers, and some ruffing tricks for winners, but I can only count 9 tricks - anyone see a tenth?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe those good club spots?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still might be a chance for extra trick in @C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but now he has the Q and 9 to run through North - but doesn't have entries to do that and lead up to the @d ace, does he?|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, North has to lead things|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Jacobs will have trouble getting off lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i don't have to think about it single-dummy at the table|pg||
nt|janm: A spectator with better eyes than I notices that the diamond spots are also good and so he can set up his tenth trick there, after diamond to the A, K of diamonds, if he reads the ...|pg||
nt|janm: hand right|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|s4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janm: Of course he has to conclude that the @d 9 is from A9 doubleton and not AQ9 or AJ9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: here we go|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|janm: Jacobs almost has to play A and a diamond here, doesn't he? Otherwise he'd have to set up one of dummy's black Qs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|janm: Now to see if Griffiths figures the diamonds out|pg||
nt|bigtrain: better to have played the @D10 there|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: that way the suit guesses itself|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe it would have been better for declarer to play the ten of @ds on the 9 to find out what was happening|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|hJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|h8|nt|janm: Ruff that one and then when he played the K he'd find out that N started with just 2 and could pick up S's remaining honor.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: will this start 1@S-2@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = forcing 1 round [as are all 1 level suit openings]|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: yes sorry|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: will Ish get creative?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|kiwibridge: yes Al top marks|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kiwibridge: tough hand good defence this looks a bit of a coffee hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I could say that i miss playing Acol -- but it would be a lie|pg||
nt|timb: yes - they are playing a version of "Melbourne Acol", originally brought to the ACT by Ron Cook |pg||
mb|d|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like an IMP to Hans|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe in Oz, but over here it is a shiraz hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D must have promised fit  [makes sense by passed hand even if never clearly talked about]|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2H has something going for it, but it is dangerous in a way that is often overlooked. when a preempt is this pure, it risks pushing opps to a gane they can make because their hands ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: are pure too. at the ame time, there is a different danger in holding too much defense for a preempt: shortish long suit, side singleton, and ace of long suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told one table in Women's match    3@Hx -800|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Modern Acol is good Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: however -- in [bridge] formative years, i think i learned a TON reading ACOL texts|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: seems 500 should be max -- but we'll see|pg||
nt|timb: A novel feature is that 1@H,1@S:2@C & 2D as forcing as a jump to 3@C or 3@D would be a splinter in support of spades |pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  did Hinge really open 1N  or was it  operator catch-up from the early connection glitches|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i also have no control over the speed of the play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: north needs to play a couple of @hs through|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h2|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Tim, for some reason i just started reading Howard's version of NSW System -- didn't that use the single jump shift as shortness too??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looking at @DK  what was the rush??|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no cue no slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Griffiths not making any move|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 3@h can be Ax here can't it?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Bobby didn't show much extra either|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mrdct: a couple of pairs in the Hans team don't play all of the national events, so it make sense that they didn't accumulte the maximimum PQPs|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: very disciplined pass by Jacobs|pg||
nt|mrdct: in NS system his only option would be 3@S i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that depends on who is formulatinfg the rules that contitute the discipline|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S or higher :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: this is more of a challenge|pg||
nt|chilloncan: cannot see point of 2S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|chilloncan: not best time for a speculative double of stay,man:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobs could NOT open 3rd seat 1@H  [forcing] but might have tried tactical 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally 2@H = 10-13 HCP, 5@H unbal, but in 3rd seat can be 5332 and weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: or puppet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it takes up little room, and pd can hardly read you for this hand. if pd raises that rates only to help opps diagnose degree of fit|pg||
nt|mrdct: well it's unlikely to go for a number and if he happens to fit a fit with partner they are positioned to compete|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS are a little bit hamstrung with no weak 2 available|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i count 7 spades there, so lack of weak 2 not an issue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well there aren't many other hands that fit Jacobs' sequence other than hand that others might open with Multi 2@D or Weak 2@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are plenty of such hands, depending on style. for example 64 in majors|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the meantime how does 6@c go?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no longer uncommon for vul weak 2 to include 7 card suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: slam is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: diamonds 4-3 or a trick on the lead (quite likely)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: this works MUCH better -- IFF Thompson can find @H lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this will not go well if thompson hits on the heart lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: true, counting suit lengths has gotten harder as average age of players ever rises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice guess|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: grateful for the 8@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: doesnt matter given grosvenor can never lead them|pg||
nt|chilloncan: interesting, the alert on 3H suggests that the call does not deny 4H, so responder could becone declarer in that suit. contrary to fundamental premise of puppet|pg||
nt|mrdct: if they play here, bill's 2@s would certainly have been successfulk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gosney did open North hand with 2@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS are playing a variation of the Fantunes system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure about Ish's DBL vs 3@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that there are distributions for NS where 3N makes and 4@S is down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me this is just unlucky for Robinson-de Livera|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrdct: lets see how robust the @sK still is as a stopper|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chilloncan: not sure the EW potential disaster can be linked causally to the NSseuqence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dan Neill put together a file to explain a lot of Fantunes -- but we've already seen some bids that don't fit or aren't listed at all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chilloncan: also contrary to Hinge's apparent vow not to declare:)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: you may not lose IMPs on THAT deal but it is a cumulative MATCH, and the lost opportunity for massive gain  counts everuy bit as much in the tally|pg||
nt|mrdct: @h ruff will beat 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  a @D raise|pg||
nt|mrdct: it looks like a @d raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems Jacobs will start with 2@D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: certainly 3X was an alternative, but if E had been 4522 for example, 2S cou;d have been going for a lot against no game. N was perhaps a favorite to have 4 hearts on the sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it is a question of not getting too high|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks Michael!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@d for the majors|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugrapha3: this would be a good board not to have great agremeents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or just starting a force?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i went and read what ish had written|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i like 4@c now (assuming its a splinter)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure hope bid was alerted on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ought to be, since 3C forcing after cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now if he didn't hold 3@D  then might be harder for North at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  7N is 88%. 7@d is a little worse because there could be a ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you could win IMPs playing imn a diamond partial against a really good team|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: surely 7NT is better than 88%|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other match (ladies?) both tables stopped in 6@d|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  2-1 is 76%. 3-0 is 34%|pg||

mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine 4333 exploring other options|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: X an interesting choice|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i know Acol 1@C usually delivers 4+ suit ... but  8-bagger??|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: aims at a VERY narrow target, when pd can bid 3N AND that is the right spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 4H much better  if you bid 5H now  P will expect a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: easy 4@H |pg||
nt|chilloncan: well there is no question of bidding 5H|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5@h looks like down 1|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so possibly 8 IMPs to Hans|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW can make 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hinge-Morrison in 4@S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: if you missed 1st match --  Ebery got hammered by Hans|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'll try and get scores from the other match|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: perhaps even 4@s if they can play trumps for 1 loser|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: there are 4 teams in Division 1  they play a Double Round Robin of 20 board matches [2 10-board sets]|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all over soon even with @C ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 5@c -300|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: after Hinge bid only 2@S|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence hope to get 1@c, 1@h and 2@s here|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the Law is jnot that bad.    4S is cold  4H also  when you guess the clubs   and they dont ruff them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 card suits are for playing in|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chilloncan: the law is only useful if you describe your hand accurately. given the X by N, there is no way for S to assume his side has 10 trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: letting play then 4S  is a big risk.  but NS did not know the big H fit, because N started with D |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: isnt 4@h making even if you lose two club tricks?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: but west's @s pips are good enough to pickup the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|mrdct: nice duck of the @sA by ben|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: I bet the hand gets opened 5@C more than once|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as you and I would Al|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i would like to be able to open the West hand 3NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: you mean a normal 4@C/@D opening  [ala Namyats]??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: something along those lines yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: that said i dont normally play namyats|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: theres some banter at the table about the arrangement of tricks|pg||

nt|mrdct: yeah - you're right michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play started same way in other room  [Edggton also ducking @SA]|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: its a good duck because it stops declarer from drawing trumps easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key here isn't so much North's trump holding as finding 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mrdct: i knew there was something good about it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- declarer doesn't want to pull trump  so is duck best??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i'm sure ish wouldnt draw trumps before he had the hand under control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what he doesn't know -- @D9 is natural winner|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: indeed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is giving a lot of thought to his choice in hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we can see that ace is best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Thompson really didn't have attacking defense if winning @SA|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but its not clear to sih|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: 3NT makes here for NS - not easy to bid perhaps|pg||

mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: especially now|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: apparently it was easy for simon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D RELAY  usually INV+ but sometimes gambling for better spot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: current standings; Hans 23, Klinger 16, Hollands 14, Ebery 7|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: (in division 1)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H would show 3/4@H  so 3@H must show 4 & MAX|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry hollands are actually called henbest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually that may be unique to Jacobs-Thompson  since Fantunes 2@C can be 6@C & 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: oh well good spot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: of course if Ish had had HTxxx in @d it was down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 2@C  may mean it could also be Balanced Game Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the best spot is 5@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@h isnt terrible|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: not terrible single-dummy   but looking at all 4 hands is different story|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: can still maybe make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  i'd rather be in 6@C than 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: N can reasonably bid 2N with his source of tricks. S will go on to 3N if it is worth a shot. perhaps S was barred on second round|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edggton 1N in 1st seat was pure highway robbery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he handle 4-1@H [with K7] AND losing @C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 6@c is quite good in fact|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he can lose a club and two hearts|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: arjuna is taking a long time to claim 11|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: system may dictate 2N, but uncomfortable to bid it as E when high card structure creates no desire to declare NT from that quadrant|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: @S taps make the @H7 key card|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: if its right to finesse arjuna started with a singleton or void @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: if a singleton why didn't he lead it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thats why jacobs is thinking now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another reason to think -- if fly @CA and @CK does NOT fall -- then what|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Marshall -- i'm a bit surprised you didn't mention 2@H rebid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uh oh -- now maybe in control|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|vugrapha3: always was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and we're back to defense prevailing|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think when @CK scored -- @C ruff or @D  sets tempo for defense|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: @c ruff gets declarer control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no -- exit @D  then what does declarer do?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pc|d3|nt|chilloncan: not sure why. what else would he bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's growing number of pairs who define 2@H as 6+  so that 2N becomes the catchall|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense can eventually negate declarer's @C suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now another club|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: if @C  let it win -- it is NEXT @C that gets ruffed -- then you can kill north hand|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting hand  to analyze|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ruff next club - then what?|pg||
