mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: how about doubling this and leading trumps?|pg||
nt|henryb:  double all pass?|pg||
nt|athene: south has a very defensive hand|pg||
nt|athene: people tend to take liberties at favourable|pg||
nt|henryb:  what little there is of it|pg||
nt|athene: it's important to get out the stout stick of justice once in a while|pg||
nt|athene: typically north's double will show a strong notrump|pg||
nt|henryb:  why is Ms Neale thimpking?|pg||
nt|athene: playing a weak notrump opener you just have to double in these auctions or you can never show your hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course, the answer is, don't play weak notrump, but still...|pg||
nt|sybarra: questio is can S lead a trump (answer yes) but will she|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead will work ok too|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @cA loses a trick|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: S thought for a v long time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west might have considered 3@D, as a lead-directing raise, rather than 3@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: this is almost as pre-emptive as 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: these fit bids can work out poorly when they give opps a lot more room but here it was worth consideration perhaps|pg||

nt|athene: and not raise too freely|pg||
nt|sybarra: a fun hand |pg||
nt|henryb:  If the other table stops in a NT partial for 120, -300 is lose 5, -500 is lose 9, and -800 is lose 12|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: W was unlucky to hit such a misfitting hand opposite|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: yes but if the other table gets to 3n and goes down, which is possible...|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure how one gets to 6 @C here |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: west bids 3@C now and east raises|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: S finding the auction a bit amusing is my guess |pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that sometimes 3@C is just a "probe" looking for a spade stop for notrumps|pg||
nt|athene: so east might not be too eager to raise it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|d|mb|4C|nt|athene: west is going to be a lot more aggressive facing 4 clubs than just 3|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure she knows about the 4-card support|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c is a perfectly reasonable contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: oh yes, they aren't bidding slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6 after all is on a finesse|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: North having a long look at the auction|pg||

nt|henryb:  partner did not overcall 2 or 3; makes it less likely, surely|pg||
nt|athene: most people are not passing 1@D with west's hand either of course|pg||

nt|henryb:  well, actually they don't if I were only a better opening leader|pg||
nt|athene: actually even if they get a heart ruff, north can finesse clubs and ruff the king down, so throwing both diamonds?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: might be a few handling charges? can it all be done|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|s8|nt|athene: after a ruff from 3 trumps, you can draw the rest pretty easily, so i think you should make 4@S anyway|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|henryb:  both tables in the open match did double with the south hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
