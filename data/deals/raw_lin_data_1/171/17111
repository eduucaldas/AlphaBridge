nt|brolucius: I heard about a great defense from Zia this morning. His partner, who had opened 4H led the @HA against a slam. Dummy went down with a singleton and Zia false-carded the @HK from ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK-x. Declarer ruffed the next round high from A-K-Q-x and Zia's J-x-x in trumps was promoted. Brilliant!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not showing my age, just showing my knowledge of old movies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne match also exchanged about 100 imps last set for a negligible change in the match|pg||
nt|ritong: soooo...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms are visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently needs a @c lead to beat 4@s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: fleisher:  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but how many world/national championships  do they have??|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: eventually the scores from all matches will show here : http://www.bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter results at  http://bridgewinners.com/round-of-8|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must open a brouser for each room  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond:  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
nt|harmon: 16+\|pg||
nt|harmon: But Im glad Walter here, he knows system much better than I|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible using  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: already some excitement, 6@d was made in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: some commotion as other tables restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss still studying.  deck may seem to have too many points in it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman had only a sevn-card suit but it might easily have been 8-card.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from 2010 Team Trials online for both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches playing same boards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann asks about 4D.  Gitelman writes: "I think splinter"|pg||
nt|harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|harmon: Team captain here so iahve to behave:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=659&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 5NT is interesting, of course in standart bridge it means to pick between 6 or 7, but it doesn't seem likely considering West' strength|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess North might bid 4NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: West leaps to 4@S rather than tip his hand with a cue-bid response. Interesting. He makes life more difficult for N/S that way.|pg||
nt|dburn: intending to convert clubs to diamonds to show 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: with 5-5, he would bid diamonds at once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-8 HCP  or  9+ with no more than 1 King|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  this is RM Lite version -- he's FULL RM savant|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT shows 12+ W/5+@h|pg||
nt|harmon: I assume 1n some GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hefty constructive raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann exhales deeply. looks tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lots of losers|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: NS play a version of Precision   EW 2/1 with lots of special agreements|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ HCP  unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|harmon: see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12+ HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rhelle: 1NT by North is normally 12.5 - 15|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Bill|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfe: green cards placed delicately on the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar sees them when the tray comes back, puts his cards down and his hands to his temples|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: nice easy board to start the set|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar leans back, crosses his legs, still thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is great to see the top stars bid these competitive deals - a very difficult area for most of us.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue's strength limited by failure to open Precision @C|pg||
nt|ritong: and leading a @c from Jx is highly unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visibe using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play what Kokish calls  "somewhat timid kaplan-sheinwold"   weak NT except  3rd seat vul|pg||
nt|dburn: strong club, heart positive with extras, three natural bids...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...and a difficult call for Greco|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D unusual with 4333; you would expect a scrambling 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: fingering @DA and @DQ|pg||
nt|ritong: +|pg||
nt|dburn: as it is, diamonds may play better than hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: this probably isn't the real auction|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have no idea what is going on - looks like a transcription error|pg||
nt|sybarra: good flop as Henri says?|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with a potential trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads/carding  3rd/5th vs suit  4th vs NT    upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure both matches playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = any 8-11, FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other rooms are visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  [one window per table]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: psychic cue??|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure - looks that way|pg||
nt|bigtrain: probably strong @H rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this was wrong"|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North passed, it would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from 2010 Trials   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/DiamondPlatnick.jpg|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll give link for EW as soon as they're identified :)|pg||
nt|athene: but it has worked out ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 6@d actually a lot better than 6NT, you can make it even when the K@h is off ( playing small @s from hand towards the Q, then if south doesn't jump you discard the K@s over the 4th ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c and if he does you can discard 2 @h's )|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: but both contracts have issues of trump control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lauria is asking about 4nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: to watch multiple tables: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|dburn: not Blackwood|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Liz :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think NS are in 2@d|pg||
nt|harmon: 4d probably says I like from previous bidding 4h says I hate it|pg||
nt|dburn: would like to bid Blackwood for hearts, but not sure how he can organise this|pg||
nt|athene: swap south's minors though and 3@D would take them past their best spot of 3@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: @h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: swap south's minors and Gitelman won't reopen|pg||
nt|athene: the disadvantage of bidding a scramble in this sort of situation, though, is that you are painting a big target on yourself to an extent|pg||
nt|athene: saying "hey opps, i don't have any long suit, please start the doubling"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chorush: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this way|pg||
nt|dburn: 4NT over 3NT would sound natural|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: he needs an entry to his partners hand to beat this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW CC  http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/LevinWeinstein.gif|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@h - 8-11, any shape?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 5@S showed specifically @S & @C|pg||
nt|dinos1: mb 4@s4m?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well actually it does NOT include 8+ HCP, 5+@S  [1@S]   all other positive responses to 1@C show 12+ HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Score not correct,  real score is 41-25|pg||
nt|dinos1: but 3N showed NT hand|pg||
nt|harmon: 5 is in danger on Ace of clubs lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil in 4@S North|pg||
nt|dburn: Hampson may have to pass here just to get a plus, but I don't see how he can|pg||
nt|dburn: Kamil and Fleisher actually did remarkably well|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: being one tempo ahead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down Attitude, standard Count    NS  standard count & attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both matches playing the same boards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: no he doest|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has three top tricks - the club ruff is for down two|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: although I guess that after the ruff, Grue can pick up the hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can handle it all|pg||
nt|ritong: he can|pg||
nt|ritong: fred has two @cs|pg||
nt|dburn: and so did Hampson|pg||
nt|athene: yes it's possible that gitelman had some thoughts of "equal level conversion" i.e. he was intending to correct clubs to diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Jacki: welcome Ira chorush|pg||
nt|athene: but i still think using 2nt a lot in these positions is better as it lets you double with more hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Spade switch is clear, but West can give a suit preference card anyway.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: and as everyone knows, the aim of the modern player is to double for takeout as often as possible, if not more so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: part of decision from Moss COULD [keyword] be that if EW bid 3@S  @D lead better than @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: here you have to rely on the @h finesse, but it worked so 2 imps for diamond |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Moss that 5N was pick a slam,  Gitelman thought it was choose 6 or 7|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Joanna, thanks |pg||
pc|h9|nt|chorush: This is an agressive 6 spade contract which might make on a good day, which this is not|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dburn: whether he will or not is another matter|pg||
nt|athene: what does Diamond need? about 3 imps a board? slightly less|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  EW Greco-Hampson playing their form of Precsion    NS Fleisher-Kamil playing 1@C=2+ with transfer responses|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: that should give a decent range of different auctions |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: two and a half won't quite be enough|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, someone who can perform division at 3am :) good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ritong: it was not, as 5@d is a make|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn: if he ran the jack of hearts and lost to a stiff queen, he would go down an awful lot|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: we have some technical problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  Grue 57  Kang 35|pg||
nt|ritong: operator, can you pls enter pass out for every unplayed hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't matter as long as total is 1 larger than Fleisher|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: then replace with actual results|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2nd of 4 16-board segments for the Vanderbilt Cup Semi-Finals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless you're a Fleisher fan|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: it is doubtful @c lead will be found next room, so expected push|pg||
pc|hT|nt|harmon: winning 2imps in the process|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein  upside-down Attitude  standard Count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow is 64 board championship match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this auction much more thoughtful than the other room|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco-Hampson  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|ebrok: Alle for højt i 6 sp|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|mc|8|nt|chorush: fight is now about 2 imps that katz might win for his team for down 1|pg||
nt|gambit: Fred did well to raise the level|pg||
