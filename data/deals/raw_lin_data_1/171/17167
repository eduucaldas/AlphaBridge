nt|brobles: This is actually Joaquin Pacareu's first deal of hands of the tournament, right in the final :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: 600 is a huge result|pg||
nt|brobles: The team Caracci won the Round Robin, and had a confortable win in the semifinals over a women team that has played for the Chilean Women team a couple of times|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: may also get to game here   |pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: The Team Rubio has also played the event mostly 4 handed and had a very tough semifinal match against the RIOS team|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|kmb24: they're playing the board backwards|pg||
nt|tez: this is no real|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca did in fact open 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: different hand i thk:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: East west playing in 2 hearts, not sure who is who and who has what though :)|pg||
nt|tez: check pls vugraph operator|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's the right hand, the board is just rotated |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|brobles: Vugraph operator tells me that West has east cards, so they put the board the other way round|pg||
nt|tez: not right hand|pg||
nt|brobles: So Paca is playing 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: north is dealer|pg||
nt|brobles: the auction was not like this, they just put the contract|pg||
nt|tez: he cant pass|pg||
nt|brobles: so Joaquin Pacareu is playing 2@h (as WEST)|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|tez: yes means?|pg||
nt|kmb24: the board is right, the hands are all in the opposite spots|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: 1@s pass 1nt 2@h all pass may be|pg||
mc|9|nt|ralfwil: there is in my opinion a big difference between a 3- or 4-card support, so 2@h is enough for me as E on previous board|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 3@C showing 3 card support and let pard decide|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cornelia and Friggi|pg||

mb|1D|nt|kmb24: i might try 1n in third seat on that|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ady: south might balance|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room chose to double 1@d.  i really prefer 1N|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt with singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: ok for me.np:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: prefer 1N with singleton over t/o double with one!|pg||
nt|kmb24: the other room's result is huge.  game on every hand!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|friggi: light opening|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C 2@H should end it|pg||
nt|brobles: I would probably bid 1@h at the table, would be a little scared of 1N red white with a PH partner. 1N looks still reasonable to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S from west shows decent hearts|pg||
nt|chick: very light, even by my standards :)|pg||
nt|tez: 20 point game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kmb24: not sure what's the plan with 2@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: balance chancy  as west could be shortin spades   possibly singleton and a good defensive hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks cedrtainly down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it -1 or -2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: found a home|pg||
nt|brobles: I don't know what Smith was planning over 2@d but he should definitly pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Very interesting hand to lead from. You sure know one thing - you donÂ´t want to lead :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he had 2@s available to show 4@s and longer minor, nf|pg||
pc|h8|nt|friggi: W signs off with 10 points!?|pg||
nt|chick: He's probably seen his partner's openers :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|friggi: that is the only fair clue to make from this |pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Well, their agreement before was that East may do light openings and bids, while West makes sure he covers up for his partner.. :)|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|friggi: but 3NT would have been super here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||

mb|2N|nt|friggi: What about @C opening here then reverse @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Never for me|pg||
nt|chick: There are still about 75 people in the world who open that hand 1@C, but I'm not one of them :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tez: i would bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: so maybe 76 in few weeks|pg||
nt|brobles: I would bid 2@c if 1@s wasn't available :)|pg||

nt|kmb24: too tough to avoid 3n, but they got there from the wrong side it seems|pg||

nt|tez: need|pg||
nt|brobles: maybe declarer tries to sneak a diamond and then play for 7 tricks in the majors|pg||
nt|brobles: it's his best shot really|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room bid a direct 3n over 1S|pg||
nt|brobles: win the club in hand and try a suspicious @dJ :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|tez: if duck 8 trick again|pg||
nt|brobles: I really don't see another plan, but I'm guessing that Rubio will pop Ace knowing the layout|pg||
pc|cT|nt|espooz: They dont play 2/1 ?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|friggi: but not enough|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|pc|c3|nt|ady: this happens with a multi sometimes   both sides playing in the same suit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|brobles: so the first 13 imps to the Rubio team|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: the e/w made 8 tricks defending in CR in spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h ruff before playing @dA and an overtrick...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kmb24: i think you have to run the T@s to leave the Q as a reentry|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
