nt|athene: no guarantee partner is passing that|pg||
nt|tobbet: correct|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: An inelegant down 4 in 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|tobbet: 400 -400 after 2 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's east's job to bid 2@S here in my opinion|pg||
nt|andyv:  so score is tied|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: difficult; a lot depends on exactly what west needs to bid 2@S over 2@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  does 2@s have that much going for it?  only non @s card appears to be not working|pg||

nt|lestergold: Germ hi|pg||

nt|sybarra: the operator will get them up shortly |pg||
nt|sybarra: i think we are in a mad scramble at the moment to catch up |pg||
nt|lestergold: a borderline 3n  available here for N/S which shouold be bid really|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 1st example of youthful exuberance...|pg||
nt|m_niemi: pre-empting 2@c bid:)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi bruce |pg||
nt|kemperg: racognized your name|pg||
nt|jcomyn: natalia i mean|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello Arifin, Joe, Dennis and specs|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd be wrong :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  This looks a strange auction for Short/Walker, as they have a 2@c response to show a good raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: weak two diamonds or strong I guess|pg||
nt|kemperg: O no dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i am not sure this is the auction |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ralf, greetings from Jakarta|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 10-boards matches, so each of them is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: well at these colours putting a spoke in is not soley confined to juniros|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mike and Bruce @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Sime/Matheson, in my eyes, easily the best Scottish pair this weekend|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mesbur/Fitzgibbon, perhaps the most experienced pair at the event|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|lestergold: trouble is it doesn't take up very much space|pg||
nt|sybarra: I beleive the operator is catching up,    |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hello all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: amazing what does he leave the x in with i wonder|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a bad slam|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like E will compete to 2@s|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely not|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: 3@s is agressive|pg||
nt|xenya: Not many spectators here -- just a selected few|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@s is aggressive when 3@s can be bid on that junk|pg||
nt|puncher: I agree - 4@S too optimistic here|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this bidding system presumably weak no trump will get e/w too high pretty quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85  for particpants|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=96&Itemid=85|pg||
nt|jcomyn: aggressive isd hardly the word|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it did its work|pg||
nt|m_niemi: hearts length in left so RHO will overruff hearts|pg||
nt|mamos: a comfortable start |pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi germ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cameron_1: i found the conv card says 8pt 15+ |pg||
nt|ady: sure it isnt Peter|pg||
nt|dagold: presumably X was 4/4 in the majors, so not much to spare|pg||
nt|dagold: partner can infer the club shortage in all likelyhood|pg||
nt|dagold: and would be able to bid 3@s himself many times when it is right|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|paulg:  Anderson and Greenwood one of the most experienced pairs in the event|pg||
nt|paulg:  David Greenwood, known as jtr on BBO, is also a frequent vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Good morning all|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Jim|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 3@C opening in a youth match|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have an exciting week of bridge planned with the jrs. |pg||
nt|lestergold: no @d opening by N?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@d |pg||
nt|lestergold: not available|pg||
nt|lestergold: in which case i'dopen 3@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: nv|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D I ment|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: not so much mini as micro|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi mike|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what i wasw asking is if the polish juniors are sons of well known fathers|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant bid it |pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree|pg||
nt|kemperg: I understood|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: yes, it's the younger son of Krzysztof Jassem on South|pg||
nt|kemperg: only pepsicola is not there|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT looks the likeliest outcome here|pg||
nt|sommer: upside down count, so @CK is safe|pg||
nt|sommer: there's some work to do for E, but it's makeable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe a jr didn't open the n hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks:(|pg||
nt|ahalim: if a @H is led|pg||
nt|kemperg: and ducked|pg||
nt|ahalim: of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has to do that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahalim: no problem here in 4@H I think|pg||
nt|bg: W can get two red aces but he has to cash them|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all from sunny Dortmund|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|santyclz: So w must play the J to attempt to induce s to win the trick.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45: This might go one off - @D not behaving and the @C Ace off-side|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n for N/S has a  fair chance|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C as w2 in@D or something strong is very popular in the Netherlands, I do not like it|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Thomas|pg||
nt|xenya: and Mike|pg||
nt|tomi2: gives your opps the chance to double 2@C, pass and double 2@D, bid directly or await things and balance later|pg||
nt|tomi2: north now knows his partner can't be too strong for his double, so he won't push to games in doubt. same as if S had overcalled / balanced, north has one useful information|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how good is 6@s on say a trump lead|pg||
nt|dagold: 4 losers but I am not sure there are 9 winners|pg||
nt|sybarra: list of all participants |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Suppose taht E/W do not play negative double, East has a problem. Would then bid 2 @S|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon|pg||
nt|hawe45: 10th trick now|pg||
nt|mamos: i thought they were hutling towards a slam there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right tx|pg||
nt|kemperg: 25 pts to start with|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pitiful:  assume opps have not bid|pg||
nt|ady: only 1 top loser in spades   but with spades 4-1  difficulties at the slam level|pg||
nt|sommer: @H shift?|pg||
nt|kemperg: teh best|pg||
nt|sommer: a minor is sensible too, but not best|pg||
nt|sommer: wonder why S didnt continue @C's|pg||
nt|kemperg: No E has 8 pts not 0|pg||
nt|yuval10: W can't even be sure his side has a 8-cards fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cameron_1: i wonder what the real auction was|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would not want to bid a slam single dummy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on these cards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi michael|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: Those Israeli' hate mistakes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  @h10 from Walker to show diamond interest|pg||
nt|puncher: Exciting time for Wales - when was the last time they won it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Alan, of course we know international bridge players are hopeless with bridgemates|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here, so no hope |pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a great contract even without this lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Riccardo Rubino|pg||
nt|rich89: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: ciao ricardo |pg||
nt|santyclz: Even at favorable, qjxxx at the 2 level is shall we say sub-optimal.|pg||
nt|the saint: South should have doubled 2D to show extras|pg||
nt|kemperg: but  3N makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont agree chazps|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|puncher: Ireland will be looking for a big win here to nail the camrose - Wales and England also hoping for big wins - any of these three could win it|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wales have never won|pg||
nt|mamos: this will drift off could EW make anything much?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3CX more interesting|pg||
nt|kemperg: amazing, wd:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I am a great admirer of Jassem's book|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C asking for 4 and 5 card major - 3@D = no 5 card but 1/2 4 card, 3@S = 4 card @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK Wessel|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kemperg: morning Ricardo|pg||
nt|lestergold: east strong no trump opener they play in 2@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: reasonable contract that is not easy to make|pg||
nt|tomi2: he has 6 fast losers her|pg||
nt|ahalim: decl shd try for a slow @H trick|pg||
nt|xenya: actually declarer will do well to get out for -1|pg||
nt|tomi2: will have to work for -1 only|pg||
nt|mamos: perhaps the 2@c opening worked this time :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@D would have worked as well or maybe better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is a vfery impressive bidding sequence|pg||
nt|kemperg: lot of nerve from W|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gowdy: a trump lead in these 2 syuited auctions often work best  as here|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed but look it has shut them up when they have a chance of a vul game|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|paulg:  Convention cards are available from http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think so|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes Sandra Rimstedt must have high hopes of beating this|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mike Bruce and (@H) Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David welcome |pg||
nt|jcomyn: helps tell why israel leading|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 "tricks , sp some work for decl|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about gold old herbert|pg||
nt|kemperg: somewhat oldfashioned|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: 3@c would have been close, perhaps struggling on a forcing game in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of the reasons i do not like weak no trump because it forces you to a 2 level rebid with a 17 COUNT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I SHOULD SAY MQANY REASONS|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock sorry|pg||
nt|mamos: no  messing  :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont mind the lead|pg||
nt|bg: good try by west when your own suits do not look promising try to hit partners suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Partner could equally have held J10xxx instead of 109XXX|pg||
nt|kemperg: with @H breaking yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  good duck by Norman?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: doesnt matter what he does does it?|pg||
nt|puncher: Even more exciting then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best is now a @d finess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: whats the point of playing take-out double when you hasve the perfect hand for penalties|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you dont know 3nt is making - you DO know 3D is going down|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6k7orbt  for results and standings|pg||
nt|peachy: The point of playing takeout dbl on the 3-level is well made by Mike Lawrence, Larry Cohen, and other bridge authors|pg||
nt|kemperg: right John|pg||
nt|peachy: No doubt leaving in this time would have been better|pg||
nt|kemperg: we wood|pg||
nt|kemperg: would|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes double dummy -- but it's a tall order|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes - but here West should have played trumps - after the nice lead|pg||
nt|gowdy: rite   but some play it here as penalty|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should have x available for takeout / show values|pg||
nt|mamos: not so easy |pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to me but then I am an auld fella|pg||
nt|yuval10: it looks like both sides has a 8-cards fit , so not competing to 2@s is surely a losing bridge for the long term|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: just drop the @HQ and guess clubs|pg||
nt|puncher: And if slightly strange things happen, even Scotland could still do it|pg||
nt|sommer: now 9|pg||
nt|kemperg: no defense left now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dagold: seems to be  atrick short|pg||
nt|puncher: But can they hold on to their current lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they will be very nervous, but even more so their supporters, NPC and sitting out pair|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulg:  declarer should probably have played the @dJ there|pg||
nt|paulg:  Short would not lead small from the @dJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he must have the @dK ... often right to play your middle honour of a sequence|pg||
nt|lestergold: and if clubs were 3/2 they would take a further 3 tricks with a ruff|pg||
nt|ahalim: indeed|pg||
nt|hawe45: But cross-ruff will appear|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: S could have doubled 3@H, showing a good hand, but the final contract would have been the same|pg||
nt|jcomyn: isnt she the brazen hussy with her 10 count|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  Scotland can help themselves, and Wales, by keeping Ireland at bay|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
pc|s2|nt|puncher: yes that's true - it's probaby the worst for the sitting out pair|pg||
nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, halftime scores: Wales 168; Eng 161; Ireland 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But I am "on" the other fashon of BBO, have no coq...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: claim time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|the saint: I'm a little surprised, South isn't normally that reticent from what I recall|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sry private|pg||
nt|kemperg: for E it could be 7, but thats enough|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: sorry I was here ready  they started without me  :(|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: can see 11|pg||
nt|mamos: may end up having to guess which  major to finesse in|pg||
nt|pelu: @S or @H finess|pg||
nt|mamos: that Heart discard suggest North has length in Hearts  so maybe declarer will get that right|pg||
nt|pelu: ecen chance, so @sAK ( the Q could drop) and @H-finess|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/5ufb7ny    for results and standings|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good morning Mike Peter specs and all|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt it help to bid s along the way|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  12|pg||
nt|puncher: Yes would nice for Scotland to hold onto, and even increase, their lead - though others might not agree :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am surprised N did not try for ruff |pg||
pc|s9|nt|rich89: mistake of failla|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice try from decl.|pg||
nt|lestergold: shoudl have got out of the wat with the A@c on general grounds in any c ase|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Mike|pg||
nt|m_niemi: making if guesses spades|pg||
nt|kemperg: gm Mike|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  N-S are playing 5-card majors, strong 1NT, like many in this event|pg||
nt|paulg:  E-W are playing Blue Club, probably the only ones to do that|pg||
nt|rich89: by*|pg||
nt|lestergold: this defence was not impressive|pg||
nt|lestergold: as illustrated by this crash of honours|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sime struggles along in 2@h|pg||
nt|pelu: a fantastick proformanse by the Nederland Girls: 18 matches and average over 19 VP! (they are 2.place after Israelæ)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: good afdternoon|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: reticence is not a word we expect to use very often here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: heading towards 2 off it seems|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: yes   12|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: one down, and it looks like 3@H was destined to go down as well |pg||

mb|3D|nt|andyv:  now just depends on styles...3@d would be idea if in their arsenal|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  ideal|pg||
nt|athene: as long as partner doesn't think you have a good hand or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: north knows south can't have five diamonds and a decent hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  W taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D perhaps might be taken as 4 diamonds and a ten count or so in that situation|pg||
nt|athene: one possible way to play is that you always pass over the redouble and then bid with a good hand|pg||
nt|athene: and jumping is just shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would think 2@d would show values (free bid over redbl) and 3@d would be length... again, it depends on style and agreements|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  you type faster than I do, Bill:)|pg||
nt|athene: well, south can always cue with a hand that just wants to cue :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: one thing about a mini notrump is it does come up a lot|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: lots of hands are boring balanced 10 counts|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|athene: some books say you have to stand in the Naughty Corner if you open a weak 2 with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|athene: but sensible people ignore these books|pg||
nt|athene: i actually think it is an advantage to have 4 in the other major for a weak 2|pg||
mb|4C|mb|5C|nt|athene: because opps' defensive bidding will be geared towards finding the other major|pg||
nt|athene: (doubling your weak 2 etc)|pg||
nt|athene: and if they don't have it, their bids are often more awkward|pg||
nt|athene: (e.g. 3@D overcall with both minors often fares poorly)|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for South to envision that the @cA, the @sK and a doubleton @h are enough for a slam|pg||
nt|athene: north just cares about @CA, @SK, @HK|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a good example of how you can be too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|athene: splinter should leave partner in control|pg||
nt|athene: so if you have a very strong hand, it doesn't really get you anywhere|pg||
nt|athene: however, 4@c after only a 1-level response has to show a serious hand|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, i guess 4@C might be various hands here strong with spades yes, sorry|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Well done to overcome the barrage, but I think East might have doubled 5@d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: south might be mildly worried his @CAK is a bit wasted facing a void but even then it might be useful for throwing a couple of little diamonds from north's hand|pg||
