nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman: "I have to admit it occurred to me you were psyching there"|pg||
nt|hedyg: picked up the Q@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: but judging by that, he did well|pg||
nt|brolucius: A splendid opening board for us.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry i just walked in and I'm afraid I missed the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: we lost our connection|pg||
nt|ritong: and we start with slammy hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the match ends with board 64 [unless tie]  winners play in Semi-Finals tomorrow   losers  maybe watch vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: previous set was WoW about these|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome a well rested Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: hi Wayne|pg||
nt|ritong: interesting hand, regarding style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2010 Trials Convention cards online for both teams|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: NS in the OR judged very well to bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N=good 14 to 17|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to @D and 3 nt?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think they play   3@C=@D  [weak or FG]|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think brad will content himself with that, shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well Shirley's sequence should be mild slam try  otherwise just 1N-3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: matter of agreements re the transfer sequence|pg||
nt|ritong: there are other considerations|pg||
nt|sybarra: or another sequence maybe be game force stayman...and..|pg||
nt|ritong: one is moss' hand is really good and justifies more than a mild try|pg||
nt|ritong: an other is, when you transfer for @ds and bid 3NT afterwards, there must be a reason  for us, it shows @c shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room has already crashed once -- are we in holding pattern because of connection or is Brad in the tank?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=656&Itemid=284|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: don't worry - the play is not likely to be too fast for you to keep up with from now on|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is on page 240 of the system notes right? |pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 142|pg||
nt|ritong: will levin repeat @ds or raise @hs|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: We are all indebted to BBO for letting us watch these top tournaments free of charge. I hope they don't change their mind one day...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: EW put maximum pressure over South|pg||
nt|hedyg: shhhhhhh! dont give them ideas!|pg||
nt|wstuart: Have Chips and Lew changed to a str NT vul?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: always thinking  about chips?  :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: but it seem as if he has a 5@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone believe that was a typo??|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will still be free for commentators, Hedy. No need to worry.|pg||
nt|chorush: that dbl has just transformed this hand from something resembling a push to a swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip wrote 12-14|pg||
nt|wstuart: He wrote 12-14 on the notepad the operator says.  This is very un-Chip-like.  He's a very aggressive player and I wouldn't expect him to downgrade a controlish 15 HCP, even though ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: it is 4333.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: well at least im here now for the auction|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally so:)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c looks like a decent contract - not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  4@H Ace Ask   taking control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a short fight, finally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss grimaces a bit, points at dummy, still making plans|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ahollan1: i should say Key Card Ask      5@C=2 without Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: shorter than next room, where EW pushed a bit|pg||
nt|chorush: It may only be 3rd 4th position vul|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|yuval10: South must've been convinced that his Partner has void @s|pg||
nt|wstuart: At one time they played 12-14 in all seats *except* 3rd, where it was 15-17.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if non-imp scoring would change Levin's choice of rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: on surface it looks like N's double meant to discourage his Partner of carry on|pg||
nt|brolucius: Although if the kibitzers had to pay they would probably be less tolerant of the mistakes that the commentators make.|pg||
nt|dburn: optimistic, that - should South really have both majors stopped and the ace of clubs?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   not sure what 3@S is  AFTER the super-accept|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1st leader change of the set  --  how many more will we see?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, this lead may let him escape for down only one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the result is an impossible 3NT in the wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: some question whether the 84-44 carryover is correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no Liz|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is E/W bidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't make it with these cards, but maybe has more chance on the actual borad 3|pg||
nt|dburn: no, this is North-South bidding - they're just not bidding board 2 again|pg||

nt|ferlema: ok|pg||
nt|wstuart: I would not have opened 1@H, either, unless in the context of a strong @C system.|pg||
nt|passell: 15 and a good 6 card suit seems too much to make a light invitation|pg||
nt|ritong: hi mike welcome|pg||
mb|1D|nt|chorush: Every conventional use of a bid has some downside. Stayman, probably the most uniformly played convention of all time, had a big downside on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes we agreed on that point|pg||
nt|passell: hi   this is quite a match|pg||
nt|ritong: sure enough!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H limited by failure to open 1@C  -- and could be 5@H & 5@S|pg||
nt|passell: congrats to the Berg teams great performance througout this event|pg||
nt|passell: they were way to tough for me yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last set was exactly 100 imps exchanged for net difference of about 6|pg||
nt|sybarra: we just threw the imps in the air|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and they landed....|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|wstuart: So, I tihnk their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 4rd only).|pg||
nt|ritong: might need an other coffee:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens overcalled 1N rather than Moss' DBL   looks close to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: I'm sure Stansby will upgrade this hand to a 15-17 NT evaluation.|pg||
nt|chorush: you are probably correct Wayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historically   that is really 14+ to 17|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 7 comes from three small, when north would not lead from KJ7 here|pg||
nt|ritong: so greco will duck twice|pg||
nt|ritong: keeping his precious 10|pg||
mb|r|nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer sits behind brad.  our first as opposed to the mob hovering at the zia-hamman table|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = @h, 9+, unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman, after sitting still for a minute, grabs the pass card off his tray|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = 4+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he had no real reason to get involved here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok -- i'm sure i would have bid 1N at the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and other potential swing|pg||
nt|passell: sorry i had to miss the last quarter|pg||
nt|ritong: gee|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: a strong @c?|pg||
nt|dburn: by the look of things|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if DBL by Fred would absolutely deny 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board   Diamond-Platnick play a Big Club [very similar to Greco-Hampson version of RM Lite]|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: this may actually make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he can't really risk hearing @D from partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually looking again,  it just might make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|harmon: another 6c hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@s = at least 55 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = relay|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you proceed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so they had toy for East to show ALL of   Good Hand [for non-1@C], 6@D, 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond in 3@H West|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3@s = eaxctly 3=5=0=3|pg||
nt|passell: will take careful defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because of room crashes  some bidding in movie may be operator shortcut trying to catch up|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: a hard job to do|pg||
nt|wstuart: Let me type tihs more accurately**So, I think their NT in 3rd seat white is 12-14 (15-17 vul 3rd only).|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|wstuart: 2@D was GF checkback, I assume.|pg||
nt|chorush: Specs are asking why Stansby would upgrade his hand. the reason is the good 5 card suit mostly|pg||
nt|wstuart: The very fine controls are another reason.|pg||
nt|wstuart: I more true method than the A=4, K=3, Q=2, etc evaluation is to count Aces as 4.5, kings as 3 and Q and J as a little less than the Goren HCP representatoin.|pg||
nt|chorush: There is no obvious eighth trick here much less a ninth, so Meckwell did well to make 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents figure it out|pg||
nt|ritong: the @c stack is hidden|pg||
nt|ritong: and south did not lead his singleton|pg||
nt|passell: yes club lead down for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: however, north might switch to a @c in order to open trick(s) before @ds are good|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a trick short|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: lacks a tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: but a tap in the long trump hand  kills it doesnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 53  Nickell 13-0 for the set  now leads Fleisher by 20|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some would say  the only true "precious" card is The Beer Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone have the URL that explains details/history of Beer Card?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3NT is to play|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe 6NT now?|pg||
nt|harmon: =h-5|pg||
nt|passell: then they have to be careful to play a trump next|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  both pairs playing 2/1|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil twist is 1@C=2+ and transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Kit|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|yuval10: time to stop now|pg||
nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|brolucius: That lead would have paid off if East held a singleton club.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 17 opposite 16+ ... he won't stop under slam|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = 4 controls, 15+|pg||
nt|rhelle: (A=2 controls, K=1)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|rhelle: 4@h shows a @h picture - can't have 3, he would have supported them earlier|pg||
nt|sybarra: now (single dummy) what do you do next with Fred's hand?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 8 tricks to lose, so -3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: pump trumps while keeping a policeman|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW convention card from 2010 Trials   http://usbf.org/docs/2010usbc/acblcards/GrecoHampson.jpg|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman in 1@SX East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spy on other tables via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    [one window per room]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: Aces and Kings gain power the more distributional the contract hands are, and aces and Kings combined with a 5 card suit for NT is a very big plus.|pg||
nt|rhelle: At first glance this looks as 1 of 2 finesses. 5@c tricks, 2@d, 1@h, 2@s = 10. An extra trick can be developed in @h or @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: so finding trick 12 is what it's all about - before giving away 2|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chorush: well, that got him up to 8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzfe: had @H2 out but put it back|pg||
nt|passell: unreal|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: this is type of hand that shows weakness of double dummy software -- much more interesting when defense can't see the cards|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wstuart: Specs ask if a 1NT rebid could conceal 1 or 2 4 card majors the way Martel-Stansby are playing, and I believe the answer is yes, they tend to rebid 1NT to show the Strong NT when ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: possible.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rhelle: this trick will not be what South was waiting for|pg||
nt|rhelle: Chances are that the @sQ is with West now - he can see 6@h and 2@c in East already|pg||
nt|harmon: needs more than that|pg||
nt|rhelle: So he needs a double squeeze - @s@d against West, @h@d against East. But he has no @d entry ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: Not enough entries to ruff the @ds high either|pg||
nt|rhelle: Looks like he'll need the double @s finesse against West|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred: "don't worry about it"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|harmon: no good either entriey prob|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond will also open 1N  [14-16]|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: looks like both declarers might take 6 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rhelle: not now, for sure|pg||
nt|dinos1: if ruff with 9 still -3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: good read/discards from Steve Weinstein to minimize damage|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|chorush: this looks like 5 imps to Nickell and a tied match|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: right  down 3 here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dinos1: now N is endplayed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like the only possible line is to find an opp with KQ doubleton @c, or KX @c and catch him off guard for an endplay|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
mc|6|nt|yuval10: other possibility is a squeeze over the black suits, if one opp has 5 in each of them, as Dror Padon suggested|pg||

nt|ritong: but brad has a particular talent for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting   i wonder if 2N was forcing  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: question of whether this goes down quickly or slowly, I guess|pg||
nt|chorush: Only way to have beaten this contract is with a club lead and a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: 2NT artif prolly any gf hand with no suitable rebid|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of gazzilli, just upscaled|pg||
nt|bg: letssee|pg||
nt|ritong: you think he should act?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: just the manner, softly placing the card on the tray|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c5 - @d SP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auction in the other room  and quick @CA @D @C @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar: not the worst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: then asks who wants water; moss accepts|pg||
nt|rhelle: NS play reverse count and attitude - so the 4 is from an even number|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  just some tool for Weinstein to complete shape|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: a club lead would mean quickly, this means slowly - assuming the defense does nothing silly|pg||
nt|wstuart: Doesn't 3 rds of @C beat it too, Ira?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6|pg||
nt|dinos1: good try to hide low @c's|pg||
nt|kit: Levin giving his own suit-preference signal with 6@C -- he wants the higher suit|pg||
nt|kit: 3 higher clubs, 2 lower, so Platnick should get it right|pg||
nt|dinos1: well if S has 532 then W has 4 clubs and bid 2N?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: so far eldad has shown a strong 2 in @hs with questionable suit quality|pg||
nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@h looks quite fair, but not today|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT is a kind of puppet, asking opener to come back to his opening suit|pg||
nt|ritong: unless ha has real good news|pg||
pc|d5|nt|harmon: be nice to tavel tod but that has dangers|pg||
nt|harmon: we know its safe but......|pg||
nt|harmon: travel to a diamond|pg||
nt|harmon: I type like doo doo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C mechanism to show weak 6-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   3@C to show GAME FORCE 6-4|pg||
nt|drewsky: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: it seems that a top @c lead would be bad|pg||
nt|ritong: hiya drew|pg||
nt|drewsky: a direct 3@H or 3@S would have been 5-5 and 6-4 respectiuvely, and Non forcing|pg||
nt|drewsky: relay to major 5-5 and 6-4 forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pull up a chair, and relax, this is going to be a long session|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  other room also 1N -200|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Jacki: did you use our payment screens?  b/c your deposit didn't go through.  The error message usually means a wrong card type (it's a drop down menu) or a wrong CVV number|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond stops in 2@S after  Platnick Semi-Force 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: weinstein has few options at that point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting that Diamond did NOT show @H|pg||
nt|drewsky: A trump lead probably would have defeated this contract for sure.|pg||
nt|ritong: ya drew|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson considered his lead for a long time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with @H strength trump sure seems like 1st or 2nd choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weinstein "sorry"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin pacing in empty room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss also tried @C6|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: they did not want to try the coup three in a row  remained possible, though|pg||
nt|ritong: in this context, 3@c instead of 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: here, pachtmann had relatively good news|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman seems always in control, never on tilt, never in a hurry|pg||
nt|ritong: moss cares about the excited part|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|chorush: Eventually, declarer will lead a diamond toward the dummy and on the showout, will take 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match   Grue off to quick 25-0 lead after 3 boards|pg||

pc|c9|nt|ritong: with talent|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: he ruffed the queen? really?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one window per table|pg||
nt|ritong: two trump tricks with that J643 holding are really unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: well next|pg||
nt|kit: that is silly -- partner must have stiff ace of clubs, and declarer must have ace of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Liz is going to have a tough time if they play and claim so quickly|pg||
nt|chorush: Very friendly diamond layout for this slam, presuming it is reached|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know their methods assuming there are methods for hands like these|pg||
nt|drewsky: Open 3@H or 4@H at these colors ? I would open 3@H, but I am conservative|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wstuart: True, though it doesn't really require a friendly layout to make.|pg||
nt|Jacki: Live streaming available here:   www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion  If anyone knows the names of the players at the table, share with us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Kantar created the convention where 3N showed solid MAJOR|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: this one looks routine|pg||
nt|ritong: other room EW got offboard due to the systemic 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ritong: showing the equivalent of a very good weak 2 in @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: if you wonder how they treat very strong hands, big @c is the answer|pg||
nt|ritong: any 16+ hand is opened 1@c|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a school of thought that one shouldn't Michaels with a 6 card Maj, however, I don't know if much analysis has been done on 7-5 bidding.  :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  looks liek Robert Levin|pg||
nt|sybarra: open a browser for each room you want to see|pg||
nt|ritong: moss will probably bid 4@s directly|pg||
nt|ritong: to me it is a textbook 3@h at unfav  but i am VERY conservative reg preempts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: half of the scoreboard keeps reading as a beercard since you started to talk about the beercard @D7|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|brolucius: The East hand is worth an extra point, with those controls and the five-card spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the convention card that I am looking at, 2NT shows only 20-21. That's puzzling.|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may well lead a heart, which will work rather well for him|pg||
nt|hedyg: except the @s suit is not nice and stiff AK not great for NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he downgraded?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Top players rarely downgrade.|pg||
nt|ritong: after the raise, that is|pg||
nt|kit: interesting choice by Levin -- he figures he can bid 2@S later over red-suit competition|pg||
mb|3C|nt|brolucius: Mind you, they don't miscount very often either.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have 20-21(22) may have a 5 card major|pg||
nt|wstuart: As you can see from the 3@S bid - Martel is a very aggressive player, which is why I was surprised when he downgraded a control righ 15 HCP to a 12-14 NT.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss did bid 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  and can't miss Meckstroth....|pg||
nt|robbg:  Weinstein (r) meck (l) with backs to us|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think Katz would close the bidding with 6 hearts here, unless he thinks he has a good way to get to 7 if it is there|pg||
nt|robbg:  Levin facing|pg||
nt|rhelle: systematically, NS have to open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: a diamond wn't work so well|pg||
nt|algraves: hello everyone|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 2@d is 18-19(20)|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, it may not work at all|pg||
nt|dburn: though declarer will still have to guess the play extremely well|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@S is a control bid in @S showing a good hand and making a slam try in @Hs.|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4NT is likely RKC|pg||
nt|wstuart: Katz will likely jump showing the number of keycards and a void.|pg||
nt|chorush: They will have a way to show a void but Katz cannot be sure the void is not opposite an ace, as it happens to be here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: seems right to show immediate @C support with lousy @S suit  [and expected bad split even if partner has 4@S]|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  3 aces and a spade void|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy bid   |pg||
nt|ritong: experts hate leads from xxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction would have been interesting after 4@H opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 9 easy tricks from top|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is visibly sitting on the benefits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry, got knocked off the internet but didn't miss any of the bridge|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard promises 4 @s and opener|pg||
nt|ritong: i think they can raise on 3 now and then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2 is ATTITUDE|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: seems normal|pg||
nt|wstuart: (RKC = Roman Keycard Blackwood) where there are 5 controls -  the 4 aces and the trump K.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "that's too fast", takes time to study dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: just trying to avoid big swings|pg||
nt|ritong: if he was not doing that, he would certainly raise @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss wrote: if you bid 1NT, X would be takeout. haven't discussed here|pg||
nt|ritong: which were freely bid by his pard|pg||
nt|hedyg: so now he knows no @D in N|pg||
nt|kit: worked quite well, as Weinstein was able to compete to the right level|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Weinstein "not more @D's?)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitleman-Moss in 5@C|pg||
mc|10|nt|harmon: 4d could be beaten2 so this is better|pg||
nt|rhelle: it bites them here ... 4@h or 4@s looks solid|pg||
nt|harmon: they play canape??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those a lot in the 70s/80s  and to be honest  i have no idea how/why they work|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: Yes, for Kamil|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps vulnerability will induce kamil to open 4|pg||

nt|jillan:  Nick bid hearts first so he should be playing right|pg||
nt|wstuart: Right - Nickell was playing it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: east took a short break|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@D will make on this deal, but it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
nt|jillan:  can't they make 6@D here as the cards break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all players are back now|pg||
nt|chorush: This hand should be played in the very good 5 diamonds. 3NT undeservedly gains 2 imps so justice not served|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry I played the wrong card brad played the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: he guessed it?   |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east tried a 1NT overcall in other room i d be surprised to see gitelman duplicate this|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, they are surging ahead now|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wstuart: aside from being off the @SA, 6@D requires both the @H finesse and 2-1 @D which will fail 22% of the time.|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  do you confirm the score operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: but I had him in the dummy when he was in hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: Levin quickly has limited his hand with simple raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: assuming 1@s is the response here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@s does not include 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he made 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  push at 5@D +1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S limited by failure to open Precision 1@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jillan:  I know the percentage BUT you can't argue with the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sadam Hussein would describe this as the mother of all misfits.|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South will do well to go plus on these|pg||
nt|passell: well guessed when he ruffed the diamond north was squeezed|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: what about the 1NT rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Most players will not rebid a 5 card minor nor reverse with such skimpy values, so 1NT is chosen as the alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 amazing hands in a row for declarer |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure is a space-saving agreement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D is 100% game force|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, KQxxx facing the singleton are not awesome, although opener must have goodies onside to offer this " minisplinter"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|harmon: when they restarted Geoff shda passed:)|pg||
nt|ritong: with four small trumps|pg||
nt|kit: classic preempt, although at favorable maybe should open 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: a nightmare to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Was 3@D available?|pg||
nt|dburn: better not bid any more, or he may have a doubled nightmare to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my bet    2@C transfer to @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: it was alerted but no one gave any info|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit do you think 4@H opening more likely in 1st seat than in 2nd?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who don't always open 4@H :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves: will Lauria double if Cheek bids again?|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2@s showed 6-5...|pg||
nt|ritong: this might get bloody|pg||
nt|passell: escaped the ouble  fred knows he is doing well  not chancing an accident|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rhelle: EW in trouble now|pg||
nt|ritong: at 50 a piece, though|pg||
nt|ritong: so hampson should get highly interested|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chorush: 50 years ago it would  have been universal to open East's hand 1 heart and rebid 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|algraves: no could have been only 4 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree that it should show 5-6 (on the basis that North has denied four spades). That is a reasonable auction to describe a strong 4-6 hand. |pg||
nt|sybarra: N  has the hands my pards usually have :(|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: this contract has a lot of play|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks makeable, so Schwartz team likely gets some imps back|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman studying the trick before turning it|pg||
nt|ritong: trump looks clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: then why bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|kit: declarer now has problem -- he may think he has to take quick pitch|pg||
nt|dinos1: now @h to A, @h|pg||
nt|kit: and if he does, West gets ruff, and no dummy entry for heart finesse|pg||
nt|dinos1: but if E has 2@c and @hKxx it's wrong|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: no trumps etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: alot of pointing alerts with no written explanations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H Key Card ask for @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C=2 without Q|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: 7|pg||
nt|chorush: Katz' 3H bid here is announcing some black suit worry|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: brad has doubled, and not with a trump stack|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has values, including @h control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann lowers screen, asks about carding, gitelman answers UDCA|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have a bad hand for hearts, or so he hopes - that @sJ would be a working card, and he has an ace|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|wstuart: The question was posed that if EW knew both hands, why would they not bid 6@D (not knowing the NS layout).|pg||
nt|rhelle: lead: either a small trump or the @dK|pg||
nt|harmon: prob d3 uless defense slips|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|algraves: down 2 or 3 it seems|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, 3@d is pretty much bound to be hopeless unless partner miraculously has two of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: No reason whatsoever for Lauria to double, as I see it. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: ron tried a small @h to his stiff jack, but unfortunately moss was aware about that card|pg||
nt|jillan:  because it is a poor slam|pg||
nt|chorush: mainly because it is about a 41% contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jillan:  it has ONE virtue - it makes|pg||
nt|harmon: need to start spades for 5th trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd start with @h ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martel-Stansby seem to be on their way to slam too|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|ritong: no clear reason to give up on trump attack|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria said he miscounted last hand, thought he had 21|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: so do we have a guess re 2 @C?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did he really, though, or was that just to annoy N/S?|pg||
nt|ritong: naturally, when opps go down a bunch, the first reaction should be " hey, did we have something to play" instead of " har har har  suckers"|pg||

nt|dinos1: and then? 6@h?|pg||
nt|kit: and Weinstein needs to find the 6@H call|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he should|pg||
nt|kit: Platnick may take a save over a slam -- but maybe not, fear of pushing them into a grand|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, he has void, ace, @s tolerance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue-Cheek +1660  in 12@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're 6 boards ahead of their other table|pg||
mb|5S|nt|algraves: Lauria played too quickly there as it was clear to not play a third spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@C opener was 16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D-5@S-6@D-6@S/DBL-end|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ritong: they prolly have a tool to show 5@s 4@h limit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they are joking that it might go all pass at othe table|pg||
nt|dburn: but 6@s is pretty good - not straightforward to bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks good for a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: result is accurate|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|wstuart: Since the IMP returns are +11 IMPs for 920 vs 420 and -10 IMPs for -50 vs -400, the slam needs to be an 11:21 favorite in order to break even, wihch is 52%|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, 3NT was hard to defeat on previous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11  game force|pg||
nt|kit: clear to double for club ruff and hope to have another trick I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|bg: yes 2h =5spades 4 hearts|pg||
nt|chorush: That's true, Wayne, when you compare it with 5 of a minor but not when 3NT is an alternative|pg||
nt|harmon: sometimes opening light gets you, this was one of em|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco probably surprised how quickly his drek improved|pg||
nt|kit: although it doesn't work well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry BAL 9-11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open 2@C  that will really change tone of auction in other room|pg||
nt|ritong: we often observe that, but again, see how experts are reluctant with stiff aces|pg||
nt|ritong: stiff ace is "total control" of the suit, but in reality it is an inactive card|pg||
nt|dinos1: but dangerous with @sKJx under|pg||
nt|kit: Levin might get the spades wrong though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: West in the OR chose 1NT after South decided to open 1@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well my copy of convention card also says 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so same auction as Grue-Cheek table|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: possible 11 tricks  let s see|pg||
nt|marinesa: many pairs play 2h is 5s,4h 0-9 and 2s is 5s,4h and 10-11 something in this range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Stansby  buys 4@H south  after  2@C-2@H-3@C-P//4@C-4@D-P-4@H//end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 4@H North|pg||
nt|ritong: here, i guess hampson, with small singleton in @c and @s Ax would have passed, offering pard to go on|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: long ause by each player at every opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to mention -- even if you lead Ace from AK -- at 5 level and higher that should switch back to King from AK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the idea is you need to know whether or not to cash out   and  higher chance that you'll want to lead unsupported Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Ace gets attitude   and King gets count|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco-Levin (screenmates) talking inaudibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope this hasn't been discussed already ....|pg||
nt|ritong: inactive card means it will be unuseful to develop tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I think NS play Rodwell's  Inversion   where  others play DBL in Forcing Pass situations as "don't bid"  i think this DBL says the opposite -- i'm ok with you bidding more|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is, for intermediate/advanced player, it is awesome to hold stiff ace in opponent s suit|pg||
nt|ritong: it is not bad, of course, but not as great as one might think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: singleton Ace overrated in a lot of situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   since this is probably NOT a Forcing Pass situation   DBL may just say "extras"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: looks like 1 off, another 11 IMP swing|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe -2, actually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Michael|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if they've increased min for 1@C, maybe they've reduced min for 2@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hampson-Levin discussing soory|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin head in hands shking it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marinesa: especially precision pairs|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D shows a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: on the previous hand that is|pg||
nt|algraves: a lot of work to do in slam , KX spades is very favourable of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: a joke it is for sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: any shortness, 3@H ask and 3@S= singleton @C|pg||
nt|dburn: to say nothing of 4-3 diamonds with the king right, and the heart finesse on should North lead the suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this method appears on their card.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: 6@c demands several good news|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: the @h 9 had for purpose to diagnose if south has a stiff honor|pg||
nt|ritong: noone would cover with Hx(x)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: if 3@S was shortness   North hand has gotten much worse|pg||
nt|ritong: of course i am not aware about tarzan's subtleties|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wstuart: very true, Ira|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it seems that 3@h should come from Hx rather than xx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we had a system expert doing commentary last set - but it is very late where he is now  [poland]|pg||
nt|ritong: just my (uninformed) two cents|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: why tarzan?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could also have been just shape showing|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: weiss/muller|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: have to go now, enjoy the rest of the match|pg||
nt|yuval10: bye|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao|pg||
nt|ritong: brad is not the only facetious one around this table, seems|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well bid, anyway. They are over the first hurdle of a two-hurdle-race.|pg||
nt|algraves: so all reasonable lines of play will work it seems|pg||
nt|robbg:  anyway that is backwards, if those were the only 2 possible results the needed odds would be 10/21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@C a relay rather than showing @C|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: 3@D= fit and a singleton. 3@H asking etc|pg||
nt|sybarra: weiss/muller, sounds like wiesmuiler who played tarzar in 1930's (also champion swimmer)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 58  Nickell over Fleisher by a mere 4 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell original  2 seed    Fleisher  7|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, we had few opportunities to observe it, but muller is a rreal tough guy, especially in the opening lead compartiment|pg||
nt|sybarra: Johnny Weissmuller....correct spelling |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond  3 seed and Berg has risen from  22|pg||
nt|kit: big problem here|pg||
nt|kit: would South double with KJx of spades?  That is what Levin is wondering|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred asked about 3H and brad asked about 3D but I didn't get conclusive answers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D opening could have been 2290|pg||
nt|dinos1: u thk S played J from Jx?|pg||
mc|12|nt|hedyg: a limited hand, no more than 4-5 controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is reassuring when he takes so long to work out the best plan. Makes you want to give up the game when they pick up 12 tricks without pausing for breath.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is not easy|pg||
nt|algraves: lol, very complicated if you are trying to make with spades 3-1 as you would like to ruff 3 clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: he may start @cA, club ruff, @dQ intending to pitch a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I suppose, he may just take the heart finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: don't see any other serious runners, but far from clear which of those two is favourite|pg||
nt|harmon: I think he needs the ht finesse, but I let better analysts decide|pg||
nt|algraves: yes he may be thinking of heart finesse and then if that works to finesse club with fall back on 2-2 spades with king on side|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did choose the splinter bid art the other table and, as you see, they have netted 1430 at the other table. If you put your cursor over the result, you can see the auction.|pg||
nt|algraves: first really big hand of the match as slam may not be bid in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: oh i see|pg||
nt|algraves: that is a great feature|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead made it a bit easier.|pg||
nt|harmon: Fleischer leading Nickell 20-0 after 6|pg||
pg||

nt|ritong: notice greco's 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: arguing the score now|pg||
nt|ritong: starting with 1@s might be less efficient|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss thought there were only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: Versace has very good feel at the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Fred was in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: looks normal to reach 3NT with these two hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: possible correction on board 38|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: due to dispute|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry everyone -- i don't know if there is webcam this set|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chorush: 5 clubs within a hair of making here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: west claims he played the hand due to wrong information|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1@s = 9+, 4+@h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|passell: yes seems very likely|pg||
nt|ritong: strong @c for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  18+ bal|pg||
mb|3C|nt|algraves: NS can remind themselves that slam is natural to bid and almost every line makes|pg||
nt|kit: yet another possible slam hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: will eldad suggest slam?|pg||
nt|harmon: 6c here not the worst contract ive ever seen|pg||
nt|dburn: been in worse slams than 6@s on these cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3s alert|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, than 6@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=19-21   maybe specifically 19-20 ins 1st/2nd seat   i'm not sure if they do same as meckwell/greco-hampson|pg||
mb|3H!|an|+ !C stopper|nt|dburn: although it is certainly true that I have also been in worse slams than 6@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but not as many of them|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D game-forcing|pg||
nt|chorush: We are back to the nearly 5 club hand|pg||
nt|jillan:  can you make it double dummy Ira|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs behave, so no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bg: 3nt makes but hard to bid|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = 4@d, 5+@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: nope|pg||
nt|harmon: 3n a good result spade lead beats 3n|pg||
nt|kit: the double of 3@C may backfire, as now Platnick will know to upgrade his hand if Diamond makes a move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of 3@H  showing @C stop???|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@H-2@D-3@S= show2 5+@H-5+@C 12-14|pg||
nt|algraves: that is an interesting treatment , lots of merit in it |pg||
nt|chorush: I don't see how unless you get a trump lead or a heart and a heart continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: vulnerable brad would try|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@h = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 4+@S forcing   if 4@S then 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bg: true Henri this is an imp scale type of hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jillan:  I ment you personally >)(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical auctions -- go figure|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly everything behaves |pg||
nt|passell: 2dia was a winning bid if he had rebid 1nt fred would be hard pressed to raise|pg||
nt|kit: But no move by Diamond -- I think he should make one try, and that is all Platnick would need|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  in the other room    5@D-5@S-end|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: non vulnerable possible gain is not much bigger than possible loss|pg||
nt|ritong: so, better go quietly and avoid adrenalina rushes|pg||
nt|ritong: not that brad tends to avoid that:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d = 3=5=4=1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry possible correction from down 3 to down 2|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with two baby hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if Moss thought hand was balanced he would open 1N [good 14] rather than downgrade|pg||
nt|passell: one reason I am on the side line I would rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N -- YOU MADE ME BID|pg||

pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Greco pulled out 3@D, put it back|pg||
nt|ritong: landing in anice lil spot|pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to ira chorush|pg||
nt|chorush: hi everyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: tried to bid 3@D twice, BALK the second time|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, hi ira:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chorush: you need to lead trumps twice from dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry we were disconnected|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike - would you do that in your Big Club partnerships too?|pg||
nt|passell: probably open 1nt as it is in range for the big clubbers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4 to play    Nickell now over Fleisher by ONE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so all of the specs who said North shouldn't bid 6@D on 23 -- take a bow  [on THIS hand]|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jillan:  you certainly need som e luck here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director has not ruled yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: score correction in the other match   4 to play, match is TIED|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if 2N guarantees the canape hand, but it   seems balanced would NOT have bid 1@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: impossible to find @S8 now|pg||
nt|ritong: how so?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's only to save overtrick  i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thinking from the auction and Gitelman breaking the suit|pg||
nt|ritong: 280 is 7 imps|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think East has pretty clear 6@H call anywy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chorush: It could be 280 Henri|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marinesa: i'm surprised brad didn't make bid 2c followed by 2s, mild try, i think they play 2way cb|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok guys, sorry  will say good night,    long day for me  head on key board :) |pg||
nt|ritong: it will|pg||
nt|dinos1: too good hand to pass|pg||
mc|13|nt|bg: gain 6imps to make 3nt nv lose 5 if down one but gain 10 vul vs lose6 if down therefore bid close vul games|pg||
nt|sybarra: gn all |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Henri it is right to remove later option in case declarer DOES hold @S10|pg||
nt|ritong: well in fact both defensers are depressed contemplting their three @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. force guess/committment early|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Fred read SJ Simon who's philosophy over preempts was   "if you're fixed -- stay fixed"|pg||
nt|kit: considering that they had AK doubleton of spades opposite queen-doubleton and slam was still okay, indicates that South's judgment was off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably doesn't really apply  i just like referring to SJ Simon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Kamil DID bid 3@S after same start |pg||

nt|harmon: 6h makes 6d goes down on roght lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: great EW result here|pg||
nt|harmon: yes|pg||
nt|rhelle: and 7@c is a cheap save, of course - 3 off|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel-Stansby use Flannery, which would discourage a spade overcall|pg||
nt|dinos1: juniors for sure)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher-Kamil did reach 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: or try some joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: gitelman showed interest when the tray came back.  usually is very stoic|pg||
nt|ritong: good time to have a gadget for minors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Another slam - just when I have to head for my wine-tasting. Ah well, it was 75 minutes very enjoyably spent. Bye!|pg||
nt|chorush: One of the disadvantages is that is allows the opponents to overcall freely at the one level. A major advantage is that it hinders the opponents from their natural bidding when ...|pg||
nt|chorush: they have the weak NT opener|pg||
nt|rhelle: as 1@d is artificial, 4@d must be pass or correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: North is looking for a save,|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chorush: 2 clubs has not been alerted, but I believe it is a transfer to 2D which is a cue bid raise with 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: and will be surprised his partner's suit is @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: 8 comparisons left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N very anti-systemic according to my copy of their CC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best retort:  they also play flannery, or they also think it's bizarre? :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@D = 6/9 4 cartas|pg||
nt|ritong: greco has not a great hand, and the @ss behind him do not improve matters|pg||
nt|ybob: sry private|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time i did not intend double entendre -- but it turned out to be decent straight line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- Levin thinks hand too good for 3N??|pg||
nt|kit: wonder why Levin bid 4@C with heart stopper.  |pg||
nt|dinos1: and 4@c is P/C then|pg||
nt|kit: I think he may have thought 3@H Michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe he treats 3@H as 2-suiter|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems so|pg||
nt|kit: if so, they might not even reach game|pg||
nt|kit: and that could win, as slam goes down on spade lead|pg||
nt|dinos1: wonder they have misunderstanding in simple seq|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their ACBL convention card from 2010 Trials doesn't mention this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: NS have 7 losers hope they do not vul get them into unprofitable sac|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|dburn: and seven making on a fluke if you accidentally bid it|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel must now have a way to show his strong NT|pg||
nt|harmon: he knows his suit is clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: north wrote to east that he "thought 3d showed diamonds but not 100% sure"|pg||
nt|harmon: pard asked for d stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D meant to be mixed??  or is that their preempt|pg||
nt|chorush: I think it is mixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Most experts play that 2 spades is Nickells weakest action|pg||
nt|rhelle: does he? Partner can't have @ds after the precision 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: at least that is what the note said|pg||
nt|harmon: oh ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure how east kept a straight face during that explanation|pg||
nt|rhelle: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: that's the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: fred: really?"|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, he knows now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|harmon: Eric might might just bid 6h|pg||
nt|chorush: Which seems an overstatement, if true|pg||
nt|kit: always possible they changed recently, and one of them forgot the change|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chorush: Pass would be stronger|pg||
mc|12|nt|dburn: 2NT forcing, no doubt a useful treatment, but Versace is a bit cramped for room now|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5NT = pick a slam, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i scrambled thinking 1st seat favorable MIGHT be 9-12 but nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing "Leaping Michaels"  (2@H)-4@C/@D  shows @S & the bid minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: serious discussion by EW now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so common treatment for (2@H)-3@H to ASK stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: clearly misunderstanding|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: loud discussion from hall, kibitzer gail greenberg hurries to close door|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he claimed 7 on a squeeze but ns objected|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director has been nagging the players about being slow now he says|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they might not be able to play all the boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just another push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, if game is cold and his counterparts find @ds too, it would be an important loss|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: So Katz' double transformed a loss to a gain. Hard to blame Stansby for thinking that 3NT wasn't going to make|pg||
nt|rhelle: another testing board|pg||
nt|chorush: Big opportunity here for diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match this was push at 7@S=|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|harmon: they were right too|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  how to stay out of game here|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 boards played, 45-45. Incredible match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond-Platnick really put on pressure in other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@S is just natural Game Force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   there is another 7@S hand coming   it was a swing in Grue match|pg||
mb|r|nt|dburn: were they? wasn't North going to be show-up-squeezed in hearts and clubs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sry i always try to say when declarer claims t1 because people ask why I didn't type in the cards that went by|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually other room only on 59   but other match at least 4 boards faster|pg||
nt|ritong: muller has to move|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and good interference in our room too|pg||
nt|ritong: i think 3@s is @s and @c, since likely 2@s would be forcing already|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  13 is that pushed grand|pg||
nt|chorush: They have received the same sort of preemption here with one important difference: Greco knows that Hampson has a GAME FORCE with spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director just walked in, warning upcoming|pg||
nt|chorush: In the other room it went 1C-1D-1S so North's hand was very ill-defined|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: mrs greenberg is brad's mom|pg||
nt|algraves: so cheek and gure play negative doubles after 2NT unusual|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: south said he was able to pitch|pg||
nt|chorush: A double by Katz here might have turned what will be a minus into a plus|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes a double from Katz wold have made it a bit simpled for Nickell|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 2@s hoping pard can bid NTs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: greco hand is HUGE on this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  Fleisher has read Kit's book -- opens 3@H|pg||
nt|dinos1: :)|pg||
nt|kit: interesting that Weinstein redoubles -- I would think most expert pairs bid 1@S on that hand rather than show points|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue coulda pitched his q of d|pg||
nt|dburn: he was right about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting DBL|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, south has a rockcrusher for @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but can Hampson envision @H void?    no way they bid the grand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but big gain just be getting to 6level|pg||
nt|chorush: Since Hampson has received a grand slam invitation, he may be able to bid it now with his trumps|pg||
mb|3D|nt|harmon: no diff|pg||
nt|wstuart: Surely Nick will bid here, prob 5@C rather than 4NT.|pg||
nt|chorush: Mind you Katz has a terrible hand but he does have what he knows are a wasted AK of hearts|pg||
nt|wstuart: wrong again.|pg||
nt|dinos1: and now 3@s will be GF?|pg||
nt|kit: and Platnick's takeout double with 2-1 in majors wouldn't be a popular choice either|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh, sry, PH :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  Fleisher in 3@HX|pg||
nt|kit: can't be GF, as passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: grue needed Q10 of d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Tough decision between 5@C and 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: that will be 11 tricks and 3 IMPs - bringing the match exactly level|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he s not certain small slam will be bid other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will be good hand for partnership discussion  --   greco's choices of 5@H, 5N, 6@D  ....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|wstuart: hmmm|pg||
nt|jillan:  don't think Nickell tought pass was NF|pg||
nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|ritong: and an accident, like a @c ruff, can happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well last few hands we've sure seen some      weird|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: makeable|pg||
nt|ritong: auction is crystal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: create doubt -- might help explain how Diamond team won the World Championships in Philly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rosenblum Cup|pg||
nt|ritong: this looks like a deciding board|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ritong: guess @ds and bye bye clara|pg||
nt|bg: personally I am not a fan of not bidding out shape the 3 club bid could be an artificial force in some structures I would bid 4 clubs over 3 spades and show the shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought @CK to @D finesse was mirage|pg||
nt|ritong: a decision, al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems extra chances if low @D from hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the guess is: who has @d Hx|pg||
nt|ritong: when south can have @d HHx, i agree small to ten is better|pg||
nt|dburn: might have been easier in hearts, this|pg||
nt|jillan:  this will cost....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: pass over 1@s is three @ss and mini values|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chorush: will be down 2 since Martel won't get th diamond lead he was hoping for|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult to diagnose what went through their minds, but the difference between the two auctions is brad's surprising double|pg||
nt|dinos1: still better quickly to show the main value - good @s suit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfe: east says he forgot pass was forcing|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: now of course, if north ducks smoothly..|pg||
nt|ritong: redouble is " please look closer"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: and pass over 2@h is " no, really sorry mate"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: brad sees dummy, calls director, suggests ginossar has broken tempo over 2@S|pg||
nt|ritong: my perso style would be a fitjump in 2@s after pass|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: showing 5@s 4@d inviting values|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: none of these players will pass immediately with no problem as some others do|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades, declarer will have to pick up the trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: and he may not have the entries to do it, once he finds that East has four|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: after @SA lead @Dx seems even clearer -- then @DA and if suit not running, hope for 5@C 1@D 2@H 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if North wins @D -- well you're no worse off|pg||
nt|bg: only hopr her is a low dia play N for doubleton honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: retraction -- just noticed @C discard from trick 1|pg||
nt|dburn: GIB would make it, of course, but although Cheek is a terrific player, he doesn't make everything that GIB would|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: gitelmoss certainly reserv that to an other handtype|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ginossar seemed upset by the director call, takes some time to compose himself|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: he had to decide early|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: maybe that should have been @D|pg||
nt|algraves: the downside to 2 suited interference is the distributional information it gives away|pg||
nt|dburn: Cheek may have been uncertain as to whether 4@h was an offer to play, or a control-bid for spades|pg||
nt|dburn: if he'd known it was the former, he'd almost certainly have passed it|pg||
nt|ritong: up to you to draw your own conclusions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's it -- he gave them a chance to go wrong - and they accepted|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|harmon: play ht now|pg||
nt|harmon: needs hts 2-2|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: if he loses a heart to West and a fourth round of diamonds is played...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but actually NS right in a sense    they needed a swing and 3N wasn't going to get one|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jillan:  ahh, ok, THAT explains it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|ritong: he will learn|pg||
nt|harmon: HE NEEDED the heart hook of he couldnt make it|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, I guess he can handle that, but if one isn't played, he can't pick the spades up|pg||
nt|harmon: or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and line of play  possibly intentionally different in hopes of swing|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: smells like a push|pg||
nt|algraves: nice defense of course|pg||
nt|dburn: he might, though, have decided not to finesse hearts - he could make by finessing clubs instead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: stay stoic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match  on  25  Cheek also passed after 3@H-DBL|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: need Michael Rosenberg or Bart Bramley for the single-dummy analysis|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

mb|2D!|an|!D-major|nt|algraves: how does he make after the ruff sluff?|pg||
nt|chorush: Its a good question Al, but with his Jxxx of trumps I personally don't think he would bid 6D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the real point    opponent interference makes confident small/grand slam bidding very difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "if"   what a wimpy word Al|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: with 3 to score   O'Rourke leads Nickell by 7|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think DBL showed a 5+ card minor + 4 card major?|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, I assume 2 diamonds asks for pass or correction to major|pg||
nt|ybob: sus aperturas van de 11 a 15, 1@C de 16 +|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H or 1@s?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 4+ @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@c = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since other room didn't get to slam    small vs grand  insignificant imp difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director "you need to hurry"|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: It's interesting that Martel didn't jam with 3@H here - I guess he thought he had enough defense with both majors that he wasn't worried about getting outbid.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: diredctor "the boards ween't that hard at at any other table"|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other match has finished 1st Quarter    Grue over Kang  57-35|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: hampson " i promise we won't play ant faster with you standing over the table"|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||

nt|chorush: battle of nerves here|pg||
nt|poohbear: The  " I hope they run " redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice Support DBL even when Hampson's 1@S implies 5+|pg||
nt|chorush: 4Hxx down 2 with trumps led early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i say implies since not sure if they'll bid 1@S with really good 4-card suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: 3@h now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought previous set 1N was Semi-Force     maybe Semi over 1@H and absolute over 1@S|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|harmon: he cant unless ht onside that was my point|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: they|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North has choices ... 3@s = strong relay, only asks controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@c = weak relay, asks for max and controls|pg||
pc|dA|nt|harmon: before everyone yelled at mne lol|pg||
nt|chorush: Not that often that 2NT is right as "save" over 2 spades; here it is going to make when 2 spades also would have made (I think)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@d = signoff, asks partner to bid 4@h, so that he can pass or bid the final contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: lets see if fred can save 1 imp making 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss trying to find an escort to leave the room and ginossar tells him just to go|pg||

nt|chorush: potentially 600 coming provided a trump shift is made after the first club lead|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|wstuart: Asked by a spec;  I think His DBL of 2@S is probably more strongly penalty oriented.|pg||
nt|chorush: Depends on what their methods are. They might as well not play 2 spades dbld because I don't think they will beat it. Could be wrong though|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa baby   Fleisher just picked up another 10    2 to play  Fleisher leads Nickell by 16|pg||
nt|ritong: fred could try for slam|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think Fleisher vs Diamond would be rematch from final of the 2010 Team Trials  and  final of 2010 spingold??|pg||
nt|ritong: his hand is limited|pg||
nt|ritong: but he took the low road|pg||
nt|ritong: (confidentially, he knows brad can be overactive in finishing situations)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: asking for @H shift instead of giving away @C position|pg||

nt|ahollan1: apparently NS don't open bal 11 with Precision 1@D   [makes sense with North hand -- especially vul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: very nice slam - hard to bid.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: for specs unfamiliar with the treatment    2N showed Balanced Game Force   a totally new concept that was introduced in 1920s|pg||
nt|bg: this pair obviously use 2nt as a balanced openig bid vs others who use Jacoby--both styles have their merits|pg||

nt|ritong: meaning " i would open 3@h"|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: awkward for South, this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Did east miss his chance by not splintering over the 2@H rebid?|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, Wayne, slam is quite good and hard to bid. I always have trouble when I don't start with a direct forcing raise. Let's see if Katz does better than I would|pg||
nt|dinos1: no intermediates at all!|pg||
nt|wstuart: my ass is sore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Levin "i liked it alot, .... obviously!)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|chorush: Most partnerships have a rule that there are generally no new suits bid at the four level. So 4D is a cue for heartswith slam interest|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: what a lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|dinos1: @hK is rather over so will play @hA low @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like tough problem for Diamond at trick 2  -- starts with what Platnick's carding is when dummy shows singleton @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  in context of standard carding  ---  what should 3rd hands play show at trick 1?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: Liz the tables dont seem to be connected?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

nt|wstuart: a well earned push/|pg||
nt|ritong: all these considerations about preempting pard etc are not really reliable  preempts are precise bids  here muller has a textbook 3@h good suit, no outside values|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfe: fred calling cards so softly moss has to ask|pg||
nt|chorush: In slam bidding, there is a special responsibility placed upon the partner who holds the AK of trumps. His partner is doing all this inviting without them, so... should strain to ...|pg||
nt|chorush: accept|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: THIS is the hand that was pushed at 7@S= min the Grue-Kang match|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: not sure about their style, but this @c Ax is surely worth an effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C must deny 3+@S|pg||
nt|wstuart: Spec asks what is the diff between the 2@S cue and a potential 2@C cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h = 2=2=5=4 exactly, 6-8 points|pg||
nt|passell: moss may raise 5dia though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other SemiFinal  thru 25   Grue [ 21 seed] 97  vs  Kang [ 41] 53|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: hard not to|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wstuart: Many play that the higher cue is more trumps and less HCP then the lower cue.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@h also promises at least 1 control, so North will be wondering what to do next. 6@d looks possible|pg||
nt|harmon: can he have 2 controls??|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s asks for controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: bd 9 6NT +1|pg||
nt|passell: well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder what 2@S-P-P-4@S shows?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: 2@S-P-P-4@C/@D often @H & the minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would have been relay for more info    not sure about implications of direct 3@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: just not sure if 6th @C shown|pg||
nt|chorush: different pairs have different uses. Could be 2 spades shows 4 card support and 2C shows 3. Each to his own|pg||
nt|passell: needs 2 3-2 breaks and a lot more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think double dummy defense can set this 4    starts with @H lead|pg||
nt|ritong: now a battle of undertricks|pg||
nt|ritong: three looks like a lot of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then they must untangle @S winners while retaining transportation in @H -- extremely unlikely|pg||
nt|bg: rebid of the minor usually shows 6 with 3 hearts better to raise hearts with unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ritong: but|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Bruce -- but there is slight impact playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|ritong: try @c hook, loses, a @h back|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 11 3@H -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: now the contract makes with @d K on|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: depending on 1N rebid -- 1@H can be used to show exactly 3@H [1N=weak balanced hand] or 2/3@H  [1N=18-19]|pg||
nt|harmon: Hedy why u disconnect tables??|pg||
nt|ritong: offer him an entry!|pg||
nt|passell: if the Q of clubs didnt fall would need that hand to have 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ritong: pitch @d J|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: i like how he thinks  he says sorry if you can make 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C from Levin??|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c by W - 4@h by E)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: so 3@h 2@s 1@c 1@d|pg||

nt|hedyg: for Cayne|pg||
nt|wstuart: However, there is a difference when you have overcalled 1M and 1m - when you've overcalled 1m 3NT is a likely contract and it is useful to play that you cue the one that you have a ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper in, while after 1M the number of trumps and hand type is more important.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: he is facing his hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't know what the NS undersdtanding is here.|pg||
nt|jillan:  a wll played match with a lot of interesting hands and actions|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: pachtmann toying with his cards, trick 1 still faced|pg||
nt|chorush: This seems very hard hand to bid to grand because each hand had features that are essential to the success of the contract and they meld very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good idea from spec   2N with 4@S  other bids guarantee 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S = 2 Key Cards + Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: at least they managed to right-side it - should be a few overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not clear if Levin has shown @C shortness|pg||

nt|dburn: well, if their opponents had made 6NT at the other table, they might not want it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to have sequence that shows invite with exactly 4333|pg||
nt|dburn: 6NT was... well, I've seen worse|pg||
nt|passell: moss gittleman having their way here  their team mates dont suspect they are in this great shape|pg||
nt|warrens:  isn't it about 70%, either a finesse or 3-3 @C's or a black suit squeeze|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot worse, to be honest - almost convincing myself it's a good contract|pg||
nt|passell: yes  at least 70 percent slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i would be very sad not to be in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: having seen Brad in action -- might just bid 6N here|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|ritong: when things come to slam, 4/4 fit is important|pg||
nt|po-s: agree|pg||
nt|dburn: I'll go out and come in again|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|chorush: welcome back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  south not forced to abandon a loser -- but when last card known to be @CQ declarer KNOWS north holds @SQ|pg||
mb|2D!|an|good !H raise|nt|ritong: even with a 4333|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfe: director sitting on chair as only kibitzer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ginossar/pachtmann not having fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell v O'Rourke showing  Nickell +7 with 2 to play  there is possible scoring error of 3 or 4 imps [it would be in favor of O'Rourke]|pg||
nt|hedyg: live streaming from the OR: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/bridgeunion|pg||
nt|dburn: but it would have been wrong to bid eight - that really was against the odds|pg||
nt|dinos1: trf to trumps shows good raise, 2@h wd be weak|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great work getting explanations into BBO record!!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wstuart: Chpis turn to get his lead directing DBL in|pg||
nt|chorush: will Katz think his hand worth a raise?|pg||
nt|wstuart: *Chip's|pg||
nt|ritong: but things do not come to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: untouchable today|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S instead of 1N means Moss ON DEFENSE gets 100 honors|pg||
nt|bg: not much joy in this hand eather|pg||
nt|ritong: but imps no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: even if few|pg||
nt|hedyg: far left is Cayne, far right Amoils|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like 10 tricks on a low @c lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N?  wow  that wasn't on the list of bids to consider|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: with the @hs breaking 22|pg||
nt|dburn: when did this match start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Nick won't|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's interesting that EW do'nt ahve any special methods here to try and get the contract played by the hand that has a @C stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: long ago|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, on approximately what day?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 2:25 ago|pg||
nt|ritong: hampson and the director won t go to holidays together|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting non-strength showing reverse in comp   when partner has implied no 4-card major|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: very close decision from Platnick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: but as we see  Weinstein obviously does bid 1N over DBL with 4-card major  so good to have partnership agreement|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chorush: Guess that is commentator's curse|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's reasonable to play pass to say he doesn't have any reason for a @C lead to come up to his hand, then try and get the major suit contracts played by east, who might have a @C ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: stopper.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: and a @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d by Versace would have shown both majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @C 9 was upside down count - the @s2 upside down attitude|pg||
nt|rhelle: so North has an odd number of @cs and likes @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: likes decent 5-card spade suit opposite expected short @H in partner's hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: he knows pd has stiff @h |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now he just has to find 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing all hands  he can even make overtrick --- but at the table ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein wants to kill dummy's @C suit but can't do all of   knock out @HA  knock out @DA  tap dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wstuart: I think this might make double dummy.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ritong: best is to duck that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred fidgeting with quitted trick, hand folded|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  bigtrain [Walter Johnson] says if scoring error  it would be Nickell +1 with 1 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing our match had ANY spectators|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: with bbotv can watch more than one room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right -- never thought about them  even though one is ME|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: fred finally fans his cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we who logged in to watch this match  saw a lot of very solid play from Diamond|pg||
nt|passell: unreal taking this position with a monster game going|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, squeeze looks like it will work|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|bg: sometimes better to use only two entries to play on side duit like clubs which requires two finesses  and jus lead spade away from king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa    de ja vu|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: if he can ruff 2@C and strip squeeze N he might do it.|pg||

nt|chorush: 2C is a relay to 2D, I believe|pg||
nt|passell: the last board of the set has potential for a game swing  dont take a break yet|pg||
nt|chorush: The thought here is probably Fred deciding whether to double 2D|pg||
nt|ritong: if 2@c is a puppet, he is probably wondering about it right now|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: correct, Ira|pg||

nt|ritong: ton kooijman warned them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both matches playing same boards -- other match will NOT start earlier this match  [that's my story & i'm sticking to it]|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves: he had to draw exactly 2 @H then play on clubs. Lauria can win thrid club and play @S but you ruff in dummy and ruff club and play last heart to dummy to draw trumps|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 scores in  Fleisher leads by 37 over Onstott    Berg over Lynch by 74|pg||
nt|chorush: One moral of this story is that when you play cards to help partner, it may help declarer as much or more. the diamond 9 was a tipoff, with the K he would have no reason to ...|pg||
nt|chorush: discourage a diamond return|pg||
nt|wstuart: 3NT on these auctions shows specifically long and good @D since 2NT would be bid on 18-19 bal hands.|pg||
nt|chorush: I think Nick's hand is too good for his action|pg||
nt|wstuart: Nice point, Ira|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, he|pg||
nt|chorush: Both sides make exactly 3 of major on this hand. A triumph for the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2+@D  [they play Precision 2@D opening  3-suit 0/1@D]|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: !|pg||

nt|dinos1: 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N was down 1  so another 8 for Fleisher  who are 54-28 for the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play is faster than 1st set, but not nearly as solid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|wstuart: However, it may be a least of evils decision - I don't know their methods well enough to undersdtand his other consideratoins.|pg||

nt|mikeirl: is tuesday ok for  u|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 1NT response had a small chance  2@s has not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll surely see Nickell v O'Rourke in final set of the night -- and if this table one of last to finish this match too|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss: "sorry if this is wrong"|pg||
nt|algraves: he was playing east to be 7411 I think|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c = mild invitation|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@h needs 3-3, 6N - @c3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, 1NT with four trumps, a singleton and a king would be fancy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like Nickell will end set trailing O'Rourke by 8|pg||
nt|lc: The triumph was for the 3@H bid -- which looks ugly, but forced East into the wrong guess.|pg||
nt|dinos1: specs want pass, but pd hasnt to have @dA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: this result easy to accept -- when you're +80|pg||

nt|rhelle: this should be swiftly -1 ...|pg||

nt|bobh1: Hi Alex.  Miss you being here.  We're having fun. Hope you and family ae well. |pg||
nt|dburn: for the benefit of any layman who may have wandered in, "zeitnot" means "time trouble"|pg||
nt|dinos1: or fin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep -- but i thought impressive to notice the possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: yoou are in zeitnot when alloted time is almost trespassed   chess expression|pg||

nt|passell: 4 spades is the best spot here also|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfe: fred calling cards more audibly this hand|pg||
nt|multiphren: it means you do not have to write down your moves anymore zeitnot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like German or Yiddish word|pg||
nt|ahollan1: an interesting option for specs -- try setting BBO so that you only see 1 hand -- you'd be amazed how many bids/plays would be different than when trying to ignore seeing all 4 ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hands|pg||
nt|dinos1: hardly pd has 4@s4@c - wd X 1@h then|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Bergen would bid 1@S-3@S   that might convince East to Pass|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and probably easier to find 9 tricks in 3@S than in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which really?   3@S with West   or   Pass from East??|pg||
nt|ritong: i mean 1) would bergen preempt two passed hands and 2) would west give up?|pg||
nt|ritong: esat*|pg||
nt|ritong: east**|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure 3@S -- descriptive     East Passing -- that's why i said "might"  only 5 trump, 3 quick outside losers [3@S won't have Ace]|pg||
nt|dinos1: german, zeit = time|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: and that is 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: it is German - it literally means "time need"|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ritong: hi larry|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h2|nt|bg: does bergen apply by a passed hand? 3s is just a preempt with good hands use drury|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course playing the @s 10 is his only legitimate chance of making his contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||

nt|algraves: they play more like 13 to bad 16|pg||

mb|1C|nt|wstuart: There are many slam hands where that is the crucial and hard to determine peice of information if you don't ahve a specific agreemnt.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but teams can agree to start earlier|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and quick refresh now shows Grue [original 21] beat Cayne [ 4]     Fleisher [7] over Nickell [2]|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: i mentioned because South hand opposite a 14-16 NT improved during the auction|pg||
nt|dburn: well done Chip - knew you wouldn't let me down|pg||
nt|wstuart: I assume 3@C after 2NT would not have been forcing.|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't know enuf about their methods|pg||
nt|wstuart: Although, after a 2 level nerg DBL opposite a str NT it seems like it should be.|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h looks like a make - especially with the @d Ace before the king|pg||
nt|rhelle: a game on pretty minimal values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play precision so 3@S weaker than playing 'standard'|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: yes -- if EW negotiate @C ruff beat is easy|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the other room North opened 1NT - for reasons he better understand than I|pg||
nt|rhelle: and they made slam tried, all the way to 5@h :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: this was a very exciting set, been a long time since I saw so many swings|pg||
nt|rhelle: at this level, that is - my Monday night game produces them as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note partnership agreement that allows Platnick to PASS the 2@H bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Katz is going to have a good idea what to lead if it plays here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Chip's sequence expresses doubt about 3NT and Lew's stopper is surely about as weak as they come.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - he cant pass, can he?|pg||
nt|lc: I always tell my students : "Don't lay down"  or "underlead" aces.  I hope they don't see this deal. :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard for NS - S consider his @dK as losing card, and N consider @dQ as wasting oe)|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: now diamond and diamond will eventually beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but in real world ...|pg||
nt|dburn: no, he can't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the situation is a little different than DBL by 2nd and and cue from advancer|pg||
nt|dinos1: still i wdnt bid 2@d if i were going to pass any response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i still would have expected Q forces bid to confirmed fit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lc: Of course, after @CA, @C, West would have to switch to SPADES -- not DIAMONDS to beat it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Sergey  -- but WITH AGREEMENT can certainly see the appeal|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfe: my computer is having some problem|pg||
nt|algraves: now Versace will have to guess TX in trumps to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a little bit more Liz! |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: so we will be back about 15 minutes after all finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry lag not responding|pg||
nt|algraves: pershaps south did overtake and it was missed by recorder|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he just misguessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I tried to key it|pg||
nt|algraves: thrid diamond, and if neccessary 4th diamond promotes trump ten|pg||
nt|hedyg: np Liz, you didnt a good job! thanks @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: you did a good job* my keyboard too!|pg||
nt|algraves: even if south did not overtake it seems natural for West to misguess the third diamond after south wins trump ace|pg||
nt|sillafu: how can he misguess|pg||
nt|hedyg: Liz it is minus 1 for sure?|pg||
nt|hedyg: the result of -1 confirmed|pg||
nt|wstuart: Now they need to not overstate their values.|pg||
nt|wstuart: VWD for Martel-Stansby!|pg||
nt|wstuart: There is a reason they have won so many championships.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chorush: looks like this one can't be beaten|pg||
nt|wstuart: (VWD = very well done)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: Diamond also in 4@S on  14   but Stansby never bid with North hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still not sure they'd get to game|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, as I told - tuff hands for bidding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Deutsch [original  16]  dethrones the defenders Monaco   152-91|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|ritong: see you to morrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ok, we're done, see you tomorrow|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|ritong: see you all to morrow for further adventures|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rhelle: anyway .. thank you all for watching some exciting and great bridge|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: merci a tous   see you soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they finished all boards!!   that was far from automatic 25 minutes ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  15 minute break after other room finishes|pg||
nt|chorush: actually "only" 20 minutes late|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2 minutes late|pg||
nt|chorush: with screens they allow about 2:15 for 16 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all rooms will start at the same time, with duplicated hands|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  30 so you can watch them finish after negotiated claim here|pg||
nt|dinos1: thx all, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 1 hour 50 minutes|pg||
nt|dinos1: bye|pg||
pg||
