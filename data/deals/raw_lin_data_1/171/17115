pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|mrdct: the problem here for NS is that there isn't really a source of tricks in NS as south has no entries|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chilloncan: ish also a veteran of the Rita Shugart team in US at one time|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|mrdct: the rip of 3@hx to 3NT should make it clear to north that south intended 3@d as natural|pg||

nt|mrdct: but neither @s nor @d are breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: spades breaking ok, normal play brings in 3 trix|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: yet another hand with not much powder in it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: kang off to a good start with match with a partscore swing and a beatable game on their scoresheet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Patrick Huang of song and legend informs me that Sun was on the chinese team that finished 4th in Olympiad in turkey. patrick is a guy i am inclined to believe:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d come home for 4 tricks here so 7 tricks on top|pg||

nt|chilloncan: i am grateful to all the specs who are deluging me with information about EW:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|mrdct: once the @h switch comes though he'll need to play on @d|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|mrdct: north can even afford to not cash the setting trick and try to get it 2 down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: without 7 of diamonds, attacking that suit is more or less going for 33 break. ducking first heart and attacking spades makes u heavy favorite to get an 8th trick in spades, and ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: playing the last two rounds of spades (or last one) may put pressure on opps|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think south will be able to cling to all of his @ss|pg||
nt|chilloncan: still i agree that attacking diamonds seems the natural line|pg||
nt|mrdct: north is just think through whether or not anything could go wrong if he doesn't cash the @dK|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS can make 3@c so this could be OK for Grue|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct: an agressive (or insane) EW pair might try for a VUL 3NT here|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: swap the NS hands and 3NT is cold|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: single digit percent game if u swap the hands|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be welcome steadier for Grue as they lost quite a lot of imps towards the end of the 3rd session and a small swing on the 1st of this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: always get difficult with bbo program to "lead out of turn"  etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: all the hands so far in this set have been teeth-gnashers for the trailing team, little scope for rally|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|frankaus: 11 will get 13 imps 10 only 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: in which case he could then revert to @s and make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfh: West is deliberating|pg||
nt|frankaus: must cash @S or 11 |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mrdct: basically he was assuming @DK was offside for east's pass|pg||

mb|5D|mb|d|nt|mrdct: illustrating the general preference to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 fit as you get some pitches|pg||

nt|mrdct: which is going to go for 800 I think |pg||
pc|h7|nt|chilloncan: a lot of the bids chosen by NS here are probably motivated by a belief that opps in other room will push very aggressively, so attempting to duplicate those tactical siutuations|pg||

mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|nt|vugraphzfh: director has urged table to play faster|pg||
nt|mwigor: going back to the slam - i think ducking the club lead is 63% and playing for 4-3 trumps is 62%|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be exciting|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have 10 tricks in @h|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mwigor: so any small feeling about the lead (ie that it is a singleton) is enough to swing it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: on that hand moss also lead a @C and Kamil took the same line as Ish for -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes it is tricky to know how to assess the likelihood of singleton from the fact that a club was led, as the auction made that lead a substantial favorite to hit the baize|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1C is a very dangerous bid, just begging to be blown out of the auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: but NS have 6@c on ice|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|mrdct: when hampson delcarer in 6@s, he got a @h lead and could simply duck that and easily cater for @S5-2|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a bad game here for NS so a chance for Grue to extend the lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: easily? if heart loses he does not necessarily have enough discards if spades go bad|pg||
nt|mrdct: same auction so far in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@h passed around to south who dbls|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: W hand may not seem like a 3D raise, but there is a tactice benefit as it takes opps above the level where they can support double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: only if @h 5-1 i think (but what would I know!)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|chilloncan: sadly we are unlikely ever to amass a sizeable enough database to decide whether the tactic is worth repeating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North needs to be careful|pg||
nt|mrdct: how can NS go wrong here?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS must cash the @D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: why - what declarer going to do with his @d losers otherwise?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: put one on the @S suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he has 3 entries|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so if North overtakes...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to do something other than leading a @D..|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess stranger things have happened - but it would seem to only make sense for north to overtake if he had an absoluely clearcut action to take that partner either wont realise ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: or wont have the card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree with all that - so why the delay?|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe he's having trouble counting up west's 16 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West doesn't actualy have the canonical 16 HCP, so this is hard for NOrth to read|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe the internet is broken|pg||
nt|mrdct: north will be worried that perhaps west has a @d honour so he can't see an obvious way to beat this|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: admittedly the duck has big odds in its favor|pg||

nt|tejjyid: A lot to be said for a 6@C call from South|pg||
nt|mrdct: so tense stuff here with a couple of lost opportunties for NS in recent boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: who cares if it goes down, it's not at all stressful & probably cost 5 imps at worst|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plenty to be said when you see N hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ish could have less for 5C bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ISh could have been missing the @S A forexample|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it was SJ Simon who said not to defend these hands|pg||
nt|mrdct: F leading 158-112 in the other semi|pg||
