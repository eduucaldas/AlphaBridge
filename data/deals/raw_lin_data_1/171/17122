nt|algraves:  hello everyone|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chorush: Betting West was not expecting to be doubled|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed east played the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: @s 9 in dummy is good news|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: and made 4@S|pg||
nt|woozle: Frankly, the South hand, with no aces, no spades and no tricks in dummy's suit, will be a disappointment|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: on the @CK lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h3|nt|chorush: I think he will make 5|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|h7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|woozle: Ish can stop one club ruff in dummy for making 4|pg||
nt|chorush: right|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: the match will be tied|pg||
nt|woozle: Why did I say Ish? I guess I just figured that he's just the sort of North to double|pg||
nt|barnets: any chance of putting the north and south names up please ?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|h5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|algraves:  he had to lead a trump to have a chance sort of counter intuitive. Tough game bridge|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h8|pc|cJ|mc|10|nt|algraves:  then a second trump, then a @D when in with trump King|pg||
nt|ritong: lets restart this final  0-0|pg||
nt|barnets: well north is either ish or bahkshi|pg||
nt|barnets: c|pg||
nt|barnets: c|pg||
nt|barnets: can you tell us who s north ?|pg||
nt|chorush: a spec told me that GIB required specifically, the spade 7 to beat the contract but I am darned if I can figure out why|pg||

nt|athene: a good example here of the perils of doubling for takeout without support for all the unbid suits|pg||
nt|imp_jan: david bakhshi's first hand in a vandy final :)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|ritong: 3@c looks ok|pg||
nt|ritong: second choice 1 NT|pg||
nt|barnets: and thats where they are playing in closed|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: 2C, 3C and 1NT are all possible...it depends whether you have the sort of partner who doubles with 2452|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: After SAK, ruff, HK exit this looks like down only one thanks to the heart blockage|pg||
nt|barnets: wset has not passed yet|pg||
nt|woozle: If Bakhshi had passed, Stansby would have had the lovely problem 1S:1NT,2H:?|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|barnets: same contract same lead|pg||
nt|woozle: after a diamond exit, this can be made (or if East cashes DA before giving the ruff)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|woozle: after a spade, ruffed by west, and a diamond, Ish can just ruff with the ten and claim...or ruff with the ace and hook the ten|pg||
nt|woozle: OK, Martel adds a twist by not taking the spade ruff|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gambit: perhaps N might have entertained 1NT, he knows S has the reds, would solve this problem |pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe Ish can read that if Stansby didn't want a ruff (with a SP signal on the DA) then maybe he has Jxxx trump|pg||
nt|athene: good evening everyone|pg||

nt|barnets: so 3@C made in closed|pg||

nt|warrens:  does anyone know that structure?|pg||

nt|ritong: 110 confirmed, operator?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Bakhshi'|pg||
nt|gambit: nice time for as 1@H psyche, if there is such a time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 110 is confirmed|pg||
nt|ritong: ty|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|athene: 5333 not the best shape for a weak-2, usually, but here there is a combination of good suit and right vulnerability|pg||
nt|woozle: Bakhshi's loose weak two in hearts will reduce the science that Stansby-Martel can bring to this hand|pg||
nt|woozle: Martel might get optimistic in clubs here, expecting a singleton opposite|pg||
nt|ritong: there is also a 16 boards final segment where thay all want to take advantage|pg||
nt|dburn: true - 5-3-3-3 hands tend to have too many losers|pg||
nt|woozle: He's not opening 2H intending to play it|pg||
nt|ritong: psychological advantage i meant|pg||
nt|athene: another problem with pre-empting on essentially a balanced hand is that if you push opps into a thin game contract they will make it on good breaks|pg||
nt|athene: that's more of a worry than going for a number, i think|pg||
nt|woozle: Agreed|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w in 4@S in closed|pg||
nt|gambit: 4@H from E |pg||
nt|woozle: probably 4C,4D,4S|pg||
mb|d!|an|Cards, not a stiff heart|nt|ritong: doubling 3@h a possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: which will make|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: can he handle 5@D from his partner?|pg||
nt|gambit: whoops|pg||
nt|athene: well, we are going to see how he does just that|pg||
nt|woozle: I think Martel would do better to get an opinion specifically on clubs...this diamondless double is working poorly|pg||
nt|woozle: still, 5D might make, which is more than can be said for 5S|pg||
nt|gambit: will N double, I say Yes|pg||
nt|athene: do EW play leaping michaels? i.e. is west limited by failure to bid 4@D over 2@H?|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone, presumably with a double dummy solver that I can't afford, tells me that a spade lead is needed to beat 5D|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, dummy gets overruffed|pg||
nt|ritong: or he has seen that an overruff of the third @s would work|pg||
nt|woozle: Some people talking about 3NT, but I think that Martel's slam potential (in clubs specifically) is too good to worry about 3NT|pg||
nt|woozle: but he'd like to bid it now|pg||
nt|athene: you could bid 3nt and hope that partner pulls it on a reasonable proportion of hands where slam is good|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe that is asking too much of partner|pg||
nt|chorush: are Ish and Chip on the same side of the screen?|pg||
nt|woozle: yes, pull it when he has clubs but not when he has diamonds...well bid, partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east was maybe thinking a possible slam in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: well if he pulls it to 4@D you can try 4@S|pg||
nt|woozle: I don't think that double is the bid for finding that club slam|pg||
nt|athene: and if he pulls it to clubs, you can get excited|pg||
nt|barnets: or he could have just bid 4@S over 3@H|pg||
nt|gambit: if Martel's red suits were reversed his bid would be textbook, now skating on thin ice, let's hope he is Gretsky, not Avery |pg||
nt|woozle: who are they?|pg||
nt|gambit: Hockey players|pg||
nt|ritong: a pair from cartoonland|pg||
nt|athene: martel *might* leave this, playing his partner for 5-6?|pg||
nt|ritong: extremely uncomfortable decision here|pg||
nt|athene: he might feel that west has to have really really good diamonds to make such an awkward bid|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|passell: dont like 5dia|pg||
nt|athene: you and martel both :)|pg||
nt|ritong: now he has three jewels and pard is really active|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room south passed and this made it easier for e/w|pg||
nt|athene: i still think that for 6@S/@D to be good, west would be Leaping Michaelsing - if that is a legitimate verb|pg||
nt|passell: 5dia is cold  not 5spades|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone asks if East should be thinking about a slam with 12 points and no known fit when partner couldn't double first. I say YES - (a) an overcall doesn't deny a very good hand, ...|pg||
nt|woozle: (b) there's a huge chance of a club fit once you know that your partner is short in hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: they were able to bid both suits out at lower level|pg||
nt|ritong: c)12 points do not define that hand|pg||
nt|gambit: Martel know 5D will not be doubled by the weak 2 bid opener, he also knows that 5S may well be a better contract and more likely to be doubled, so, a very onerous decison|pg||
nt|woozle: It's all very well to criticise EW here, but the impending swing was really created by Bakshi's 2H (versus Weinstein's pass)|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps west could have bid 4@H over the x |pg||
nt|woozle: Bidding 4H still doesn't lead to any auctions where he can pass 5C|pg||
nt|barnets: as 4@D is likely not forcing|pg||
nt|woozle: He could perhaps show a very good hand which is going down at the five level|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H might be choice of games (so spades and a minor, not willing to go past 4@S) - that is why 5@D might be taken as a very strong statement for diamonds i.e. 6 diamonds 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: well 4@S is still the best contract|pg||
nt|woozle: Martel is waiting for the match to be rained out|pg||
nt|gambit: Clint Hurdle...."the human rain delay'...LOL|pg||
nt|passell: that ages you|pg||
nt|woozle: East can't really bid 4S without knowing that the second suit is diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H by west would leave spades a spossible contract and show a very good hand for diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S may be the best possible contract, but it is no longer the best contract possible, as SJ Simon would point out|pg||
nt|barnets: over clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: the match will no longer be tied|pg||
nt|dburn: it will if Martel doesn't bid anything at all|pg||
nt|gambit: I hear from Specs that it was Hargrove, not Hurdle, maybe both, not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: if he bids it will be 5@h imo|pg||
nt|athene: i think martel can give up on slam and just focus on "5@D or 5@S?" decision|pg||
nt|barnets: the players have had a very long week and are in the final quarter where every bid or play can win or lose the tournament|pg||
nt|woozle: It doesn't matter much what Martel does unless he passes 5D and they make it...6SX-2 (-500, 15 imps) isn't very different to 5S-1 (-100, 12 imps)|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, just looked it up and it was Hargrove and Trachsel|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: north is hoping a force on the known 2-suiter might cause declarer to lose trump control and go a lot down? that's a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|athene: i guess there are ways this can be -2 without that happening|pg||
nt|woozle: There's nothing else to try|pg||

pc|hA|nt|dinos1: 3@s only|pg||

pc|h5|nt|warrens:  declarer will have to decided if S started with QJx or Qx to prevent -500|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: or, perhaps Kamil bid 3@h and Fleisher bid four, but that isn't all that likely either|pg||
nt|warrens:  if so, maybe N is thinking of doubling|pg||
nt|kit: just loses 2 spades and a diamond -- hand plays okay out of control|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: this all seems a bit unlikely|pg||
nt|dburn: my guess is that Kamil bid three of something, then Bakhshi bid 3@s and del Monte gave him four|pg||
nt|passell: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  best defense is K and a @D, then cash the @H K, then another @D|pg||

nt|imp_jan: 3@S by west wld not be my choice|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, not so likely now (more likely if N had balanced with 3@D)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: sorry for the confusion, trying to help other table|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably that is what happened indeed, warren|pg||
nt|passell: here the undos are vugraph operator errors or misclicks  not the players   players have no undos unfortunately|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|barnets: looks like a flat game|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Sound result for Weinstein-Levin, bidding the close game for +600|pg||

mb|2C!|an|Inverted|nt|barnets: with clubs lying well|pg||
nt|athene: you can't just bid 1nt on that south hand can you?|pg||
nt|barnets: for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and hearts splitting|pg||
nt|ritong: u_ndo pls|pg||
nt|athene: and if south does anything invitational, north will go|pg||
nt|chorush: that would be ish bidding 2 spades|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S is denying a heart stopper?|pg||
nt|woozle: people who play 2NT and 2C as game-forcing might consider 1NT...I wouldn't even if it showed 10-12|pg||
nt|barnets: kind of lucky game|pg||
nt|woozle: bold 2S bid from Stansby?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, stansby has a stopper  anyway it is north' bid|pg||
nt|woozle: If Ish showed his spade stopper, I assume 2D would have been something else|pg||
mb|2S|nt|barnets: 2@S from north|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: these stopper-showing auctions are not a good idea in my opinion - they just help the defence more|pg||
nt|barnets: non forcing|pg||
nt|athene: it's ok to show a shortage to avoid really silly 3NTs when 5minor is there|pg||
nt|woozle: Bakhshi might have missed his chance to show a heart stopper, if Ish was neutral about diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: will north pass ?|pg||
nt|athene: but if you have two balanced hands, it isn't worth it|pg||
nt|woozle: North will probably pass if he can|pg||
nt|woozle: Hardly a lovely 13|pg||
nt|athene: north is much more likely to pass now - combination of heart worry AND borderline strength anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: how many clubs did 1@c show?|pg||
nt|woozle: people are suggesting that 3NT is awful, but the heart lead might not be automatic|pg||
nt|dburn: if two, then he has a pretty good hand for clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Unknown, showed 11+ HCP not GF|pg||
nt|dburn: since South ought to have six|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: even if it only showed two, three isn't a long way above average|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|barnets: well it needs fav clubs hearts well place and the @D finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: not exactly favorite|pg||
nt|dburn: no, but queen third is quite a lot better than two low|pg||
nt|woozle: If opponents are leading a suit other than hearts, it will probably need one less thing right|pg||
nt|passell: still need 9 tricks to make 3nt|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know|pg||
nt|athene: if you hope to make 3n based on a long club suit, with the defence knocking out a heart stop at trick 1, then aces on the side are what you want, rather than kings and queens  ...|pg||
nt|athene: which you won't have time to use|pg||
nt|barnets: I think n/s can consider themselves a trifle unfrortunate here|pg||
nt|athene: so on that basis his hand is better than average|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|woozle: Ish probably expected to be opposite no heart stopper|pg||
nt|woozle: If everything is foul, 3C might fail also, which changes the odds required on 3NT|pg||

nt|chorush: A bit of blame, if there is any, goes to the undefined nature of 1C. After a natural 1 diamond opening, South would make an invitational 2NT bid and likely be raised|pg||
nt|ritong: i admit 1@c is mysterious to me too|pg||
nt|gambit: 3c is a far superior contract than 3NT, but that is a steal for Fleisher in the Closed room |pg||
nt|dburn: 1@d shows an unbalanced hand in the methods North-South play|pg||
nt|ritong: ah ok|pg||
nt|ritong: ty david|pg||
nt|chorush: right, I'm just saying that system is partly to blame here|pg||
nt|dburn: well "superior" is not altogether clear - 3@c will make more often than 3NT will, but it scores less|pg||
nt|athene: another idea behind 1@C on any balanced hand is that you expect to reach notrumps a lot of the time and it's more use to conceal which minor you have|pg||
nt|woozle: It also cleans up your auctions in the other minor|pg||
nt|passell: there will be no games missed at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I'm inclined to agree with Barnet - 3NT probably has a lower expectation than 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: if partner really cares about 6minor he can relay and find out|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|athene: if you just go 1@C 1major 1nt 3nt, the defence know less|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|passell: yes but it is a risk reward situation|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c7|nt|barnets: so dec was leading up to the @C Q and if it had lost would have finnesed the 10 on the way back|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|barnets: taking 2finesses|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: but all was well|pg||
nt|gambit: Mike notes "there will be no games missed at ther other table", and he is right, precious few missed here, on a heart lead no chance |pg||
nt|dburn: that's the right play for three club tricks - for four, you should play ace and another|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: he may anxiously ask how the hearts were split at the end of the hand|pg||

nt|warrens:  this is an interesting hand.  you need to get to 4@S to make game|pg||
nt|dburn: but four spades would have made|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  3NT NS|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: Sout hand evaluates at invitational 2NT -- maybe more|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chorush: Yes but 4 spades is a better contract and duly will make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  I am sure they play 2NT as forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|imp_jan: funny pos, due to the fact that spades break badly u shld avoid 5@C but be in 4@S..|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly a case for East just to bid it, once he finds out West doesn't want to play 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  they play 1 Major 2NT as forcing and natural|pg||
nt|fcarioca: Probably 1 down|pg||
nt|drewsky: How one down ....i see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: why down?|pg||
nt|passell: good lie of the cards  4-4 hearts clubs good dia finesse|pg||

nt|algraves:  4 @C, 2@S 1@H and 2@D|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|chorush: if Bakhshi tries 3 spades now he will get to 4. If 4 clubs, probably 5C|pg||

nt|dburn: this is a pretty good grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: 7nt needs one red suit to come in?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chorush: possible swing here. The hands mesh exceedingly well|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: no, you just have to count your tricks|pg||
nt|athene: OR various other thins|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry|pg||
nt|athene: 13 on top :)|pg||
nt|woozle: The auction at the other table resembled our other favourite sport - blindfolded darts|pg||
nt|ritong: always difficult to bid grand with exactly 13 on top|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gambit: Don't forget Barry's rules|pg||
nt|woozle: 3S from north (unfashionable in these 2/1 days) might make it very easy|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: this hand resembles a lot of Bridge World challenge the champs hands in that the singleton queen in partner's long suit is worth about 10 hcp|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm more apt to remember barry's rules in the style of event that barry sometimes won|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Ish's 3H looks misplaced with 100 honours in spades|pg||
nt|athene: if he had rebid spades again, south might value the @SQ a bit more|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: well his @h Q might be as important as his pard's @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: some specs asked abput the club suit on the last hand both @CA and a club and two finessses have exactly 50 percent chance to make 4 club tricks|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|gambit: we will see 4NT followed by 5NT (a grand slam try) and then...|pg||
nt|athene: @SQ surely getting lost now|pg||
nt|dburn: actually, @cA and a club has exactly a 58.7826% chance to make four club tricks|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south will work out he has so many extras he can just bid 7 in a bit|pg||
nt|warrens:  is this key card in @H?|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt feels like keycard for hearts, yes, so it might be hard to unearth the @SQ|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|ritong: insolent double:)|pg||
nt|woozle: Stansby's double might work poorly if south's second suit was clubs and could return it to the sender|pg||
nt|woozle: If North confirms all of the keys, South might be able to bid a grand|pg||
nt|ritong: don tthink he has any choice|pg||
nt|athene: south did bid 2nt rather than 3@C so west doesn't expect him to have great clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: south' hand is not limited|pg||
nt|ritong: now, there is a small ambiguity about the suit being trumps|pg||
nt|woozle: 5NT then 6S might make seven possible|pg||
nt|po-s: If 4c was a cue it seems strange that Ish would ask for keycards  with the North hand|pg||
nt|gambit: Stansby was telling himself what to lead, as in all kikelihood (though far from guaranteed) S will declare|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: West led a @C at the other table without having to make a lead-directing double.|pg||
nt|gambit: I think 4NT was premature from N |pg||
nt|woozle: bah...someone needs to step up with "I've got tricks...how are we for aces?"|pg||
nt|athene: @SQ is the key to the hand, gotta find that and the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like he should ask for the trump Q anyway next|pg||
nt|barnets: and will find out about the @HK as well with the reply|pg||
nt|woozle: someone suggested that if north passes, south might redouble....but the problem remains that they may not make it|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: no, he won't - South doesn't have the trump queen|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|woozle: lots of people are telling me about board 24 in the closed room...be patient, folks, be patient...there will be time to snicker nater|pg||
nt|dburn: hearts are trumps, not spades|pg||
nt|woozle: er later|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|barnets: right cause its hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe should play double keycard with 2 queens|pg||
nt|woozle: someone tells me that 5C can make, but I assume that's on some other board|pg||
nt|gambit: NT , not hearts, or spades|pg||
nt|barnets: that would work here|pg||
nt|dburn: but Bakshi may now be able to do something about the spade queen|pg||
nt|woozle: maybe Ish is asking for third round control in spades...but the queen isn't the same as a doubleton|pg||
nt|po-s: Ish paints a picture....Do you have the treump queen partne? - No,  Then interpret my 5spades|pg||
nt|woozle: must be a seven-try...I think that Bakhshi can just bid 7NT|pg||
nt|gambit: the q@S is such a huge card, S has so much, how can he not do the grand?|pg||
nt|barnets: I think the auction is very unclear|pg||
nt|woozle: however much we can mock this auction, it's a much better attempt than Weinstein-Levin|pg||
nt|gambit: no club lead if he plays in NT |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Ish is pretty calm, Bakhshi is fidgeting like crazy|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@S may be an attempt to play spades|pg||
nt|barnets: at some level|pg||
nt|po-s: I think Ish says unfortunately I don´t have the trump queen but a very good spade suit, prepared to play slam without that heart queen|pg||
nt|gambit: I love those updates from the VyG operator....|pg||
nt|woozle: even so, why revert when he couldn't bid them over 2NT?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes po i agree sounds right|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: wow|pg||
nt|gambit: I love it|pg||
nt|woozle: Bakhshi gets the message about the spade queen - a huge board for ish|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, I guess Bakhshi knew what it all meant|pg||
nt|dburn: if South had the heart jack rather than the spade queen, 3@h would be a rather better bid than 3@s|pg||
nt|woozle: At some point, bakhshi had to ask himself "partner is slamming, and I have...how much?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I wish I could tell Lew that it doesn't matter what he leads|pg||
nt|barnets: 17 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: you certainly will not:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gambit: Les was ALWAYS a winner, maybe (too soon to call)  and there are many hands left|pg||
nt|woozle: easy to tell if Bakhshi misplays this...if he plays a card before claiming, he misplayed it|pg||
mc|13|nt|Vugraphzfc: He just showed his hand and claimed|pg||
nt|barnets: Grue by 16|pg||
nt|athene: bakhshi must be feeling pretty good - 2@H opener, and now 7NT|pg||
nt|athene: he won't feel bad about missing the horrible 3nt|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chorush: This doesnt look right. How could 3NT even make, much less make 6?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: quite a surprising final (seed   7 v.   21)|pg||
nt|warrens:  K of @C lead.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  E had double showing reds or blacks and W assumed blacks|pg||
nt|gambit: please tell us I@H was conventional |pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  of course, some pairs might get to 4@S, but not Grue-Cheek :)|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, it is a 1 spade response|pg||
nt|warrens:  7nt, requiring no suits to break at all|pg||
mb|2N|nt|algraves:  yes you can handle every suit breakig lots to zero|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein ever supports spades, that will probably do the trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 3@D = spl |pg||
mb|3D!|an|Hx in !H|mb|p|nt|kit: but otherwise, they might not find out enough to bid the grand|pg||
nt|algraves:  the @S J is the key card in the bidding and Levin might end up having to make that judgement|pg||
mb|4N|nt|imp_jan: so it will end in spades |pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: After the double of 1H Kamil sees lead value in his hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  no comfortable leads from E's hand.|pg||
nt|chorush: no, very difficult hand to lead from|pg||
nt|warrens:  do we know what 3@D showed?|pg||
nt|kit: this seems invitational -- and now I doubt if they can reach the grand|pg||
mb|6N|nt|warrens:  if spades are 3-2, he can easily afford to go up with the Ace, but he has to think about 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  of course, if he ducks, the defense might take the first 4 tricks |pg||
nt|dinos1: 7 by S now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: so Bakhshi has at most DQ, SJ, HKJ?|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes Warren it would be very interesting to know what 3@D means. Whatever it means I',\m going to play it|pg||
nt|warrens:  we're now told it showed Hx in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: 3@D slow @H support|pg||
nt|kit: problem is that Weinstein only invited a small slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Hx or xxx|pg||
nt|algraves:  ah that is an excellent agreement. Its going on my card for sure|pg||
nt|algraves:  dinos is our all 4 hands analyst|pg||
nt|dinos1: could S show @sQ?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so would have bid 7|pg||
nt|algraves:  those who only see one hand pass|pg||
nt|drewsky: and for sure you will never have honor x in hearts and ALWAYS have 4 chuncky diamonds and NOT be able to showe them..on every hand for the rest of your life :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves:  I knew I would create controversy|pg||
mc|13|nt|kit: I think Weinstein had to be willing to commit to slam in order to reach the grand.  The question is whether or not he should have made that commitment|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks Drew, glad you said that.  every system has tradeoffs, though Steve and Bobby have lots of great agreements|pg||
nt|algraves:  well it is really hard when you dont have an 8 card fit to find out about a key Jack|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Stansby, like Cheek in the other room, misreads the vulnerability and opens one spade in third seat|pg||
nt|ritong: unless del monte takes aa semi wild shot|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need much more than a good 15 to raise here but you do need a bit more i think|pg||
nt|woozle: Ish won't shoot at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|ritong: well he has good fillers|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: delmonte can taste that thin +400 :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|woozle: perhaps not...3NT would liven up an otherwise dul board|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: maybe he can feel he has momentum and wants to try to really put EW away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: EW aren't getting put away quietly though|pg||
nt|woozle: Martel figures that he needs some imps and the opponents are stretching, but his double is not a thing of beauty|pg||

nt|ritong: let s see who stays standing|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: gave nothing|pg||
nt|athene: delmonte certainly didn't want his partner to have the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: he wanted it to be in west's hand|pg||
nt|mslair: high heart, club to the 8  |pg||
nt|po-s: Hmm, Heart ace and a small club?|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w have been defending well this match|pg||
nt|gambit: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: and saved some boards|pg||
nt|gambit: Well, that is the virtue of being World class players, defending like Klingons from the Romulons|pg||
nt|barnets: lloks like down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|barnets: can def get 2 clubs 2 spades and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: ?|pg||
nt|woozle: club to the eight looks reasonable from here - maybe you can place Martel with some key pips for his double. Of course, my analysis would differ if the club nine was with west|pg||
nt|barnets: yes of course |pg||
nt|dburn: declarer can get two clubs, four hearts and two aces first, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...declarer's main chance is to find West with @cQ9|pg||
nt|dburn: so he may play in such a way that the defenders get their tricks first|pg||
nt|woozle: club to the jack and ace, then endplay east in clubs later?|pg||
nt|barnets: @CQ 9 thir|pg||
nt|barnets: third|pg||
nt|barnets: or doubleton|pg||
nt|barnets: would make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - I don't think he'll lead a club from the dummy, unless he's just giving up on the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: so he has to try that|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that could be the right thing for him to do, of course|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|woozle: if he leads the club jack, West has to cover|pg||
nt|ritong: suspense|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|po-s: well...|pg||
nt|woozle: wow. that play is much easier from here|pg||
nt|mslair: sigh|pg||
nt|ritong: eight in the bag  now let s discuss|pg||
nt|woozle: defense has to be pinpoint to get five tricks without giving him nine|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder if the double was a warning to avoid spade lead|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: now west knows where all the high cards are|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|woozle: defense being timed well here...endplays will only make eight tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: so does South, of course, but it won't do him any good|pg||
nt|ritong: he better deal one light|pg||
nt|barnets: how about|pg||
nt|barnets: win ace|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond ace, four hearts pitching club jack, spade ace, diamond looks coolest, but still loses a long club (or if you keep the CJ, west gets spade tricks)|pg||
nt|barnets: cash 4 heart pitching club jack|pg||
nt|barnets: the sa ace a|pg||
nt|barnets: and dimond to endplay east|pg||
nt|woozle: defense will get at least one trick in the endgame...these endplays don't work|pg||
nt|athene: you would need to endplay east AND set up your fourth diamond, but you just can't do that|pg||
nt|athene: well, you can, but you don't get to the winning diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: only comes to 8|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of chatter from spectators, but the endplays don't quite work|pg||
nt|barnets: but it looks good though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: if south keeps the club jack, he gets endplayed with it...if he doesn't keep it, east gets a long club|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|woozle: like I said, lots of chatter, but if you pitch the club jack then east gets a long club|pg||
nt|barnets: dec gets 1 spade 4 hearts one diamond and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk that only comes to 8|pg||
nt|woozle: if you keep it, east leads a low club to you and west gets a spade|pg||
nt|athene: i am being given lots of lines that net declarer 9 tricks - they do, but only by giving the defence 5 first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: All these possibilities must be running through Bakhshi's mind, too|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room they are on board 29|pg||
nt|woozle: Bakhshi can definitely make it, on some other layout|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ritong: he will try to make when west has 6@s|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|gambit: tough call for N|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C not an underbid in the other room facing passed hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn: if this is keycard for spades, South will need to treat that void as an ace|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|gambit: 6@C?|pg||
nt|warrens:  does S show his void?  0 with a void?|pg||
nt|woozle: people saying it's hard to make 7C on a heart lead - not really. ruff, club ace, diamond ace, diamond king, diamond ruff, club king, claim|pg||
nt|athene: you might finesse diamonds in 7@C after 3@H - but maybe not; you know west has almost as many hearts as east|pg||
nt|po-s: off two aces - difficult|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry you are short of trump entries to south anyway|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that only needs @d 3-3 AND @C 2-1:)|pg||
nt|po-s: aces=keycards|pg||
nt|athene: @C32 just not as big as you would like|pg||
nt|woozle: someone asked about 6S. That contract would suggest that North never looked at his club suit.|pg||
nt|gambit: 5@s by N, followed by 6@C from S|pg||
nt|athene: so the diamond finesse would not help as you can not pick up @DQxxx with west anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: if this really is Blackwood, South has denied any key cards for spades|pg||
nt|chorush: Could think about 6 clubs. If pard has no spade king or heart ace he might easily have the material to make 6 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he might|pg||
nt|ritong: good point ira|pg||
nt|dburn: he ought to have something - he did bid 3@s, after all|pg||
nt|chorush: club K and diamond KQ are only other real high card values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: This time it's Ish who's sweating.|pg||
nt|gambit: for sure, he should be|pg||
nt|barnets: he will make the last bid in the auction now|pg||
nt|athene: south's @CKxx more important than his @SJxxxx - maybe X (as in the other room) expressed the hand better than 3@S|pg||
nt|chorush: also unlikely for a passed hand who now bid 3 spades on a jack high suit not to have cllub tolerance|pg||
nt|woozle: fair call, although 3HX doesn't appeal|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls any calculator available for 7@C chance:)?  @C must be 2-1 and @D 3-3 or !Q sec or !Qx|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: that is thr trouble, when pard takes so long, even with his working void, can S move forward? I don't pretend to know but I see a storm cloud ahead |pg||

nt|woozle: Ish settles for 5S, and the lead changes...until the next board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gambit: Delmonte hand-cuffed his partner|pg||
nt|gambit: not well bid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the opponents handcuffed both of them - what was North supposed to do , after all?|pg||
nt|chorush: I doubt that Bakhshi was bidding a slam over an in temp 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: it is possible south may have bid a slam if  5@S was made intempo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha added @SK sec and @SKx onside:)|pg||
nt|athene: if south was going to do anything cute, he shld have bid something other than 5@D|pg||

nt|dburn: it won't create a great one here either|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|dburn: but he is already onto a bad result, due to the difference in opening styles|pg||
nt|dburn: Fleisher steadfastly refusing to open at the one level without enough points|pg||
nt|kit: another not so easy slam to bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  easier after the neg X|pg||
nt|algraves:  Bakhshi opened 2@H on 5 bagger seat 1 favourable and created enough confusion to get them to 5 doubled to boot|pg||
nt|kit: I would be scared to make neg double on South hand unless partner virtually never passes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|woozle: The only reason to pause with the EW hands here is if a stop card was used|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 8-11|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  1100 save|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c2|nt|chorush: David, their weak 2 takes in some hands that others would open 1, which gives more definition when they open 1 of a major and rebid 2|pg||
nt|woozle: and there are a lot of juicy penalties when the opponents step in|pg||
nt|algraves:  1100 down with best defense in 6 @H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|algraves:  but 7@C makes by ruffing out diamonds first of course|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|dburn: sure it does - was merely trying to strike a blow for the old fogeys in pointing out the dangers of opening the bidding without at least 12 hcp|pg||
nt|woozle: defense doing well here - after club ace, club to king (ruffed), trump exit, declarer can be held to seven tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: but I confess, I'd have opened that 1@s even playing a style where 2@s was 8-11|pg||
nt|woozle: This hand is nice, but not nice enough to upgrade two points|pg||
nt|chorush: Just talking with Bigtrain about that. We both agree with you|pg||
nt|dburn: and I'd have reached 3@s just as Cheek and Grue did, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|chorush: Id bet you reach 4 spades|pg||
nt|dburn: no, no - you need 25 points for game|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the hand evaluates with KNR as 15.15|pg||
nt|chorush: Kamil raised to 4 with a very similar hand in the 1st half|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, even the two level is in some danger|pg||
nt|woozle: looks clear here to lead his trump - Fleisher probably has the stiff diamond because Bakhshi didn't shift to his|pg||
nt|chorush: not some danger. Just down if the defense takes its tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe no one should have opened the bidding at all - nobody had any high cards|pg||
nt|chorush: passouts are an endangered species:)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: amazing, but these voids can be so trappy|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: wasn't it schapiro who said his teammates bid a slam but found the ace of trumps offside?|pg||
nt|athene: sounds the sort of thing he used to say|pg||
nt|barnets: how about exclusion key card |pg||
nt|gambit: maybe N should bid in tempo and allow his partner to bid as he sees fit. The year-long hesitation means N is flying solo, I grant a very tough hand but make a decision in tempo ...|pg||
nt|gambit: whcih allows partner to weigh in w/o all the baggage that hesitations entail. |pg||
nt|barnets: can we do this here ?|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades? not easy to organise|pg||
mb|4D|an|key card|mb|p|nt|barnets: thats key card|pg||
nt|dburn: though maybe 5@s ought to be that - but North seems to have got keycard in first|pg||
nt|dburn: which is as well for his side|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 with the Q|pg||
nt|gambit: hopefully they can avoid the mistake of the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|barnets: hes checking if he can show 2 + Q + void|pg||
nt|athene: south wondering whether to show his void|pg||
nt|athene: of course if partner takes a long time to answer keycard you know he has a void in your suit|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades? most unlikely to do that|pg||
nt|warrens:  I wouldn't consider it in partner's suit|pg||
nt|athene: if it just takes him this long to count up to three, maybe bridge is not the game for him|pg||
mb|5N|nt|barnets: well thats what he must be thnking about|pg||
nt|athene: (or two, or whatever)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and he did|pg||
nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
nt|chorush: that is an uncalled-for comment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: did a lot of writing on the explanation pad|pg||
nt|po-s: Perhaps 4D wasn´t keycard|pg||
nt|ritong: i also suggest that we do not jeer too much if you do not mind gentlemen|pg||
nt|chorush: I am guessing 5NT is an even number of keycards with a void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: It was, I was able to read that note|pg||
nt|dburn: then 5NT is hard to explain - I think Barnet's right; South is showing his spade void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Ish just wrote KC|pg||
nt|gambit: deja vu, all over again? (Ty Yogi) |pg||
nt|athene: standard is that 5nt is even number of keys and a (useful) void, isn't it?|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't know - plenty of variants around|pg||
nt|athene: with odd number of voids you cue the void if below trump suit else bid 6 of trump suit?|pg||
nt|barnets: so many hands when nobody is sure what exactly is going on|pg||
nt|athene: but that is when it is 4NT|pg||
nt|dburn: with an odd number of voids, you need a 13-card suit|pg||
nt|passell: weird to show void in partners suit and take up so much room|pg||
nt|barnets: including north south,|pg||
nt|po-s: that might be over a 4NT ask, but seems a waste of space otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: so you have to think ok, are you counting steps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Does one usually show a void in partner's suit?|pg||
nt|mslair: no|pg||
nt|dburn: if one can do so without ambiguity, I guess one might|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you can show the void in partner's suit explicitly you might but otherwise not|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|dburn: but cases of the kind must be very rare|pg||
nt|athene: i mean if there is any doubt partner must assume it isn't|pg||
nt|barnets: if nort bids 6@C that will be try|pg||
nt|dburn: I don't like the look of this|pg||
nt|passell: will he dbl 7dia?|pg||
nt|po-s: if 5NT asked for trump honours....|pg||
nt|barnets: that would not be sporting would it ?|pg||
nt|gambit: if they bid 7, Yes, they will dbl|pg||
mb|7D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but Stansby might not show the same magnanimity as Cheek|pg||
nt|passell: they didnt in the other room|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|dA|nt|gambit: terribler, can't count key cards?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|passell: all caused by showing a void in partners suit|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: west in the other room thought that passing 7@D was the best way to ensure a good profit|pg||
nt|po-s: I will  train juniors next weekend, should I include this deal for bidding?|pg||
nt|chorush: If Bridge World brings back its You Be the Judge feature, this hand will be first in line|pg||

mb|1S|nt|imp_jan: dbl = cards or ?|pg||

nt|dburn: major - minor, I think|pg||
nt|woozle: or 4M, longer m?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  no of course not|pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: Bakhshi presumably using Stayman to construct an invitational sequence which can stop in 2S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|harmon: anudder slam|pg||
nt|kit: this oneshould be very easy to bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  a lot of potential swing hands, though this one looks pretty tame|pg||
nt|algraves:  Harmon sailed through our Candian spelling bee national contest|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: in the old days, when someone opened 1NT they had a lot of points, and when someone doubled it they had more points|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 2n: looking for the m|pg||
nt|dburn: this is the same kind of thing: 1NT shows a major and a minor, and so does double|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
nt|chorush: lol. Good one|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: shoor did|pg||
nt|algraves:  in the phonetics division|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Canada has a Brookly phonetics spelling division?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *Brooklyn|pg||
nt|algraves:  so 6NT is safest slam but very hard to bid|pg||
nt|algraves:  well I think 4@C unambiguous salm move in @D|pg||
nt|algraves:  3@S sort of muddies the waters around choice of games involving 4 @S|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|imp_jan: these guys like to compete (ew)|pg||
nt|woozle: Ish thinking? Surely he did enough opening 1NT|pg||

nt|dburn: he may be worried that he did not do justice to his heart suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Thinking certainly can be an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and he has a couple of spade honours, should his partner not have heart support|pg||
nt|algraves:  always best to send clearest message you can if possible|pg||
mb|5D|nt|woozle: if only he had a hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfh: Break for NS|pg||
nt|algraves:  well wasnt it Edgar kaplan who had so many misgivings around all the Blackwood advancements|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein was king asking looking for 6NT maybe,and Levin though they had all the keycards|pg||
nt|algraves:  Just maybe Edgar was on to something|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Room empty|pg||
nt|poohbear: they didnt read your article , kit|pg||
nt|kit: although if 4@H was RKC, the 5@D call showed 2 with the queen, so that doesn't make sense either|pg||
nt|algraves:  for those who wonder why Cheek did not double, how , hyothetically would you feel if North ran to 7NT and your partner started thinking on opening lead|pg||

nt|ritong: now can north deduce from the overtake in @ds west had Kx initially?|pg||
nt|kit: I thnk so|pg||
nt|chorush: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: and from esat's reluctance to establish his suit his has no quck entry?|pg||
nt|dburn: I should think so - he might have raised with king third, for one thing|pg||
nt|dburn: and he might have encouraged rather than overtake, unless the queen demanded that he unblock|pg||
nt|po-s: might well turn into an imp for Grue|pg||
nt|chorush: I think it will PO|pg||
nt|kit: overtake makes no sense with Kxx -- for all he knows, partner has QJ10xx|pg||
nt|dburn: and the queen lead is not all that likely from AQ10xx, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  so west had @dKx for sure, even if west does not continue the suit|pg||
nt|ritong: east*|pg||
nt|chorush: If Martel clears diamond, Ish will take his 8 tricks and find out that they have turned into 10|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, the @hQx magic wand|pg||
nt|chorush: If not, Ish likely to lead spade to K and then take his 8 tricks, again finding out that he has 10|pg||
nt|athene: martel wld be far more likely to clear the diamonds if he held the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks this long about it it makes it less likely he has the ace|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that he takes that long is a strong indication|pg||
nt|ritong: he has no entry|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - by the same token, though, the queen lead makes rather less sense from a man with no entry than a man with one|pg||
nt|ritong: no direct entry, that is|pg||
nt|harmon: GOOD point David|pg||

nt|kit: Even with this start, declarer is far from home|pg||

nt|barnets: not too far from home kit|pg||
nt|passell: I agree drewski|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, that club play hasn't actually given declarer a trick, just made the defence more awkward|pg||
nt|kit: but he will get diamonds right due to the entry considerations|pg||
nt|passell: he may guess diamond and dbl hook hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the defence may play another club thinking the finesse is there for declarer anyway|pg||

nt|woozle: might be slow to knock out the spade ace and grant you a club trick, or East might be endplayed|pg||
nt|algraves:  other room is way behind|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Consider spade lead - ace, spade ruff, run some hearts, club jack to east|pg||
nt|woozle: lots of options, only some of them needing grievous misdefense|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I think that the fortunate location of the diamond jack makes this one a make, provided he ruffs a spade to his hand|pg||
nt|woozle: To play to make, either play East for doubleton diamond ace (unlikely if he has his count) or ruff a spade and play for spades 6-2, or play West for a doubleton diamond nine|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|dinos1: 3@d - constructive raise?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|poohbear: 3@d is a hand willing to play 3NT opp 18-19 bal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: 6-2 spades very likely if West thought for a while over 4H.|pg||
nt|dburn: this is the pressure line - but if East ducks, it may not work|pg||
nt|passell: dbl ace is not enough|pg||
nt|woozle: doubleton ace is fine - win king, draw trumps,low diamond out|pg||
nt|passell: yes  I meant unlikeliest after hesitation|pg||
nt|poohbear: mixed raise|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT could go down on club lead and diamond misguess|pg||
nt|algraves:  seems natural to guess @D and make 5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|algraves:  3NT on the @D guess as well it seems|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|chorush: East did well not to drop the spade king which would have given the show away but had to make a hard duck of the diamond|pg||
nt|woozle: bakhshi takes the bait - and fleisher demonstrates another way that 4H might be made|pg||
nt|gambit: claiming quickly |pg||
pc|dT|nt|woozle: There's never a better assumption than human error...that's a principle that works for everything in life|pg||

nt|algraves:  but better than @D guess as declarer can get two @s in NT if needed and the opps may not be able to untangle their tricks to get to 5|pg||

nt|barnets: e/w cn make 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: declarer doesn't need to ruff the second diamond - can just throw a heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: but even if he ruffs, he is ok, with the trumps 3-3|pg||
nt|kit: after North's likely 3@D preempt, not easy to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: not impossible for the auction to be the same here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: certainly no one made a stupid bid at the other table|pg||
nt|ritong: tough problem for martel coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|dburn: and this may work out the same for practical purposes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: playing his partner for four tricks|pg||
nt|chorush: LC would approve. Where is he?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dburn: or not - crikey|pg||

nt|drewsky: a brave pass indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  lol|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: LOL|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- didn't happen|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: so will be down at least 1 -- maybe more|pg||
nt|drewsky: only at pairs is pass a consideration|pg||
nt|ritong: operator playing with our nerves|pg||
nt|kit: why is pass not a consideration here?  Plus is still better than minus|pg||
nt|athene: one drawback of passing is, even if it is right on the hand, it might dissuade partner from doubling in future and cost more than it gained|pg||
nt|passell: qxxx of clubs makes it scary|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, but you have long clubs as well as long hearts and no tricks - they could easily make four diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: partner has 1 more heart 1 less diam  for instance|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: well, West does have what might be considered a model takeout double of 4@D, and passing does turn out 8 IMPs better than bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|algraves:  what is best defense double dummy from this point|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree with Mike.  Partner doesn't always have a 20 count with all Aces.  and you might have a double fit in @h's and @C's|pg||
nt|kit: I'm not saying passing is right -- but I'm far from convinced that it isn't.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but reverse partner's major holdings, and 4@h is icy while 4@d isn't going down too much|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: these are hands where computers pass all the time because they don't care about psychology - they just do the simulation|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer ducks a heart, North should play a diamond I would thnk|pg||
nt|drewsky: Personally, I am a total wimp, and would Never dream of passing my pard's takeout double with that hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|kit: And now it my go ruff, ace of hearts, spade to jack, heart -- down many!|pg||
nt|dburn: I would dream of it, but then I would wake up shivering|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: Good unblock by South|pg||
nt|chorush: Now if martel goes for the make he will be down many|pg||
nt|dinos1: will u play for @h3-3 after 4@d pre?|pg||
nt|chorush: well spades are 3-3|pg||
nt|barnets: north has either 3 spades or 3 hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: any inference from North's shift at trick 2?|pg||
nt|algraves:  declareer might think diamnods are 8-2 on the bidding|pg||
nt|passell: this could be the match now|pg||
nt|dburn: no, but restricted choice considerations after that @hQ|pg||
nt|passell: not with the low dia lead|pg||
nt|kit: he can play ace of spades and spade to jack, saving one undertrick in case of disaster -- but most don't think of that|pg||
nt|algraves:  so that the third trump is "safe"|pg||
nt|dinos1: wdnt shift having KQx or QJx|pg||
nt|algraves:  well yes maybe the strange lead|pg||
nt|dburn: that is: with HHx in hearts, he might have played some honour other than the queen|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: hard to imagine going down the rest|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|barnets: but two spades mighthelp the count|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: good play|pg||
nt|algraves:  true enpugh|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: he is doing just what I said it looks like|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|chorush: he's going for it|pg||
nt|barnets: moment of truth now|pg||
nt|passell: the cup may ride on this 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: could he have HHx and still just preempt?|pg||
nt|dburn: and would he shift to clubs?|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe north could have played the @S 10|pg||
nt|kit: sure -- partner is passed hand|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps Ish could have played the spade ten|pg||
nt|passell: 2 people giving upside down count|pg||
nt|drewsky: when partner is a passed hand, one can and should preempt with extras|pg||
nt|barnets: that would look more like 2|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel trying to assess how likely it is that the contract will be the same at the other table|pg||
nt|passell: he knows the dia count for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you should go for it|pg||
nt|athene: because|pg||
nt|athene: if they are in 4@S at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: more 50s don't really hurt so much|pg||
nt|kit: what makes it tough is that if spades 3-3 4@S makes, but if spades 4-2 4@S doesn't make|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well try to flatten it|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows @d 7/3|pg||
nt|drewsky: they do in this match|pg||
nt|dinos1: -5 or -1 is big diff|pg||
nt|ritong: so can imagine a lower preempt|pg||
nt|mslair: the bane of udca |pg||
nt|athene: yes, but not as much|pg||
nt|barnets: it does |pg||
nt|passell: but 5clubs down 1|pg||
nt|athene: if other room is 420 anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: the unknown element is south raising 4@d|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, guess 4@S can handle 4-2 split|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can pitch heart on second @D|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S always makes|pg||
nt|drewsky: like passell said, THIS is the match|pg||
nt|kit: very hard to settle for down 1 when might make|pg||
nt|athene: it feels to me that the longer you think, the more likely you are to go for it|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes it is human nature to try and make it|pg||
nt|algraves:  so full marks to Martel if he gets it right|pg||
nt|kit: risks 200 to gain 470|pg||
nt|mslair: I never ask opponents if they play udca  I just casually look at their card:)|pg||
nt|dburn: if you were going to go for it, you would play quicky and get it over with|pg||
nt|dinos1: @c shift is the only indication|pg||
nt|drewsky: when u go for it, you gain 370 points against losing 200 points when wrong|pg||
nt|kit: 470|pg||
nt|drewsky: yes 470 kit|pg||
nt|dburn: no - this really is a restricted choice position with respect to the heart honours|pg||
nt|barnets: both north and south played upside down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I didn't actually see Delmonte's 2nd @S card, for all we know he played 10|pg||
nt|drewsky: i would go for it for one very good reason|pg||

mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|dburn: Weinstein had a useful one, in that East could pass when he did use it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: Normal 3@D preempt for Levin, but maybe he will bid 4@D the way match is going|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|woozle: Now Ish has another decision over 2D|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: del Monte could presumably also let East out in 2@d if he wished|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@S the best game|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: now Grue has to make a big pass to go plus|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S would make, but hard to fault the E-W actions|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Bakhshi ends up in 2S, which could offer hours of analysis opportunities for commentators|pg||
nt|gambit: a trump will hit the table faster than a speeding bullet|pg||
nt|woozle: If only we were paid by the hour|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile North-South, who are cold for 3NT and 5@c, have not yet made much of a move towards either|pg||
nt|dburn: understandably, given their values, but...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|woozle: Kamil might have competed in clubs at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: might not get them to game, but can at least get them to clubs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves:  what about 4 @D by E|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@d over 4@d?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|gambit: cold? how does he get to the dummy? after four spade tricks (logical) and a diamond switch|pg||
nt|algraves:  partner could be oh I am sorry|pg||
nt|algraves:  I did not see the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|algraves:  it was blacked out in my market|pg||
nt|algraves:  this of course is the one of the bigger prices the big club systems pay|pg||
nt|algraves:  but even playing standard 4@s after pre emption would be hard to find|pg||
nt|kit: seems like Levin will continue diamonds|pg||
nt|algraves:  the bottom line is that pre empts work. so get out your pre empts and start jumping around|pg||
nt|kit: Is Levin still thinking here?|pg||
nt|algraves:  so NS for Grue have missed 6@C for an 11 imp pickup for Fleisher|pg||
nt|mslair: is this hand makable with the dia return?|pg||
nt|dinos1: but will score in 7@d hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: long pause by levin|pg||
nt|algraves:  board 27 now looms as a big board|pg||
nt|algraves:  the possible vul 3NT played in 3@D by NS|pg||
nt|dinos1: not makeable coz def will tap E in time|pg||
nt|mslair: someone state a line to make with the 2nd dia play?|pg||
nt|kit: even with club shift, doubt if it can be made|pg||
nt|mslair: club return  pass the heart to the 6|pg||
nt|kit: and then the diamond|pg||
nt|mslair: ok  no  good|pg||
nt|harmon: lol|pg||
nt|passell: not even the great mr lair could make this 1|pg||
nt|kit: I could see this going down a lot if declarer plays all out for 3-3 trump split|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kit: depends on your definition of terrible|pg||

pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: In that case, he missed a chance to describe his hand properly after Ish very effectively jumped to 2S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: if North won't have four hearts, then unless he is specifically 4=3=3=3 he will have a minor|pg||

nt|algraves:  and doubled to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|algraves:  for grue|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: and Stansby was willing to make the unsporting double, picking up 2 IMPs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|kit: And if that is the margin of the match, Cheek will commit suicide|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: South at the other table showed both his suits with a cue bd, and North jumped because of his two good cards in those suits|pg||
nt|ritong: a bit offbaord other room  now, they just lack trump 10 or J to have a good play|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Ish's double is support for Bakhshi's "suit", no doubt|pg||
nt|dburn: the resulting game was not bad - needed the opener to have a doubleton @sA, or someone to have @sJ10 doubleton|pg||
nt|woozle: Kamil might be able to stop if his style makes a 2S bid meaningful here|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher has a plus position on the last board of the set in that they may well go plus.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Kamil still trying to decifer 2@C bid|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes really imagine you had to double to protect against the same contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, if he thinks it;s natural, his side will get to some game or other|pg||
nt|woozle: It feels like Grue's 3S was an overbid at the other table, particularly after intervention at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|dburn: but he seems to have worked it out|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|dinos1: he may bid 2@s then accept INV|pg||
nt|woozle: Fleisher headed for a six imp gain here, closing the gap to 5.|pg||
nt|woozle: sorry, 5 imps|pg||
nt|dinos1: 190 = 5|pg||
nt|woozle: so Grue will lead by six at the break|pg||
nt|chorush: I think 5 unlss he makes 4 by some chance|pg||
nt|dburn: errors and omissions excepted, of course - the judiciary may yet have to consider board 10|pg||
nt|dinos1: helping lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dinos1: 10 tricks)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|woozle: six imps after all. |pg||
nt|algraves:  thats from Alice in Wonderland|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: It's difficult to love a lead from a doubleton jack of trumps...but leading the jack might have saved the position|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|dinos1: once i made unsporting X of 7@h with trump ace with a thought: who knows what may happen at the other table. beat them -2 pd having trump K ...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@h was played at the other table))|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ritong: restart soon|pg||
nt|sybarra: and join us then,  its another nail biter |pg||
nt|chorush: Should be a great finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: back soon for 4th quarter|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|vugraphzfh: longway to go at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: for what?|pg||
nt|algraves:  well he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  the tenth will be hard to come by|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: closing, follow at open table.|pg||
nt|algraves:  but he figures it is the last board|pg||
