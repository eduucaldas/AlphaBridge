mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Yes, learning the hard way|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|alert|nt|mich-b: I assume West thought the lowest @H from East suggests a @C shift?|pg||
nt|bg: if they are playing low encourages then there was no reason to switch|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Why*|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: IT's an obvious count situation in my view|pg||
nt|mich-b: yes, agree, would be a count situation for me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: 3d is retransfer not natural|pg||
nt|xenya: the only S's holding where a spade switch was needed is something like xxxx Axx KQJxxx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mich-b: in this hand , I like 3@D only with strong 5-4 that may consider slam|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sybarra: this auction could well be duplicated however|pg||

mb|d|nt|hawe45: But almost...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is not ideal because you have no good rebid if it goes 1@D  1MA  from partner|pg||
nt|mich-b: 3@C as a fit jump , is a possibility for North|pg||
mb|2D|an|alert|nt|bg: third hand 3nt opening would have paid off here|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|pelu: now roon for 2@h by East (asking for stopper) - better 3@H by N - then problems for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She is too good for 3@H|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think EW are on the right way to 3NT|pg||

nt|pelu: on a pssed hand?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hans claimed she had an opener|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3N|nt|pelu: then 3@C = fit bid|pg||
nt|hawe45: South is by far too weak to bid 1 @H - red against green etc.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: I think 1@H is a good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no hans - opp a passed pd just for the lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: with such a good suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: I - and most topplayers - would bid 1@H 100 out of 100|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45: With the North hand - facing a 1 @H vulnerable - you are closer to slam than to a part score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 101|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hans, you must be the only player in the world who does not overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|pelu: Now I know why TD's looks for extra pass-cards to Hans' box |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would also bid 1 @H - but the hand is too weak|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: did I mis-see that   couldnt he he can leave trump in dummy and play clubs, pitching the 2 @D in dummy ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: North did much too much in the auction of course no reason to preempt with 3@s couold have doubled 2@s to show a good suit in a giood hand then south would have been able toshow ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: his @ds at a safe level|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

nt|mamos: declarer making the defenders suffer a little|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hawe45: 4 @S is an interesting spor here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The only game with a chance|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Tough to spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alert|nt|Walddk2: 3NT goes 2 down|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|hawe45: 2 @D game forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D a game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|xenya: and it may go down on om a diamond riff|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D prob GF - sh be alerted|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hawe45: I think, they will soon know, that their @H-stopper is not OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 3@S|pg||
nt|pelu: now they have a chance - 3@D nat and 3@S by N = bad @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she already denied four, so 3@S is a feature|pg||
nt|Walddk2: denying a heart stopper|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mich-b: 5@D is the likely outcome|pg||
nt|pelu: and played by N - no @D-ruff!|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mich-b: And west has an easy lead to defeat 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: To get to 4 @S, at least one player must bid the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: :):)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Maria had an easy 3@S bid after 3@D|pg||
nt|hawe45: North should have bid 3 @S and not 4 @D|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy - but that would be a good bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|mich-b: Will East overtake to make sure?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45: The North hand is "ugly" to bid 1 NT - I would bid 1 @S or 2 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good point Michael|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what if partner switches to a spade?|pg||
nt|mich-b: Now West is thinking ..and East is sorry for not overtaking....|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am surprised Peter did not say "play count" instead of "attitude"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hans too for that matter|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|hawe45: This is an obvious count situation|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|lestergold: nothing can keep us on the staright and narrow|pg||
nt|viren169: Nothing really make on this hand but I suspect N/S will climb too high|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|mamos: so Denmark may get a chunk of imps back|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S has some play... but not much!|pg||
nt|vugraphzag: west alerted 1@s, but east takes it as natural|pg||
mb|d|nt|viren169: especially when E/W had bid and supported them!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: more true for you maybe :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: West knows she wants to bid Hearts :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mamos: 4@D?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: South has other ideas|pg||
nt|mamos: well this may be better than bidding game|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: six black tricks   ta very much|pg||

pc|cK|nt|mamos: East's overcall   and West's perfectly reasonable raise have lead to playing far too high a  contract :(|pg||
