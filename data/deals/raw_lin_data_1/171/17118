nt|hedyg: i would need to check the poll at bridge winners|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|lc: Likely 1@D-1@S-1NT to start.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: The hands ran high in the last session and - naturally - we are hoping for more of the same.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Then, South needs to know his methods for signing off in @C|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lc: Actually, I like analyzing partscore deals. :)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Cant beat the Fraternity house. People who have lived there or live there have won virtually every event . So Grue team a favorite|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the bridge winners poll 9% voted for Grue|pg||
nt|lc: Apparently 2NT puppets to 3@C  which will be the final resting spot.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah yes, part scores (yawn...) |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  so here we have an easy 130 for NS|pg||
nt|kit: on this hand best is if they don't know how to sign off -- stumble into 3NT making|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lc: The poll, Hedy, was taken when the Final 8 was known?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes larry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|algraves:  Ew could have taken 7 or 8 ricks in @H|pg||
nt|lc: Yes Kit, the cards are very friendly for 3NT -- a make.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know, doubt it cause only 12 % for Fleisher and 9 for Grue|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes, fi8nal 8|pg||
nt|hedyg: final*|pg||
nt|lc: Well, Fleisher had to beat Nickell and Diamond the last 2 days -- that held down their vote, I'm sure.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|harmon: I think fleischer had the much more difficult draw|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|algraves:  welll you will never go broke underestimating the American public|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised they use 2NT as relay for signoff -- means they have to bid 2@C on invite, allowing lead-directing double|pg||
nt|lc: While we are at it, we should congratulate  41 Kang -- who made it all the way to the semis -- nobody saw that coming.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Fraternity house is in NY. Grue lives there . Bathurst . Hurd . Wolpert used to live there . All have won events at this tournament . Well Grue hasnt yet|pg||
mc|10|nt|poohbear: sorry Bathurst second|pg||

nt|athene: good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|athene: martel has an interesting evaluation decision here|pg||
nt|athene: if partner has four spades you might make 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it can be useful to be able to bid stayman and still stop in 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but they might not have that option available|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or a NT?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!C|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt might be there if partner has just the right hand but it is a fairly low-percentage action|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|nt|athene: east might double now|pg||
nt|athene: and EW get into their hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: a pretty aggressive double - he feels he has to "pre-balance" since he is the one with the short clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also he is limited by passing over 1nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: System here. How to show @C with or without tophonors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: Leslie had his Wheaties for breakfast this morning, great call, I love it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt didn't give opener any room to show enthusiasm for clubs, so i guess martel had just decided not to look for game|pg||
nt|athene: which is fair enough|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: looks like well do some quick catching up here|pg||
nt|athene: costly lead|pg||
nt|athene: now ishmael will lose only one diamond AND his spade goes away on the fourth diamond|pg||
nt|athene: so a nice swing for people finding their nine-card fits|pg||
nt|rodal f: A old 3@C from S?=2 tophonors and 6+?|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of imps in these partscore battles|pg||
nt|athene: in fact a lot of high-level teams matches are decided on partscores because you expect everyone to bid their games and play them sensibly, at this level|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: west not adhering to the rule of 15|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know all the details of NS's system over 1nt; you would think they have some way to invite games with minors|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|frankaus: g'day all |pg||

mb|p|nt|poohbear: Grue has won an event . He won the NAOP |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lc: Maybe PASS to avoid the rebid/distortion - even though tempting to open light at these colors as dealer.|pg||
nt|kit: not an opener in Levin-Weinstein style|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: He would open if the suit was a major.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  perhaps they have a style they have discussed|pg||
nt|lc: Since it was a 3rd seat opener, and they are white, and the xxx in @H are poor, those all led to Levin's pass of 3@D.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lc: Declarer's concern here will be the @DJ -- he can see the 4 top red-suit losers.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems that we have now paid the price for the exciting boards at the end of the last set (assessed at two consecutive part scores) and will soon move back to the big stuff. |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|s9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lc: Honestly, I feel there is more to learn and more to teach on this kind of deal.  Oh well.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you are greedy David|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: fourth round of hearts might give declarer something to worry about|pg||
nt|hedyg: we had fireworks last segement!|pg||
nt|lc: Freak/crazy distributions are more of a guessing game with no point.|pg||
nt|algraves:  4th @H would be interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: segment|pg||
nt|brolucius: You watch the part scores, then, and I will watch the games and slams. See who has the more enjoyable time...|pg||
nt|lc: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: There are only two bridge writers in the world who are willing to devote two pages to a 2@D contract. (Easy to guess).|pg||
nt|lc: As a player, I was always disappointed to work so hard to win 5 here and 4 there -- and then have 26 IMPs swint because of where the @HK sat in 6@H at one table and 4@H at the ...|pg||
nt|lc: other.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: now another spade discard, and some real problems for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lc: From the 6-1 @H, declarer will place South with the @D length, of course.  And will suspect South has the @DJ.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: i dont quite understand the ruff in dummy where the better trump are that i will need to pull trumps with|pg||
nt|kit: but a spade will now scramle the entries|pg||
nt|lc: So, @DA and then a @S.  That does look like a problem for declarer (even though GIB users don't think so).|pg||
nt|lc: I guess he can then crossruff.|pg||
nt|lc: And probably would.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's yet another hand where Allan was explaining that you have to count winners rather than losers (despite being in a suit contract). I find these part scores so fascinating.|pg||
nt|kit: but what  if South wins ace of diamonds now and plays another diamond?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: no, sorry, that doesn't work|pg||
nt|kit: must play spade|pg||
nt|lc: Glad to see Brother Lucious finding this partscore so fascinating. :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lc: I'd rather see a grand slam on a finesse.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|kit: now can crossruff -- 5 trumps, 1 spade, 2 clubs= 8 tricks left|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|mc|9|nt|007 joosth: so no cross ruff  just a claim:)|pg||

mb|1C|an|c b short|nt|mrdct: i think brd 1 looks like a swing for grue as 3NT looks cold vs the failed slam in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfh: Director is summoned|pg||
nt|mrdct: so what's the problem nancy?|pg||
nt|mrdct: slightly off-beat 1NT here but low risk at these colours|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@sx a likely contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: what's east doing? transferring to his singleton?|pg||
nt|mrdct: few would deny that Ish Del'Monte is Australia's best player|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: ah that's better|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E will be disappointed that dummy is so strong|pg||
nt|mslair: its got to be the @h lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: he from NZ originally right?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: hi mark:)|pg||
nt|athene: trump promo here for 2 down|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange. If NS at the two tables had 2@S and 2NT at there reportuare a 3@C bid would been auto from  ans a might auto 3NT at CR as OR.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrdct: dbl and then 2NT shows about 19/20 balanced generally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: on board 1, 3nt made 5 in this room|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah - he migrated to australian about 20 years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: shipwrecked so the story goes|pg||
nt|sybarra: egads when he was  4 yrs old?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: he was about 19 or 20 at the time i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he has kids older than that|pg||
nt|athene: close decision for east; passing might work out very well if you can get spade ruffs, but it could also go very badly wrong if declarer gets in and draws trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you would be more inclined to pass at MP since 200 is great and -670 isn't so bad, just one board|pg||
nt|athene: if you are going to pull it, maybe the ever-popular 2nt comes into consideration|pg||
nt|athene: keep diamonds in the picture|pg||
nt|athene: of course that would wrongside 3nt if partner wanted to bid that with @HKx or something|pg||
nt|athene: del'monte thinking about 3@H now i would imagine|pg||
nt|athene: he might even pass|pg||
nt|athene: on the basis that this could well be a hand where you might have the points for game but no game makes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: yes Ish's  best results are with ash bach - now also playing in Melbourne Aus|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS may fare better in 3NT here on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS might be having a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well he found their diamonds, but this surely must be forcing|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mrdct: 3@H looks cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@C was system on I hoped. Now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|mrdct: the problem here for NS is that there isn't really a source of tricks in NS as south has no entries|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|chilloncan: ish also a veteran of the Rita Shugart team in US at one time|pg||
nt|chilloncan: connection there with Andrew Robson who is also a former partner and ongoing colleague of David Bakshi|pg||
nt|sybarra: he doesnt look very old|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe its just me getting older|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might well have got doubled|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|mrdct: he also does quite a bit with youth development in Australia on top of running a couple bridge clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: west might have dodged a bullet there|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: the rip of 3@hx to 3NT should make it clear to north that south intended 3@d as natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think he's about 38 or 39|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: 2 down likely here losing 2 trumps, 2@h and 1@s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: sadly we may not be so well-informned about EW, so the byplay commentary is regrettably a bit onesided|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: would have guessed slightly younger,   but that sounds right|pg||
nt|athene: levin decided that 1-3-4-5 was about the worst shape to open light|pg||
nt|athene: and he gained some imps for it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: east ruffing a @d will be with a natual trump trick if south gets trumps right|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: ruffing a @c i mean|pg||
nt|athene: even if east had bid 2nt scramble over the double, west would have to bid more than just 3@D, so there is no way they were going positive on the board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Jacki: Welcome Harmon, who will be commenting for us|pg||

nt|poohbear: 3@c asked for 4 card suits and 4@H KCB|pg||
nt|lc: At IMPs, it would seem better to be in a minor (preferably clubs) -- since 6NT needs more.|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|lc: On the other hand, I could see suffering a ruff or bad break in a minor -- when 6NT is a make and 6@C or 6@D is down.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|chorush: And there is a matter of 2 imps extra|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: The biggest test here is for the defense not to lead out of turn.|pg||
nt|lc: They have to figure out who bid @D first.|pg||
nt|algraves:  well Grue did not know that his partnere did not have 5@D|pg||
nt|algraves:  and less points|pg||
nt|algraves:  right this is a huge favourite for the lead out of turn, thank goodness for screens|pg||
nt|lc: On a @C lead, declarer has a test.  (He can't go down on this layout, but it would be annoying to rise @CA and then find a @D loser with the @CK onside).|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is usually a bit tricky to decide whether to play in a 4-4 fit at the six-level or 6NT. The usuall guideline is to choose NT when you have points to spare. (You might still go ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: down to a bad break, when playing in a suit contract).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: levin knows he's on lead, just to relieve your anxieties...|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol ok|pg||
nt|algraves:  ah|pg||
nt|algraves:  not an easy lead |pg||
nt|brolucius: A skilful declarer will usually read the cards well when a defender takes 5 minutes to choose an opening lead.|pg||
nt|kit: they did quite well to get to 6@D -- 6NT could go down|pg||
nt|algraves:  he is trying of course to visualize situations where what he leads will contribute to the defeat of the contract|pg||
nt|lc: yes, in 6NT, after losing the @C finesse, they might have to guess which major suit finesse to take.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lc: Yes, I know all the viewer wouldn't lose to that @CK.  Neither would Deep Finesse.|pg||
nt|algraves:  either by not giving up a trick and waiting for 2 or by creating a winner for pard and then in time to get it later|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: When West has four minor-suit cards to East's six, West would be favorite to hold any missing major-suit queen. Declarer might then finesse in hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 10@H lead vs 6NT would solve that problem i guess|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mrdct: looks like a fairly normal game to reach on the EW cards at this vul|pg||
nt|mrdct: but neither @s nor @d are breaking|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Hi R|pg||
nt|athene: 6minor better than 6nt here|pg||
nt|dburn: clubs better than diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: a ruff in either hand means you don't need a major-suit finesse for the 12th trick|pg||
mb|2C|an|inverted|nt|chilloncan: spades breaking ok, normal play brings in 3 trix|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: yet another hand with not much powder in it|pg||
mb|2H|an|ART GF|nt|mrdct: kang off to a good start with match with a partscore swing and a beatable game on their scoresheet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Patrick Huang of song and legend informs me that Sun was on the chinese team that finished 4th in Olympiad in turkey. patrick is a guy i am inclined to believe:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d come home for 4 tricks here so 7 tricks on top|pg||
nt|mrdct: but declarer will fiddle around a bit before putting all his eggs in the @d basket|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|athene: inverted minor raises are really tricky without a lot of agreements|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Easy board and a interesting point in @C|pg||
nt|athene: people often flounder around with no idea whether opener has 4 in his suit, or how strong he is|pg||
nt|athene: then they end up just jumping to 6nt anyway|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though NS actually have some methods in place, though|pg||
nt|athene: not surprisingly :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: By 2/1 u prommice 3@S at 1. Then I also invert minor, but by 5 cards. There system. for shure is dicussed|pg||

nt|athene: y, 2 with the queen is 4th step|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i guess a @H lead most likely|pg||
nt|mrdct: the defence could come to 2@h, 2@d and 1@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am grateful to all the specs who are deluging me with information about EW:)|pg||
nt|harmon: club lead at other table|pg||
mb|5N|an|pick slam|nt|athene: hmmm is 5nt pick a slam?|pg||
nt|athene: if he knows he is off a keycard, why wld he be looking for 7?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|mrdct: once the @h switch comes though he'll need to play on @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the @D suit comes home |pg||
nt|mrdct: although delcarer may have tangled himself up here as @d a blocked if @hA is removed|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: this lead solves all problems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: in the open room declarer tried to set up @d|pg||
nt|gambit: yes 5NT is pick a slam|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly better contract than six diamonds, this - since the trumps are solid (apart from the king), you can obtain more information about the distribution before trying to handle ...|pg||
nt|dburn: 4-1 diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: just as is happening here|pg||
nt|dburn: also, six clubs might make even with @cK wrong and an opponent having a sure diamond trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chilloncan: In recent years the US has been regularly graced with the participation of World Pairs winners  FU Zhong & ZHAO JIe  (known here as FU & "Lord Jack" respectively), and given the ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: success of the Kang team to this point i am guesssing we may see a larger chinese presence here in NABCs to come|pg||
nt|athene: if you try the "free" heart finesse you lose the jack as a menace|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: but people are more likely to lead from Q109x against 6@C than 6NT, i guess|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: so he felt it was worth trying|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: Fu & Jack are perennial contenders for the Gold Medal in smoking at NABCs|pg||

nt|dburn: but he'll probably just ruff it anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: still, with trumps 4-1, to do that will require him to commit himself early in diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: But wan't the 7 2EW as NS:) Next board.|pg||
nt|athene: he can keep either the @SJ or the @H7 for a possible squeeze|pg||
nt|athene: has to decide which is better odds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: it's more convenient to ruff the spade isn't it? since you have more big clubs in hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: north can even afford to not cash the setting trick and try to get it 2 down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: without 7 of diamonds, attacking that suit is more or less going for 33 break. ducking first heart and attacking spades makes u heavy favorite to get an 8th trick in spades, and ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: playing the last two rounds of spades (or last one) may put pressure on opps|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think south will be able to cling to all of his @ss|pg||
nt|chilloncan: still i agree that attacking diamonds seems the natural line|pg||
nt|mrdct: north is just think through whether or not anything could go wrong if he doesn't cash the @dK|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well he didn't :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chilloncan: woiuld be interesting to compare odds of playing Ds to those of attacking clubs as well|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: that's Professor Martel to you|pg||
nt|athene: show-up squeeze if east had four diamonds|pg||

mb|1D|nt|algraves:  you couldnt draw that inferernce in the rubber games Iplayed in when I was young|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|hedyg: thank you for sharing the table chat with us Patty :)|pg||
nt|lc: I love to play 2@H here by South as weak.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it must have been AWFUL for Larry to have to watch that slam. Let's hope this next deal is better for him.|pg||
nt|lc: Very effective treatment -- as a strong hand is unlikely.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: I think that is pretty standard Larry|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: Not for this pair, apparently. :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: 2@H makes is so much harder on them -- and of course has LAW safety.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|lc: I know Kit agrees 100% with this (not always easy to get Kit's agreement).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South would surely have bid 2@H (pre-emptive over a redouble) if he was non-vulnerable. |pg||
nt|kit: maybe he just didn't feel it worthwhile -- of course any "lawful" bridge player would bid 2@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: grue:  if i bid 3, will you bid 4?|pg||
nt|lc: Of course!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, that's what he led|pg||
nt|hedyg: a wow lead!|pg||
nt|lc: Curious opening lead. |pg||
nt|peyret: good lead|pg||
nt|chorush: only lead with chance to beat contract|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|algraves:  well once he doesnt want to lead a trump|pg||

nt|harmon: I was told if he hasnt underled an ace he doesnt have one:)|pg||

nt|dburn: not quite sure how that squeeze would operate, since the South hand looks like being squeezed first|pg||
nt|dburn: but at any rate, he made it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: yes, the show-up squeeze would only apply if all the cards were completely different|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: so perhaps it was a bit misleading to be babbling on about it|pg||
nt|dburn: you haven't been attending the Barry Rigal School of Commentary, by any chance?|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Limit|nt|mrdct: NS can make 3@c so this could be OK for Grue|pg||
nt|athene: no, but it sounds like a fine institution :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: an agressive (or insane) EW pair might try for a VUL 3NT here|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact 3NT might make for NS|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rodal f: 20-20 and 2@H as end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt is a good raise in diamonds|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H was from S a fight good enough.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mrdct: missed a pass there i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep think a pass needs to be inserted|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: swap the NS hands and 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT-P-P-2@H in OR.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people play "flip flop" here where 2nt is the pre-empt and 3minor is the constructive raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was wrong:)|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being that if you want to play 3nt, you want the doubler on lead|pg||
nt|athene: because he doesn't know what suit his partner has|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: the ace of spades is onside for del Monte, but that's the end of the good news|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi David.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: single digit percent game if u swap the hands|pg||
nt|mrdct: this will be welcome steadier for Grue as they lost quite a lot of imps towards the end of the 3rd session and a small swing on the 1st of this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: always get difficult with bbo program to "lead out of turn"  etc|pg||
nt|chilloncan: all the hands so far in this set have been teeth-gnashers for the trailing team, little scope for rally|pg||
nt|dburn: why should they go down when we can?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might be thinking lawful thoughts|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. "partner has a stiff diamond and 4 hearts, so there are 18 total trumps!"|pg||
nt|rodal f: At vul William?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|mrdct: i think test @c first and then once you have the good news go after @d|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but was that typical play for the club suit?|pg||
nt|mrdct: but may have better to finish in dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: you said it better David|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|mrdct: although - maybe what south did was better as it gave LHO a chance to err and duck the @dK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11 will get 13 imps 10 only 12|pg||
nt|mrdct: in which case he could then revert to @s and make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: West is deliberating|pg||
nt|frankaus: must cash @S or 11 |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: basically he was assuming @DK was offside for east's pass|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|mrdct: he'd like to avoid playing on @h himself|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure the defenders actually want to be doing this - would have been better to take the club ruffs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Martel had to do what he did to save the board - at the other table, Grue underled his @cA at trick one|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer didn't get that right, and ended up having to guess hearts to get out for down one in three|pg||
nt|barnets: great lead|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Martel might need to chuck his queen of clubs under the king at some point|pg||
nt|dburn: otherwise, it will be down in three at one table, making four at the other|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: I am sure he will get it right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: believe me - every imp counts in KO matches - plenty get won and lost by an imp|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: del Monte was sure also, and didn't even bother giving him the chance to get it wrong|pg||
nt|athene: the one problem with setting up elimination positions is that usually it is really, really obvious what is going on|pg||
nt|athene: so even a sleepy defender will think "hang on, i have to do some cute unblocking here"|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p!|nt|brolucius: Always 1@H in UK. Too good for a weak two, even when vulnerable.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no alert on the pass, glitch with mouse, OE|pg||
nt|kit: Double shows club suit + diamond tolerance probably|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  well you know partner is broke on the auction and you need 5 tricks so trump unlikely to get us 5 tricks and may cost a natural trick|pg||

nt|lc: If 3-1 @S, and @H misbehave, he might lose his @C ruff in dummy and go down by starting trump.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|dburn: this is potentially dangerous - has Martel got enough to bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H with @SKxx might lose the spades - but i think martel should go 3@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: One level up from OR. 1@H - 2@D|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room north opened 1@H|pg||
nt|dburn: I mean, if Stansby doesn't have a fit, it could be expensive|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|athene: well he has a pretty good hand, and missing a vul game is the greater risk|pg||
nt|athene: west surely not thinking of saccing in 5@D?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mrdct: 4@sx goes 2 down i think|pg||

nt|chilloncan: when he tells the story he won by 2|pg||
nt|dburn: if 3@s is non-forcing, OK - but if it is forcing and partner doesn't have support, the "greater risk" may well be a four-digit number ending in two zeroes|pg||
nt|athene: no guarantee partner is short in hearts so could be very expensive|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: can anyone make anything here?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he gets the lead bid in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: not a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: thats why ,mayeb 1@H was a little better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: ish will be please that the @d shortage is with the long trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@c might scape home|pg||
nt|dburn: del Monte getting to 1NT ahead of his opponents - usually a good move at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|harmon: except if flescher says dble|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C should perhaps guarantee a diamond fit given the opps are having a strong auction|pg||
nt|athene: just on grounds of frequency|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: *pleased|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S a bit dangerous at the colors, but with a big lead Ishmael probably figuring his teammates will face that opening in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: you are way more likely to want to bid 4@C there with something in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: ac tually 5@D would win  afew imps for -500|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: probably too soon after breakfast to double - not that hungry yet|pg||
nt|harmon: unfortunate but normal lead|pg||
nt|dburn: the Italians have a theory that you should lead high from this kind of suit if your third card is the eight or better|pg||
nt|rodal f: So we can say it is stolen by EW|pg||
nt|dburn: judging by this, they know what they are talking about|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, there is some other evidence that the Italians know what they are talking about|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: 2 @d might be a challenge|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i think south is happier defending 2@d|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@dW is the open room contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: well curtis cheek made 2@d - let's see how sun goes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: 90 in the bank looks good|pg||
nt|dburn: but del Monte may even make this now|pg||
nt|dburn: he can set up two hearts to go with three clubs and two diamonds, and I don't think the defenders can get enough tricks in time|pg||
nt|rodal f: If E play @H now we are right David.|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he has to play hearts from his hand, giving up on the finesse, and he may be reluctant to do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: finfering @H|pg||
nt|harmon: he can finesse d's still be ok|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: north might try to sneak a @c through to the K but I doubt that will work|pg||

mb|p|an|no 1st/2nd rd !C ctrl|nt|lc: This could be a very interesting play in 4@S -- with the potential @D loser the big issue.|pg||
nt|lc: Many pairs use 3@C as the GF raise -- but the big downside is as here, the dreaded Lead-Directinig Double.|pg||
nt|kit: This shows disadvantage of 3@C for forcing raise|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the old-fashioned strong jump shift went out of fashion, many players use the bids to show a type of major-suit raise.  Also, we saw 1@D - 2@H to show a balanced 14 points ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: (by North a few moments ago).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry, they're writing too small for me to see alert info|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Make them write in CAPITALS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the dbl of 3@C was announced as showing clubs|pg||
nt|lc: After @C, @C, North will likely play a neutral trump back against 4@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the alerted pass probably denies a @C stopper|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are doing us proud, Patty. As I have said before, 7 minutes would be my limit and that would be on a good day.|pg||
nt|chorush: Pass probably showed no club control, ending any slam hunt|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see how it can make after club lead and proper defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@C has become a useless card|pg||
nt|lc: Then, declarer evetually starts @H -- and it could get interesting.|pg||
nt|kit: how does it get interesting Larry?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps South is squeezed out of guarding @D.|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 2@cs if N plays a @d|pg||
nt|lc: In other words, @H 10 to the @HA.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lc: Then, South has to guard hearts -- and come down to @D10x -- so declarer can pick up @D by leading @DJ.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc: This is double-dummy a bit -- and probably can be broken up.|pg||
nt|lc: But -- it is interesting.  No?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Seems like it might work. He has 9 top tricks and can use the second heart winner as the squeeze card.|pg||
nt|lc: Yes -- if they don't break up the entries -- which they can.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lc: Anyway, declarer will likely just try to drop @DQ or @DQx -- and not hook the @H.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|sJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|nt|lc: Aside from playing for the @DQ to fall, there are a few esoteric @D positions declarer can try for -- none of which work.|pg||

nt|mrdct: north in 3NT on a @s lead in the open room|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, AMrshall, any chance you are a fan of Zelazny?|pg||
nt|barnets: but same|pg||
nt|barnets: safe 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Interesting hand at EW|pg||
nt|barnets: here e/w played a 3@C convention|pg||
nt|barnets: as a forcing raise|pg||
mb|3D|an|Limit !S|nt|mrdct: what's another name for AKQJ10x?|pg||
nt|barnets: north was able to x for the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chilloncan: can see S wrestling this one from N|pg||
nt|mrdct: trumps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: can't see...|pg||
nt|barnets: against 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: a competitive auction without the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@h may be a better spot than 3NT, but there is plenty of work to do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree.|pg||
nt|dburn: only three losers, but not necessarily ten winners|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: EW wont be happy with this deal either, pathetic grist to the mill of recovery|pg||
nt|mrdct: so grue might have right-sided it here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1@s, 2@h, 3@d & 3@C|pg||
nt|frankaus: 9 quickly here - 3@h, 3@C, 3@d|pg||
nt|chilloncan: havent read zelazny|pg||
nt|athene: well, *not* doubling 3@D might have the same effect|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. south leads a club|pg||
nt|dburn: South may lead a club anyway, of course|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond lead would give the contract|pg||
nt|athene: also south will lead a club regardless of cunning inferences, yes :)|pg||
nt|dburn: but I wonder whether GIB could make this - lead the jack of diamonds from dummy, then later squeeze South in the red suits...|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe not, and doubtless he won't try anything like that|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|mrdct: even more interesting is that Curtis Cheek lead the @C4 in the other room and mustn't have been feeling too good when dummy came down|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish might introduce his @c suit now - but at what level|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c might be passed so perhaps 6@c now|pg||
nt|mwigor: surely 5@c would be a cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: 3@C alerted but no explanation|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not many partnerships play 2H as Michaels by responder:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: Ish stick with the theory that @S = trumps|pg||
nt|mrdct: grue fans might be content with 10 imps here with NS stopping in game|pg||
nt|mrdct: is east thinking?|pg||
nt|gambit: xfer the threat, neat thought |pg||
nt|barnets: but south can break the squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfh: sorry, no, it's S thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct: i would be too!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|mrdct: i don't think NS have previosuly discussed this sequence|pg||
nt|mrdct: only danger now is will NS bid grand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: david's prowess will not be tested to the fullest on this layout|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe a transfer - quite popular these days|pg||
nt|barnets: by playing a second heart i think no ?|pg||
nt|athene: south just has to make sure he cuts the communication in hearts i wld have thought|pg||
nt|dburn: Stansby putting his side in some peril, but declarer wasn't going to run that diamond|pg||
nt|athene: wow, grosvenor-ish diamond return|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chilloncan: 5S = do you have a club control    6C  = yes the ace|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s is still trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, after a spade to the king and ace South will feel a little victimized|pg||
nt|dburn: he won't want to play anything, but a heart is his best choice|pg||
nt|dburn: even that, though, may not be enough|pg||
nt|rodal f: If. He have a good return. @H.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mrdct: well north-south have navigated this one to a makeable slam and a big swing|pg||
nt|mwigor: barbara travis points out that the play in 6@s is far from a formality|pg||
nt|chilloncan: dont think so, N need too many cover cards|pg||
nt|mwigor: declarer may well lose control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Les mumbling and grumbling|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in that order?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: in the other room declarer played the @SK from dummy at trick 1 which didn't work out so well|pg||
nt|dburn: if he plays a low heart, he will be victimized again after ace and another|pg||
nt|dburn: if he plays a high heart, declarer can ruff a diamond in the dummy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ure so right:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: recurring theme for me..... players are 20+ minutes behind on clock|pg||
nt|dburn: the queen of clubs has also been suggested, but even that isn't any good|pg||
nt|athene: of course for all north knew, south had @DA and declarer had @HAQ and it was necessary to give a diamond guess right there|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|sA|nt|frankaus: 11 more for the leaders|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|rodal f: Done now if W do his work.|pg||
nt|dburn: I think that's right - don't know if GIB has any other ideas, but I can't see one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|barnets: it looks like south will have no choice to break up the squeeze when declarer leads his heart|pg||
nt|barnets: had dec left a trump out then|pg||
nt|barnets: led a heart|pg||
nt|barnets: south wins the ace|pg||
nt|dburn: if he does that, can't North be endplayed? maybe he has to win the heart and play a club to North, who plays a heart|pg||
nt|barnets: plays a club to north|pg||
nt|barnets: who plays a second trump|pg||
nt|barnets: now the squeeze is on|pg||
nt|barnets: and south cant guard the @d10|pg||
nt|gambit: but it must look to declarer that S has the DQ|pg||
nt|dburn: sure it will - he won't transfer the diamond guard|pg||
nt|barnets: yes maybe he can be endplayed nice hand now|pg||
nt|athene: yes, transferring the menace only works when *two* cards are placed specifically, so you generally need a lot of information to go fo rthat|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|barnets: so it needs to be @HA club the heart|pg||
nt|athene: well, either a lot of information, or a strong desire to make the bulletin|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mrdct: indeed he is going to lose control of trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: still. Amoils can't see all the cards|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|barnets: north needs the second heart as exit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chilloncan: had N cashed D ace before ruffing (double dummy), W would have to exit heart king on gaining lead with club king|pg||
nt|dburn: well done|pg||
nt|barnets: yes |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|dburn: so he will just try to ruff a diamond on the table and get overruffed by the short trumps|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrdct: looks like win @cA and exit a @c stright-away was the winning line|pg||
nt|mwigor: or low at trick one is ok i think|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N was worried about club ruff, and was cold whenever sopades 43, so he didnt play second club|pg||
nt|mwigor: but declarer's play is understandable|pg||
nt|dburn: another 13 IMPs to GIB, but only three to Grue|pg||
pc|c9|pc|sT|nt|mrdct: but if @cA wins, he can afford to lose a @c ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: indeed, clearly indicated|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: he didnt need to transfer the guard in diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chilloncan: he cant afford to lose club king and a ruff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: south would have still been squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn: true - he could pin the ten, I guess|pg||
nt|barnets: had they not broken the heart communication |pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrdct: yeah good point|pg||
nt|mrdct: so trick 1 duck is looking good|pg||
nt|mwigor: 4-3 trumps is better 62%|pg||
nt|mwigor: (i think)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: yes he can squeeze south and then decide whether he has squeezed him down so the queen is dropping or the ten is getting pinned|pg||
pg||
qx|o23|st||md|1ST52HQ54D5CKJ8752,SK874H87DAK94CQ64,SA9HKJT3DQT83CAT3,SQJ63HA962DJ762C9|sv|b|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That was another interesting one. We can't complain about the boards this time.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|algraves:  so a good example of the waiting defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|algraves:  always best to play last to a trick if you do not need the time to build winnerrs|pg||
nt|lc: So many intermediate players would err by doubling with North's hand. It is just wrong -- since you can't cope with spades from partner.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1NT is not so bad.|pg||
nt|lc: Of course, when they X against me, they always seem to survive it.|pg||
nt|kit: Grue close to 1NT overcall, but with partner a passed hand it probably isn't percentage|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: Nice spots, but I agree -- Vul and opp passed partner, too risky for 1NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good hand apart from the three threes.|pg||
nt|algraves:  Ah Larry , the unlucky expert|pg||
nt|imp_jan: cheek cld / shld have dbld 2@c|pg||
nt|kit: However, failing to bid probably cost some imps, as both 2@D and 3@C make it appears|pg||
nt|lc: South could have X the artificial 2@C, yes.|pg||
nt|lc: The way my partners lead, I would have risked a double.  By the way, what's the score for 2@C XX vulnerable making?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, Larry -- it is the lead he wants vs. notrump|pg||
nt|peyret: will he bid now ? still thinking|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|lc: While we are at it, why 1NT and not 1@S by West?|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody bids 1@s with the W hand?|pg||
nt|lc: Isn't 1@S normal?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh ok, Larry does :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not here. You bid 1NT as soon as possible.|pg||
nt|lc: See how much there is to discuss on these partscore deals? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why? your pd is a bad declarer?|pg||
nt|lc: I was taught to get those 4-card majors in.|pg||
nt|lc: It seems they have missed a 4-4 fit.|pg||
nt|dinos1: Steve likes to hide 4cd @s with NT hand - it was discussed at bridgewinners|pg||
nt|brolucius: You should not start with two suit bids on a balanced hand. That is the rule here.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ritong: *+|pg||
nt|ritong: 7412.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: many pairs automatically bypass 4-card spade suit if balanced, so 1@S call will guarantee shape|pg||
nt|lc: But don't you like to find spades with 8?|pg||
nt|hedyg: "walsh" used to be over 1@c-1@d now it is over everything?|pg||
nt|lc: Not for me, Hedy.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: or  me|pg||
nt|ritong: sorry  ceazy kitty|pg||
nt|kit: if game-going values, we can still find 4-4 fit.  If partial, no big deal, and 1NT might be better anyway -- 7 tricks easier than 8|pg||
nt|hedyg: bonjour Riton :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: Rebidding 1@S leaves partner in the dark about your diamond length. Or club length if that is what you opened.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c2|nt|algraves:  there is merit to both treaments so the key thing is to discuss it with partner and then keep your discpline. Perhaps they have actully discussed this|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|algraves:  and who knows maybe they both agree it is the way they want to play|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if responder was 4=4=3=2 (instead of his actual 4=4=4=1) they would be in a silly 1NT instead of a routine 2@S.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont play walsh over 1@d openings ( it was not invented for that) and over 1@c 1M shows 4 4 for me|pg||
nt|lc: But, I suppose there is some merit -- or they wouldn't win everything in sight.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i have 4+@cs when i bid 1M over my partners 1@d bid|pg||
nt|dinos1: this hand shows why better bid 1@s - Larry gave responder shape|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have always thought that it was only in France where players would rebid 1@S.|pg||
nt|algraves:  the follow to that is that  it should be alerted as may be balanced with 4@S|pg||
nt|lc: I would consider 1@S "standard" in USA.|pg||
nt|kit: there is nothng sacred about always play a 4-4 major-suit fit, particularly at IMPs where the major has to take 2 more tricks than notrump to show a profit|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, i think it is everywhere that players want to be in the best contract|pg||
nt|ritong: i might send my crazy cat on you, david:-)|pg||
nt|brolucius: We have a cat too. Not crazy yet.|pg||
nt|ritong: lucky you|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lazy instead.|pg||
nt|lc: Now, as to a 2NT rebid with 4@S -- that's a different story.  Now, I don't mind, since you can always get back to @S when responder (likely) bids again.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lc: Incidentally, I suppose they use the same system at matchpoints -- where it would be a crime to be in 2@D not 2@S on this deal.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Crime not to be in 1NT when that was right, too.|pg||
nt|ritong: i doubt it|pg||
nt|lc: But after 1@S you can get back to NT.  AFter 1NT it is hard to get back to @S.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|c5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: it isn't hard to get back to spades on game-going hands Larry|pg||
nt|lc: Fine. But most are partials -- like this.|pg||
mc|8|pg||
qx|c23|st||md|1ST52HQ54D5CKJ8752,SK874H87DAK94CQ64,SA9HKJT3DQT83CAT3,SQJ63HA962DJ762C9|sv|b|nt|mrdct: 4@s by west in the open room|pg||
nt|athene: so postpone that decision|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South can make a fair number of clubs, but they couldn't find a way into the auction at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: another unproductive layout for hungry trailers|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: how about a double of 2@C?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mrdct: NS reached an inferior 3@h contract here after north made a t/o dbl of 1@s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe 5 or 6 IMPs at most|pg||
nt|mrdct: and a @C lead trouble 4@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact 4@s doesn't really have any play|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@h the better chance|pg||
nt|frankaus: to me it looks like a lot of losers for red 2@d  |pg||
nt|chilloncan: one doesnt get a buzz from opening weak 2D on this S hand, 6322 vul, but the thing is on the card...|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he did none of the above|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mrdct: illustrating the general preference to play in a 4-4 fit rather than a 5-3 fit as you get some pitches|pg||
nt|dburn: still, that brings the scores to the point where the last six boards have been a waste of time|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot of time, at that|pg||
nt|athene: if you pass as dealer, pass over 1@H, then X 2@C, you can't have that much, can you?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, perhaps "didn't" rather than "couldn't"|pg||
nt|gambit: We have to remember too that it is so much easier looking at all four hands, the defenders were perfect and that is why they are multiple champions |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: south has to decide whether to go for his major or his better suit|pg||
nt|mrdct: that might be 3@c by north|pg||
nt|athene: just some clubs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: if del'monte passes that hand, you better call an ambulance|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 800 by the looks of it|pg||
nt|mrdct: Ish taking an advance save|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is going to go for 800 I think |pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting cards again David?|pg||
nt|dburn: surprised at West - he passed as dealer, and he passed again when he could have doubled 1NT for takeout|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|chilloncan: a lot of the bids chosen by NS here are probably motivated by a belief that opps in other room will push very aggressively, so attempting to duplicate those tactical siutuations|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Ish: "good luck"|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: well, East-West have a game if they can bid it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: yeahhh! well bid, professor martel|pg||
nt|gambit: Al Roth would, but the rest of us....not bloody likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but I am not sure they can - or at any rate will|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3@s has 5 losers i think|pg||
nt|dburn: but I'm a bit surprised del Monte chose 3@s rather than double|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: my own feeling is that 11 loser hands should not bid, even when they can raise 1S to two and even when they have a stronger way to do it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: but here NS have 130 anyway|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so it made no different whatsoever, but at least he doesn't feel he just sat there|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Stansby liked his defence against diamonds too much to go venturing 3@c|pg||
nt|gambit: why not 1@S versus 1NT?|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that as showing an unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chilloncan: maybe 110 with handling charges caused by 41 trumps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@s was a transfer response, of course, so his first double showed spades|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests some might venture 1nt with nroth - you do have a lot of tens and things|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: you do, but you also have a partner who couldn't open and a LHO who hasn't been heard from yet|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: or maybe his first double just showed a good hand, so he hadn't shown his spades yet|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive he got a problem with the 1@S bid at N.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Stole'd my color.|pg||
nt|dburn: becoming very popular, these transfer responses to 1@c - important to get the methods organized|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: seems more prudent to play high trump in dummy, as low ones may be needed to ruff spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 1NT could easily be the winner - the opponents might steal a game from you if you pass|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|mrdct: in a way this is a good board for grue as they have duplicated bad results in both rooms which compresses the damage|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this game was a tough assignment in any case|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: it appears that 2@s might have made six at the other table, so the score is actually 230 for Fleisher|pg||
nt|rodal f: A small loose anyway, but are we to hook @D or try @H 2-2?|pg||
nt|dburn: or a part score, as they have done|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|007 joosth: even more wasted time now:)   (okay  1 imp)   but we enjoyed your comments David|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|mrdct: but they don't want too many of these "good boards" for the rest of this match|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thanks to spec for pointing out that spades are trumps|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: but without a spade lead, I don't see 12 tricks in spades - hearts is a different matter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|harmon: 6 unlikely unless trump lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Joost.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|8|nt|vugraphzfh: Break Time|pg||
nt|athene: if north had wanted to lead a trump to try to stop the club ruff, he could lead the queen|pg||
nt|athene: with the idea that then if declarer takes the king and ruffs with the jack, the @D108 wake up|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead a little trump, declarer can fly with dummy's jack and get a ruff with the small trump so that is no good|pg||
nt|barnets: low scoring quarter so far 8-4 for gruee|pg||
pg||
qx|o24|st||md|2SQ763HAJTDJT4CT94,SK52HQ63DAK32C852,SAT984HK987D7CKJ7,SJH542DQ9865CAQ63|sv|o|nt|brolucius: It's obvious that both methods work OK, or we wouldn't spend so long arguing about it.|pg||
nt|kit: and how do you know that 1NT isn't better than 2@S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: curtis explains he had a @C in with his @Ss or he would have doubled 2@C - so that mystery is solved|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: Up the line - and 4-4 majors for me.  But your points all taken.  We can each choose to do it our way.|pg||
nt|algraves:  well it is an age old debate as we can now see|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|imp_jan: this brd is interesting to see how fit showing treatments are agreed upon|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S limit+ raise probably|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: ok, 2@S = inv+ with @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D would be pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|kit: Good 3@S call with 4-card support.  The "lawful" bid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South would bid 3@D with a stronger hand.|pg||
nt|lc: This time I'm with you Kit. :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or 2n = 4crd fit, inv+|pg||
nt|kit: Incidentally, many (including me) prefer takeout double on north hand|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not on this one of course|pg||
nt|lc: If Grue bids 4@S, might be make it?  Good major-suit guessing is quite possible on this auction.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely he does not have a raise to 4@S after South's action.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: that's a very interesting / important issue you bring up here, kit|pg||
nt|lc: Now, I'm not with you Kit.  I'm a 1@S overcaller.  For fear of missing ... tada.. the 8-card S fit if I double. :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now Levin has a problem when it comes back to him -- stiff spade and 5-card support argue for competing, but 4 over 3 often wrong.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dbl or overcall 1@s, i prefer the latter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lc: If it comes back, I like 4@D with Levin's hand -- expecting at least 18 trumps.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lc: But, maybe he fears pusihing them to making 4@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The last of the doublers (instead of bidding 1@S) died a month ago, here is UK. |pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make it DD, but i think only DD|pg||
nt|kit: problem is that law of total tricks tends to break down when getting to 4-level|pg||
nt|lc: With enough strength to X and then bid, of course North should X with his shape. But if he doubles and partner bids NT or @C, he has maybe lost his bet.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: We already knew that Larry never misses an opportunity to bid spades.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|algraves:  so he can make 10 tricks with good picks in the majors, 9 with reasonable picks in the majors and down one with poor picks in the majors|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: can he obtain informations before deciding how to tackle the trumps?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|dinos1: after @cAQ dcl will guess @h's|pg||
nt|kit: will play jack of clubs, so can win thirdround in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: now he probably can|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|imp_jan: rt larry|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: very careless play he made, which could cost contract|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
mc|9|nt|hedyg: 3@S he can make of course, my comment about DD was re 4@s|pg||
nt|lc: Hmmm.  That's the easy way to make it.  Just claim.|pg||
nt|ritong: keep in mind that our operator can miss one or two cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: expert claim :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they are on break|pg||
nt|kit: if West had ace of clubs,couldn't be that sure about location of other honors -- he really should have played jack of clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: we must be at halftime|pg||
nt|lc: While on break -- a little about the players...|pg||
nt|lc: Both are long-time partnerships -- about 10 years or so.|pg||
nt|lc: A lot of "personalities" -- what else with bridge players...|pg||
nt|ritong: he very likely did, kit|pg||
nt|ritong: patty did not|pg||
nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|brolucius: My wife is telling me that 'Dancing on Ice' has started, so I will say goodbye. It was very enjoyable!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i misput the clubs, he ended in dummy and played @SQ|pg||
nt|lc: Levin-Weinstein had won the Cavendish Pairs just about every year -- and the WORLD OPEN pairs -- and have been doing real well in major knockouts the past few years.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: king ace, jack, claim|pg||
nt|dinos1: seems he played J and later unblocked @cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Patty|pg||
nt|lc: Cheek-Grue haven't had as much success -- but have had their share. "Dangerous" and "active" pair.|pg||
nt|lc: A pair you would want in if down 40 with a set to go.|pg||
nt|lc: Cheek was near death after suffering disease during World Championships in Brazil a few years ago.|pg||
nt|lc: He has recurring health problems from that -- but has been improving.  recently married.|pg||
nt|lc: It was a scary time for his many friends in the bridge world.|pg||
nt|lc: (The illness - not the marriage).|pg||
nt|lc: Levin-Weinstien, when first forming their partnership, flew to Florida for a week of work with Marty Bergen.  |pg||
nt|lc: That's when they put together their system -- and they work hard at it.|pg||
nt|lc: In my opinion, they are clearly in the top-10 in the world.|pg||
nt|lc: Steve is a world-class poker player -- known as "Thor-Laden" in the poker world.|pg||
nt|lc: They have been playing (other than yesterday) all 64 boards each day.|pg||
nt|lc: And, it appears they might do so today.|pg||
nt|lc: With screens, and against top competition, it is mentally exhausting to do so.|pg||
nt|lc: OK - I'm done talking -- in case anyone else has something to say. :)|pg||
nt|lc: I know little about AMOILS on Grue team.  Anyone?|pg||
nt|lc: Yesterday, Levin-Weinstein were worn down -- and stomach bug for Levin - -so they sat out.|pg||
nt|hedyg: playing pretty well for a sick man!|pg||
nt|lc: So, no AMOILS-experts with me here?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not to worry...when I lost to the Fleisher team in the round of 16, the pair that played the best by far was Fleisher-Kamil.|pg||
nt|lc: Wouldn't surprise me one bit, Drew.|pg||

nt|007 joosth: Hi|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfh: director has urged table to play faster|pg||
nt|mwigor: going back to the slam - i think ducking the club lead is 63% and playing for 4-3 trumps is 62%|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand will be exciting|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have 10 tricks in @h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: so any small feeling about the lead (ie that it is a singleton) is enough to swing it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hard partscore?|pg||
nt|gambit: I think it is noteworthy that E/W are hardly an experienced partnership and this is their first trip to a final of a "grand-slam" event, and obviously they are holding their own ...|pg||
nt|gambit: very well. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose you might start the trumps by leading the queen from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Fit raise|nt|mrdct: on that hand moss also lead a @C and Kamil took the same line as Ish for -1|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes it is tricky to know how to assess the likelihood of singleton from the fact that a club was led, as the auction made that lead a substantial favorite to hit the baize|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 1C is a very dangerous bid, just begging to be blown out of the auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: but NS have 6@c on ice|pg||
nt|athene: martel not really worth 3@D now though?|pg||
nt|athene: only 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that is the only play to make 10 tricks if you need to|pg||
nt|barnets: in 4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|harmon: boring hand maybe they take less than 20min on it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: when hampson delcarer in 6@s, he got a @h lead and could simply duck that and easily cater for @S5-2|pg||
nt|mrdct: not a bad game here for NS so a chance for Grue to extend the lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: easily? if heart loses he does not necessarily have enough discards if spades go bad|pg||
nt|mrdct: same auction so far in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@h passed around to south who dbls|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: apparently a trump was led, though - still, it will all come out in the wash|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: typically a fit-jump is on a decent suit|pg||
nt|athene: so north really will downgrade that @CKJx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: not that he is going anywhere anyway of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chilloncan: W hand may not seem like a 3D raise, but there is a tactice benefit as it takes opps above the level where they can support double|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mrdct: only if @h 5-1 i think (but what would I know!)|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it's 5@hx in both rooms|pg||
nt|dburn: he might as well lead the queen from dummy now - East can't have long spades, and West is more or less marked with the king|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been following DelMonte by tip from friends. He impress me.|pg||
nt|athene: yes he has played well from what i have seen|pg||
nt|athene: i think he would have a higher profile on the international scene except for the fact that he doesn't seem to have one really solid regular partnership|pg||
nt|dburn: Stansby must be wondering what's taking del Monte so long to return his singleton or doubleton club|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s8|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chilloncan: spec points out that the "scare value" of the strong club actually fnctioned as an inverted preempt here,|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Lucky layout? And =?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes hence the "not necessarily"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Turn NS hand and....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|chilloncan: sadly we are unlikely ever to amass a sizeable enough database to decide whether the tactic is worth repeating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North needs to be careful|pg||
nt|mrdct: how can NS go wrong here?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS must cash the @D now|pg||
nt|mrdct: why - what declarer going to do with his @d losers otherwise?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: put one on the @S suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he has 3 entries|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so if North overtakes...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to do something other than leading a @D..|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess stranger things have happened - but it would seem to only make sense for north to overtake if he had an absoluely clearcut action to take that partner either wont realise ...|pg||
nt|mrdct: or wont have the card|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree with all that - so why the delay?|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe he's having trouble counting up west's 16 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: West doesn't actualy have the canonical 16 HCP, so this is hard for NOrth to read|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe the internet is broken|pg||
nt|mrdct: north will be worried that perhaps west has a @d honour so he can't see an obvious way to beat this|pg||
nt|harmon: I hope they get a time penalty this is ridiculous|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: admittedly the duck has big odds in its favor|pg||
nt|mrdct: the internet being broken is always an option in play in these situations|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe North is broken|pg||
nt|athene: if west did get a club ruff, you would have a close decision what to do in trumps - lead low would cater for 2-2 originally|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: true, but not this time|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

pc|cK|nt|vugraphzfh: 50 minutes (of 75) left in next segment|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: oh...|pg||
nt|dburn: could fine them both 9 IMPs and start again, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: might try to sneak @c7 past Amoils|pg||
nt|dburn: but tried the honest approach, and will soon know that del Monte needs @hQ to make up an opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond now but declarer ruffs and leads @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: if east ducks, to stop declarer reaching dummy for the heart finesse, declarer just plays another club and east is endplayed|pg||
nt|dburn: so he's fairly confident of an overtrick, but one never knows|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: what he must not do is try the sneaky @C7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: or east could  pounce with the queen and stick him back in hand with the jack|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfh: short break|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess that doesn't represent reality|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but the result is correct|pg||
nt|mrdct: i suspect so also|pg||
nt|tejjyid: A lot to be said for a 6@C call from South|pg||
nt|mrdct: so tense stuff here with a couple of lost opportunties for NS in recent boards|pg||
nt|tejjyid: who cares if it goes down, it's not at all stressful & probably cost 5 imps at worst|pg||
nt|chilloncan: plenty to be said when you see N hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ish could have less for 5C bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ISh could have been missing the @S A forexample|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think it was SJ Simon who said not to defend these hands|pg||
nt|mrdct: F leading 158-112 in the other semi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you gamble with double doubled game/slam swings when you defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Mind you, that means this board wil be flat in 7@H X-ed, if both sides follow his advice|pg||

mb|p|nt|drewsky: agree, with 3@H being the smallest of roads|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: splinter seems like overbid -- how can there be a slam if all North could do is bid 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: @d A and no trump loser|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lc: Maybe:  @Sxx  @HQxxx  @DAxx  @Cxxxx.|pg||
nt|drewsky: and that is the biggest last train bid of 4@D I have ever seen|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@d last trainish for slam?|pg||
nt|dinos1: needs special hand - @hQxxxx @dA and @sxx for slam to be on fin|pg||
nt|lc: Still, I agree that 4@C too big a bid.  Don't look for magic.  Pard never has it.|pg||
nt|kit: I like the last train bid -- he has 5 good hearts and maybe some diamond help.  He could be a lot worse.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lc: He sure could be worse -- see my 1st example above! :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: does the 2@c bid by E ensure that N does not have the 3 3 2 5 hand?|pg||
nt|drewsky: When east bids 2@C, the chances that north has only 3 hearts goes way way down|pg||
nt|lc: Well, even after 2@C, North could have  @Sxxx @HJxx @Dxxx !xxxx.  Anyway, sorry to be so morbid.|pg||
nt|kit: sure, North could have the 3-3-2-5 hand.  But that's not the way to bet.   Clear to drive to game with South hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might bid 1@d with that Larry|pg||
nt|lc: L-W play S.P at T1 -- so the @C10 shows @S liking.|pg||
nt|kit: With the South hand, you just don't invite and give partner an impossible problem|pg||
nt|drewsky: yes hedy with 3-3 in the reds, safer to bid 1@D over the double|pg||
nt|lc: Even playing "Std" signals, this should prob be a S.P. situation.|pg||
nt|lc: You would think a @S would be jumping out of Levin's hand -- for every possible reason.  I wonder what he is considering.|pg||
nt|drewsky: he is considering a stiff @C in partners hand....|pg||
nt|kit: Levin will surely shift to a spade -- he is deciding which spade to shift to I think.|pg||
nt|lc: If North's 4@D indeed showed "something" it is hard to imagine beating this from Levin's perspective.|pg||
nt|kit: If he had 9xx the 9 would be automatic as partner might have KJ10x.  But the 8 can't be high enough to hold the trick if declarer has 3|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|s8|nt|passell: hard to imagine anything but a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: grue asked if s.p at t1, levin said yes, so ... now grue is in the tank wondering why @S didn't come back faster|pg||

nt|chilloncan: some would be uncomfortable opening 2C with stiff king and short spades, but at these colors opps are just going to let you bid. if opps NV, 2C  risks obstruction|pg||

nt|lc: Meanwhile, the @C are "frozen" -- which means the defense can't profitably set up the second @C trick -- so in time, the 2nd @C loser might go on the @H.|pg||
nt|kit: if he rides 9 of diamonds and loses to 10, he won't have time for double heart finesse|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps North had to attack clubs|pg||
nt|dinos1: u need exactly @dA7 for 1 looser|pg||
nt|kit: the clubs are not frozen|pg||

nt|ritong: heh|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, distracted here, sorry, and am leaving you in more capable hands now...|pg||
mc|8|nt|hedyg: are you leaving Patty?|pg||
nt|chorush: not sure why Cheek played the diamond J; had Grue covered the heart 9 declarer would have been marooned in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: not that awkward with trumps 2-2 and the @DA short anyway|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|mrdct: so grue wins an imp|pg||
nt|mrdct: personally - i'm not a great fan of the trend to "evenings off" and prefer to be able to sleep-in|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mrdct: -1100 in the other room will be costly for Kang|pg||
nt|mrdct: can't see it gaining imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: All we've asked is that the Sunday start not be more than an hour earlier than the Saturday start - started today at 1:00 and 8:00, but tomorrow is scheduled for 11 am|pg||
nt|chilloncan: probably another underdog-unfriendly deal|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nicely put, DAvid|pg||
nt|pelepele: tough for players as well !|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Ish is playing very slowly today, because he's sick - this room is (too me) quite warm, but he's huddled in a hooded sweatshirt|pg||
nt|rodal f: But as often before. A tell B if u open the bid.|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence aren't organizing a diamond ruff even if declarer had to play diamonds before drawing trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: ish did not throw a heart on the last @d|pg||
nt|barnets: but dec did not know all that |pg||
nt|athene: no, sure|pg||
nt|barnets: tand would have taken some time in the play|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: I fronted him some Umcka...if his team wins, i expect to be in the closing credits as medical provider|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's not hurting his game any|pg||
nt|mrdct: the wounded bull gets stronger|pg||
nt|chilloncan: michaels, then INV + spade raise i reckon|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: so webby is this a hand where you can't afford to defend 4@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@s not a bad contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: forthright bidding from Joe Grue at the other table pushed his opponents to the three level|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tejjyid: No, Simon was taking about wilder hands, and the 5/6 level as well|pg||
nt|dburn: why should they go down in their seven-card fit when we can go down in ours?|pg||
nt|dburn: where he beat them a trick, which is a good result|pg||
nt|athene: will north find a club shift? only really good when partner has exactly Qxx - doesn't look likely|pg||
nt|athene: declarer leads a diamond to the king and ace and then ducks one, perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chilloncan: not sure about 4H by S. give LHO a chance to bid 3S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: South is very flat|pg||
nt|barnets: yes he chose 1N rather than X at his first bid and then doubled 2@D for takeout|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: mind you, maybe 2@h wasn't actually going down - cards lying quite well for it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct: but hard to deal with the 4-1 break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: stuck his neck out but EW failed to chop it off|pg||
nt|frankaus: 1100 in the bank will give Grue some change here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mrdct: not enough entries to effect a trump coup|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the real world you're going to have played the Ace and King of trumps before you find out one is necessary - at which point you're already down|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: south can signal for the club now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|chilloncan: u know 4S is coming, so either bid 5H or pass|pg||
nt|mrdct: F 164-118 in the other semi|pg||
nt|athene: @S7, @S8|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: lots of subtle opprtunities for suit-preference signals|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mrdct: with that 3rd round of @c declarer can pick up the trumps now|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the @CK would have worked better|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than a low one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: this is OK - the king would, in theory at any rate, have let the contract through|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|nt|athene: now north has to ask for a club|pg||
nt|dburn: true, declarer would probably have ducked it|pg||
nt|barnets: yes as north has the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C and =|pg||
nt|barnets: I missed that|pg||
nt|athene: EW seem to play support doubles only in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: they seem just as useful in diamonds, i would have said|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, that @h4 might not look all that high to Martel|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrdct: 17 imps swing between making this and going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: S asking W questions about leads|pg||
nt|mwigor: defense is hard - getting the @cQ ruffed could have been crucial on other layouts|pg||
nt|mwigor: on this layout it has given declarer a chance when in practice he had none|pg||
nt|mrdct: like swpa the @S7 & 6|pg||
nt|mrdct: swap|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: maybe east decided that with those majors and only @Dxxx he preferred 1nt even with a support redouble available|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: high enough, combined with the earlier @c5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: the money moment|pg||
nt|mrdct: these are the sorts of decisions that teams leading 144-86 tend to get right|pg||
nt|mwigor: would JJ have seen the need to ruff with @s9 holding 9xx of trumps?|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats what this comes down to in a way|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed - a useful clue for south|pg||
nt|mrdct: although the auto-pilot practice in that situation is to ruff high|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: he just has to cover that @H9 now :)|pg||
nt|dburn: this has been an impressive show from Martel and Stansby, who have had to find a lot of tough defences|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|dburn: and who haven't once let their side down|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|drewsky: I though steve raon the nine of @D ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: he led it but didnt run it|pg||
nt|hedyg: he started to|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: clear king of spades lead IMO.  King doubleton lead is much underrated|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|lc: Thanks all -- leaving you all in many capable hands  :)   Enjoy the match.|pg||

nt|kit: I don't like this defense at all --would duck heart, and when in shift to club.  |pg||
nt|algraves:  bye Larry|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea being that the preempter less likely holds @s A|pg||
nt|drewsky: 3@H is cold now if south can see the position|pg||
nt|dinos1: now only @cJ and @d back while pd has trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|algraves:  well he may have thought declarer has 7 @H and his partner a Singleton @S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|algraves:  and then he needs to win A of @H and play @S and @s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|algraves:  and partner has two more tricks |pg||

nt|chilloncan: this S collection will have to do until a good hand comes along|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 6H by S tha target|pg||
nt|dburn: 3 to Fleisher for saving a trick|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: finesse heart THEN throw north in|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: NS use 2@h as the negative|pg||
nt|chilloncan: but play a bit tricky|pg||
nt|mrdct: this make on a @C lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: do I hear female vocals ?|pg||
nt|barnets: so 3 imps to fleisher on last board|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct: so @h will be wrong-sided|pg||
nt|dburn: and a game for which East-West don't have the high-card values, but the distribution is fine|pg||
nt|dburn: sometimes, games like that get doubled|pg||
nt|barnets: 8-7 this quarter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: missed a pass there i think operator|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3rd 20-20er at this segment.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3 loosers but winners?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn: Cheek had no reason to double it because Grue didn't open the North hand|pg||
nt|chorush: Potential big swing to Fleisher as 4S requires guessing the spades and then some. I don't think it will be reached here|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: cant speak to that|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 49 imps, 6 boards....|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat atypical 3@h opening from Cheek, which didn't work so well this time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|mrdct: west thinking of raising?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mwigor: play in 6@h is fairly simple - if they lead a spade you go down - if they dont you make|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not really so simple i think|pg||
nt|mrdct: yeah - can ruff a @C high back to hand|pg||
nt|chilloncan: u have to get to dummy to draw last heart|pg||
nt|mwigor: well its your hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: from South 6@h is cold|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfh: E didn't realize it was his lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry my computer is very slow so big delay in my comments hitting the screen|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Wonder how 4@S runned in. @HA and K hooked?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: still, you'd prefer to go down two than one, since it means the opponents won't make two|pg||
nt|athene: it looks as though NS in the other room play pretty weak weak-twos (board 21 for insteance where they opened 1@H rather than 2@H as in this room)|pg||
nt|dburn: but Martel can in fact make two, if he reads it|pg||
nt|athene: pairs who play like that often open 3 on pure 6-4 hands|pg||
nt|athene: just because they have too much playing strength for 2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|dburn: crafty stuff from Amoils, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...hard for del Monte to put in the ten|pg||
nt|athene: he's pretending he has a singleton diamond?|pg||
nt|chorush: It's a good play. Spade Q and another is hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: ace, diamond back, declarer ducks|pg||
nt|dburn: which he'd better do, if he wants his trump promotion|pg||
nt|dburn: still, ace and another might work if declarer does not read the situation|pg||
nt|athene: usually a big pause like this tells declarer what is going on|pg||
nt|athene: but here, west might be thinking with @DAQ10xx|pg||
nt|dburn: weird - Martel could probably have made it anyway if he had put up the jack of diamonds, but no one except a computer would do that|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gambit: wel|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|mrdct: we are likely to see Ish Del'MOnte in action again on BBO next weekend for the Australian Open Team playoffs where his team will probably start favourites|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: quality warm up|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|barnets: in the other room east also shifted to a low @D and then scored his @D Q|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: to set 3 @H by two tricks|pg||
nt|athene: that was all very strange|pg||
nt|barnets: that was 6deserved imps|pg||
nt|barnets: to fleisher|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what del Monte was about there - he had seen enough of South's points by then|pg||

nt|athene: it does sort of show the drawback of doing weird things in defrence|pg||
nt|athene: in defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn: North-South's turn to make a game on no points|pg||
nt|dburn: this one vulnerable, moreover|pg||
nt|rodal f: Interesting hand NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: only double dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: pre-balancing time|pg||
nt|gambit: maybe EW will steal one back |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mrdct: 4@s a phantom in the open room|pg||
nt|mrdct: east here deciding to pursue an inviational sort of auction it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 3S by E is an attractive alternative. sometimes they now have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|chilloncan: at these colors, i think that is the wrong strategy|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: but not for Kamil, and I don't blame him|pg||
nt|rodal f: W opened 1NT at OR. P - P - 2@D|pg||
nt|barnets: nice slam bid here|pg||
nt|athene: you get partner confused and rattled and even if he "should" work out what is going on, he often doesn't|pg||
nt|barnets: by grue- cheek|pg||
nt|barnets: norh opening 1NT|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - Grue and Cheek have been pretty accurate in the slam-bidding department|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: stansby made 4@sX on this hand a short time ago to give Flieisher a 119-103 lead in tghe other semi|pg||
nt|chilloncan: ish maybe gagging to bid, fearing larceny at the colours|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: reluctant pass from N|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzfh: still shaking his head|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bonsoir henri & hi bill|pg||
nt|mrdct: a glimmer of hope for Kang|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Ish asks about the lead - 3rd and low|pg||
nt|chorush: 6 hearts is the "wrong" slam since it is potentially beatable on a diamond lead. Six spades a little better|pg||
nt|athene: maybe transfer then 4@S was a quantitative invitation|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a great slam by North and a pretty good slam by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and 6@h by North was a lot better than 6@h by South|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mrdct: still 20 boards to go in this match so if kang can string 2 or 3 good boards togther they will be right back in this match|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is a non serious slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|barnets: that means if you are great I am suitable|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chilloncan: they havent really been taking the fight to the opponenets too much in this room, but maybe just not enbough to work with|pg||
nt|barnets: but I am not great|pg||
nt|chorush: Well when Martel cues Stansby will know HE is serious|pg||
nt|barnets: myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: The steal was in the OR, Kamil can't pre-balance on that rat bag |pg||
mb|4N|nt|gambit: I say that to my girlfriends...doesn't work too oftern |pg||
nt|dburn: Martel probably has enough to get his side to slam once North makes any kind of try|pg||
nt|athene: will partel put it in spades to protect the diamonds?|pg||
nt|dburn: and may well choose spades to protect whatever diamonds Stansby has|pg||
nt|chorush: probably a 6 key card situation for them|pg||
nt|athene: martel|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|barnets: had north cued 4@D instead of 3N that would show a powerfull slam try|pg||
nt|barnets: this is an important convention|pg||
nt|barnets: to play when both north and south hav unlimited hands|pg||
nt|barnets: and can give each other infrormation|pg||
nt|dburn: Martel probably knows enough - with @sK, @hAK, @dA North would have made a serious try|pg||
nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|chorush: Martel may be influenced by the great heart spots and the fact that there was no double of 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|gambit: and he knows how many key cards they own|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would expect he's thinking about where to place the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess it can't hurt to ask for the king of hearts, just in case North was being frivolous when he should have been being serious|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S by south was a cue bid showing the !o those specs asking|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA|pg||
nt|chorush: They play a number of 6 key card auctions so 7 is not an issue|pg||
nt|warrens:  if it's double Key-card, there's a potential @H ruff if partner has KJxxx, Kxx, AKx, xx|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course this really is six-ace Blackwood, in which case Martel is indeed only thinking of what suit to play, not what level|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry misread that|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S was setting the suit off course|pg||
nt|kit: clearly grand not in the picture -- he is deciding whether 4-1 spade split vs. protecting diamond holding more important|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he could bid something to ask Stansby what he thinks about it all, but North doesn't know that South holds real support rather than just a control|pg||
nt|gambit: is 5NT here pick a slam?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|chorush: I wonder if he has any way to solicit Stansby's opinion?|pg||
nt|athene: when you raise two suits like this it's easy to have misunderstandings|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: Ish asking about spot card leads in the middle of the hand - some communication problem, but Kang finally says that it's 3rd and low there too|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@S could be a cue for hearts OR setting spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: well, he has gone with hearts, and his own heart may skip a beat if del Monte leads a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see why it "logically" should be one or the other without discussion|pg||
nt|chorush: and he could go set on a diamond lead, but i am betting he will take into account the lack of a double of 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: well done West - not that it matters here, but it never hurts to worry the opponents|pg||

nt|vugraphzfh: Ish asks about discards: "standard"|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H can make with spades 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: also|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - that's why 6@h by North really was the ideal spot, so an extra well done to Grue and Cheek for finding it|pg||

mb|1N!|an|F|nt|mrdct: NS got the best result possible in the open room|pg||

nt|dburn: no - he has to use a transfer-like mechanism instead|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: or bid it, knowing opps will|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@c looks perfectly OK to me|pg||

nt|gambit: can he bid 2H with AKX? Is that something special?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Don't N have a auto X now? But there system|pg||

nt|gambit: EW awfully busy this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway 6@H was almost 75 percent |pg||

mb|3D|nt|mrdct: 4@sx in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: well, I guess he won an IMP anyway, but...|pg||

nt|dburn: decent enough spot on the bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: lets see, what trump shall I lead:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|barnets: he has one club trick and 2 heart tricks so 7 trump tricks will see him home|pg||

nt|mcphee: rusinow lead just for trumps:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|dburn: curious symmetry about this - the other semi-final is over, and Fleisher has a lead of 41 IMPs|pg||

nt|mrdct: oddly the scoreline in the other semi is exactly the same as this one|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, the third quarter is over|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|chorush: I'm wondering if 3 rounds of hearts will lead to down 5 for 1100?|pg||
nt|dburn: I think declarer is OK if he guesses clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: that is, if you can call minus 800 OK|pg||

nt|rodal f: @CJ?|pg||
nt|mcphee: another @H not so bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: sorry lost N pitch on 3rd @D|pg||
nt|chorush: GIB is saying down 4 regardless, but GIB knows wheere all the cards are. I think a heart might lead to down 5 in reality|pg||
nt|dburn: GIB would ruff in East. play a club to the king, a spade to the king, and duck a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: ouch|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure he can make it from here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chorush: yes, that is true. but would declarer?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: another practise squeeze|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: then, it would ruff out North's @sA and make seven tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer, on the other hand...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...is in the other hand, so to speak|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might right Ira but if a @H u will play @CA an slipp next for 800|pg||
nt|dburn: and now he really will go down five|pg||
nt|chorush: GIB has now changed his/her mind and says down 5|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, declarer still has to negotiate the club suit, else GIB may soon be predicting down six|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful David!|pg||

nt|007 joosth: 11 easy tricks here as soon as the 2 aces are known?|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
