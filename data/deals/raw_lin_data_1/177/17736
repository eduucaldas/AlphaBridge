nt|sybarra: maybe afraid to risk the cashing of clubs and a ruff, then back to dummy with a trump |pg||

nt|athene: the opening lead told Helgemo that west had an awful hand to lead from|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|mc|9|nt|athene: so he can put him with the aces in spades and diamonds almost for sure|pg||

nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: one problem with bypassing better diamonds as a passed hand is you can be left to play in your major|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but pard should have 3 |pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: i prefer to rebid 1nt unless it's definitely subminimum, but easy to see why Helness let that one go|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another "not fun" hand to find return|pg||
nt|athene: might try something cute like the @SQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: that might work |pg||
nt|athene: a would-be deschapelles coup|pg||
nt|athene: trying to force an entry to partner's hand for a diamond ruff or two|pg||
nt|athene: but it's a bit of a shot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: "a bit" is understatement perhaps|pg||

nt|sybarra: making 4 should be pretty good |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 1.  smirnov  piekarek|pg||
nt|athene: with trump control, he could duck a club and arrange to win the @D7 last, but i guess he is not concerned with such frivolity :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 2. levin weinstein|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 3. stewart  woolsey|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 4. lev  pepsi|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfa: 5. kalita  gawrys|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S not a specially strong bid - east had 3@C or 3@D available for a real raise|pg||
nt|scotty: THAT is not a "major suit transfer"|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzfa: last board of this first session, we will be back with session 2 in  80 minutes from now|pg||

nt|athene: NS are leading low from doubletons these days?|pg||
mc|8|nt|sybarra: and that was last hand of this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Catalina our great operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Bill for joining in here |pg||
nt|athene: Helness didn't want to lose a tempo with top diamond lead if it turned out there was a void around somewhere i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: :)|pg||
nt|athene: it's a question of maximising the penalty there rather than cashing out to try to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably dinner break in Vegas |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: small break|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok  cu then :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: just enough for a quick bite |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 75 minutes 4:00pm Pacific|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably quick nibble and good dinner later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Bathurst/Lall vs Greco Hampson |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: And Multon/Zimmermann vs Bessis Bessis|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: David Stern here any questions?|pg||
