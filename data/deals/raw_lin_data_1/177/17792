pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
mc|12|nt|pelu: Levin-Weinstein bid the slam almost same way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: A good treatment to use over (1@C)-2@C/2@D showing both majors is to use 3@C as invitational or better in hearts and 3@D as invitational or better in spades, with 2NT showing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: diamonds|pg||

nt|pelu: 11 + 10 = partscore not game :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: seems like swedes doubled the wrong board|pg||
nt|pelu: @D back - but the @S-loser can go on @CK|pg||

nt|vugraphzfp: as South, doubled 1@S and as a result Helgemo could downgrade the @CK to bid 2@H|pg||
mc|8|nt|pelu: sh only be down 1 - Take @DA - then 2x@h and discard 3 @ds|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well. regardless to the 550 out this must have been a great round for Fredin/Wrang|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@H dont give many IMPs|pg||
nt|mikael_w: I think it will. I also think there is a risk some pair might be close to bidding the grand wich is cold|pg||
nt|pelu: comperere with Weinstein: +3 IMP :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: there you see :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and if east diddnt open 1@c and instead opened 3 or 4 @c it will make it really tricky to get to exactry 6 I think|pg||
nt|pelu: u have a point - but too strong to open 3@c|pg||
nt|pelu: but a presicion 2@C could do the work|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, to strong for 3@c and you dont really want to past 3 nt with 4 @c. so I guess 1@c will be the most comon|pg||
nt|pelu: ok my bet: 18 tables - 13+ will bid 6@H :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hehe, ok. I think you are close. But I have to say 11-12 then, to make it intresting :)|pg||
nt|pelu: a coke ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: if you just change S:s hand to x,xx i minors instead of xx,x grand would be a REALLY good contract|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ok, but make it a diet coce :) |pg||
nt|pelu: oh u are on Rolands "team" :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: :) I am a diabetic |pg||
nt|mikael_w: But Fredins nose has taking him to where he is today, so I guess he diddnt have a clod today :) And I know you Peter knows about that nose too :)|pg||
nt|pelu: time for lunch-break after every 4 boards :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Next line-ups for Round 18: Cohen-Smith vs Jansma-Jan Paulissen, Brogeland-Wentin vs Piekarek-Smirnov, and Bertens-Mohan vs Hammon-Mahmood|pg||
