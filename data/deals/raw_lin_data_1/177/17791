nt|jbgood: some play a 4 level splinter as void showing - not helgeness|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer may get hearts right here, since he might just play for 3-2 trumps and diamonds not too foul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am being asked (harassed) why no Italians. The Yeh Cup this year was two weeks ago and there are two large tourneys this weekend in Europe and Last Weekend Spring Fours in London|pg||
mb|4H!|an|Reluctantly|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: South will probably lead a high club and shift to a spade...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfb: That lead will blueprint the diamond suit a bit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told and.. the Italian first league on last weekend, too|pg||
nt|scotty: That's a surprising lead.|pg||
nt|caitlin2: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin2: expecting a ruff???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: elness being kibbitzed by his son|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Suit preference at trick 1 and standard count says Levin|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|scotty: Declarer hopes defenders will do something helpful...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told Fredrik|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Is Helness' son's name|pg||
nt|scotty: I have to believe that Levin thinks his partner has the stiff @d, not declarer|pg||

nt|scotty: Good play by South overtaking...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am also told ....Tor has played bridge with him the last year and he is promesing|pg||
nt|jbgood: you are right on all accounts, David|pg||
nt|scotty: not only prevents partner from masking a mistake, but also surrounds @s8 in case partner has @sQ76|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am ALSO told Helness son is an exelent poker player too :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|caitlin2: that's what it takes for juniors-such mentoring|pg||

mb|2D|an|Majors|nt|scotty: Helnesses play was cold if trumps 3-2, unless S led from Q fifth or sixth of @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfb: How bad is 6@H here|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfb: I see it is cold but how good a contract -- pretty good it seems to me|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: Levin agreed, David|pg||
nt|warrens:  did 3@H show extras?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK everybody I can see it is cold by setting up diamonds - I know I look dumb but....|pg||
nt|scotty: Very good job getting to slam - I guess 3@h told North what he needed to know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Stevie did alert 3@H so suspect it showed extras|pg||

mc|12|nt|scotty: North may have suspected his partner's stiff was in @d, since he had so many more @d than @c.  even with opponents bidding, they didn't have to have 11 of them|pg||
nt|scotty: In the play, it's usually good technique to start the side suit immediately|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: East wouldn't mind bidding 5@C - if it were exclusion for @d!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfb: That lead may cost the overtrick|pg||
nt|scotty: Of course, slam is not good - the finesses all rate to lose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK next matchups on VG are Cohen Smith vs Jansma Paulissen|pg||
mc|12|nt|Vugraphzfb: Brogeland Ventin vs Piekarek Smirnov|pg||

nt|scotty: East may have been planning an invitational 3@h, but changed his mind after South's double....|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|scotty: The @cK was more likely to be badly placed, and trumps were more likely to break badly|pg||

nt|scotty: We can see that best defense was to lead trump, but it's not so clear when only looking at one or two hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Declarer could then win trump in hand and run the @SQ perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wesintein may feel he needs to attackk spades now|pg||
nt|scotty: Even on an initial trymp lead, declarer will succeed if he starts by ducking a @d, which knocks out north's entry to ever play a 3rd trump|pg||
