mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: With a void in partner's suit and a 10-count, Larsen could not care less what type of 4@S raise his partner has.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: does declarer have any other option than the heart ruffing finesse if in 6?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: A trump lead is a bit unusual on this auction, with a threatened side suit (hearts) in the dummy.  More normal to attack in some other suit. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|jbennet: it lookes straight forward now for 12 tricks. |pg||

nt|brolucius: It is just possible that West might miss a slam by responding 4@H. Against that, he reduces the chance of North coming into the auction.|pg||
nt|jbgood: i dont think Broge would bid 4@h with a regular partner|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brolucius: No, a bit risky.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: No way the bid can be misunderstood by any partner...|pg||

nt|brolucius: "I couldn't. We were vulnerable..."  |pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Hurray.|pg||
nt|jbennet: north elected to pass and which this time might have been an 8-IMP:s losing decision. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Easy raise to 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Seems that North was tempted to raise.|pg||
nt|jbennet: on the previous hand 5d only -1. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: east had a perfect hand for the useful gadget.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 3NT.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbennet: FIRST trsfer to enemys opening suit then bid 3 NT.  (showing a raise to 3NT with short hearts)|pg||
nt|jbgood: - di to the king, and then play on spades:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can lose one heart (on a hold-up), two diamonds and one spade.|pg||
nt|jbgood: even makable|pg||
nt|mslair: everything works on this layout|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - even 2 di loseres|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Brogeland goes down, Jon and I will buy every kibitzer a drink.|pg||
nt|mslair: it's un-downable:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am receiving many drink orders. No faith in Brogeland.|pg||
nt|mslair: best chance is to play dia ace and continue heart|pg||

pc|s5|nt|jbgood: he really went for my (double dummy) line? That is Broge - he just does what he thinks is right in the moment|pg||
nt|brolucius: He respects your analysis...|pg||
nt|jbgood: he is much better than me on analysis...|pg||

nt|brolucius: Well, I will put my credit card back in my wallet. Well played. |pg||
nt|mslair: you guys should have got your free drink out of that line|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mslair: but very good daily bulletin material|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to get into the bulletin than to find the best line.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction in other room     how close is North to DBL on 2nd round?|pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing we tend to forget is that S might have had a singleton di Q|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mslair: yes  and more importantly as you start reaching old age|pg||
nt|jbgood: then we would call it brilliant!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer thinks we have had too much excitement and must now watch a 1@S contract. Who are we to question his judgement?|pg||
nt|mslair: not I for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ROUND 5 Open: Multon-Zimmermann vs Bramley-Welland |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Closed: Elinescu-Wladow vs Rogoff-Verhees|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mslair: stiff queen of diamonds was the best angle of his play|pg||
nt|brolucius: One thing is for sure... a 1@S contract will not make the daily bulletin.|pg||
