mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well, I don't understand that. The Bessis pair (father and son) twice failed to open a weak two-bid when I last watched them, because they are playing strong twos. But here he does ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not open 2@S. |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would seem to be the right bid, rather than 2@C. |pg||

nt|scotty: Are you certain they play strong twos?  Maybe they play 2M as some other convention?|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@D pretty easily assuming 3-2 @S and 3-2 @D|pg||

pc|sT|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|scotty: Quantin just told me 2@h strong, 2@s weak|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now I am told that they use 2@H to show a different range (not anything like 6-10) and a six-card suit. Well, it seems that this is a risk when the rest of the field will have a ...|pg||

pc|h6|mc|11|nt|brolucius: If I played in a pairs event and an unknown pair arrived at my table, telling me they played 2@H strong and 2@S weak, I would think that it was a good chance to add two tops to my ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: score-card. A most unusual method. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Again..... South passes!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I really dislike that method. Three times in one Saturday afternoon, with the pairs changing every round, I have seen them have to pass a weak-two.|pg||
nt|scotty: I would not open a weak 2@h with South hand - it is much too favorable for playing in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: You would surely open 1@H in that case?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: It does not seem to be good bridge to pass such a hand, but what do I know?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|scotty: No, I would pass.  Unlike some experts, I have no feeling that "pass" is a dirty word|pg||

nt|brolucius: How can players open 9-loser 11-counts, causing me to gasp, and then pass a decent hand with six respectable hearts? That seems to turn the world on its head. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||

nt|brolucius: It went 2@H - 4@H at the Wolpert table, I am told.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|scotty: True - it's just a question of who is being "robbed".  When I have the majors, an average hand, and my RHO has passed, whose hand does it rate to be?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|jbennet: the books says that its only with 24-27 Points one should look for 44 major games. but with extra points (like 28 or more bid 3 NT|pg||

nt|brolucius: On this auction there is a strong bias towards the major suits, for the defenders. It may seem strange when responder has used Stayman.  However, when you are on lead you should ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not be afraid that LHO has a major. Worry more than RHO wil be good in the minors. |pg||

nt|brolucius: Neither defender could retain a heart guard.|pg||
nt|scotty: Actually Victor Silverstone  saw it - I was too busy arguing with you about preempts|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: My only advice on pre-empts is: do it!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: My advice is "do it sometimes"|pg||
