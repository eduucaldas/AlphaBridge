mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: West's double is fine, as I see it, but not classical on that shape.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Few other players will pass on the East cards.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Standings after two sessions are Piekarek-Smirnov, Levin Weinstein about 200 Cavendish imps behind, Grue-Moss another 30 imps back, Jansma a further 85 imps behind|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Possible diamond ruff if declarer takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Cavendish imps are about 17 "real" imps each, so the fifference between first and second is about a vulnerable game swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the defenders played on diamonds, setting up a ruffing potential, declarer would have to play ace and another trump rather than finessing. |pg||

nt|jbennet: well judged by north and surely odds-on. p had minimum + a waste value in hearts ; yet 4 sp have good chances|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hard to understand why anyone would not pre-empt on the East hand, particularly when NV. Surely they have a weak two available?|pg||

nt|henryb:  and in spades?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: Weak two-bids are much more common than strong 2s, of course.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|jbennet: weak 2 hadnt helped (north had an easy take out over heart bids)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  Obviously E-W do not play Michaels either|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Another weak 2 bites the dust.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|henryb:  or at least 2@d Michaels and 2@c natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|jbennet: good 5 club bid route open for extracting the max panalty should NS save|pg||
nt|henryb:  now he has to judge to lead a spade and not a club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|jbennet: but it also pinopointed the spade lead. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbennet: however east didnt draw the inferences from the bidding. 5 clubs is huge favourite to have been made to show void.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|henryb:  Note that a @d lead will also beat 5@h|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Helness's 5@C appears to have been a lead-directing bid in case they went to 5@S.|pg||
pg||

nt|henryb:  Sorry, does not if declarer preserves the @hQ in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: North's hand was once described as a 3rd-in-hand opening. Nowadays most players would open it in any seat. However, if you play Michaels, it is a good option to pass and then hope ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: to show the two-suiter with a Michaels bid.|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5 clubs was in theory a good bid, but it also had the devastating effect (or at least should have) of telling east the best lead|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Good point, Johann!|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S now in trouble|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|brolucius: 2@C is an unusual move on that hand. It is not as if it was taking away any bidding space. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  The Bessis play defensive methods I do not understand|pg||

pc|d6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer suggests that North might have passed 2@C, rather than introduce hearts (which are almost certainly held over North). Interesting point.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: just a reminder, we will be closing and re opeening after each rd|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes 2 h was a odds against; i have tolerance for a club contract; + minimum opening.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: tolerance for clubs weak suits if his own minimum opening.|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W here have to get to 5@D, which is not easy (particularly when you start 1NT - 3NT).|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@c would also succeed although much scarier|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Having said that, East had an obvious raise to 3NT on his ace-less hand. |pg||
mc|8|nt|jbennet: this again shows that the philosophy let them find a lead!" loses over time.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if east had the possibilty to show both minors and 22 majors.|pg||
nt|henryb:  the problem is our reduced standards: in the old days Goren and Culbertson told us no worthless doubletons|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's the sort of deal that they give in a Bidding Challenge in Bridge Magazine and Bridge World. The competitors think '3NT can't be right or they wouldn't have given it to us. I'l ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: try the effect of bidding round the houses'.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: ill leave the room open, we will be back soon, still 10 min in the clock|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: coffe time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: next round we will have grue moss  vs   hamman zia|pg||
nt|brolucius: If the bidding starts 1@D - 2@D (inverted), then you have a chance of detecting that there is no spade stopper.|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is a famous play called 'Waiting for Godot'. We are all 'Waiting for Zia'.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see (if there is a web-site providing such details) how many pairs manage to find 5@D on the last deal.  The French auction was absolutely standard, but ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: unsuccessful (as we saw).|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Weak notrumpers  1@D  3@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but weak notrumps are a dying breed. They are all scared to play such methods after hearing your views on the matter, Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: closing will be right back with the next round|pg||
