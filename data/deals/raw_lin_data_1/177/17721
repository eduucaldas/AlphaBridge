nt|brolucius: He held only @DA-x-x.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Committed overbidders would always get to a slam here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: East should now describe WHY he is bidding 4@H.|pg||
nt|scotty: It's usually tougher to get to slam after they open, but here the slamis good BECAUSE they opened|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: live web cam and all the info  http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can bid 2NT to show a 4-card raise in some partnerships. Here he simply bids 2@S to show a high-card raise to at least 3@H.|pg||
nt|scotty: East can visualize @sa now - he should want to try for slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4-0 trump break will make it difficult to ruff a club, after a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|scotty: If a diamond finesse is needed, it will almost certainly be on|pg||
nt|brolucius: North may lead a spade anyway.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S agreed hearts, so East is free now to cue-bid a minor.|pg||
nt|po-s: unlikely after 2sp undoubled and 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: True, but the other two suits are hardly attractive leads.|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: The risk is that West has someting like QJx, AQJxx, Kx, Jxx - and even 4@h would fail.  But since he's not going to pass 3N anyway, he may as well try for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: east already has the 6h bid out of the box|pg||
mb|4N|nt|brolucius: It will be a fine effort if they do reach the slam after the opening bid by North.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well done! They are over the first hurdle. But a diamond lead might be awkward.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: North had no reason to place his partner with anything, when they bid a slam, so he had no chance of finding a diamond lead, really.|pg||

nt|scotty: It will be interesting to see if any pair reaches slam after S responds 1N (as i would)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: Did you think it could be made on a diamond lead, Michael?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|po-s: yes David - we just said that|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: On the slam hand, everyone was mentioned a black-suit squeeze on North (after a diamond lead). A simple squeeze could not be arranged, because if you duck a club to rectify the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: count, North could win and kill the club threat with a club return. So, you play your red-suit winners to catch North in a squeeze without the count. He has to bare the @CA to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: retain his spade guard and you then duck a club to the bare ace, setting up your @CK.|pg||

nt|scotty: At some tables, East may intervene over a 1@S opening - but even then reaching slam looks pretty normal...|pg||
nt|brolucius: A friend of mine, Marc Smith, once opened 1NT with a 6-card spade suit. His partner responded with a 2@H transfer bid and he broke the transfer by rebidding 4@S!|pg||
nt|scotty: When they miss slam against you here, that's the kind of result that really helps in winning this event - you have to be in the right place at the right time|pg||
