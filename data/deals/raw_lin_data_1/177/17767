nt|rv: Pramod, any idea about the no of the teams and current standings?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3N by E the best spot|pg||
nt|raghavan: contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: CABAL team is sponsored by Gadgil, Poddar developers by Dipak Poddar|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|subhranp: this could see action from all 4 hands|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: 2@d should be single-suiter major|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, apparently so  2@h does not look correct, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Other room same contract |pg||
pc|d2|nt|subhranp: North has 2 diamond entries so a spade lead would take this down|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|ritong: but neither south nor west were finished|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|raghavan: he will continue D I hope|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: so we land in the spot andy predicted|pg||
nt|rv: yes I might have bid 2@s as playable upto 3@h or even 2n as game try which could be a bit of stretch|pg||

nt|rv: Poddar developers qualified for R64 in Rosenblum at Philly, lost narrowly to 7th seeds Gromov-Russian national team|pg||
nt|rv: I believe there are only 5 teams, every team has a bye and will play only 48 brds which is norm for senior events|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: NEXT match live, AZURE VS INDIABLUES in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|raghavan: a slam hand for Azure - will they bid|pg||
nt|raghavan: once bid - makes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|subhranp: last board here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rv: Teams in Open events typically play 60brds in a day|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: agarwal fell in love with his @c ace|pg||
nt|raghavan: may come a jump in Spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2n is an overbid here, I might have raised to 3@c with West hand though only doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|rv: I won't pass with Agarwal's hand, would raise to 3@c even with doubleton|pg||
nt|ritong: sridhar has good reasons to think this will not be a picnic and proposes to play for higher stakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have a lot of work just to get to 8 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  this will help|pg||
nt|rv: Sridhar sitting South should not be confused with P.Sridhar who plays for Texan Aces, this is R.Sridharan based out of Dombivili, Mumbai|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: helpul, though reasonable lead by North|pg||
nt|subhranp: Many kibs asking if North is Subhash Gupta. RV confirms it is him.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this will definitely help|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: this might improve declarer's prospects tremendously|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 9 tricks come home|pg||
nt|rv: maybe even OTs if South fails to find @s switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has run out of suits... has to lead @s eventually|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 9@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  W still have to be concerned with location of A@s|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ritong: has he? south has doubled|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a major concern, Henri:)|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly he did not like the sound of the auction, but still needs one or two good cards to take charge that way|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|raghavan: well on road to making 7|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: yes, Subhash Gupta who played Indian Open trials with Formidables playing here for Blues|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: for that matter, north could shift to a @s at trick 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  but this can't be the right way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: if he had won Indian Open trials, he would not have played this event|pg||
