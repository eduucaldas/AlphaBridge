nt|Walddk2: Trondheim is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. With a population of about 175,000, it is the third most populous municipality and city in the country|pg||
nt|psridhar: IMP scoring right?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like whoever gets to 1N first here will buy the contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think MP. TorO?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztc: yes. MP|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: OK so every trick counts|pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 ! much better form of the game |pg||
mb|2D!|an|!d+!H|nt|pjs_ch: pairs competition - match points|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|pjs_ch: might be that 2@D shows diamonds and a higher suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D is probably Nilsland's Defence to 1NTX, weak with diamonds and hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Interesting start|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did 2@S come from?|pg||
nt|vugraphztc: West|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2nd X was a stretch and 2@S sheer imagination |pg||
nt|pjs_ch: most contracts above 2@H were probably going off|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: even undoubled this will score poorly for EW|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|pjs_ch: South needs to duck to cut off the spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, upside-down attitude, standard count, is 'standard' in Norway|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ah ok|pg||
nt|psridhar: unlike Cavendish movement which Roland is used to by now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we do not shut down after every round of 4 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because they are not paranoid in Norway|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes thats good -i dont see why they shut after every mini round|pg||

nt|psridhar: EW had them for d1 in 1N|pg||
nt|psridhar: found the difficult part of defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: not sure many will play @d contracts on that one|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 3@D clearly better but hard to complain about the NS bidding|pg||
nt|psridhar: at many tables bidding will go 1s-p-1n-X- now NS will  find @D partial|pg||
nt|jbgood: do we have a result page, TorO?|pg||
