mb|2C!|an|NAT|nt|robinswr: could also be strong two|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like 3@C was Puppet Stayman    3N said  was looking for 5-3 major|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: passing the redouble could be a penalty pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would play it as such|pg||

nt|robinswr: partnership agreement about the pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: other room open now . sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|scotty: What if you wanted to have the best chance to get to your best fit?  The actual North hand is a perfect example|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/     webcam 2    left=kalita  right=piekarekc|pg||
mb|3D|nt|scotty: That is the most important thing - to have an agreement.  Far more important than what the agreement actually is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|robinswr: right a bad agreement is better than no agreement|pg||
nt|robinswr: puppet stayman over 2nt (unless you have all the sequences worked out puppet is a loser over 2nt|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfa: Piekarek whispers something to Gawrys|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|scotty: On this hand, if N bids 2@h, what does he do when that gets doubled?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: at the other table Meckstroth Johnson v Lev Pepsi|pg||
nt|robinswr: so if someone asks you to play puppet say no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   webcam 2   left=Wooldridge  right=north  [i don't recognize]|pg||
nt|robinswr: wooldrige had a great Louisville national|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any convention where you haven't worked out sequences is a loser|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: no 3diamond overcall?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: west got there first steve|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzfa: 3NT anyone?|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you allow world class players all the room they need, they will probably get to the correct contract. By preempting you could easily make them use judgement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 1 suit  @H or @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 3@D might just lead to unbeatable 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|robinswr: 2hearts and 3hears were pass or correct|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: but as we see  too double dummy to lead @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|scotty: South may have to stick in the @c10 in the ending|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: didn't Wooldridge PASS of DBL  confirm @H?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|robinswr: however if you bid 3diamonds, maybe partner wil bid 4clubs on the way to 4@d|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Hurd known to have @H fit with better/longer @S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: cute    too bad that would have been one for the bulletin|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think 2spades should show values since both hands unlimited |pg||
mb|1C!|an|baltic|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: this 1@C very similar to Polish 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in this case  weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|scotty: One suit squeeze would have worked - but would fail if S had 2 honors doubleton in clubs OR if N had 4-card H (and @cAQJ10)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Baltic includes many natural @C distributions that Polish opens 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: therefore with x/xxxx/xxxx/xxxx i would bid 2hearts to slow down partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting    thanks Steve|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|robinswr: we're looking at all four hands where its easy to see what would work. easier just to play for the ace of clubs on sides|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||

pg||

nt|ahollan1: alert probably means   natural|pg||
mb|2N|nt|robinswr: have to alert natural cuebids|pg||
nt|robinswr: double could be negative|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: alert = clubs explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: John Mohan is in the thinker's pose|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: now asking Wooldridge what is 2c|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: asking what's double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mohan asking wooldridge about 2@C???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Wooldridge ask Mohan ? are you sure?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: and Mohan shakes head yes|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure how i flip-flopped that     Wooldridge asking about 2@C is normal|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4spades would not fetch with spades 5-0|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2nt shows diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: this hand will make 4th @S contract for other room   but this one will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specifically @D    what would Bertens do  with  0=5=2=6|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: Kalita has pass card out hovering but hasnt played it yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if he does PASS   very lucky make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: not that lucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mohan obviously not on same page|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Gawrys asks about carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now needs 3@D  to go with 3@C 2@S 1@H|pg||
nt|scotty: I agree - it would be pretty unlucky to fail - and 4@s is not actually cold just looking at E-W cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and   south not getting in before he gets 9|pg||
nt|scotty: No, he will play on spades if S clears hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Smirnov thinking. Giving the show away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right   2nd @S will showout|pg||
nt|scotty: true but irrelevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: begrudgingly holding the @h J|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfa: then plays the 9|pg||
