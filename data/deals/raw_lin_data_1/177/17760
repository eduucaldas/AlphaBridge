nt|athene: when you have 4441 in defence and declarer plays several rounds of your singleton suit, you often have a nightmare decision what to throw|pg||

nt|athene: he can win this and lead a heart to the 9|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|nt|athene: then declarer may read him for one more heart and one fewer spade and try cashing the @SA then throwing him in|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the endplay looms|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: coming down to a singleton spade is suicide|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it is obvious now to cash the spade ace and exit in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: ok declarer still has to decide whether north has singleton @HQ now|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has almost a full count now|pg||
nt|athene: but i think with the @SK as well, he would have doubled 2@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: and south would be very unlikely to bare the @SK|pg||
nt|athene: so he should get it right|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it is far easier for us!!|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of interesting possibilities actually|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rv: 2n is an overbid here, I might have raised to 3@c with West hand though only doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I won't pass with Agarwal's hand, would raise to 3@c even with doubleton|pg||
nt|ritong: sridhar has good reasons to think this will not be a picnic and proposes to play for higher stakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have a lot of work just to get to 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  this will help|pg||
nt|rv: Sridhar sitting South should not be confused with P.Sridhar who plays for Texan Aces, this is R.Sridharan based out of Dombivili, Mumbai|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|rv: helpul, though reasonable lead by North|pg||
nt|subhranp: Many kibs asking if North is Subhash Gupta. RV confirms it is him.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this will definitely help|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: this might improve declarer's prospects tremendously|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 9 tricks come home|pg||
nt|rv: maybe even OTs if South fails to find @s switch|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has run out of suits... has to lead @s eventually|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 9@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  W still have to be concerned with location of A@s|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|ritong: has he? south has doubled|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think it's a major concern, Henri:)|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly he did not like the sound of the auction, but still needs one or two good cards to take charge that way|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: yes, Subhash Gupta who played Indian Open trials with Formidables playing here for Blues|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: for that matter, north could shift to a @s at trick 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  but this can't be the right way|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rv: if he had won Indian Open trials, he would not have played this event|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|nt|rv: Seniors trials is usually held after Open trials for this reason|pg||
pc|c2|nt|subhranp: thanks all|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what the delay is but W can count 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to cash @d and exit in @h ( without cashing @c ) for a balck suit squeeze on W|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  I have a feeling S did not play his cards the way we have them here|pg||
nt|rv: he actually made an OT as predicted, defense sold approx 3 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: Pramod, any idea about current position of teams after RR1?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he made OT, his score would not be 550|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pc|hA|pg||
