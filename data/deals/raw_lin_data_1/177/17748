mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: or half today and half tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Two more after this|pg||
nt|robinswr: Levin and Weinstein are giving the field a break and are not playing the last two rounds|pg||
nt|robinswr: :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: So defence havd 2-1-1-1 it seems|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Against 3NT perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least not crashing the trumps|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzfa: Yes they managed to avoid that one|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes not easy to avoid... |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Can be down 3 on an inspired diamond lead and low spade switch - hey I did say inspired|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: michaels|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|robinswr: double says he want to defend however there is a differance between a 3-card double and a 4-card double|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: As pointed out that doesnt work: Don't think that defense good enough - insert 10H and duck J|pg||
nt|robinswr: better if you can pass and then double to show a 3-card penalty double|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Lineup next round This table Piekarek/Smirnov (Leaders after Session 1) vs Gawrys Kalita|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Lineup Other Table next round Fredin Wrang vs Compton Passell|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he try 3 nt? or? |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3nt seems obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: In the tank as they say|pg||
nt|robinswr: a direct 3diamonds should show a weak hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is imp pairs across the fielding sitting your same directions |pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: (did I say that right David?)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: *field, not fielding|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Better would be this is a cross-imped event where you are imped against the other 17 pairs sitting in your direction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Cue agreeing perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|robinswr: bypass 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Just seeing if you were paying attention you passed the test|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: Wrang scratching his brow|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll bid 5clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: After partner cues twice and you havent shown the @CA one should now cue|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or does Wrang's xxx of hts slow him down?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|sybarra: voila |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Club lead will sink this one|pg||
nt|robinswr: so 3diamonds was forcing to slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfa: Ouch this may distract the club lead unless that is treated as dummy's first bid suit outside diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: this is what is great about imp pairs. You win when you play this hand against this pair|pg||
nt|robinswr: lucky the clubs block so only d1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Pauliseen considering EVERY suit the way he is caressing his cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfa: Away goes the bunny and making six|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Ah only 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: still searching for 12th |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: West could be squeezed here|pg||
nt|robinswr: double can't say lead a major|pg||
nt|sybarra: although there are a lot of descards to be made|pg||
nt|robinswr: turns out all pulissen has to do is follow north's discards and he'll beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: I think Jansma should perhaps have doubled 5@C for the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Unless West can be squeezed out of @CKQ|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|robinswr: i would think that over 3spades, if south had extras he would bid 4clubs no matter what he had in the suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Lineup Other Table next round Fredin Wrang vs Compton Passell|pg||
nt|robinswr: after north's double 3diamonds was a weak action if he had more he would wait to see if partnerdoubles 2spades|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|an|Support XX|mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|robinswr: 3diamonds says 'i don't care how strong you are, i don't want to play 2spades doubled|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 3diamonds weak is a standard bid|pg||
