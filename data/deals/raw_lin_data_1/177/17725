pc|hQ|nt|scotty: I think CAN make either with @SQ or @d play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|scotty: Tempting to hope for @sK to be stiff - it helps with entries...AND|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|scotty: iT MAKES IT MORE LOGICAL THAT FAVORABLE OPPONENTS DID NOT BID|pg||
nt|scotty: Had West covered, I believe declarer could make by leading a low club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fredin had no count on the hearts, so may think that North had a ruffing entry to dummy for a second finesse.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, he had to make up his mind very quickly whether or not to cover the @SQ.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|scotty: There are conflicting factors after spade is covered...|pg||
nt|jbennet: that spade finesse looked premature. |pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer can play a low club or a low diamond|pg||
nt|jbennet: looked more sensible to play a Diamonds.|pg||
nt|scotty: If East has @dA it's more likely he would have a hand to bid over 1@s....|pg||
nt|scotty: But if East has @cK, I think you only succeed when he has fewer than 4-card @C|pg||
nt|jbennet: if the ace is wrong then there is nothing he can do about it. but he do have a ruffing entry for the next finesse.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, diamond looks normal.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbennet: lucky for declarer that Sp queen wasnt covered.|pg||
nt|mslair: he is still forced to make|pg||
nt|scotty: after the cover, Mark?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mslair: get out with ace and another club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|scotty: And what if W had club !k and E @dA?  Or if West has 4-card @c?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|scotty: Sorry East has 4-card @c?|pg||
nt|mslair: yes but at that point  the forced continuation|pg||
nt|brolucius: West overtakes to avoid his partner being left on lead with no safe return.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|scotty: Not at all, he could lead a low @d from hand and play West for @cK later|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but now nothing can happen anymore (providing routine play).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ROUND 4 Open: Deutsch-Larsen vs Brogeland-Ventin  |pg||
