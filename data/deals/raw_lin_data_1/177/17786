mb|p|nt|brolucius: We 'wait for Zia' no more.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I suppose it is unreasonable of us to expect magic every time he is at the table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can bid 2@H and then 4@H.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: To offer a choice of the majors. Well, he has bid 3@H forcing. I suppose that shows 5-5 because he would start with Stayman on 5-4 or 4-5.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: 3 @h even better - catering for Zia to be 2-2 in the majors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: Yes, but some players use transfer bids when 5-4 or 4-5 in the majors. Not in the US, I realize.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jbgood: Smolen very popular|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. Not on my card, though.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @c first - and if 2 @d from opener - 3 M shows 4 and 5 in the other M|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|brolucius: That is a good method.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|scotty: It wouldn't be a good method if EW belonged in hearts|pg||
nt|scotty: I mean the actual auction|pg||
nt|jbgood: spade to the queen is usually the better way of playing trumps - would have been here too|pg||

nt|jbgood: a kib rather |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Understandable that North should want to cash out against a 5-5 major hand. It is not so likely that the ace lead would be costly.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder whether if Grue (or Welland) were South they would have opened 1NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Grue is a very successful player, whose name is always in the bridge magazines. Fairly young, I think.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: He is 29 or 30 |pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 29|pg||
nt|brolucius: Catalina, our excellent VG operator, tells me that he is 29. Well, that counts as young when you are my age. |pg||
nt|jbgood: an electric guy|pg||
nt|henryb:  28 or 29 I believe. Won his last junior championship in 2007|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: you can see him in the web cam 2  http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: as we can see it is a play for 6 - e will get endplayed in spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: North was investigating a diamond slam, which seems a bit ambitious. He will bid more cautiously when he reaches my age.|pg||
nt|jbgood: if you were in 6 that is|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had bid it Moss would surely make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: absolutely|pg||
nt|brolucius: The slam is reasonable because South happen to hold seven diamonds. North's single ace was not necessarily adequate support.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: But a 29-year-old has no need to take advice from one of the most cautious bidders on the planet.|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Declarer wins the spade lead keeping the Q on the board. crosses to @dA, @cAK, @c ruff, run trumps and E has to come down to @sK, @hKx. A spade to the Q then endplays East to lead away from the @hK|pg||
