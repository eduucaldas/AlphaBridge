mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  probably not, but that is a very unlikely lead|pg||

nt|jbgood: some kibs tell me that N will be in serious trouble after lots of red tricks - I guess they are right...As far as the di lead is concerned - some play  "di ag slam"|pg||
mc|12|nt|henryb:  I am reliably told that it is cold. declarer cashes 9 red trucks and North is squeezed in the balck suits|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: Polish 1@C?      multi-purpose, in this case  a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D= you made me bid!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room is visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   and a mobile link that i've forgotten :(|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: multon zimmerman  are in 6@H|pg||
nt|poohbear: Note the 1@s bid by Weinstein. We are taught to respond 4 card suits up the line after an opening bid. But after a Takeout DBL Weinstein leaves himself the option of competing in ...|pg||
nt|poohbear: @hs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  As a reminder, there are 36 pairs entered, and each pair will play 4 boards with each other pair and against each other pair over 5 28 board sessions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other URL for spying on other room   http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile     [thanks to ALL who sent that]|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Scoring is "cross-imps", meaning each result is imped against the result at each other table, a total of 17 comparisons. The maximum swing on any comparison is 17 imps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Multon got @S lead, but PO Sundelin pointed out that squeeze makes 6 regardless of lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so levin-weinstein will do very well when other EW pairs bid slam on  5|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|jbgood: Gawrys very cautious with his minors |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: What was he supposed to bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Well, how about 2@c transferring to @d|pg||
nt|poohbear: LOL|pg||
nt|poohbear: they have to be playing that|pg||
nt|henryb:  then with a second opportunity, perhaps 3@c natural?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jbgood: bidding his 2 minors doesnt seem so strange?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  they do play transfers over takeout doubles, at least I believe so|pg||
nt|poohbear: how would that work out?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|poohbear: The way I play transfers over the dbl. I would pass and balance with 2@cs to show 2 places to play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|henryb:  obviously they do not, since Gawrys would have done that if possible|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|poohbear: The defense neede to play a trump . But levin was hoping to his partner in to do that|pg||

nt|ahollan1: who talks about follow-up after super-accept??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is new suit shortness/cue/natural ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: laydown 6'er - they will bid it|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@d may be most promising in N's view|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@s in many versions shows 4(+) trumps and minimum. Why minimum? @sQJ are probably wasted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i asked -- i meant for non- world class pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. club games|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: here  3N is some sort of slam try too|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: the minimum raise to 3 has been abandoned by mot pairs i think|pg||
