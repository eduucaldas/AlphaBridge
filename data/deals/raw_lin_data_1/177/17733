nt|jbgood: work even|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|robinswr: bidding is a guess, but i say when in doubt bid and be agreesive when short in their suit|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: he better make this because 4hearts has four top losers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: can he make 11?|pg||
nt|mslair: no chance to make 5 @cs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mslair: not with @h@h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|robinswr: because clubs are 4-1 he will be tapped in both hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: right|pg||
nt|mslair: 1 down is very remote|pg||
nt|robinswr: bidding over 4hearts is probably against the odds |pg||
nt|jbgood: a very tough position - and bidding will rarely result in a big loss|pg||
nt|robinswr: if bramley was void in hearts, it would make more since|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mslair: but it surely feels good and it could be spot on|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he holds it to down 1 its 5 imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: precisely|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|mslair: Axxx, xx, xx, J9xxx   claimer, next case|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|robinswr: of course what happens if partner is xxxxxx/xxx/x/xxx|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|robinswr: at neither vul you bid only if you think you'll make|pg||
nt|jbgood: then it is EXPENSIVE|pg||
nt|mslair: you can't play that scared guys|pg||
nt|mslair: agreed  a pretty big bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: -300 only gains 3  imps if they can make 420|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbgood: i doubt pessimism won any titles...|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner passed so bidding only is right if partner has long clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mslair: another @h was for sure down 2  but this also works|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess if you're going to bid, maybe you should double which allows partner to pass if he has nothing|pg||
nt|mslair: y|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|c7|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4SAK874HKQD964CAJ8,SQ3HAJT864DA5C643,S62H93DT3CKQT9752,SJT95H752DKQJ872C|sv|n|nt|jbgood: and you get 4@s - then what?|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you play equal level conversions, then 2diamonds denies four spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: you dont deny 3?|pg||
nt|robinswr: so bidding cost 8 imps|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: bidding 4nt shows 6-4 in minors or longer diamonds bidding 5clubs would be made on more equal length|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: two more spades makes it a bit difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|mslair: but the contract is for sure on this layout|pg||
nt|mslair: if playing for the make|pg||
nt|jbgood: not so easy...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pc|dT|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jbgood: got to play ace and a small heart...|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps not too difficult|pg||
nt|mslair: he will not worry about 3 extra undertricks at this vul|pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - he cannot go wrong on this|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pc|d7|nt|jbgood: was fixed on N having 9xx in hearts|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|pc|c8|nt|mslair: ok  we are not so smart|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|c3|nt|robinswr: he conceded d1|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|mc|9|pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1SKQT9HT4DJ76C6432,SJ5432H753D8CAQJT,SA86HQJ2DA543CK85,S7HAK986DKQT92C97|sv|e|nt|robinswr: there is never a reason to concede d1 at imps|pg||
nt|mslair: unless you lose the match by 1 or 2 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless you're doubled and will go down a million if you're wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2N!|an|!H+!D|nt|scotty: If he is correct he gains 4 imps, if he's wrong he loses 10.  So, if he believes the odds are more than 10 to 4 in favor of going down, it is reasonable to play for down one|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: well put|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|robinswr: it just seems wrong to play for d1 undoubled|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h6|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you bid 2nt showing the red suits, your hearts should never be longer than your diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: Maybe South's play of the @hQ "got him" - it would be normal for the guy that opened to play the king there |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|robinswr: that hand is why i don't like playing in this event.  you win 16 imps (or lose) on a random play from an opponent|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|mslair: anyway Welland plays with no fear to back his judgement and doesn't worry too much about looking bad which is admirable to me|pg||
pg||
qx|o20|st||md|2SAQ87HK8765D74C54,SJT9HJDQT983CA876,SK42HA9432DA65CK9,S653HQTDKJ2CQJT32|sv|b|nt|scotty: Maybe he should have ruffed aclub and played a heart from dummy planning to duck an honor, and assuming that S would not find that play with Hx (who would?)|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you're unlucky, you play against lair or rosenberg and they make 4hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jbgood: at least a quiet end to this set...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mslair: thanks for citing me with rosenberg re play:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|scotty: My experience is that contracts tend to make more than they "should" - sort of supernatural|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Multon puts his hand on the table and hopes for a claim somewhere|pg||
mc|11|nt|jbgood: most of us would subscribe to that, Michael|pg||
nt|mslair: particularly when doubled|pg||
nt|scotty: claiming "making 6 if spades 3-3" is the winning line - if you play it out you will go wrong and finesse the @s8!|pg||
nt|mslair: J109 together is extremely low %  one of the lowest|pg||
nt|robinswr: the percentage play if you 100% need four spade tricks is to finesse the 8 its restricted choice|pg||
nt|mslair: much more so than J10x|pg||
nt|robinswr: J10 doubleton|pg||
nt|scotty: Sorry I blanked out - though you could pitch a @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Be right back shortly, next round starts in 2mins|pg||
