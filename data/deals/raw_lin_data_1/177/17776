pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down attitude but standard count|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Looks like one loser in each suit - just claimed such|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Everyone amused at repeat Auction|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: 4N 2-suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then  5@C-5@D/5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Weinstein forces slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 5@H needs a spade lead from the defence to beat it but here is some action|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: i'm glad i got that last minute qualifier on the record|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hmm thinks Wolpert they have just bid slam in my six card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Heres some MORE action|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: How do Levin Weinstein always manage this they have turned -500 into a plus|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I guess swap the red kings around and they were going +1430|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good karma?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helgemo bought the hand in 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  Helness in 5@H  T Bessis didn't open the East hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: if Levin's carding didn't clarify his @C void -- Weinstein able to realize duck would never hurt the cause|pg||
mc|10|nt|jbgood: 6 @s a tad high:) Helness was allowed to play and make 5 @h next door|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl - p - ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Works for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass very expensive when wrong -- but 5 trump ...|pg||
nt|jbgood: rare position|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: And Levin it seems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Testing for JK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: East|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin and Kranyak Hmming to each other|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: The spade blockage may test the defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Good luck says Gavin Thanks says John I best says Gavin|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: many specs questioning the negative dbl on such light values|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure its right to duck the opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Assuming this goes down  and it likely will what is the question|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't worry about partner passing my negative doubles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think ok since @S holding good safety valve ---  but if @C & @D reversed  maybe tougher|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @CK now will force South to play a heart|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbgood: the risk of prd being light but distributive was why Levin pondered before passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Leave them out says South|pg||
nt|robinswr: you have both minors and can even stand partner to rebid spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: the point is that you are short in hearts and therefore you should be agressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands   we see weinstein can play anything [except @C10]   |pg||
nt|robinswr: every hand is a problem. 5-5 in majors 10 points is an opener in lots of books|pg||
nt|ahollan1: T Bessis  started with DBL  so Helgemo-Helness in quiet 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going down 2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|robinswr: d1|pg||
nt|athene: weinstein was perhaps working out whether it was necessary to put his partner in with the @HA to cash the @SK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Against not much|pg||
nt|athene: before it went away on the @CQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin might want to duck this to be able to force declarer in spades later and establish his long trump tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyak asking Levin about signalling methods|pg||
nt|jbgood: Helness can afford going down - after 2 good boards (no weak 2 @h on   1 - so they bid and made 4 @s, and scored 650 on   2)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder if Levin would change his defense if @H9 from dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyak playing out the hand by moving cards along his hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: still d1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin looking v unhappy about last trick|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll score all his trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Heart off the board now will allow declarer to score @HKJ10 for -1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Wrang also began 2@H   but Grue pulled to 2@S  [also down 2]|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|robinswr: levin will score his trumps|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: still d1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyak struggling here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s4|mc|7|nt|ahollan1: that will probably be one of few plus scores for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyak throws the board on the ground in disgust - seems he feels he should have made it or perhaps bid 3@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is Imp Pairs event -- all boards imp'd against entire field|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry yes it did|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: They were under time pressures|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The next line-ups are: Stewart-Woolsey vs Jansma-Jan Paulissen, Grue-Moss vs Hamman-Mahmood, and Hurd-Wooldridge vs Gawrys-Kalita|pg||
