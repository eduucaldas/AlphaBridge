nt|hedyg: yes sure|pg||
nt|peachy: The late great Grant Baze discussed strong NT openings with 5-card majors. His advice was to have 3-card hearts on the side if opening  with 5-card spades. Well suited for MPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the North cards you just know what partner leads, don't you?|pg||

nt|peachy: The logic, for MPs, was that if partner had hearts and transferred, then neither 5-3 major fit got lost|pg||
