nt|santyclz: (A *good* pd will have a @d stop)|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|mb|d|nt|cuttysark: 3NT - or 5@C - not 4@C|pg||
nt|korszurku: 4@C in their methods is @C + @H|pg||
nt|korszurku: so not an option|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 4@c is leaping michaels|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|korszurku: if you are planning to bid 5@C why not double before?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: So 4@C not an option. Nonleaping Michaels is one of my least favourite conventions|pg||
mb|p|nt|korszurku: so many good things can happen (ie partner bids pass or 3NT)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: Double than 5! over 4@H should be a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Moisan ain eigher away.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Likely to lose 2@hs and a @d.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: but you are not willing to bid 5@C for sure|pg||
nt|korszurku: is it a bad thing if partner bids 4@H on a 4 card suit?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|korszurku: could be good if we have slow winners in the red suits|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: not after a 3@S opening, E might easily have a 5card @H suit then|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3N might have no chance (like now on a spade lead) while 4@H could make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like 4-3 fits as much as anybody - but not on deals where there the hands are very unbalanced|pg||
nt|korszurku: I would probably bid 3N myself I just don't think it is automatic|pg||
nt|korszurku: and double is the only other option imho|pg||

nt|panosk: still |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 2@C perhaps an artificial game force |pg||
nt|peter1961:  16 boards and 16 more after?|pg||
nt|panosk: 32 in total i think|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Peter:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Many nice contracts even lawer then 24. Let's see.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzcg: who said it is not reachable? :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems a pity not to bid the diamonds - would be really tough if West had been bold enough to bid 4@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: Hmm - how does South feel about this development? Should convert to hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 6@D sounds like a Grand Slam Try to me|pg||
nt|april7: y, because  6@C goes down on a @H lead, which is extreme difficult to find|pg||
nt|april7: not difficult if  played by S, sorry|pg||
nt|santyclz: On bd 2, the major suit 5-5 s drove to game in the closed room.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcg: it goes down anyway, you cannot dicard your @s on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I suppose North might open 1@H with 5hearts and longer clubs?|pg||
nt|alati: paso i 2@h?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|eleni: 32 tonight, 64 tomorrow and 32 on Sunday|pg||
nt|panosk: any guess for 2cl bid?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some form of Drury, perhaps.|pg||
nt|peter1961:  my best guess is forgot the system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: how lucky can you be!!!:):)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now, I am writing a small book about the times when a trump lead is right against a small slam. it is VERY small|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ask I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Never kill ure pard if he/she open 3rd or 4th hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzan: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: only against a grand!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S then told normal opening.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|panosk: if i'm correct all fantoni-nunes system 1 level opennings are limited in upside and with no spade fit really cant see what it is|pg||
nt|santyclz: If they are playing Fantunes, the 1@s shows 14+ and is forcing, I believe.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@D=mic opening|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|panosk: maybe that then|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 2@s bid shows the limited hand.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cuttysark: I am not convinced about the lead against a Grand Slam either these days|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: now this will be tight|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I expect 2@C usually has clubs, but even so - can't see the reasoning behind the trump lead|pg||
nt|april7: you mean "these days" about very modern bidding styles:):)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes indeed - the ones where you can ask about the queen of trump, but somehow never do|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told that 2@C is a completely artificial game force, so I have no explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: I'll ask them after the play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: @S @C @H @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: But I don't know Fantunes.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure, but more than a thin 12HP|pg||
nt|panosk: anyway i think N hand doesnt deserve  a nt invite so 1nt shud be ok|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u|pg||
nt|panosk: d or club returns are advisable :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I just checked with someone who knows fantunes and she confirmed it's the 2 bid that's limited.|pg||
nt|rodal f: But again. System.  Sayc or 2/1?|pg||
nt|panosk: i know of their system what i've as alert explanations so i'm far from gd at it|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|panosk: or a bumpy flight :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: Quite conservative in the other room - most would reach 3NT on these cards|pg||
nt|april7: isn this bid passable?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Most play this reverse as F1 - but 4th suit means West has a weak hand, so 3C no longer forcing|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So East should bid 2NT rather than 3@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And West should shrug and raise to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: 3@S is forcing, but makes it hard for West to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is 5432 a stopper?|pg||
