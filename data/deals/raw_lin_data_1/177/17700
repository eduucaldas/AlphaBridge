nt|ritong: might deserve a check|pg||
nt|poohbear: if north had followed to the @s declarer would have pitched his @d loser|pg||
nt|poohbear: this would endplay south if he had 4 trumps to start|pg||
nt|poohbear: and declarer can always play for the !q of @hs onside at trick 12|pg||
mb|1N|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
nt|poohbear: Welland needs to win this match 25-5 to tie the event. No other team can win|pg||

mb|2D|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"    EW play their version of Precision|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H could actually be 3 cards with 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
nt|poohbear: again we see this pair open NT with stiff honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
nt|kit: question here is whether North is worth 3@H or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont seem to be posted yet|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try refresh screen|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s was a super accept . Max with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so ....   good @C10 play from Kalita|pg||
nt|poohbear: so 6 imps on board 19 when levin weinstein cruise into 3nt and have no problems on the @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well impressed they got there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-18 HCP, 5+@S  maybe stronger if 2-suited|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@d shows an unbalanced hand with @ds|pg||
nt|poohbear: all balanced hands get opened 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: purists would find much wrong with this 2@H bid, but it often works well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18 with 5+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a limited opening 1@S, 4@S is much wider range than in standard|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S could be 3 cards with longer @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis-Bessis are playing  2 in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, INV+     but maybe he'll just gamble 3N??|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will have a tough bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: as you see sometimes it is opening strength, but no slam interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: E Greco asking if they play precision|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C invitational.  3NT is probably a better contract, since it might make and if it doesn't 3@C might fail also.  Not clear.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
nt|ritong: now|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT is like 19/20 more or less balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually it cost 1 trick in @C  --  2 tricks overall|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit of a psyche?   i think 3@C=game force 3+@C natural or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry I can not see the explanations of the alerts|pg||

nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: it is the same situation, approximately  except that you suspect the opener to have some goods|pg||
nt|sybarra: its only 5 with nothing to write home about |pg||
nt|sybarra: and white|pg||
nt|sybarra: this cant be but so many imps|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein shifts to a spade, which he surely will, declarer has a difficult decision.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer will win this draw trumps and likely play a @d trying to strip the hand. But nothing works because North has a high spade spot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: If @S9 promises the 10, then fine|pg||
pc|c6|nt|woozle: Rohrberg switches to a spade, but from the wrong side|pg||
nt|kit: He can make by going up and setting up the heart for a discard, but this is far from clear|pg||
nt|kit: Now it looks like declarer will have to lose 3 trump tricks -- not close to enough entries for trump coup |pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|poohbear: Declarer has started well on this hand . Taking 2@s tricks without losing one and guessing clubs. Gawrys might have done better to duck smoothlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson 5 point hand provides THREE entries|pg||

mb|3C|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||

nt|woozle: I think we've worked out what about that situation is different|pg||

nt|woozle: sorry, he's|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: N can bid 3@C and over 3@S - 3 card -4@D and have 4@H cue bid|pg||
nt|woozle: South shouldn't cue anything|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D inverted, but since a passed hand it isn't forcing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kalita's hand is so good that he bypasses 3NT despite the ample @H stoppers|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s shows @Hs  and a slam try|pg||
nt|poohbear: nothing about @ss|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|henryb:  1@c "Polish": usually a ballanced 10-13; sometimes strong (18+) or perhaps natural with clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't have thought South hand was worth another call, but perhaps they open more soundly so there could still be a game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This hand must be a worst-case for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C and 4@D forced S to show a @H-stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You cuebid with an aceless hand that showed 15-17 already, Peter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet that most club players agree 3M=shortness in the suit  and make no further statements about @S length|pg||
nt|poohbear: but partner doesnt Q bid the @s ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The textbooks recommend that you pass 1@C; there must be something wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund finds the featherweight response...Orkoneva is grateful to the 2D overcall which simplified his rebid|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d prob shows a good @H raise . Not sure if they are playing a transfer structure|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: Not sure if this is intended as weak or invitatinal, but not what Levin wanted to hear|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbooks say 6+ for a response|pg||
nt|woozle: Only Granovetter tip worth reading - never pass your partner's 1C at favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room that was quite a 2N bid from Mike Moss opposite passed partner|pg||
nt|kit: probably weak -- if invitational Levin might have bid more even with bad spade holding.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: That's an error in the textbooks - a far better way to describe it is "6 points is the amount with which you must respond"|pg||

nt|kit: I think he should cash ace of hearts first now --can't see how holding it can help|pg||

nt|poohbear: i am surprised|pg||
nt|poohbear: prob cause he saw the majors were breaking 3-3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: how do you explain to partner/teammates that you freely rebid a suit then lost 4 trump tricks  [if EW negotiate the @D ruff]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some tables are finishing up and leaving the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is playing with a spade|pg||
nt|kit: From Weinstein's 2NT call. Levin thinks Weinstein is 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|warrens:  East might think his partner is 2344 unless some of this is artificial|pg||
nt|kit: yes, many players would rebid 2@C instead of 1NT with Weinstein's shape|pg||
nt|ritong: missing both minor queens they won t be in 7|pg||
nt|kit: problem here is:  has a trump suit been confirmed?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Normal practice in Northern Europe is to lead 2nd and fourth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: South has run out of pass cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: 3S is descriptive anyway - he hadn't promised the fifth spade|pg||
nt|scotty: After 2N, East KNOWS there is an 8-card minor fit,  What he doesn't know is what slam to play|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible that 4@D isn't natural -- may be intended as RKC for clubs, may be some kind of relay|pg||
nt|kit: But if Weinstein is thinking here, they might not be on the same page.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein ARE investigating slam on  13    standby|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: now just a guess as to how many down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me that 4@D made them guess -- 5@D now says  "they guessed right???"    seems there was at least one flawed thought there|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|scotty: I would think natural - no reason why not|pg||
nt|scotty: Tempting to bid 7?|pg||
nt|warrens:  must be tempted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby opens and closes his hand now has set his cards on the table and his head is in his hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: a big sigh|pg||
nt|scotty: West denied 4 good clubs by not raising over 3@c or 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: still Weinstein didn't have to jump to slam if he has a minimum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: here they all come |pg||
nt|kit: so what can he have?  That's what Levin is trying to figure out.|pg||

nt|scotty: Levin doesn't need much - @cQ, @hA and either red Q gives play|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll make 7@C if he's in it.  ruff one spade and take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|kit: yes, it seems like he should make it if he plays carefully -- 5 trump tricks, 3 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: Unless he thinks no trump lead means something.  But it should not here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|poohbear: so the play might go . @D @D ruff. infer the @c king on . Now it looks like West has all 3@d honors and the @c king so play a @h up to dummy and take a @c finesse then duck a @h. ...|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|ritong: hasta la vista baby|pg||
nt|kit: this is just as good|pg||
nt|scotty: West was hoping the stiff spade was important.  It may also have been an issue that 4@h over 4@d might have been KC in @d - I really have little knowledge about that|pg||
nt|kit: ruff spade with jack of spades, club hook, claim|pg||
nt|warrens:  only risk now is a spade overruff|pg||
nt|poohbear: Defense made it easy by not continuing @ds |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: german|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is says he didn't do a good defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 25 minutes are remaining for this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if determining factor was Barry's statement about non @C lead  because of 33 majors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  the spade position was fortunate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh   he noticed the @C pitch too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: they got very lucky.  If they had been able to establish clubs as trumps at a lower level, they would have had a keycard auction and found out they were off the queen of clubs|pg||
nt|poohbear: 14-16|pg||
nt|poohbear: i guess they are allowed to open 1NT without a singleton|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+   honest|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: Actually, I notice that 4H can be made with a deft heart guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D, 4@H, fit 3@C   what's best?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d q bid will show at least a limit raise in @hs|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 3nt but not sure they'll bid it wtih 13 opposite 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson and Smirnov wispering about last hand and shaking their heads|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl by West would be takeout|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: How you get all the way to 3@S is a mystery|pg||
nt|poohbear: I differentiate between 3 and 4 card raises by using Q bid and 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot about possible 2N :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs natural 1@D   Piek could show @S & minor via 2@D    not sure if the 2+@D eliminated that option or just Piek likes hand enough to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time -- i didn't think about 4@H from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The intra-finesse|pg||
nt|hawe45: Even if DK bids 3 @S here, they might score at least 3 IMP´s|pg||
nt|scotty: I think that will be Weinstein's point in the post-mortem "If I had @hA, @dK and @cQ I would have bid 4@c earlier."  Meanwhile Levin was probably thinking, good chance it's cold, ...|pg||
nt|scotty: finesse at worst|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco was reaching for his bidding cards|pg||
nt|kit: South might well have bid 3@S here, making life even more difficult for opponents|pg||
nt|poohbear: slam is good if they bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: i dont see how they wont|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh thats how|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl by hampson shows extra defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: in relation to the preempt|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner pulls when he has a fit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how little he knows about amount of defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think kalita will redbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D!??|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not even sure I would bud 1@S - I would prefer 2@c|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva appears to have done little justice to his hearts or his game potential with his first bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is not even close to a game try|pg||
nt|woozle: operator error -bid by S?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Mathias have for breakfast??|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hurd opts to make a game try as opposed to lev who just jumped to 4H|pg||
nt|kit: Notice 1NT-3NT auction in other room -- brutally punished|pg||
nt|poohbear: good news. Trump lead beats 3@d|pg||
nt|poohbear: though I guess they have time to shift|pg||
nt|poohbear: so these guys are now in 500 territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Only game possible for E/W is 3 @C D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: E may think that it's N/Ss board|pg||
nt|woozle: 1SXX?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I am getting the answer to my question: how do you get all the way to 3@S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thank you says Eric Greco|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: South hand is pretty good for a preemptive 2@s - so he bids again!|pg||
nt|kit: This one should be a flat 4@S -- hard to see what else can happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then Greco pulls to 5@D?|pg||
nt|poohbear: well thats one way to keep them outta slam|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  On the previous hand eventually North would have to lead from his @s74 into declarer's 86|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@D opening, which wasn't obligatory, sure changed result of this hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: Like this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is today's Daily Bulletin that has article about Striped-Tail Ape DBL|pg||

nt|kit: Succesful save -- they will be disappointed to lose IMPs on it.|pg||
nt|kit: well, North did chime in with 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: and South now knows he is facing a stiff heart|pg||
nt|scotty: Takes a heart lead to beat 6|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hawe45: But still East is right - N/S can make 620, there should be only one way to play the @H-suit|pg||
nt|scotty: Seamon is listening to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This first rd is the last of the round robin, the next 2 will be swiss|pg||
nt|poohbear: john Lowenthal had a name for this dbl. Its called the striped tailed ape dbl. If you think opps can make slam then dbl them in game. if they redbl you run like a stripetailed ape|pg||
nt|poohbear: is in control of all situations|pg||
pc|d5|nt|poohbear: 5@ds suit preference|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Were they ever going to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, some pairs don't bid game with 13 opposite 10 :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva was right to double 3D - Rohrberg wasn't going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Easy club shift.  And when declarer finds AQ of clubs and king of spades in East hand, he will get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that was introduced in the short-lived but great publication  The Bridge Journal|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer might well misguess @ds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|poohbear: one option is to win and lead a @d threatening crossruff or @c suit establishment|pg||
nt|scotty: Would the bidding have been different if East held @dQ?|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure|pg||
nt|kit: Levin considering overtaking in case jack of clubs is singleton -- but that can't be, as with 10xx declarer would have covered|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the @h position is not crystal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby is shaking his head|pg||
nt|scotty: In fact, mightn't he play EAST for the @dQ since West might have opened a 1N? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 14  Krekorian opened 1@D [his 1N=15-17]   so Weinstein 1N South|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: East MUST have bid 3 @C - and nNOT 3 @D!?!|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  opening 1@h or 1@s show 5+ cards (11) 12-17;|pg||
nt|warrens:  unblocks the suit and keeps the @S entry for the last @H|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|kit: Levin trying to hid the queen of hearts, so declarer will place him with queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer perhaps considering just crossruffing and settling for down 2.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think I'd misguess @d here - I don't know 6-3 clubs, so I don't know shape.  And West might have opened 1N with @dQxx |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe East thought that he had a different hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Alco-test then...|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|pc|h5|nt|kit: reason he took diamond finesse first was so he wouldn't lose control if he misguessed diamonds|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  -500 a good score for welland.  1430 available on the lucky stiff K's when declarer is stuck in his hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Has to is an interesting term of phrase|pg||
nt|po-s: yes absolutely - 1D is a must Kit...|pg||
nt|kit: they may not have to push E-W higher -may begoing on their own steam|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, for the kibitzers, I agree it makes 7 on a guess.  but in 6, on a @D lead, you have no choice but to bang down the Ace of trump|pg||
nt|kit: if E-W get to major-suit slam, diamond lead, and will have to play ace of trumps -- works whatever is trumps!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Yes there is a paucity of entries|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Piekarek 1@C is multi-purpose   including  weak NT, natural with @C ...   so Weinstein 2N would be @D & @H|pg||
nt|po-s: diamond lead forces declarer to make 12 tricks if in slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: At the end of the match i will leave the table open and chase down the scores and post themm|pg||
nt|warrens:  another possible line, if in 6, is to cash the club Ace and exit a @D, hoping for both kings to be onside|pg||
nt|po-s: true Warren, missed that|pg||
nt|kit: good point Warren -- if playing in hearts, probably right play|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: playing in spades, not so sure|pg||

nt|kit: particularly if hearts trumps|pg||
nt|kit: exit|pg||
nt|kit: works only if in spades and hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|warrens:  side suit puts you in dummy for the two finesses|pg||
nt|warrens:  and you play the trump suit first|pg||
nt|kit: but if in spades, playing ace of spades probably better anyway|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: Now, maybe the ace of clubs and diamond exit is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trailing by 20 VP, it seems surprising they stopped|pg||
nt|warrens:  playing in 5, I think you're supposed to exit and hope one finesse is onside, though there has to be a concern about @H ruffs |pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Levin lowers screen to ask a question|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Whatever north can or cant do it isnt happening quickly|pg||
nt|kit: only chance for defense to take 3 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: smirnov DBL showed 4+@H  & @S|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kit: otherwise, declarer will have to have successful endplay|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: This event has 9 matches of 9 bds, today we will be showing 6 of them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's got to be a good result for Zimmermann|pg||
nt|poohbear: I am surprised he didnt play ace of @s and a @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: worried about 5-0 I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drew Casen [drewsky]  overcalled 2@H      Levin-Weinstein in undoubled 5@C|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4 comparisons to go . Welland needs to win by 16 to tie or by 19 to win outright|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another  "weak nt" version of 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double partscore swing = nice pickup for O'Rourke|pg||
nt|ritong: ho hum|pg||
nt|ritong: someone opened 1@s for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: please undo the whole thing  eyes hurting:)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|poohbear: another routine 4 M here|pg||
nt|ritong: ty|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1C strong|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|poohbear: 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same Precision 1@D opening|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2NT presumably minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think Hurd's NT range in this position is 14-16   [that explains 1@D]|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 is sort of on a finesse for the right red ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so RDBL would have really gained|pg||
nt|poohbear: partner has it|pg||
nt|poohbear: pass shows less than 8 points|pg||
nt|poohbear: by hampson|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: on  5  Welland also in 10@D|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 3nt except on a @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|kit: Pushy slam in other room -- might not make on club lead|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows hearts and a higher suit, e.g. majors|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein trying to decide if worth 3@S -- I don't think so hand too junky|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: 1 NT now might end the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: North won't sell, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Hurd and Wooldridge play 14-16 NT despite playing a std system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see here, Smirnov DBL might include Strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could help explain Piekarek's 1N   for those who don't like it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Geoff Hampson is writing notes to Alex Smirnov but can's see|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl says its our hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: notice you cant help but make 7 @hs but not 7 @ss|pg||
mb|5C|nt|poohbear: state of the match rdbl in my opinion|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Norway +1|pg||
nt|woozle: unusually, CQ looks to be more successful than a small one|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H down 1 at both tables NO-SW - @S-lead @D to K and now 2x @D ruff inEast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to be honest  this is impact of Raptor NT that made me uncomfortable the few times i played it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks says J Piekarek|pg||
nt|kit: I think North's pass is awful.  With half the deck and short in their suit, never let them play it at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: state of event|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h is not a good game|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats what I meant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I guess for North the heart holding was a greater deterrent than the spade holding was an impetus|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: What is the better contract at imps, 7@c earlier or 6@h here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: quick claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  try a low @H now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think pass by Greco would have been forcing. Surprised he didnt do that|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|poohbear: 14-16 nt range gaining alot of popularity as people open lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Geir is showing his hand|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H by Levin looks pretty conservative to me -- 3 aces should be worth some kind of noise.|pg||
nt|poohbear: so this looks like down 3 and a bathroom break :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: even playing 15-17   that north looks too good to me|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|poohbear: nice spec dbl by hampson. he knows that they wont redbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS maybe thinking they're down 2 slam swings this set|pg||
nt|poohbear: and might get declarer to misguess things|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|woozle: that's down two, isn't it?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|poohbear: also he might have picked up on gawrys hesitation that he is weak for his raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker had a character that was famous for that type of double - in fact she often had trump void|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|hawe45: That was a very bad @D-move|pg||

pc|s2|pc|cQ|nt|kit: depends whether opponents are good opening leaders or not|pg||
nt|poohbear: i think at this point declarer knows who has the trump length|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep    can he use the info??|pg||
nt|poohbear: his spots arent good enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think only defense can let this make|pg||

mb|p|nt|scotty: It wasn't a serious question about which slam was better - just my quirky way of pointing out that Levin had the worse of the slam luck (as usual, he would say)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: every imp is a VP in close matches . then every 2 imps fpr a while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=4+|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yet another Precision 1@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hawe45: Might bid this bad slam - easy to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  The cards lie well for an E-W 4@h contract|pg||
nt|kit: very heavy weak 2 -- many would open 1@S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|poohbear: makes overtricks important|pg||
nt|scotty: "hope" maybe, confidently expect is a bit much - partner might be 4-3-2-4 or we might land in their strong suit|pg||
nt|kit: but 2@S would be reached anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Sw-NO now 15-15 - stop the match - Denmark will win both groups - Stop :):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting problem for West|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2H shows a bad raise . This qualifies!|pg||
nt|warrens:  well this one makes 6@C if you find the offside !K of @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No explanation of 2 spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C seems more likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: father and son Bessis defended correctly against 5@DX to pick up 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told 2spades is mini spliner and 3 spades is cue|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told if Geir remembers 2 spades is splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s good spot here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|woozle: If west is rebidding in a suit here, prefer 2H to any level of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today's Daily Bulletin includes the VP scale     http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/daily-bulletin|pg||
nt|poohbear: helps West as now he has a clear value showing dbl available|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, sorry, 6@C only makes from East, not West, 'cause of the @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd singleton King of the set ---  always in a minor|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: I wonder if EW play Support DBL  in this situation|pg||
nt|ritong: the fourth best of the longest strongest blah balh would not be asuccess here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Norway in 6NT??|pg||
nt|woozle: At least 2H shows a good hand and doesn't risk missing heart fits|pg||
nt|hawe45: Facing a non-passed partner, West should bid 4 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: so now Norway +12 IMP (17-13?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made 6NT and are now +12|pg||
nt|woozle: should be quant here|pg||
nt|woozle: West hasn't learned anything new to incite blackwood|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S convention card says 2@d transfer, but some notion that is forbidden (do not know why|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 3@C denies a club stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and is forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@c sh promise 0-4-5-4|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd worry if it denied a club stopper and was non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: needs little more than 3-2 trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|woozle: 6-red better than 6NT here, although 6D might fail with an overruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures udating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is not uncommon over doubles in this country|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: director was called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: east and north left the room to talk to him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some misunderstanding about the 2d bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: first north said showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT would also have been forcing. Some play that 3@D is passable, and others play Ingberman 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco hasn't shown ANY sign of life|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ng|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Which is a good treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45: For those who like good bidding - some more boards are coming up...|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think he should dbl again. partner can bid 3@s freely with doubt since he has denied more than 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about 3N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and NS win the war|pg||
nt|kit: Mike, guess it depends if you see the cup as half empty or half full|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3NT is scary with no idea if he has a source of tricks|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2nt is aggressive. greco hoping his aces and J of @ss is enuff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  probably alerted differently on the two sides of the table also|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner bids 3@s over dbl then his 3nt shows doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Fallenius made it easier for Moss when he bid 2N instead of DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 5 minutes left in round|pg||
nt|poohbear: but here comes the little more|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco says umph|pg||
nt|poohbear: Welland specs a dbl knowing they cant redble. he has a good lead and knowledge @ss not breaking|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  he should play a @C to the Ace since he knows a @H ruff is possible|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: this will get ugly fast|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question  --   how close is Piekarek to (1@C)-2N  instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Tor and Geir having a discussion|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @D is better than 6 NT!|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D makes if you take the spade finesse, fails if you try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: But a lot more tricky to play|pg||
nt|woozle: makes if you go for a S-C squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu: will Marie bid 6NT - I exp that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made on that squeeze Kieran mentioned|pg||
pc|c7|nt|woozle: I've almost forgotten what it's like to bid without brakes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: sorry misclick :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: I was afraid, Maria was thinking of bidding 7...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has not made 6@D yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, I think it's in jeopardy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks normal to ruff a club|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu: @s8 lead??|pg||
nt|kit: this has not been a good match for opening 1NT with a 5-card major|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: well that was unimpressive|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a 3 @H by W would have helped?|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s9|nt|hawe45: Pls repeat Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: director still here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: the agreement is that 2 d shows hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: south alerted it was hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: north also|pg||
nt|henryb:  Although transfers are allowed only over 1@c and natural NT bids, there is some reason to believe that transfers after takeout doubles are a defense to the opponent's convention and therefore legal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: after north saw trick 1 he notice his pt had spades and told gavin|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 4 ht or t ht |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: he showed the diamond|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||
nt|kit: interesting that this time he doesn't open 1NT on a hand which many would consider a normal 1NT opening, but maybe they play 14-16|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||

nt|kit: Double probably shows 4 or more spades|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1H shows 4+ @ss|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: no ruling yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||
nt|scotty: What card should East plasy at trick one?  @s3 or @s6?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 red finesses lose and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|kit: difficult hand for Seamon -- is North supposed to raise with a doubleton?  If so, what if Seamon has 5 hearts?|pg||
nt|poohbear: pass denied 3@s i imagine|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
nt|poohbear: Of course Welland has 4 :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl is extra values. Do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: break is usually 10-15 minutes, but seems this table ending late so might be sooner|pg||
nt|kit: which makes South's double a support double|pg||
nt|scotty: Some pairs play specifically 4 or 5|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: Bramley-Welland won't have this problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||
nt|kit: Seamon appears confident that Cohler doesn't have a doubleton heart.  I wouldn't be so confident about that.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired in grace period|pg||
nt|kit: South has shown extra strength with his second double I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: Many experts open 1NT with this hand type to avoid rebid problems. |pg||
nt|poohbear: playing 5@s on board 25 at the other table . so likely 5 imp pick up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: last bd here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: So he has nothing more to say|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein knows from the spots that his partner has the singleton club -- unlucky hand for those who lead low from doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: but that is just happenstance|pg||
nt|kit: Still, not clear how he should defend|pg||
nt|kit: danger with ace and a club is declarer may just discard a singleton heart -- but if he doesn't do this, he may not get his ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: And if he leads a low club, partner may be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|ritong: depending on the third downtrick|pg||
nt|poohbear: for Welland . If they can pick up 14 on 26 . That would give them an 8 imp lead going into this board|pg||
nt|poohbear: needing 8 imps to tie|pg||
nt|poohbear: 11 to win|pg||
nt|poohbear: play to 4@d here not without interest. Trump lead best for defense . But they cant get another trump play in|pg||
nt|poohbear: 5 will be too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
nt|poohbear: if defense plays @hs declarer can set up that suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
nt|kit: all things considered, I believe ace and a club is best|pg||
nt|scotty: When is a club better than a heart now?|pg||
nt|scotty: I see when it's worse - when partner has QJx or Q10x and declarer has a stiff heart|pg||
nt|kit: assuming partner doesn't have ace of diamonds, I guess it isn't|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer will be confused about the @s layout but will likely figure Welland for a semi psyche|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
nt|poohbear: I just dont agree here. Ace of @s is a more suit oriented card|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i keep getting into a loop, still not sure if down 2 or 3 here|pg||
nt|scotty: third?  is the second so clear?|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he can get out for down 1 offhand|pg||
nt|ritong: okay 2 imps at stake  depending on the second downtrick:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  17 Levin did open 1N, but Krekorian overcalled [multi]2@D    still 4@S North|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks to World Bridge Productions for allowing us to present this world class tournament, Jacki at BBO for helping to organise our commentators and Fred Gitelman for providing the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: means by which we can present this remarkable tournament throughout the world.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: wondering if Helness was supposed to cash @CA|pg||
nt|kit: as long as declarer has a heart and partner the ace, heart looks right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: I take the bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 cokes|pg||
nt|hawe45: Declarer will suffer, when the @C-suit in invited into the battle|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith vs NT -- but does that apply looking at dummy's @C?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both respond     i've got 9 cards left|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|scotty: Only a heart void - and that seems impoissible...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired and grace period|pg||
nt|poohbear: and they can rebid 2@c to show 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|poohbear: We will be back tomorrow at 1030 local time. About 21 hours from now to bring you the pairs championship|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: on  8 the Bessis pair did find the 5@DX save against 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness is rocking his chair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Zimmermann team dominated this event last year|pg||
nt|scotty: he probably finessed @d9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: just announced less than 15 min left in the round|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has no idea what is going on. Welland has showed a lot of HCPs but has to have 3 or 4 @s|pg||
nt|poohbear: No way they are 7-2|pg||
nt|poohbear: so much for plus 800.Looks like the Germans are going for an even bigger number|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open, we will be back like in 5-10 min with next rd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see everybody then :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphzfb: okay back in about 10 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks|pg||
nt|poohbear: on 26|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|poohbear: which will make this board moot|pg||
mc|10|nt|hawe45: Why discard the @C 8 - and not the 5?|pg||
nt|henryb:  first match is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. We will be showing Blanchard vs Zimmerman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4/5 imps = 19-11 VPs   but hard to imagine this hand being anywhere near a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator said  Bramley opened East hand 2@C "after much deliberation"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp     P-2@C-2@D-P//5@D-P-P-DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Open table will show results this table closing\|pg||
