mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mikael_w: wow. I really dont think this will go down|pg||
nt|scotty: 5@d is lucky in the sense that it cannot be defeated on the actual lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: yes @Hs 4-1 and no entry in N|pg||
nt|mikael_w: singleton @h makes it :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Hamman judged well not to bid 3N facing the splinter - he figured on 1 spade loser and trusted Zia's known @h-@c cards could limit the losses there to one trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mikael_w: I mean, looking at Hammans hand you shod not really be that glad to get a splinterbid in @s from partner shod he ?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|scotty: If Zia had @HK and @CA, no defense could defeat 5@d (assuming @hA onside)|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pelu: ontil now a superb round for Zia-Hamman - but they need it - they were 25 after 2. sektion|pg||
mb|4H|nt|scotty: Even  @h fails here on club lead and spade shift|pg||
nt|mikael_w: unless he now wants to get back showing what a monster he has for his pass :)|pg||
nt|scotty: 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: OK doubtful action|pg||
nt|scotty: 3N is where you'd want to be...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbennet: yes 4 H was a unilateral decision.|pg||
nt|jbennet: xxxx in spades are life threatening holding|pg||
nt|mslair: they are almost sure to find the winning defense here?|pg||
nt|jbennet: in a suit contract.|pg||
nt|scotty: Zia has enough strength to make 4@h, and was not picturing such a strong spade holding opposite|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H close to go down - but can make - after @HA S cant ruff the next @C!|pg||
nt|jbennet: no ZIA didnt know about the spade|pg||
nt|scotty: Perhaps Hamman might have tried 2@s instead of 3@h, but he chose the simplest route|pg||
nt|jbennet: but when u dont know|pg||
nt|jbennet: u consult P|pg||
nt|jbennet: zia didnt do that|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @cA and @c-ruff and @dA and another @d is my tip for 1 down|pg||
nt|jbennet: which should cost a game swing|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@S in E and then let pd decide?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 spade was ther obvious bid|pg||
nt|scotty: Zia's problem was that if he bid 3@s and partner bid 3N, he still wouldn't know what to do|pg||
nt|mikael_w: or 2 down. he will finess in @s and def gets a @s ruff too|pg||
nt|jbennet: "p i think we have  a game but im not sure which"|pg||
nt|pelu: after that defense Hamman is forced to take @HA and play @CQ - and make|pg||
nt|jbennet: thats what zia should have bid.|pg||
nt|scotty: Now the spotlight is on N - he needs to NOT give partner a ruff (yet)|pg||
nt|jbennet: but "I am the great ZIA so I take decisions on my own"|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no. no @s-finess. forgott the @s overcall|pg||
nt|jbennet: defence however Must defend accurately.|pg||

nt|pelu: wd by N|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes yes|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|jbennet: sp trick 2 :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|scotty: If Hamman had AJ, KQJ10xx, QJx, Ax he would bid a very happy 3N over 3@s - but it would be the wrong contract. Make the @cA the @cK, and it would have no play....|pg||
nt|jbennet: now ZIA will have to say sry for not consultiong you in the choice of game contract|pg||
nt|scotty: So I don't think it's fair to criticize Zia's 4@h bid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|pelu: yes its easy for us to see and bid the optimal contract :)|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|h7|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hK|mc|8|nt|scotty: Had Hamman bid 2@s, it would have continued 3@c-3@h, 3@s and now HAMMAN would have the guess.  He has good spades, but is worried about @d.  And on that auction, he hasn't yet ...|pg||
nt|scotty: stressed how good his hearts are.  All in all, a very difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Next round we have: Amoils-Delmote vs Grue-Moss, Hamman-Mahmood vs Lev-Pszczola, and Fredin-Wrang vs Gawrys-Kalita|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Restart in 3mins, be right back shortly|pg||
