nt|robinswr: makable for six from south if club guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stewart's opening pass  denied 10-12 bal [1N]  and weak 2   so  Woolsey didn't hunt for a perfecta|pg||

nt|ahollan1: RM Lite  [versions of which played by greco-hampson/grue-cheek/diamond-platnick ...]  don't use transfers either|pg||
nt|robinswr: i thought that the response would not be 1spade by meckwell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  RM  the full meckwell system does not respond naturally   but RM Lite ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Closing and reopening|pg||
