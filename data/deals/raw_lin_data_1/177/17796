mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing, multi-purpose  in this case  any (18)19+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-6|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jbennet: why not 2d+|pg||
nt|jbgood: Pikarek - Smirnov one of the most successful European pairs the past few years - whereas Brogeland - Ventin play together once in a while|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps that had shown a canape?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H hadn't clarified hand  could have been 3@H with weak nt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ew system is called "Baltic Club"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: although they play for Germany    Smirnov originally from Russia, Piekarek from Poland|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfa: Event website: http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/   Also live table pictures updating every two minutes|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: this time  1@C with hand too good for 1N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: so 1N=18-20|pg||
nt|jbgood: broges action may create something here - N bids 2 @h - and E?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: 3c was alerted in one side of the screen only|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: for hand with 0-6 HCP  can't imagine it being anything other than NF|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|jbgood: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure about the alert of 2@C    or the final contract of 2@S instead of the 10-card fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: gazilli-variation allows you not to find the 10 card club fit...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and   i forgot  Smirnov had another chance to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: maybe now is the time?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: you better pull, Broge:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: Jansma 4@H-2  Hamman 5@D=|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Smirnov DBL far from automatic  but just as far from non-kosher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a lot depends on what 2@C said, but  wasn't getting rich defending 2@S undoubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done EW|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: this version of 1@C = natural  go figure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ HCP, 3+@H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C  6+@C  or  5@C & 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jbgood: as Michael Polowan points out, 2 @s x is only 500 - so passing would be the winner by Boye:)|pg||
