pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes as notedd 5@D maked because the defence cant get their heart trick as North has no entry and so it disappears on the @CK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Billy Cohen sighs as he simply doesnt know what to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lucky they didnt have to play a board - no time problems|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: The director checked that EW hadnt discussed the board with anyone after the last round which they had not has they have gone through all 18 versions of board 16 and it was only EW ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: at this table and their NS opponents who played it wrongly|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: 1@C clearly strong club|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: spade lead killing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So club and ruff will see the spade loser go away so declarer likely to make this|pg||
nt|po-s: club and spade return also good|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: As p-o notes a spade lead makes declarer's ability to draw trumps and avoid a spade ruff difficult but....|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So 3NT was the best sport here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|warrens:  club, club ruff, Ace of @D, @D.  now declarer plays the Ace of @H and has to decide: play North for the @S Queen or South for only 2 @H's.  I think he would finesse and go down|pg||
