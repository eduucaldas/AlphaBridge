pc|cJ|nt|jbennet:  4 sp looks like hoping for p having the dream hand; which he hadn't.  |pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like Lev expected more for a second-seat vul vs not weak 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbennet: 2nd preepmts wk2 or preempts should be well-defined. (if so then Souths hand hardly qualifies)|pg||

nt|henryb:  no 9th trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: oh but yes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: this is how the play will go.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: for security reasons we have to close and re open the vugraph after each rd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: today we are going to be showing 2 sessions of 7 rds each (4 bds per round)|pg||
nt|henryb:  For what its worth Hurd-Woolridge picked up 13 imps against Lev-pepsi|pg||
nt|henryb:  going +110 on 2 and +500 on 3, but getting only 100 on bd 1. And yes, this is a pairs event|pg||
nt|henryb:  Still 13 imps in the head to head comparison figures to translate to about 200 cross imps|pg||
nt|henryb:  Standings in this event are only disclosed at the end of the session|pg||
nt|henryb:  as far as I know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We'll be right back shortly guys|pg||
