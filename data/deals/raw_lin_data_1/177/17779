nt|santyclz: (A *good* pd will have a @d stop)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: 3NT - or 5@C - not 4@C|pg||
nt|korszurku: 4@C in their methods is @C + @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzcg: 4@c is leaping michaels|pg||

nt|korszurku: 3N might have no chance (like now on a spade lead) while 4@H could make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like 4-3 fits as much as anybody - but not on deals where there the hands are very unbalanced|pg||
nt|korszurku: I would probably bid 3N myself I just don't think it is automatic|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes, another Roland slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is why 3@s has lately taken favor to show either a very good @s hand or just an average @s hand.  It still allows room for investigation without going to the 5 level.|pg||

nt|april7: duplication of value in @D, so NS must guess Q of @H to make 4@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cuttysark: A club ruff might beat 4@H - but it is not often effective to go for a ruff when you have a singleton trump|pg||
