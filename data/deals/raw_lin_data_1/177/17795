nt|Walddk4: or vulnerable game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: this is a turbo speed table :)|pg||

nt|chorush: +90 will be a good result for NS since EW could make 2 spades if they could enter the auction. that is tougher over a strong NT than if they were playing a weak nt|pg||
nt|athene: west had 5332 shape, that's not usually a recipe for overcalling over 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrang in 1NX   Kalita opened east hand 1@D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|athene: east must have been unhappy about passing 1nt out, since his partner isn't finding a diamond very much when it's needed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but i guess he didn't have anything sensible to do either|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This has some scope|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 2@S or 3@D?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: his hand is all about diamonds so the latter seems fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: his hand worth about 1 1/2 tricks in spades and 6 1/2 in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H perhas the best spot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: *perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: pepsi might decide to give up here but it will be with reluctance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is safe, though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: All games may go down|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: next rd we will have  kranyak  wolpert  vs   grue   moss   young table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: plus always better than minus     except in golf|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S by zia here perhaps after 2@H and 2NT overcall|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades can make only by taking the right view in trumps|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, hamman gets in there despite weak suit and two aces|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: glad to see someone agrees with me that you can have two aces for a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=medium hand, bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yuck, and a great suit|pg||
