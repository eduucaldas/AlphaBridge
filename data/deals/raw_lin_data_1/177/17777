pc|d3|nt|jcwla: This is going to cost Grue and Moss dearly, I think.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think North hoped to buy it for 5@h - otherwise he might have tried 5@c over 4@s as a lead director|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, for my next guess...|pg||
nt|scotty: Of course on this lead....|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead??|pg||
nt|pelu: cost 2 tricks|pg||
nt|scotty: West presumed N had @dA, and went for max...|pg||
nt|scotty: But since most experts know Fredin is very capable of such leads, he perhaps should have eschewed it|pg||
nt|scotty: If declarer believes the lead is a stiff - he will win @dA and go down|pg||
nt|scotty: I think declarer can be certain the lead is EITHER a stiff OR from the king|pg||

nt|jcwla: If they get to 5@D against you get back into bed and pull up the covers.|pg||
nt|pelu: only if u open 12-14 NT u have a chance: 1@D - 3@D, 3@H - 4@D - 5@d|pg||
nt|pelu: :):)|pg||
nt|pelu: some spect say: the West hand too strong to 1NT - but sometimes u have maximum :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: The next line-ups are: Stewart-Woolsey vs Jansma-Jan Paulissen, Grue-Moss vs Hamman-Mahmood, and Hurd-Wooldridge vs Gawrys-Kalita|pg||
nt|pelu: a 2@C from East would often only helpNS to find thebest lead|pg||
