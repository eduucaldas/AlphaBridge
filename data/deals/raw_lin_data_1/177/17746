mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|scotty: Light 3rd seat opener propels E-w into game...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in context of Big Club ===   Greco didn't expect to end up in game opposite passed partner|pg||
pc|dA|nt|scotty: Unluckily, the opponents have no big fit and the AK of trump - so likely down against nothing|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|scotty: Count, which is the most common expert agreement here....|pg||
nt|scotty: Attitude, which is second most common...|pg||
nt|scotty: And "mini-count" which is the least common (but what I prefer)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michael,  in situations like this where Queen is in dummy, do you use normal count methods or always standard here|pg||

mb|3D|nt|scotty: Second highest would be the normal count card in a count situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kranyak DBL reminds me of article by Ed Manfield  "I've Got A Secret"|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: his proposal in situations like this   DBL/DBL is penalty with 4+ trump   PASS/DBL = good BALANCED hand|pg||
