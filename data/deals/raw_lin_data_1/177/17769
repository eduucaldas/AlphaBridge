nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Good evening |pg||
nt|psyck: we have the 2nd & 3rd place teams here: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru: ciao a tutti|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quiet start|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Liz McGowan and Bill Jacobs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: hi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@D w/o  a @C lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|daman: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bara brudar = Only 'chicks' (women)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West should already be thinking: "3NT"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
nt|rv: Please access http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for running scores|pg||
nt|granguru: 3N or 5@d is an easy task to fullfil|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
nt|psyck: @d's put to sleep|pg||
nt|rv: huge surprise Lavazza out of contention|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|granguru: N Asks for majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|athene: many people play the overcall in responder's suit as natural here - but not by a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning - and it is another sunny morning in dublin - can we take all this good weather|pg||
nt|rv: yes sunny in Dublin and wet in Bangalore good for resp regions:)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome to see some of the best players in Italy - and in the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|fann4: After 8 rounds - SBAR lead the table with 166 vps, and MIRO are 2nd with 149 vps.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So you guessed it, N-S are young women|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|j0i: Hi all|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes   we are very lucky to see this match|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
nt|kemperg: 17 to work on, nice task for Miro|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But not from his side...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No ... it was awkward|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s lead?|pg||
nt|rv: East won't find inspired @SJ lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If 2@C was a game force, then West could bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: perhaps East should rebid 2NT with his scattered stuff|pg||
nt|friggi: Hej alle, velkommen til denne begivenhed, forhåbentlig vil vi se en masse af god Bridge|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would you?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Fabio Carugati|pg||
nt|rv: on this auction, there is case for leading @sj instead of @C since you have no entry and best to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Fabio, I will seriously consider @SJ lead|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all, the weather is not so good here in Northern Italy....let's hope|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I certainly would since no suggestion declarer or responder have spades|pg||
nt|rv: did the weather affect Lavazza?|pg||
nt|caruga: is possible :)|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer can make this contract by playing @HJ and rising with @CA if West wins and continues @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how about kibs any spade leaders out there|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: but close to down 1|pg||
nt|jcomyn: should guarantee fireworks since have to pout the boot down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|athene: East's double just showing a good hand i think?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So they both had chances, but it might all depend on their system agreements|pg||
nt|cuttysark: All is not lost: he has to switch to a diamond now to beat the game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|daman: this seems like a decent contract|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
nt|psyck: S will have to provide an entry to dec hand for @c fin|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wow, that's tough|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: it is easier for East to lead a @s from shortness here since partner has most of values and odds on to hold 4+@s|pg||
nt|athene: this is a swift clam|pg||
nt|fann4: So to win the event, MIRO need to win 24-6, a VERY tall order.|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S 10 importent |pg||
nt|cumino: EW can make 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if you HAVE to win 24-6 you cant sit on your hands|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
nt|athene: claim :)|pg||
nt|fann4: What can beat 2@S here are east and west's trump spots. the @S8 and the @S9.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
nt|caruga: Paolo Uggeri is a very imaginative player but the first board in rama......|pg||
nt|rv: now 1 down again|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
nt|granguru: yes, for the ones who are asking...WE ARE watching the bridge legenda|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @SA @S10 will cause some damage here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, -3|pg||
nt|j0i: Might go for -3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: 2@cs + 2@D and 2@hs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: playing 4@C no risk on card play playing for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S can not find his parner entry for a ruff but might try it |pg||
nt|fann4: Now the contract can make.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jameslee 2: claim  for 10 not 11 should be |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
nt|rv: Franchi did have a tough play problem even on favorable @c lead, to play for either @SK right or hope for right @HT guess and 4-4 @cs|pg||
nt|granguru: hi |pg||
nt|rv: he didn't take a very unreasonable line |pg||
nt|rv: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pressure w|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste|pg||
nt|caruga: hi, ciao|pg||
nt|athene: yes, indeed - west's first name is "THE"|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito Garozzo, born in September 1927|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: ace and a diamond completely safe now|pg||
nt|hawe45: North will hardly ruff @C - seeing the @C Queen coming down |pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk4: There is no typo in the N-S team name. Intentional as Guld means Gold. Those guys dreaming of the gold medal|pg||
pc|h9|nt|j0i: Guldberg is my pick to win this compatition|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|woozle: Good hand to show off the law - EW make 9 tricks in their nine card fit, NS make8 tricks in their eight card fit. If 4H was making, 4S would be -500|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @hA what else?|pg||
nt|athene: no way anyone can win the @DK and give his partner a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: well|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|athene: if he had cashed the @CK and seen the queen fall, yes|pg||
nt|granguru: ciao Fabio|pg||
nt|daman: he could have made it double dummy :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cuttysark: I meant 'she' onviously - and  agree that is asking too much|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So far, the defence is sparkling|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we call these kind of hand "buzz sawa" |pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but the way it went it was not so obvious that the @CQ was stiff|pg||
nt|athene: but still|pg||
nt|athene: ace and a diamond was 100% to make 3@D at that point|pg||
nt|hawe45: This will not be the best played hand of the tournament|pg||
nt|athene: definitely very bad play|pg||
nt|athene: i guess "first board syndrome"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north thought that west had the clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: All beginning is difficult|pg||
nt|athene: since west bid them|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: maybe he did not check what 1nt meant|pg||
nt|jcomyn: might as well find out about chilean weather|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: *buzz saws"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: get out fast before you lose your head|pg||
nt|bobholl: a of @C claim|pg||
nt|granguru: nice weather here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: could have been a lot worse|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: and he did not bother to even ruff high first time|pg||
nt|athene: so he must have been really sure west had club length|pg||
nt|athene: that suggests he just did not pay attention to the bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Would not have helped|pg||
nt|hawe45: ruffing high|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: no, of course not, but the fact that he didn't does show he didn't even consider that east might be the one with the long clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Fred madea point in rec.games.bridge recently avout arriving early to a tournament to free your mind of clutter before the 1st board... :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: was down and makes now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|woozle: 8 imps to EW, richly deserved by NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: 90% of the pecs could:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: specs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: 10% are blind?|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 1 in the OR (Open Room) EW have bid to a very agressive 4@h, which may make.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ianmcc: well put|pg||
nt|andyv:  very unusual @d play...are we sure Fulvio ducked the @d?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which suggests boot is down already|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: I'm not do sure the first round @H finesse is the percentage play|pg||
nt|cumino: Wrong play by Comella (safe playing Q@S or club) and wrong defence by Alfredo. |pg||
nt|kemperg: so it is Paolo|pg||
nt|cumino: Or at least what we have seen :)|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer is going to go down agains the 4-1 trump break there.|pg||
nt|kemperg: all hands makes it easyer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: These two teams are 1st (Sbarigia) and 2nd with a 17 VP gap. So Miroglio needs to win by at least 24-6 VP to overtake Sbarigia|pg||
nt|j0i: We got a sibling rivalry in this match :) Ida and Mikael Grönkvist|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
nt|psyck: unlikely S would try pd entry with all hcp marked though|pg||
nt|rv: early summer rains have really cooled temperature here in Bangalore|pg||
nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: end april time is like ending the summer...not so cold not so warm...|pg||
nt|daman: so*|pg||
nt|daman: with another entry in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo´s partner is around 45/47 years nice guy|pg||
nt|athene: he might downgrade to 1nt - 4333, poor spot cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I might have given up the contract a trick earlier with a low heart lead at trick 1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jóhann Sigurdarson|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am sure you would find the low diamond, Bill :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
nt|athene: but still it is an 18 and not that bad an 18|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree with 1nt here|pg||
nt|athene: now it's usual to treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter|pg||
nt|j0i: Hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|cumino: Hard to believe Alfredo didn't play clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: but he need to discard a@D on @s|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@C presumably a 'good raise or better'.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: may try for slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: anybody for 3@C by south?|pg||
nt|fann4: Some would have splintered over 2@C, if available.|pg||
nt|kemperg: perhaps he is to strong for splinter|pg||
nt|cumino: Souh annot bid 3@C because it is @H @D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed but wouldnt bid 3c vul anyway|pg||
nt|fann4: RKC (Roman Key card) would fine a key card and the trump Q missing, so not a good slam, but the other room they may push for it.|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah cant find a CC, what is 2NT then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they have a higher range for their 2NT opening I assume|pg||
nt|fann4: No, they stopped in 4@S there.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: certainly, with the hand record, instantly|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
nt|psyck: no problems in 4@h with trump breaking if they can get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Kristina have we got our vugrapher around to ask for any doubts?|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't know, we can try :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Jeff|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi again Krishna:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract |pg||
nt|jcomyn: h nicely placed|pg||
nt|athene: but Versace wants to get both majors into it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s too|pg||
nt|kemperg: specialy with the bad 4 and good 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: To win by 24-6 on the 16-board scale you need 37 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: heading for trouble|pg||
nt|caruga: is this a strong club?|pg||
nt|rv: Cossu's pass says I want to play here?|pg||
nt|daman: yes   the discard would be necessary|pg||
nt|granguru: fantoni nunes range is diff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East takes a reasonable gamble - and loses|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Interesting that NS sold out here - you really can't afford to let them have the auction to themselves|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was South polishing her nails when 1@C was bid?  What happened to the 1@H overcall?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
nt|j0i: You would have thought S would have gotten in with 1@H or at least 2@h after 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You still a junior, Jóhann?|pg||
nt|j0i: no, turning 26 this year :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
nt|xenya: Q|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D control & slam prop that N will decline |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|fann4: Not good to have North playing it.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 tricks could be claim soon after 2 round @H |pg||
nt|rv: I play pass here by West says I want to play in 1@d XX|pg||
nt|granguru: thats the top level meaning|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psyck: I'm told 3@c was transfer last deal, that makes sense|pg||
nt|psyck: Common to play transfers after intervention|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H = 2/2 help to make contract easy |pg||
nt|caruga: me too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri-Cossu possibly play it differently|pg||
nt|granguru: I must confess that I agree with it but at the table I use my instinct|pg||
nt|rv: why not lead @sK?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hard to stop now|pg||
nt|kemperg: E says I have told my story|pg||
nt|jcomyn: E has but thats a big w hand|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||
nt|athene: very nice breaks, nice honour mesh - game is there but hard to get to with no great fit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
nt|daman: the @H 10 is nice to have|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptrick and with @h10 S can setup a @D trick|pg||
nt|granguru: but it used to be 20-22|pg||
nt|kemperg: 21-22 on the CC|pg||
nt|granguru: for you to remember all 1 openings are 14+ hcp|pg||
nt|kemperg: told that by 3@C, not splintering??|pg||
nt|jcomyn: w has no intention of dropping this and then the s play|pg||
nt|cumino: No I think 2BT 3 cards raise or better 3@C 4+ cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec tells splinter limited hand, so he is bigger than that|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
nt|fann4: Hard for east NOT to bid it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, North should play the queen, in case partner has @DJxxxx|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
nt|rv: when God has give you KQJ, you lead it:)|pg||
nt|cumino: 2NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Forcing declarer to take the king|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i second that|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo used to win many world championships with Forquet, belladonna, Avarelli, DAlelio and PabisTicci|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|granguru: 1NT is weak 12-14 permits 5M 6m332 or semisolid suit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|granguru: all 2 openings (yes Imean ALL) are 9-13 5+ UNBAl|pg||
nt|daman: a @H shift will hold him to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru: because S thinks that @C might be run  for W discards if defense plays pasively|pg||
nt|granguru: I third it|pg||
nt|rv: can't see a way to beat 1@s on any lead|pg||
nt|granguru: all 3 openings are 5+ weak|pg||
nt|fann4: Of course this can make double dummy - play @SK and run the J, but not likely in real life.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: otherwise 10|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: lot to do  but looks doable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good word that - brave bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand is there,  (per many specs)  but not sure I want to be there |pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could take a while|pg||
nt|psyck: may fin @s into safe hand & be forced to set up @d later|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think mhe will|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru: 3NT any one suited solid suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: want to have x-ray vision to even think of game|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo, also nicknamed the submarine, was considered the best defender in the world |pg||
nt|jcomyn: met him back in 1980 - good lord am i that old|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are world class, but also a bit lucky here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so do i since s likely to be short iun s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: 6 @d 4 @c 2 @s 1 @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats true too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: there we are|pg||
nt|j0i: there is still a change to set it though|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ianmcc: sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 back to Brown|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru: Cima is the only not world champion here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Need that diamond ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: declarer knows that north must be out of diamonds AND south does not have the entry|pg||
nt|fann4: True, south has the longer @C.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|rv: I suspect declarer will make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|granguru: small @S is best now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: didnt think there was an italian who wasnt a world champion|pg||
nt|kemperg: pius 12|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and they'll get it, one way or another|pg||
nt|bjacobs: gettin' ugly|pg||

nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: best defence, holding it to 8|pg||
mc|6|nt|sybarra: but now?|pg||
nt|athene: north must be out of HEARTS sorry|pg||
nt|athene: as the defence took the @HA and switched like that|pg||
nt|caruga: first 6 imps caused by the slam in the board 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Poor old declarer will have to give it to them|pg||

nt|hawe45: No comments|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@h NO PROBLEM THANKS TO @d t |pg||
nt|psyck: W's sequence on deal 1 was likely game forcing, E may have forgotten|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Fantunes playing for Angelini, Lauria-Versace playing for which team? I don't see Zaleski in list of teams...|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C good @H; 4@D good @S 4NT 6-5 minors|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good example of why 6-4 is usually a 1-suiter|pg||
mb|1N|nt|granguru: 4M and 5m: to play|pg||
nt|athene: partner has two more cards in the 4-card suit and it still makes two more tricks in the long suit|pg||
nt|fann4: To have any chance, declarer had to assume North had the @DK - so it was likely that South was then pretty long in @C - but it's easy seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|kemperg: this keeps it exiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S obviously weak |pg||
nt|granguru: and 2 obvious passes|pg||
nt|rv: quick pass by North|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
nt|athene: one more trick sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1nt on N even if only 14|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't bid it if he doesn't guess to bid 1 nt now (too ligth imo)|pg||
nt|granguru: what should E do?|pg||
nt|pelu: u have done your homework. John, wd :)|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so easy to reach unless N overcalls a weak 1NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: same again 6-4 in majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: too early in the day to try swingy bids|pg||
nt|hawe45: Depuis 40 ans...|pg||
nt|hawe45: Sorry, privat|pg||
nt|bobholl: some kind of truscott i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  Especially if E elects to respond|pg||
nt|henryb:  which I would|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: stayman & a 4@H shoot |pg||
nt|rv: close decision, I may pass because nearly half of my values in @s|pg||
nt|granguru: E will run into trouble|pg||
nt|daman: he is a fount of knowledge|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = gazzilli|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well we got the start we wasnted|pg||
nt|fann4: Perfect start for MIR|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H both majors nice convention but now ?! :(|pg||
nt|granguru: decided to pass, which was best as the cards lie|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT in the OR had chances, as the play went.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
nt|rv: L-V playing for Sbarigia, Roma|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@H would have been  a disaster|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Zaleski not fielding team since foreigners not allowed in this event|pg||
nt|granguru: I played the system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I hope nobody was seriously thinking of bidding there|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: would have thought 2d promised secondary s support|pg||
nt|fann4: East must be tempted to try 2@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
nt|granguru: all 1 openings are F1. after 1@S for instance 1N shows 0-9|pg||
nt|fann4: South can't have 3@S on this auction.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes agree.|pg||
nt|j0i: This should go down at least 1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: danger hand with @D 5/0 Q@S off side & a @H looser |pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was min,|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/gazzilli.html|pg||
nt|jbennet: it all comes down what the 6 card suit is like.|pg||
nt|athene: west's @SAJ gets a lot better when partner shows six of them|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: nobut must have 2|pg||
nt|fann4: So a big swing heading back to SBA here, on a 'nothing' board really.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  so what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise i didn't understand the duck :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this aint much better|pg||
nt|jbennet: if however SpQ was h Q then the hand should be bid as both majors.|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks why cima doesn't use stayman - well, this is what we are talking about|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||
nt|athene: he has SPADES (and hearts on the side)|pg||
nt|fann4: Probably 2 off on this lead.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kemperg: 2@S any 4card|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like no breaks :) - 2NT was a possible winner|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sommer: nice and easy, wd|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S 3crd support|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: now i bid 2s on the s hand after the x|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good lead - from his shorter holding in partner's suits|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
nt|granguru: why is garozzo playing then?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h8|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fann4: It was tough for south after the x of 2@D. Should he pull to 2@S before he knows what west is going to do? |pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
nt|caruga: foreign players are allowed|pg||
nt|caruga: we've players from France, Poland, Venezuela....|pg||
nt|pelu: @H back - if decl has @h10 N can kill the ruff of the 4. @d|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Madala had a 2@h-opening in S! (@h+minor)|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 3@CX - looks like down 2 - but u never know :(|pg||
nt|daman: the auction almost guarantees that declarer is 3541 |pg||
nt|daman: and so ot will help with the D|pg||
nt|daman: it*|pg||
nt|xenya: essentially a 50% game, and you can't expect juniors to throw the chance away|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||
nt|athene: clearly this is trivial unless south has all the hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just has to hope trump are breaking now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: nunes fantoni didn't take their tricks against 4@H either|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, 8 will be entry now :)|pg||
nt|athene: @D8 nice entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - that´s better|pg||
nt|fann4: and did the 2@D bid guarantee some @S tolerance? That's not clear - maybe he had a long @d suit and not 2@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: surely pass and hope 1nt vul goes down|pg||
nt|fann4: Whatever, looks like 9imps heading back to SBA|pg||
nt|kemperg: interesting to know if S had a weak 2@D in his system, then N shouldhave bid 2 @S now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: am a great believer in guaranteeing a doubleton of pards suit before bidding suit of my own|pg||
pc|s9|nt|granguru: Hamaoui is from venezuela but also italian|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: sorry unless north has all the hearts|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entry in dummy for the 2 finnesse |pg||
nt|kemperg: specialy when you could not open yours|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in this type of situation|pg||
nt|cumino: May be only 1 down|pg||
nt|kemperg: and for ops its more risky to dbl 2 major, game |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|psyck: that would be a likely explanation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c to shorten dummys trumph|pg||
nt|pelu: this trick prove that even the italians cant see all cards :)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||

nt|psyck: the least you would expect from this legend :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 84 year old think|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://tinyurl.com/5w9ppn3|pg||

nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :) ty not far |pg||
nt|psyck: 84 later this year i think|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@S by NS will be an easy task|pg||
nt|granguru: the main idea was 1. to have always and alternative to run into |pg||
nt|granguru: as you would, as partner never fall into a void dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: will they defend or not|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S is on here. On the surface it looks like it was misplayed in the OR. After 1 rd of trumps ending in dummy, declarer must abandon trumps and play a @C.|pg||
nt|j0i: a thin 4@s game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
nt|caruga: do you all bid with N?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|athene: south is close, in my opinion, to a double of 2@H (he is in the pre-balancing position)|pg||
nt|jbennet: as usual activity will now be rewarded.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The girls in the other room played 3Nt from the better side on Board 1, and so gained an imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|granguru: 2. you can lead trumps agaisnt any doubled contract if it was the case|pg||
nt|athene: but combination of mediocre shape and minimum hcp and being vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: so pass is sensible enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no @S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Once again, N/S strangely silent ... I would have taken a youthful risk and overcalled 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi has been practicing with N quite a bit on BBO recently, you can catch him with the id sillafu here often|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly 1@S would not have been forcing by S here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not bad hands for a start for Benito 16/18/17/19 in 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s might now go overboard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This time, though, no harm done|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: Bridggida, the goddess of Bridge, clearly favors him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
nt|pelu: u see "only" 13 HCP so N cant open 1@h (= 14+)|pg||
nt|daman: Running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 12/13 also allowed|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer needs 2 ruffs in dummy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs probably shows both minors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Mikael Westerlud|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Westerlund, sry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: well, what would 2nt show? this is a bit odd i have to say|pg||
pc|c3|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D making N 3Nt only by S|pg||
nt|fann4: maybe heading to 3N by S, if N bids 3@H now.|pg||
nt|granguru: if @D forces N to a new bid 4@S can be reached|pg||
nt|granguru: ditto|pg||
nt|kemperg: stif K not good|pg||
nt|granguru: 3. There was a chance to find a 4-4 fit even if you opened a "weak 2"|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mikael|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
nt|granguru: good bid by Montanari|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know tha ditto system|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And in fact, it might have worked well ... not helping to clue E/W in to their effective fit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
nt|fann4: Down a lot if the @DK offside - 5@D much better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: brave or what?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hi there Vladimir :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be used to poor overcalls|pg||
nt|granguru: I am also not accustomed to bid suits like N, but it is a good strategy to enter over 1 in a minor  with such type of semisolid suits|pg||
nt|caruga: NS are very good and very young players|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: but lauria-versace do have a lot of funky little bits of system that come up in odd places :)|pg||
nt|fann4: A commentator in the OR has said - MIR will start afresh after this board, as Versace won't fail to make 4@S, I guess.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well he did go down in 6s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they are heding to a good 5@D|pg||
nt|granguru: because it is around 50% chance that NT might be bid by 3rd hand so defense wins a critical tempo if the lead is in the mentioned suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if my pard overcalled vul I wont stop in 4s|pg||
nt|granguru: by passing the chances that partner leads another suit are overwhelming|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H lead expected |pg||
nt|fann4: No he didn't - his partner did.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S was "wheater/or"..and then 3@C showed 5c @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: NS stole the auction from EW    Ew can make at least 8 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|daman: 9 actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: according to the OR|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: oh yes thats true|pg||
nt|fann4: At this point in the OR, declarer played a 2nd trump, and that was goodbye.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|daman: ufffff|pg||
nt|jbennet: and now folks lauria entered the bidding on the 3 level vulnerable and earned himself a wel deserved double part-score swing.|pg||
nt|athene: these partscore hands are 6 imps a time so it's not enough just to say "i might go for 500, i have to pass"|pg||
nt|jbennet: lucky?? no the least. just acting with the odds.|pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering what i meant when i mentioned that south was in the "pre-balancing" position - he isn't actually in the passout seat, but opps have had a limited fit ...|pg||
nt|athene: auction|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  some think it was nmf, but does that guarantee @hs?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the bidding makes more sense now, thanks |pg||

nt|granguru: you must be very young  john|pg||
nt|kemperg: :) well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: so he can see 2@H might well get passed out and he wants to compete if so|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. it will indeed once in a blue moon be a layout such as a) they dont have a playable trump-suit |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8th trick|pg||

nt|cumino: Interesteng 5@H|pg||
nt|cumino: NS|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes, but with @S start and continuation not easy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|woozle: Well, Anderson gets a chance to show off his cardplay, and if he does, Buchen gets a chance to show off his defense|pg||

nt|fann4: Certainly a big swing possibility. West may not open in the other room or declarer may still take the @D finesse.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
nt|granguru: fit is what its all this game about|pg||
nt|caruga: isn't easy|pg||
nt|granguru: and there is an important 4th adventage: the relay. It permits opener to show the 5-4 or the 6th card suit at ease|pg||
nt|dima:  hi all :) 6@h on 1-1 split?|pg||
nt|daman: yo Dima|pg||
nt|daman: You Di Ma|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible that NS use 3@C there to show both minors because if you start with 2NT you allow east to double to suggest a penalty|pg||
mb|1S!|an|transfer to NT |nt|mikael_w: At this table we see Karlsson/Gullberg a really strong young pair. And their team "Guldberg" are huge favorits to win the swedish championship this year. And Grönkvist/Petersen is ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: a really young girlpair. They will also play in the uropean championship for sweden in the "Girls-class"|pg||
nt|xenya: on a different layout, declarer might have suffered a ruff|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
nt|pelu: but NS are missing 2 key-cards - so no slam|pg||
nt|dima:  If they find out that they have 11 trumps and havea chance to Qbid @d ace on the way ... but unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C might make it harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
nt|jbennet: but for every -500 the activity philosophy will earn 8-10 partscore swings. (worth 4-6 IMP:s every time)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get closer |pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially as s d are pretty scruffy|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C-4@D might do it|pg||
nt|athene: NS play a slightly modified form of stayman|pg||
nt|jcomyn: have to go for it|pg||
nt|fann4: I would imagine that EW should start stepping things up in the OR - they must know that going down in 4@S on bd 4 was a shocker.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||

nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
nt|granguru: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT probably 18-20|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
nt|psyck: can set up an extra @s trick as cards are to get home|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: J@D lead or 10@D with agreement |pg||
nt|jcomyn: can hardly bid on now|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spects claim that the slam sh be bid - but when N ask for keycards he will get 2 - could be @HK and @DA - then missing 2 Aces|pg||
nt|dima:  Turbo shows even number of key cards so Fulvio knows they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|granguru: well seems yes|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think that the 2NT shows both minor BUT south shall choose clubs if eqal length.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H showed a maximum hand without majors|pg||
nt|granguru: many other things like a 5th (if memory doest fail) with his wife Lea Dupont, a pro/am victory with Martin Woltman (wollies) watching now here|pg||
nt|athene: OR four hearts]|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rv: back, sry had conn problems|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, THAT is an importent 8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Without it, he has to find the @HQ play here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
nt|granguru: Coach of italian natl team and the italian juniors - european champios|pg||
nt|jbennet: whats does 3 club mean???|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just asking what he has|pg||
nt|jcomyn: assdume 5d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but no entry in parner to make damagge |pg||
nt|psyck: actully not, cannot afford it now|pg||
nt|granguru: if it is a cue|pg||
nt|j0i: Transfers after 1@c are popular in Iceland as well, though I have never tried it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: but can endplay S |pg||
nt|pelu: so for sure impossible to bid if u dont just use dice's :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, there is the matter of finding @SQ perhaps|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
nt|granguru: 6 reached|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
nt|fann4: The lead sorted out the trump suit for declarer, but without it the right play is small to the Q, and it if loses, cash the A next.|pg||
nt|fann4: On the basis that the person who won the K is more likely to have done so from K10xx rather than a singleton K.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know for sure his P had @C Q|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@C in N -1 |pg||
nt|psyck: @c doubleton sees him home too|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's see how he goes about it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They are becoming popular everywhere.  I play it even, but I actually think it's an inferior style ...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cuttysark: it is particularly important to overcall when they play transfers - disrupt their rhythm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: and may be someone has no @C|pg||
nt|granguru: Merit for Franchi|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@D is a VERY though bid to make at the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree we see so few minor slams these days|pg||
nt|caruga: agree|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sommer: closer to 8 than to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: on spot 9 make |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mikael_w: yes, But I think you always "finds" it when you play safe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rv: yes, tough to get to this slam, if I had @DQ or @DT in Franchi's hand, I might have bid 3@d on 2@c to set suit with an extra card than min |pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/TurboConvention.pdf|pg||
nt|granguru: good tip daman|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: a guess is that 2NT at 3rd bidding turn would show minimum to allow then to play 2NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|woozle: ducking the opening heart lead is leaving Smolanko poorly placed - it's hard to see him going down if he rises with the ace and knocks out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ill tell him|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|woozle: Perhaps Christie is contemplating an undercut|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has he fallen asleep?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: "thanks"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: Good defence ... a phony threat, but it changes the whole hand for declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: south might vaguely have had thoughts of 6@C, but if so, they must have been only very vague ones|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fann4: Push board here.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh, now he dont need the @s-trick|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yeah, this is the end|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kemperg: @HJ gives it away:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcomyn: i dont think 3c shows c more likely d|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|jameslee 2: board 4 now call in W as dealer and playing 3nt |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Realistically, I don't think there was any beating it|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|woozle: now Buchen tries desperately to break spades, but Smolanko, try as he might, can't go down|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I have not tried transfers sine I mainly play a natural club, but can see there are plusses and minusses|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jameslee 2: 1@S-2@D-3Nt board 4|pg||
nt|psyck: that should be comfortable then|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 4, in the OR (Open Room) W passed, so big swing heading back to MIR|pg||
nt|psyck: as W did not open & NT right sided|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
nt|j0i: now it's going to make|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: benito nice defence tried for the drop of the big other honor @D how many times we find us in this deal |pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I like strong nt with this s hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: may struggle to get this many viewers for the bowl...|pg||
nt|athene: Fantunues' 2-openers are much more relaxed in third|pg||
nt|hawe45: My grandmother would make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo in 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|daman: EW are in 3@CX in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: will north bid 1nt over 1@H?|pg||
nt|jbennet: too many controlls for that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so it's ugly, but so are the alternatives|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR declarer play a @S to the K - easy:)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: one certaint w aint defending|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: would she know how to bid it in Angelini's system though? :)|pg||
nt|athene: "i'm not opening 1@D with 1 diamond and six clubs!"|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@H depends on the @SK position|pg||
nt|jbennet: D best|pg||
nt|athene: i would be a 1NTer i think|pg||
nt|athene: i don't want to double and hear diamonds from partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: S had a chance to find 5@C by bidding 2@C....|pg||
nt|hawe45: She would bid 1 @H - 3 @H - 4 @H - all alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@D or 7@H even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but when s passes no slam bid|pg||
nt|rv: need @s 3-3 or honor doubleton inside, poor slam|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito, at 83 can play 10 different full systems ...|pg||
nt|kemperg: E is not expecting a @D fit:)|pg||
nt|cumino: In the other room 1H 2H 3NT = 4H with cards|pg||
mb|2H|an|8-11, 3!h|nt|jbennet: some times overcall 1NT with singleton honour is OK but this is not such an occasion.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: whether it shows 2, 3, 4, 5, whatever|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gosh. I thought they were for those playing a fester: 2+ clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone open in s|pg||
nt|pelu: also here?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|mikael_w: no, And now n/s has bidding really hard many boards and it has been right every time|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: NO|pg||
nt|athene: so east bid 1nt over a strong club with clubs, now 1@H with spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: I´am proud of the fact, that I do´nt understand one single of these bids|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo east in 4@S here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if they are too sophisticated they'l discover missing @D Q|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knows 65 now i suppose so simple RKC can do the trick now (7@D)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he surely takes enough time for it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: well, versace is a good partner|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobholl: no on previous one|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be one of his better fits:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D finessed in board 4 hedding to a confortable 630 swing |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can one open 4th in hand - and let the opponents play - undoubled|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi peter|pg||
nt|fann4: the dbl presumably showed @H, and 2@H showed 4 card support.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 12-12|pg||
nt|granguru: @Sk stiff, doubleton or tripleton on side|pg||
nt|pelu: would X from Fantoni be take out - also here??|pg||
nt|athene: lauria was hoping he would bid the right suit and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: IF Buratti had bid 2@C, N might have fallen i love with his hand and go for 5@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter:) |pg||
nt|granguru: no one would think of it at the table...just commenting how easy 4@h will be|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 6-4 h fit not helpful defending|pg||
nt|fann4: How to play trumps here? If they are 2-2 anything works (declarer has to ruff at least 1@C presumably)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: True ... in my part of the world, the whole method is geared around a VERY short club - 1@D openings showing 4+ or even 5+ diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it seems so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The point is that transfers give you more room for investigation later because 1@D takes up less space than 1@H, 1@H less than 1@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and here we go again|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45: Look at this board, no mistake possible in the play|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps and two clubs to lose here|pg||
nt|xenya: well this will go down?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Not right this time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: but this game is a pretty good one. but this time the cards are not in favor|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite a poor game, I think, but not hopeless|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: there is a defense to strong @c called DONTTON where 1 level bids are transfers showing length or shortness in the next suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :(|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed overcalling 1nT might have caused a missed an excellent 4 msp|pg||
nt|athene: now versace might have to decide whether to deep finesse the heart or play east for a singleton honour|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what should he have done if he had got a D response.|pg||
nt|jbennet: treat the hand as a 18-20 NT of course.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that he would like to just crossruff it - but to cash two heart tricks (or three) he needs to draw east's trumps|pg||
nt|athene: so he is a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene: of course to cash the @CK he needs to draw west's trumps too!|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see this coming home|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how a 1nt overcall would have fared but it looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will take some time i daresay|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks, can we not just play west for both hearts? well, yes, but if we draw trumps and do that we only make 3 trumps, 3 hearts, @CAK, and one ruff|pg||
nt|athene: no way to organize TWO diamond ruffs and keep control|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes a 4-4 trump fit just ain't enough|pg||
nt|jbennet: looking at NS hands alone 4sp looks good. But knowing about the club suit.|pg||
nt|athene: on this sort of hand what you really, really want is a ninth trump|pg||
nt|jbennet: N might have realized that the breaks was bad (knowing bith west and south was short in clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: still, these borderline game contracts in a 4-4 fit are really tricky to defend|pg||
nt|athene: and versace has had a lot of practice at making them|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lets see D king at tricks 2.|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps 3+3+2 D ruffs+AK might be possible.|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 4 spades an overbid??|pg||
nt|athene: so if he plays the @DK to the ace, what does Garozzo do?|pg||
nt|jbennet: the defence prevails if for example garozzo bangs down AX in spades.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: easy grand - more interestig to bid without @cA |pg||
nt|rv: OR, North did bid 3@d on 1@s by South and now South could visualize slam easily|pg||
nt|granguru: but there are still some other chances with @SKxxx in W,,such as @CKQ alone|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|psyck: & 2 level bids like DONT|pg||
nt|athene: well, no-one managed to find their 5-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: but there is work to be done|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|psyck: and Pass lead directional in Pointed suits, & Double lead directional in Rounded suits :)|pg||
nt|psyck: So far we have been able to follow NS bidding anyway, usually they are more esoteric :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/2 no problem in 4@H = or Q@C placed for +1|pg||
nt|jbennet: h to the 7?|pg||
nt|granguru: for the askers: Leo Cima is from Tuscany a very good player, training almost daily with Benito thru Internet|pg||
nt|granguru: as said 45/47 years old|pg||
nt|kemperg: called 100 dog?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: Garozzo is smispi?|pg||
nt|athene: no, that's dano de falco|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp looks in fact unmakeable as long as defence doesnt slip.|pg||
nt|granguru: Smispi is Dano de Falco|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is sillafu here|pg||
nt|kemperg: No sillafu, mixed them|pg||
nt|granguru: LAURIA was born one year later as me 1946|pg||
nt|athene: of course it would help declarer if garozzo had overruffed there|pg||
nt|granguru: Versace is much younger 1969 I think|pg||
nt|athene: you shouldn't give up the ace of trumps so casually|pg||
nt|athene: holding Axx of trumps in defence is very powerful in many ways|pg||
nt|athene: for example, often declarer wants to draw exactly two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but you can prevent that by ducking the first round|pg||
nt|athene: then if a second round is played you can win and play a third|pg||
nt|jbennet: A diamond now. to the ace. if garozzo at that stage plays AX in spades. then 4 sp will make|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like imps to ew|pg||
nt|kemperg: think that wil happen |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1 off now|pg||
nt|fann4: So, 14 imps for MIR, putting them 10 ahead. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: had 4s made in the other room on bd 4 the fat might really be in the fire|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|woozle: The defense here seem to have taken to heart Zia's tip "always play the nine"|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really hope to make use of the diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, of course, you tend to say "sayonara" to the hands with diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: all the grandmothers in the audience are shaking their heads|pg||
nt|pelu: well defended by Nunes|pg||
nt|dima:  One might use 3@d for takeout and X for penalty but who am I to suggest here ... :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: so you just have to scramble some tricks by ruffing hearts|pg||
nt|mikael_w: for junior this MUST be a verry good game when even I want to be in it in teams :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: not or, need both|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry true need to find Q@C to make |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kemperg: losing 2 @S or 1@S + 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: none of these gimmicks are free|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, you need to win finesses in both clubs and diamonds, and also avoid several other dangers, such as 4-1 trumps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sommer: I was talking about board 5 of course:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..where NS make 5@C|pg||
nt|xenya: @D switch would have beaten it by 2 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: i believe it was Belladonna's Bridge Tip to "hold up the ace of trumps!"|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo-belladonna top pair in the 1970s, early 80s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: You bid 1@S with diamonds, splendid idea when you have no major|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree -100 could be good for ew|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jbennet: yep he didnt play a D to ace so now he have opened himself for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think you can go back further than that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kib says last world title was as far back as 75|pg||
nt|jbennet: only way to let 4 sp now is overruffing and return spade. then and only then 4 sp makes|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is just trying to work out if he can beat it if versace has five trumps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jameslee 2: 3 loose always |pg||
nt|fann4: Nothing much to this hand really.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so needs to find the Q@C |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but versace would not have had anything like such a problem with five spades in his hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: luckily   EW avoided a big penalty because of system|pg||
nt|jbennet: if declare has 5 trumps there nothing to be done.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You really don't want to be in it|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: tie game now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: will not try drop this time :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But their system just got them ... the 8-11 raise, aggressive but reasonable try, aggressive but reasonable accept|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: basically there is a big practical advantage in complicated artificial schemes of interference|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: in theory it is supposed to give the other side more room |pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumf now and its 2 down too, but can not be found|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bjacobs: and with clubs?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jameslee 2: @S & J@C |pg||

nt|jcomyn: apparently benito won first title in 1961|pg||

nt|athene: and more chances to have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 5 EW also in 3N in the OR.|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slipped it thru|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is that showing the suit bid, or takeout of the suit shown, or what?|pg||
nt|athene: or penalty interest?|pg||
nt|athene: it all needs agreements|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i assume west actually overruffed that|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: but now the defence can't stop the @S8 scoring|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead at trick 1 (or trick 2) and it was a bit more interesting|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: any advance on two off?|pg||

nt|woozle: 4H looks excellent NS - the clubs establish with one ruff|pg||
nt|woozle: Hard to reach though - someone has to bid an awful lot|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can perhaps still survive by ruffing hearts and unblocking the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky 3N for NS but will not get there|pg||
nt|fann4: more likely 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid this one|pg||
nt|rv: on brd 21, even on 2@c Franchi would have considered 3@d, chose to bid 2@d and subsequently changed his mind and bid 4@d |pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats shows what a great game bridge is - its longevity|pg||
nt|fann4: 3@H can make here if declarer guesses how to play the @C suit.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: meanwhile EW have 12 tricks in a cold game - it would be mucg more difficult to find @HQ in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and then lead the @DQ forcing west to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: tap tap|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they didnt find the sacrifice, despite Bocchi bid both @D and @S!!|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||
nt|hawe45: They will not bid 5@C before midnight...|pg||
nt|athene: and throwing a club loser from dummy when he does|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S?|pg||
nt|daman: intermediate?|pg||
nt|daman: 9-13|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1|pg||
nt|granguru: a @S too much|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobholl: east has a nice hand but no bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: So do I. I don't think that anybody figured out the diamond tap thing without Deep Finesse though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Double?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in b 4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slam but can it be bid|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: you surely have to do something over 3@S with that east hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: this better|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S could push lets see |pg||
nt|kemperg: good 13|pg||
nt|daman: I thought you needed 14 HCP to open 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: or good 12/13|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR, declarer went to dummy and played a @C to the Q, losing 3 tricks.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Did she really Pass?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Needless to say, the trump lead helped :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sommer: this X is outside my knowledge:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c prob either @c or some strong hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (I should wat ch the play more :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: easy 4@S bid now for south - in fact larry thinks he should bid 5@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|pelu: I was told tyhat 13 good HCP also ok - and this hand for sure good 13 - remember that 1-openings are F1|pg||
nt|daman: I wasn't certain if the held to the 14+   as John explained in the beginning|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 15-17, no M are opened 1@C then 1N|pg||
nt|fann4: A small @C towards dummy's J, and then ducking a @C next time wins.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Moa must have miscounted her hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
nt|fann4: But here it's neither|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here|pg||
nt|fann4: Suprising initial pass here by south.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be playing here at all|pg||
nt|fann4: and then dbl instead of 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
nt|daman: now that we have that straight...........|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 18-19, no M are opened 1@D then NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)http://www.archiviobridge.it/FantoniNunes-CCard2-0.pdf|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
nt|psyck: strong being 15+ maybe|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: end 2@D |pg||
nt|jbennet: B schapiro won his first Gold Cup -title 1945 and his last  1997.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ireland's greatest ever woman player will be 100 in september|pg||
nt|granguru: trivia: Why the Blue team is called like that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: played blue club i darseay|pg||
nt|athene: they formed two squads to select a team|pg||
nt|jbennet: the game does indeed have a life prolonging element in itsself.|pg||
nt|athene: the red squad and the blue squad|pg||
nt|granguru: good athene!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A spectator just messged that it shows 15-17 with 5@D and 4@H.|pg||
nt|fann4: I have my doubts.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: making 11 ruff a @S & K@H placed |pg||
nt|pelu: Ns can win 1@S and EW 9-10 tricks - so now they are on 5-level :):)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and  http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: optimism rewarded|pg||
nt|granguru: it is not due to the italian squad colors|pg||
nt|jbennet: no i think blue team is named after the bidding system "blue club"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but did they play blue or roman club|pg||
nt|granguru: The name apparently derived from the 1956 ItaLIAN trials, when the blue team defeated the red team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that solves that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/3 for the 11 trick |pg||
nt|psyck: Papi understandably did not want to play in 1N with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|caruga: 3@S=heavy limit|pg||
nt|rv: some might even bid 4@s on Franchi's hand |pg||
nt|fann4: this should make, for a push board|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
nt|fann4: Many would just pass 1N, on the basis that pard is likely to have some @C, having skipped both majors.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no chance on a bad day, but this isn't one of those|pg||
nt|granguru: the blue team system received its name from the blue team memebers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: martin johnston says it was neapolitan club - well there yar|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This looks unreal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they play strong pass on odd boards? :)|pg||
nt|j0i: Could be hard to make this one|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, they play odd pass on strong boards|pg||
nt|cuttysark: or odd pass on strong boards?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (You are too quick, Bill)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: sorrrry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please explain, Staffan|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Such an obvious comment - it was a speed typing contest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what is Moa's initial pass?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
nt|pelu: we have not aeen the best of Fantoni in the last 2 boards :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: strange lead|pg||
nt|daman: unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: no good|pg||
nt|athene: he is banking on the diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not the winning line here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could never make it with heart ruffs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||
nt|caruga: 100% tied.....in a bad day or today :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: play in a BBO tournament on one of these and you are 2 down|pg||
nt|caruga: no, only 99%|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trumps 5-0 club finesse wrong to be going on with|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @HQ would be unfortunate|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: S can expect @Cs 5-3 and 4 by pd - and C10 will stop some cross_ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: how can u pass with that s hand unless u are a real mouse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||
nt|rv: Fabio, as per Roland's mail we have 9 rounds of RR, is this last round and 2 to qualify from each group?|pg||
nt|j0i: there it went i think|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|granguru: turkey is awakening...|pg||
nt|caruga: I think here we have only 9 rounds and a champion after the RR|pg||
nt|rv: this broadcast heading says 6/6 and we seem to have 2 groups as well?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but just too tempting|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: duck!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sommer: it is close to 50% after S opened and nothing tells that @H are 5-1, so ok...close to 50%|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone. sry for beiong late|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|sommer: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|athene: wants diamonds to break evenly|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a lucky contract, this - better chance from North if East leads a club|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|j0i: had to double finesse the spade|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Error by operator, this is 6/9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Complete round-robin and that's it|pg||
nt|rv: ok, ty Roland|pg||
nt|rv: he can even ruff with @SJ and play @s to T catering to 4-1 breaks|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|nt|hawe45: Expensive now|pg||
nt|athene: if north had doubled (an ace facing an opening bid) that might have tipped declarer off to the winning line|pg||
nt|rv: really surprised with bidding of both N & S in OR, in my view both were a bit timid|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like "all" spects agree with the lead :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @c-lead was extreamly good lead. And @c continuing now can even beat the contract|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: see the pint half empty in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: now a squeeze that is not there:)|pg||
nt|pelu: but as they - correct - analy: 5@C is can make on all leads - eliminate majors and play @D10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fann4: On bd 6 in the OR, N very conservatively passed 2@H (here N jumped straight to 4@H), so a missed game for MIR|pg||
pc|cT|nt|woozle: Klinger seems to be toying with a 54321 point count...armed with that method, the North hand is just average in high cards (15)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can S strip the read suits and duck a @s to E hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure East has a problem, but if u look for perfect hand by partner - u almost never find them :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And of course, no reason to do so|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45: How can you possibly play trumps - with 3-4 @H-loosers|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out that if declarer is going to rely on 2-2 diamonds he could just as well do that before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he can make making use  of the @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 1 down ? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|woozle: When I adopt a point-count like that, check my pulse|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Girls in the other room bid game on Board 4, building a substantial lead.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: sorry, 17 for the north hand, slightly above average|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: yes|pg||

pc|s4|nt|psyck: quite a pass, maybe being NV influenced him|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 6 for Papi team then 18/12|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  I guess not (that would have been dbl dummy for sure)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Naked|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcome Ralf |pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||
nt|bobholl: but should go down|pg||
nt|fann4: This is not a particularly great slam, but EW could climb quite high here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if they try to go to 6@H |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d either nmf or some kind of GF checkback|pg||
nt|granguru: Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina was 13 when she came to play to Chile a junior tourney...we saw she would be a world champion sooner or later...|pg||
nt|jbennet: south refrained from insisting on 4hwith his balanced shape and wk suit.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sommer: 2@D may be GF relais (stronger than 2@C)|pg||
nt|sommer: "double check-back|pg||
nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is all ghetting a bit confusing since we now have a kib saying vanderbilt club was first|pg||
nt|jcomyn: something hs occurred to me over the past few days - I havent seen one psyche. Do Italians never psyche|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
nt|granguru: well Fantoni is NOT going to lead a @H against 6@C..but over 3NT :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, strong  club methods have been around almost since the very start of the game|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: Uggeri will finally get on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead might be worst for N|pg||
nt|andyv:  S|pg||
nt|athene: sadly partner doesn't have @HJxx :)|pg||
nt|rv: E-W should make 8 tricks here, N-S could have competed in either black suit for only 1 down|pg||
nt|cumino: 4@D seems wrong|pg||
nt|fann4: John, I'd say most top players don't do much psyching at all - they don't have to.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbennet: 6322 with weak suit and secondary values in side suits.|pg||
nt|athene: the blue team played traditional methods their first couple of years|pg||
nt|athene:  then eugenio chiaradia designed the forcing club systems with canapé|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is polish the newest|pg||
nt|kemperg: only Zia likes it:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think someone should have bid 3@S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: whith the @d-J onside it seems like 3 @h will make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: It´s a long way... Why not a direct 4@h after the rebid 1nt from W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 nt will be ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H made in other room on previous hand so angelini loses|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good stop |pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 7 in the OR, NS amazingly reached the cold 3N.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as the cards lay down|pg||
nt|fann4: 22 high card points between them, no particularly long suits and it's cold.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: naked chicks?   is there a webcam?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Down, Bill|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: duck first @s and partner will show his entry|pg||
nt|bobholl: ay ay now even 2 down but not bad play|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not even 3rd in hand not vul|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck: they were making up for the previous deal :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Yet the hand before they stopped in 2@H with 25pts!|pg||
nt|pelu: also 3Nt in OR - @SJ lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: who started this anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: they like their trump leads|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: yes, she had both beauty and talent|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|j0i: We use "bara" alot in Iceland with another meaning, now i know why the swedes always look at me funny when i talk|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sommer: ..4@H too..as said already with "pick a game"|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes:)|pg||
nt|athene: dunno, think we are getting sidetracked :) let's look at 4@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|woozle: With nine certain tricks in view, Smolanko doesn't bother to duck the opening lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes sorry didnt mean to repeat |pg||
pc|hK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbennet: should be bid as 5332 (if having done home work properly then there should be possibilty to show 6 Card suit Game forcing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so lon ago i cant remem,ber yes i agree|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: @CJ on the @DJ|pg||
nt|jbennet: below 3NT.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: is there any chance to make this?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that was the OTHER red jack|pg||
pc|dT|nt|granguru: hard to say what was predominant on her|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: lauria will have cashed his @DJ throwing the @Cj first|pg||
nt|athene: then led the @HJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: cash @CAK and play ace and a diamond, hope for a ruff and discard?|pg||
nt|fann4: And it's vul too, so new leader coming up.|pg||
nt|psyck: could afford safety play in @h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if other team go & make as spec tell me 12 is cold on a squeeze |pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: or hope for a minor suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||
nt|athene: no play for this as long as someone keeps spades and someone keeps diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be a big swing here |pg||
nt|psyck: only after @c lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: cash the @CK and run the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: cash  both clubs and run the hearts you might as well|pg||
nt|granguru: Giorgio Belladonna and Walter Avarelli played the Roman System (3 versions made)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Trump lead was a reasonae shot here - but nothing will beat this game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: they have to divide their @D and @S stoppers otherwise made :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: tx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fann4: this will be a push, so at the half way stage MIR needs a further 27imps to win the event.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito Garozzo and Pietro Forquet played Blue Team|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jbennet: indeed he was lucky.|pg||
nt|jbennet: south.|pg||
nt|granguru: Mimmo D'Alelio and Camillo Pabis-Ticci played Arno|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and all our 10,000 kibs have a different version|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: thx all, have to dash,  called to do "real work"  sorry  cu later |pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: but a squeeze would need the diamond finesse too and west isn't going to have both minors|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hi krishna:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: As of today, BBO has decided to deduct 1 point for every typo we spot. Serious typos = 5 points. You will be able to see how many you made over 30 days when you look at next ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: month's pay cheque|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was reasonable, but I am quite pleased that they somehow didn't get even a single trump lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: the clock is ticking|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: slams a plenty today|pg||

nt|athene: (i am talking about the defence to 4@H of course sorry)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the first 4@S on this table until now the only sizeable difference :)|pg||
nt|caruga: ty|pg||
nt|cumino: 5@C only lead @D beats|pg||
mb|1C!|an|12-14NT/18-20NT/!C|nt|bobholl: 4@S good save |pg||
nt|daman: 6@S is a contract that makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: pay - what a lovely thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: much less easy to reach 3NT now|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam depends on lead....unless E can get to play 6@c|pg||
nt|athene: east would like to splinter now except he really hates that diamond lead coming through his @DKJxx|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 6@C now ?|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Giubilo only bid 2@S - green against red|pg||
nt|granguru: so 12 was the max|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time the odds against decision to insist 4H rather than consulting his p was left unpunished.|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!S|nt|fann4: No game makes here|pg||
nt|granguru: after some years Benito Garozzo matched Giorgio Belladonna, playing Spuerpr|pg||
nt|mildredb: that would be 4|pg||
nt|granguru: SuperPrecision |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@s has its chances|pg||
nt|fann4: I meant NS:)|pg||
nt|psyck: rite :)|pg||
nt|fann4: hang on, in 3N on a @S lead, won't W get squeezed on 6 rounds of @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: it would be a good vul 'sac' to find though :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bit early in the day for this conversation I'll forget about bridge if you keep that up|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: hard-ish for north to find the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence might get a second chance if declarer tries an immediate club|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is risk in this bid especially as partner will tend not to have four hearts (no negative double)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3NT a bit myopic (as well as where is the @h stopper?)|pg||
nt|athene: but it looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: if the play with KJxx in opp's suit doesn't bid notrumps who is going to?|pg||
nt|athene: the player|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 2@s leavs a wideopen way for EW|pg||
nt|granguru: Arno is the same as little roman club|pg||
nt|fann4: on a non @D lead, declarer gave himself the only chance. take 2 @S finesses and hope west can't overuff to cash 2@D tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: over 3@S N could bid 4@S|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fann4: There's that saying 'Don't put down an 8 card suit in the dummy'.|pg||
nt|fann4: Note East overcalled 2@H in the OR|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know the bridge term for an 8-card suit|pg||
nt|fann4: The way this auction has gone South has to bid @C again, but will he jump to 5? |pg||
nt|fann4: What is the term, John?|pg||
nt|kemperg: tell us|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TRUMPS|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson bids his spades...with 4162 or 4072 it would be more tempting to respond 1NT (to give a chance of bidding diamonds later) but this hand can pass a 2C rebid in comfort|pg||
nt|rv: South is trying for game here?|pg||
nt|granguru: back to work ...|pg||
nt|granguru: will make 12 |pg||
nt|athene: spade lead and 12 tricks easy|pg||
nt|fann4: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: woe|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie's bold opening lead will permit at least one overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: look like it Jeff|pg||
nt|kemperg: :):)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: wow, not a jump to 2 @s but a jump to 3 @s ?|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting bid, 3@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sommer: 5@C exclusion?|pg||
nt|bobholl: now he sees he has missed 6@C despite the bad @D points|pg||
nt|andyv:  old fashioned here Bill, I'd like a better stopper in unbid suit than the stiff 9 of @hs|pg||
nt|granguru: 12000 bridge players now at BBO..what a wonderful site...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sensible auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, a good auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs: perfect in every respect except that game happens to make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Girls keep it up with a double partscore swing on Board 5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: A club looks more ordinary, but maybe he fancied his chances of catching dummy with 4531.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well with e opening it is possible but bit scratchy in hcp|pg||
nt|rv: West must have been itching to double this|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ianmcc: bold=?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..nope..just the shot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt agree with that leap|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I play 3@d shows a 5(+) -5and after 3@s from N 4@h describes a good hanf with 5350|pg||
nt|sommer: Exclusion, no?|pg||
nt|sommer: I would for sure bid 5@C...but thats me:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will go down if S doesnt find the stiff @sK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: p could have KQx in S and no DQ could he not|pg||
nt|sommer: S may get shortened, yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cdant see how he can drop S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone remember the Little Major - didnt belladonna play that one time|pg||
nt|fann4: But now there is likely to be a @D lead|pg||
nt|fann4: Unlucky for MIR that the overcall in the OR backfired in this way.|pg||
nt|fann4: Now it will be all square after 9 boards. Tough to get ahead in this match.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|psyck: can only throw 2@h & 3@c, & squeezed on 5th @d itself in 3 suits|pg||
nt|rv: opposite passed partner and at these colors, South game try was too ambitious|pg||
nt|jcomyn: uncomfortable this - itchy and scratchy|pg||
nt|jbennet: diffucult hand to bid.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They're not shy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East really likes that dummy - not a round king in sight|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: Louis Armstrong could sing......What a Wonderful Site.....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: 4@s is only -2, also 5@s against 5@h is ok|pg||
nt|granguru: record is around 22000|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: ok, he isn't insulting them|pg||
nt|rv: I might have led simple 4th best @d with East hand|pg||
nt|granguru: In the Miami Olympiad I asked Belladonna which was better Roman  or precision?|pg||
nt|athene: hands up everyone who thinks we should stop discussing systems from the 1960s? :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Reese played little major|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: by trying a very early club hoping they don't get it right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: turning nasty already|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: wd|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wrong again jeepers|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a typical hand where you should play 6@h because of ruffing @c with the short trumphlength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also han play 7@h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very interesting to see what happens in open room|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA is wrong if E has Kxxx|pg||
nt|rv: though it costs trick, subsequent defense would have been a lot easier|pg||
nt|granguru: oki oki I stop|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fann4: On Bd 7, EW struggling to find a way to beat 3N, but nothing will beat it.|pg||
nt|granguru: no more questions please|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If the 9 is 3rd, the king is wrong|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: really the J of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|daman: Hi william|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nope :)  But they will also make alot of games that shod not make becuse opps make small misstakes. Its really tough to play vs. a a pair that did this hard every hand. You always ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: know that 1 misstake in defence is a disaster|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: still this should go 1 down now since declarer needs to lose @HA to make his tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: it's worth noticing that north returns a club there rather than continuing hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they seem to lead the 9 from Q109|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cumino: 8 was strange|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: and we have "only" +2000 here|pg||
nt|athene: of course it's pretty obvious that east has the @HK for 2NT so there are no more hearts for the defence|pg||
nt|athene: so he looks elsewhere for tricks and clubs is about the only bet|pg||
nt|granguru: so 1/6 is now at your table, this table, i.e. 16.7%|pg||
nt|athene: but still, many people feel obliged to plod away at the same old suit even when clearly it can't produce enough tricks to beat the contract|pg||

nt|fann4: No doubt both defenders are upset|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the commentastors curese seems to play to all sports. you know such as he cant miss this putt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: 5@d would be more interesting to watch than 3N here...may require @dJ finess in 5@d...|pg||
nt|jbennet: little major was invented to counteract the italian blue club. (But Reese and schapiro,s sophisticated code language was more efficient than any bidding system ever will be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would say :(:(:(|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, but may just take finesses instead of playing for squeeze|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1@c as well, enough playing strength to reverse and bid @hs later|pg||
nt|granguru: if 1@C is not used as art opening @H is an error...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: as cards are E-W makes 6@c though 5@c us reasonable contract|pg||
nt|j0i: 3nt most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko starts with 2S...a 3S splinter or fit jump in diamonds might have been better options, if available|pg||
nt|sommer: it is best chance|pg||
nt|chilloncan: transfer overcall it seems|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin that is|pg||
nt|granguru: except they  are using canapé style|pg||
nt|fann4: I've lost thousands of cokes betting on BBO |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So with these transfer responses to 1@C, what does "accepting" the transfer mean (like here)?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: look at S 3 @s !|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was too busy looking at 3@H, which in my opinion is not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: 7@D is excellent but i don't think they'll bid it|pg||
nt|mikael_w: and if you are a junior you are not even afraid when you bid it :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cumino: IMHO Versace could play @D even with the Zalesky error 8@D. If declarer had singleton @D to play @H wasn't necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: we have been speculating quite a vit on their string @c defense :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
nt|athene: north may balance 2@H now|pg||
nt|granguru: :9 :9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 6@S now is the bid|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rv: they seem to be on same wavelength here, West did raise to 5@c instead of giving pref to 4@h |pg||
nt|caruga: would  be the first time in 30 years :)|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, he has opener's minor, he has to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed|pg||
nt|granguru: best contract..as was said hey will make 6 but chances are less than 50% before starting to play the hand|pg||
nt|rv: correct contract in my opinion, 6@c is fortuitous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bid slams on these hands and you wont live long|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: :) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but his partner bid 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
nt|kemperg: just saw Jimenez miss the last one, second in Korea|pg||
nt|j0i: should show 3+|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: just responding is Minimum, about 12-14, more or less bal, with 2-3@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: comment says "min, 2-3 spades", which is consistent with board 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so that means it's passable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i played suction ONCE. ishmael delmonte said "you are going to LOVE this". it came up, and when the smoke cleared we were -1400 againt a partial. i couldnt remember the details of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it. so i said "got any more  gadgets i will love?":)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: right as always Bill :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now he just has to make it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: made is fairly good possible|pg||
nt|athene: was west going to bid 4@S over 4@D, i wonder?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a bit of a view|pg||
nt|fann4: So MIR thrown a bit of a life-line there, still 10 ahead.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: Try DONTTON next time Marshall :)|pg||
nt|athene: another 4@S on a 4-4 fit - but this time Versace has 26 points between the hands|pg||
nt|athene: he will be worried at first as this is relatively new territory for him|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I would think you could bid 1@S with 2 amd a minimum hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: not convinced that's the best method|pg||
nt|Walddk4: With 4 and a minimum it is common to bid 2@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  W needs to shift now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C was gazilli i suppose ?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@S down 2 on @H-ruff? - Verdace in 3NT - @H-lead and S has to find @d10 in on @SA - adn N has to take the 2. @D with @dA - very difficult defense|pg||
nt|jbennet: scahpiro and reese used a twisted way of using stayman.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the correct facts at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Team_%28bridge%29|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and if you have a maximum?  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: in case the @DK was a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this won't do it|pg||
nt|bobholl: even the 8 helps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: Suction variants: http://bridge.thomasoandrews.com/psycho.html|pg||
nt|chilloncan: endplayed opp for -14|pg||
nt|fann4: I can't understand why W continued to 3N over a passed partner who bid 2@C then 3@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sommer: he has 73% chance of making by taking @SA|pg||
nt|athene: south was a bit stuck if his partner bid hearts over 2@S, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nunes  started slam board 8 with a weak 1nt fantoni going for a @H slam invitation on the way to 6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fann4: What was he expecting opposite?|pg||
nt|athene: NS could make some spades, but to do that they have to bid them :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|nt|woozle: 10 imps to Klinger, now in the lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: now you should have another @C to lead but alas|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: they are in controls position & 4nt call |pg||
nt|psyck: we are all foxed Jeff :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: does he just bid 3@S as a sort of "do something intelligent, partner" noise?|pg||
nt|psyck: I think needs !j fin now as i mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes |pg||
nt|jbennet: the number af fingers they held on the backside of thier cards was a response to stayman. (sort of).|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sort of a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 this time|pg||
nt|mikael_w: now its down for sure|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, specs are complaining about 3@S, but I think N/S were very unlucky on this deal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's code for "I would have bid 3@S"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I think they said 3@S was not forcing...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: not sure though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: EW missed the game in Board 9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  750|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S  4@S  or let 1@S be forcing|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: can it ever be necessary to attack hearts there?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he is worried declarer is getting rid of a heart with the ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|athene: give declarer @HAx(x) or something|pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Many options, all depend on agreements|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: presumably 2S meant something like "2+ places to play"|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR|pg||
nt|kemperg: followed orders:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|athene: claim as soon as trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|jbennet: it showed to his P the number of hearts he had.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: draw the last trump, concede the club|pg||
nt|jcomyn: it was known as the five finger exercise|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: Much prefer the last of those options.  1@S should be forcing ... there is no value in trying to stop on an absolute dime in 1@S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|fann4: The commentators busy discussing the play possibilities on bd 9 in 6@H, where Fantunes are beginning to get to.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|nt|athene: i think East was to blame for missing game in the other rom on board 9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: they @@h plays means he can manage with @h fin too|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: he needs the heart finesse, now, yes|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H  in open room board 8  starting the card play |pg||
nt|fann4: yes, and Kit Woolsey has mentioned the squeeze, if declarer can figure it all out.|pg||
nt|psyck: If fantoni is playing it, it will take a while before we see the score :)|pg||
nt|athene: he sort of has an 18 count|pg||
nt|athene: and partner has bid 2@S freely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: once they get to 3@S he should give it a fourth|pg||
nt|daman: a wise punt|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative play was to ruff everything in dummy|pg||
nt|athene: and just let west make onetrump trick some time|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fantoni declarer |pg||
nt|granguru: I played roman for years, then some Blue team, and last Superpre for many years again. And against all of them.|pg||
nt|granguru: ooops|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was wondering about that|pg||
nt|j0i: The guy's hit back, still a few boards left to get even|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: @C 2-2 is 40% plus 1 of 2 finesses makes slam chances less than 20%|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am having to think before I type - not my normal approach|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and bad 5/0 distribution suit @S |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s does look ok seeing just NS cards :)|pg||
nt|rv: another hand for competition here, auction could go to 5 level though both sides don't make game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what now - x|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, We just did see the biggest danger with the bid 3 @s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H fantoni ,lead  4@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, we will be avle to rule out DONTTON & narrow down on Suction if E doesnt act :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Here's another gadget I'm not convinced about: 2NT as a raise|pg||
mb|1N!|an|5-4 !D+!C|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
nt|jbennet: they also showed thier HCP- strength by altering the height above the table  of which they held their cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C - if u only see the EW-cards|pg||
nt|fann4: The smart money is on E to make 6@H on bd 8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good heaven - and wasnt there a court case|pg||
nt|athene: no 2@S overcall for garozzo - he is one of the few players today who likes intermediate jump overcalls|pg||
nt|jbennet: holding the cards higher up was more points. holding the cards near the table was fewer HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like it|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
nt|rv: East may bid 5@h for insurance here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you can distinguish between 3 and 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
nt|athene: in fact the italians tend to eschew aggressive weak overcalls by and large, i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not for me always give p a chance|pg||
nt|fann4: 2@H made in the OR, on a @C lead. The usual lead against a 'pass-preference' auction is a trump, though I'm not sure what would have happened.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C = 3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and with a natural 2NT sort of hand?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We are losing 2NT in a natural meaning - it went to look for 1@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is never natural|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who wants to play 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: When did you last make exactly 8 tricks in 2NT?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyone who just went down one in 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't WANT to, but somethimes you need to describe your hand, and invite partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Fantoni is already counting 12 tricks on @h fin then :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: had a long discussion a time ago|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S or 2@H on south?|pg||
nt|fann4: Do you rebid 2@H or 2@S here. I far prefer 2@H.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how is it so easy to find a 5-3 masjor fit and clubs disappear here|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs you much rather give away 50 or 100 instead of -420|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D 18-19 balanced, i assume, and 3@C puppet stayman|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs probably means Good hand for 1NT but need help in clubs.|pg||
nt|athene: double simply showing a good hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right back to this match ok everybopdy|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: usually a T/O double takes care of that...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
nt|fann4: These days, many pairs play that over the x, 2@H is a sound 2@S raise.|pg||
nt|athene: so Lauria clearly has a game force|pg||
nt|jbennet: this low good.|pg||
nt|athene: now if both red suits can be run - there are a LOT of tricks to be taken|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You often make 8 tricks in 3NT, but not in 2 :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet the way things are going|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 control cards ar missing, so....|pg||
nt|sommer: I take the chance of commentators curse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 aces missing|pg||
nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1Nt and not 2@C by East?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C better than 3nt but wouldn't have made either|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H showing four spades, not four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: best thing to do is pretend 2@D was 2NT, then it all makes sense :)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians love using 2minor opener to show this "stronger than 1nt but not quite 2nt" balanced hand|pg||
nt|athene: it was first called the "mexican 2@D" opener and was sort of laughed at a bit|pg||
nt|kemperg: I choose 2@S, partner was not happy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4C will make four, for a flat board an Klinger still in the lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was forcing one round, might be only 4 spades|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, & 2@s a weaker raise|pg||
nt|fann4: right|pg||
nt|rv: North doubled because he has values in Other minor (not one bid by South)|pg||
nt|athene: but it has some interesting advantages elsewhere in their system|pg||
nt|jbennet: a source of tricks + AAKK should induce vercase to cooperate.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: is this a victim for the 5-carnd major opening?|pg||
nt|rv: this auction could get duplicated in OR as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but then it seems to have disappeared as a suit years ago|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fann4: so redouble and then support is a little more than 9|pg||
nt|athene: basically it means they never have to open 1 of a minor with any strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you need exactly four heart tricks, you cash the ace, but then if west drops the jack or ten, you don't finesse|pg||
nt|jbennet: verace now knows no spade control THAT is good news. |pg||
nt|athene: because it's a well-known ploy from J10x to give you a losing option|pg||
nt|jbennet: he should also know that the club bid is the ACE.|pg||
nt|athene: here, clearly, east is extremely unlikely to hold five hearts anyway so the question would not arise|pg||
nt|jbennet: not the king|pg||
nt|jbennet: why must it be the ace???|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, I'm sorry, a T/O double MIGHT take care of it, but it might not, in particular, when partner takes out into one of those suits that you don't actually have|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My point is this:  these new gadgets sound great - distinguishing between 3 and 4 card support, but they ALWAYS come with a cost|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: if my partner has a 2nd suit, the chances of me playing 2NT is very slim.. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All gadgets do, Bill|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: which means, firstly, 2nt bids can be cute things|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/MGlossary/MexicanTwoDiamonds.html|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone suggested that the doubler might have solid hearts, but HE'S NOT ON LEAD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Klinger also pulled out of the X|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to say who was at fault here without knowing the details of the system|pg||
nt|jbennet: becuase there is no way lauria would have removed himself from 3NT if the club control wasnt the ace|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You could double 3@H I suppose|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks after a @c lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: card... |pg||
nt|athene: (look at the 2nt rebid on board 8, for example)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: very few top losers, but very few tricks too here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a doddle|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fann4: Will 3@D make? GIB says no, but things can change.|pg||
nt|jbennet: and versace duly figured that out bidding the ggod slam. (hearts 33 or D Q drop).|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine he will cash the top trumps and then when they don't break, he just needs hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: not trivial though|pg||
nt|athene: given the likely 6-1 club split|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps he will play excatly 1 round trumps and the 3 times hearts.'|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now E known that it´s a finess slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry knows...|pg||
nt|sommer: yes...W told that nicely|pg||
nt|sommer: ..If I understood the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love even money |pg||
nt|jcomyn: my slams are usually about 20 per cent|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Its that you will often play the wrong suit. You partner can sometimes be in a dificult bid-posision and have to bid @s with something like AJ or so. So now you are in a 7-card ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumpf on your way to slam|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: still looks normal to rebid 2@c on 1N|pg||
nt|athene: the club split makes it more likely that west has @DQxx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't get anything for nothing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if passing 1nt with that north hand was right, then south had to find a stronger bid with his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: without anybidding its not a play problem at all.|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with taking the trump finesse is that if it loses you are down on the spot|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash @DAK and someone shows out you are still alive (just)|pg||
nt|jbennet: EK of D if no drop then hope for Hearts 33|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tempting to try to postpone the evil hour|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is more likely on the bidding d finesse or h 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: but finessing might still the best line|pg||
nt|kemperg: postponing he is|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course the finesse is better than 3-3 hearts but that isn't the issue|pg||
nt|athene: if you play the top trumps, and the queen is doubleton, you survive too|pg||
nt|jbennet: the bidding makes it more complex.|pg||
nt|athene: even with hearts 4-2|pg||
nt|athene: or a singleton @HJ or @H10 is good enough|pg||
nt|athene: you get the spade away on the @HQ and then simply concede one heart for two club pitches|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes a priori the slam requires either D Q drops in 1 or 2 rounds OR hearts 33|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is giving it plenty of thought obviously|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a 9-card fit missing the Q, the odds are very close between the drop and finesse anyway|pg||
nt|kemperg: bidding almost implies 6@C i E and 6@S in W|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes there is another problem if u cash D king and queen drops.|pg||
nt|athene: if you know one defender has significant length in another suit (as east does here, with the clubs and @SQ by implication from the lead)|pg||
nt|athene: then the finesse is best odds|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: trumps will cut down dec's trciks|pg||
nt|fann4: Now GIB says makeable - but remember that GIB is a double dummy analyser, seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|psyck: now dec likely will cash @hk & x ruff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, N/S play 5@S, which in my opinion, is the right contract - better than 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fann4: Looks like 1 down and 4imps back to SBA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: meckstroth-rodwell play this style of 1major rebids after a strong club|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer must play a @C or @HK now to make.|pg||
nt|athene: secondly it means that partner can pass your 1minor opener more happily|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mikael_w: yes. Dbl or even bettar I thing Pass|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Very profound Roland - the important thing, when adopting a gadget, is to disuss how you will cope with the hands where you want the bid to be natural|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: as long as he does not try @h fin...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: ok! so an overtrick for lauria|pg||
nt|jbennet: then u may draw trumps but if hearts are 4-2  then only 3 heart tricks.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: but responder shows right away the hcp count and whether 3 card support|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@c will also go down, because of the 3-0 in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: did S count the @S ?|pg||
nt|athene: playing standard methods, if it goes 1@C p p p, opener might have only 3 clubs in a balanced 19 count and is in a silly contract AND opps have nothing on|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|granguru: well regarding last hand slam was in fact more than 20% asit wins also with @C 3-1 aand both finesses |pg||
nt|athene: playing this way, if it goes like that, you only have a weak balanced hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikael_w: If you are doing something partner can still bid|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: so 2@D would be 5-7 hcp with 3 spades here,for them, over 1@S, i think|pg||
nt|granguru: which is an additionally 12.5%|pg||
nt|jbennet: that way of play looks vastly agaist the odds.|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think the spade split was so clear|pg||
nt|athene: east might have four spades for 2@C there perhaps|pg||
nt|jbennet: i do thin in fact the spades were favourite to be 6-3|pg||
nt|athene: if you think the @S8 was honest standard count, then 6-3 is most likely yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: I goe an aspect from  a kib - 5@s is a very bad contract. either 4@s or 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: that would make north's life very easy|pg||
nt|athene: another advantage which a spec points out is that partner can respond to your 1minor opener on air|pg||
nt|jbennet: becuase if east had 46 in black suits|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|psyck: home now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: and you won't hang him by jumping to 2nt|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|nt|athene: you might ask "well why not just have 1@S promise 5?" you can do that of course but then you are a bit stuck with hands with 4 spades and a 5- or 6-card minor - you have to rebid 2 ...|pg||
nt|athene: of the minor and it's possible to lose the major fit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fann4: A trump switch at trick 3 would have beaten this.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cT|nt|athene: also making 1@S forcing makes it easier to deal with some strong hands of course|pg||
nt|kemperg: friend of mine looked at it statistically, 2@H little better.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: basically when you open a strong club you really want partner to give a positive - then you have game-forced at a nice low level|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 3c better still|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|woozle: If Christie had put in the diamond 9 and Buchen exited with a spade, Anderson would have had the opportunity to play for a stripsqueeze (which doesn't work)|pg||
nt|woozle: D9 appears to be a mandatory falsecard|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Two boards to go in the match|pg||
nt|ralfwil: again got - my keyboard can´t spell:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and there was a risk of 6+% for @D 4-0 too...so..|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@D, you are a bit behind standard bidders as you haven't shown any suits and you are a bit higher up|pg||
nt|psyck: I didn't exactly mean to make a prediction when I said we will have to wait longer for a new leader, but it seems to have worked out that way|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the great garazzo passed 5@C|pg||
nt|fann4: NS need to steer clear of the 5 level here.|pg||
nt|caruga: not a good slam anyway|pg||
nt|granguru: plus stif @Chonor in South hand |pg||
nt|jbennet: he might have doubled instead if overcalling 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|jbennet: suppose u decided that east had 36 in black suits.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nuther slam|pg||
nt|jbennet: then his play was a really bad move.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And, yes, Bill they deserve a bonus point for investigating.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: I really agree with that aspect!|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@H off on a @D lead specifically|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: well bid in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and very well made the 3N who said Klinger was tiring|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 7@c anyone?|pg||
nt|woozle: Sort of well-bid...dummy could have had the stuff to make a grand good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mine either unduectaed yoke|pg||
nt|athene: another weak notrump by fantunes escapes the righteous wrath of the penalty double|pg||
nt|psyck: NS should not get overboard with no fit here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: No 7C for me today|pg||
nt|athene: north should definitely have passed the double of 1nt in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: he is balanced with values|pg||
nt|athene: this is soemthing that people often get wrong|pg||
nt|athene: they feel it's like a takeout double so they tend to bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: but with strong balanced hand you just pass the double as a first action|pg||
nt|psyck: have ther reversed the cards?|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they can get N to play it :)|pg||
nt|fann4: That overcall will likely help NS put the brakes on.|pg||
nt|rv: can it go all pass?|pg||
nt|athene: now we see if NS play a penalty double of a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: interestingly, if you look on meckstroth-rodwell's convention card|pg||
nt|jbennet: it was then fool proof to play D AK.|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision now for Versace|pg||
nt|athene: bit shapely for doubler - but 4@S could well lead to a silly contract|pg||
nt|jcomyn: any genius out there tell me how to get to a c contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I once heard of a bidding contest (in the 50's) where top score went to 5@S,  with a score higher than 4@S ... because they reckoned it's got to be good bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding over the nature of the double - lots play X as artificial over strong notrump but you really want it as penalty over weak|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they put the cards back in the wrong slots|pg||
nt|athene: yes, board must be upside down here i guess|pg||
nt|athene: bit shapely for double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C an even more interesting ploy|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 12 maybe the final nail in the coffin for MIR. West can't be blamed for opening 3@H (plus perhaps the expected state of the match), and East upped the ante at this vul, bidding ...|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@H.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andyv:  5-5 hand|pg||
nt|fann4: The meaning of 2@C anyone?|pg||
nt|psyck: relay any G i would guess|pg||
nt|psyck: *any G|pg||
nt|psyck: GF|pg||
nt|jbennet: looks as D is most flexible.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sort of sounds like a heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: or, you mean 5@C from garozzo?|pg||
nt|athene: that looks like a club raise to me :)|pg||
nt|athene: disaster in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@S there|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Haughie's final 6C bid was just a guess...successful, today|pg||
nt|athene: they play different defences to weak and strong notrumps|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer the "weak" NT in 2@C - and then 2@h/2@S = weak sign off (5 card suit) 2 @D relay - u can even play 3@c/3@D weak 6 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: north probably did not imagine his partner had a club void|pg||
nt|athene: as he had only the bare ace|pg||
nt|athene: so thought that 6@D had to have a bit more (the @HA, specifically!)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it just goes to point out the old rule about bidding grand slams when you can't count the tricks (don't)|pg||
nt|jbennet: who said "be cautious  when opponents preempts vigorously"|pg||
nt|fann4: He could have gotten out for 3 down, but elected to ruff the 3rd @C with the !9, and this cost 2 tricks.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: to investigate|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Tks Krishna|pg||
nt|athene: (as do many pairs)|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: they also say|pg||
nt|daman: My mother would say "double"???   in a high voice    that meant it was optional|pg||
nt|athene: "all 1nt openers in third seat are weak!"|pg||
nt|athene: in other words|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: why not 1nt now ?|pg||
nt|fann4: Someone suggest it shows @H, which fits in with the 3@H bid (maybe)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't understand this auction, but have to admire the final contract|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: gee whiz great H contract gone|pg||
nt|psyck: operator will have to enter the score manually|pg||
nt|psyck: or redo the auction to make S declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 1nt from E?|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm guessing though|pg||
nt|fann4: I wonder how many people would pass the west hand, at this vul?|pg||
nt|fann4: Most people I know would open 2@H without a second thought.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BTW, I think its woth mention. East is only 14 year old (west is not much older but I think 16 or maybe 17) Not many girls in the age of 14 playing this good bridge|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and the opening lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: Anderson has the same guess|pg||
nt|pelu: ehis time 1Nt would work - but Easr "never" trust" partners @c-openings :)|pg||
nt|psyck: they play that kind of relays sometimes, not sure this seq though|pg||
nt|athene: they have seen people psyche a strong notrump so often in third seat|pg||
pc|s3|nt|woozle: Smolanko seems to have a gadget...Anderson learns nothing particular of use and takes the same guess as Haughie for a flat board|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't like the 3N rebid|pg||
nt|andyv:  acutally, their card reads 10-13 5+ unbalanced|pg||
nt|bobholl: his timing is bad :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (I hope everyone has noticed how our typing has improved)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie's spade lead might speed the play|pg||
nt|kemperg: N did not believe the void, thougt S had an extra ace to bid 6 |pg||
nt|athene: many specs are suggesting that Garozzo should have bid 6@C, rather than just 5|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: i don't believe it, rather than not liking it|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like it was @h indeed & 3@s continuing to describe|pg||
nt|athene: well, these hands are very guessy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  good slam here|pg||
nt|psyck: sensible stop, albeit helped by opps|pg||
nt|fann4: Swing potential on this board - NS did well to stay low, and also they right sided it.|pg||
nt|athene: they feel the need to bring out the stern stick of justice over it (penalty double)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 4@S bid here ... a practical shot|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: so looks like Klinger has done it against the odds|pg||
nt|athene: south just had a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: 15-181NT overcall generally|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt 5@C and 4@H all make|pg||
nt|fann4: E brought home the slam on bd 8 - very well done.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 6@C is best|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 6@H made 10 for angelini|pg||
nt|psyck: he must have gotten a count to tell him to sq instead of fin|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
nt|athene: just bidding 5 can do a lot of damage in many ways|pg||
nt|bjacobs: yes, they haven't had the cards this set, but their defence has seemed fine|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  I think even 1@s by S makes:)|pg||
nt|fann4: With NS making 650, 2 off would have been great - a 4 imp gain to MIR, now they will lose 10imps.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: but many italians play x with bal hands & values|pg||
nt|psyck: the rebid was a cardinal sin though|pg||
nt|bobholl: even number of aces ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead had worked better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S was perhapsa bit of a stretch, but West would have raised 3 anyway|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|athene: if you play DONT or something|pg||
nt|fann4: So, barring some really weird stuff on the last few boards, the match is over (and the event).|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  surprising that they didn't get to 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  Fulvio changed his mind in the middle of the hand:)|pg||
nt|pelu: oh he is consisten - "partner dont have @Cs when he open @C" so he dont support on 4 card and dont bid NT on singleton :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree that puts the kittie among the doves|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: lauria might consider finessing the hearts, of course!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: Andy Robson's bridge tip: if someone pre-empts, and then doesn't lead a side singleton, play him for a singleton trump|pg||
nt|athene: lauria never heard of such nonsense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andyv:  2@h bid may actually have hurt them since it took one level of bidding away|pg||
nt|bobholl: North has a supermax in their methods so S didn't want to force things|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: you can get really nailed by psychic or semi-psychic notrump openers|pg||
nt|athene: you simply can't show your hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: hard to find the @HK now, but he has to set up some hearts fast|pg||
nt|athene: declarer just needs one club trick for his nine|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|woozle: Someone asked if 2NT was Ogust. I'm sure it's not...2H looks like a both majors bid, and 3H looks like longer hearts (possibly clarifying range also).|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't help matters starting with the diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Minus ½ a point, Roland. You forgot a space|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|pelu: do u have the standing after round 6?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and when u think about it, Miro could have been 27 or so ahead|pg||
nt|fann4: There is no knockout stage after this. It's winner take all after 9 rounds.|pg||
nt|fann4: All I can say is this - MIR had plenty chances this match.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: undo|pg||
nt|granguru: psyching is a tool of the xx century|pg||
nt|kemperg: double void gives dclarer somthing to think about|pg||
nt|bjacobs: why only half?  a typo is a typo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am the judge|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very democratic|pg||
nt|bjacobs: time to take the plunge with the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant say i understand that 3h bid|pg||

nt|woozle: A good result for Klinger in the other room - 3NT with only eight obvious tricks. Now Brown is probably watching the clock run out of time|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's better :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cant be made....|pg||
nt|caruga: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rv: South possibly follows rule of 14, no of points+@s length should be more than 14 for opening in 4th seat|pg||
nt|daman: here in Canada   we had a pair   Joey Silver/Irving Litvack      they psyched on nearly every hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: he would make if @DQ was doubleton - against the odds though|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, now I think this match is verry close in IMP:s when other table has played all these boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: any minor preempt?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: loks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps there is a point in that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: so robsson had gone 1 unlucky down+|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess they cashed their spade winners in the other room|pg||
mb|1C!|an|12-14NT/18-20NT/!C|nt|bobholl: 4@D and a@C if they don't find the @H ruff so can be true|pg||
nt|pelu: then its not a psyke - its a part of their system and sh be declared|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S opener possible here - much less disciplined in third seat|pg||
nt|daman: one never knew what was going on but did know not to believe them |pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: east might double 1@D for the lead here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty, Daniela|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 0-11 no 4card major|pg||
nt|athene: (1@C is forcing)|pg||
nt|rv: is 2@h muiderberg or tartan?|pg||
nt|athene: that sounds like douglas adams' reciproexclusiversion mathematics|pg||
nt|daman: but they announced that they psyched frequently|pg||
nt|athene: a bid is defined as showing anything except what it shows|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Technically this belongs in 5@D, but few would reach it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, E/W have had a nice little run|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Daniel great on the vugraph, thanks Ian and Kieran and all specs, Nick Fahrer and the ABF for organising and BBO for the broadcast|pg||
nt|woozle: This is the last board, so as long as Christie-Buchen don't go for about 2000, they're safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|daman: and I use the term frequently very loosely|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C should show extras, or five clubs, i think, as it uses up so much bidding space|pg||
nt|athene: people playing 2/1 game force think that magically solves all bidding problems so they can happily rebid 3@C on 5-2-2-4 11 counts|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not that easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: must be 1@d not 2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway encourage s to bid d slam|pg||
nt|rv: if it is muiderberg, it shows 5@h+4+m less than opening hand|pg||
nt|granguru: that makes a total of around 42.5% less some restrictions such as a ruff on lead or weird distributions|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 3@S is just michaels - no leaping michaels for this EW pair!|pg||
nt|fann4: No real scope for a swing here for MIR|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: but if it is game forcing whats the hurry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: be suspicious when they lift volunteerily :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X over 2@H - only 10 HCP - but perfect distribution - |pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Now North sniffs the problem in 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D inverted, limit or better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is an excellent auction - so far|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If not followed by 3@D it is game-forcing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: ..still down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA and another @d for -1|pg||
nt|kemperg: we play the next bid as relay with less than 16|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H less then 16 2@S 4@H's , 16+|pg||
nt|athene: Fantoni Nunes in the other room agreed clubs, cue-bid, then i suspect 4NT was turbo, showing an even number of keycards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: well done to Christie Buchen, Klinger Haughie and Richman Braithwaite who will now represent Australia in the APBF in June and the Bowl in October|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: couple of great ex_kiwis in that group @H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thank you all for watching, thanks to all the commentators and spectators. An honourable mention once again to David Stern for providing tim tams for everybody|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm off to cook dinner...thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E shouls act direct on 2@h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: should....|pg||
nt|pelu: for me a 99% X|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree!|pg||
nt|bobholl: for me 99,9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bravo ... |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|woozle: And thanks to Ian McCance, Gary Hanna, Daniel Braun, and all of the specs who joined in|pg||
nt|andyv:  perfect NT dummy|pg||
nt|athene: in theory i believe that 2@S denies four hearts in which case east might not play restricted choice in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Brilliant ladies|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: ruspa won't agree :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: t5hat too Bob|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee whiz 5-5 d fit ignored|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Presumably North could bid 3@S with xxx in case partner had a half stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: nice, isn't it ... I think you are spot on|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: the NS system says 2@D was 8-12 balanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad for declarer that deuces aren't wild|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead?|pg||
nt|granguru: btw 5@C had around .9 x .75 =67.5%|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Logical lead also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They don't win any imps, but they should feel really good about this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: sadly they won´t gain a 12IMP, they deserve it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Deserves to gain points IMO - could I be biassed towards bara brudar?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: 5@d safer contract, this should score more tricks though|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope commentators curse doesnt strike again|pg||
nt|fann4: Note, Versace preferred to raise @S with the singleton J, rather than bid 3N.|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@S promised good 6?|pg||
nt|xenya: this is not exactly cold|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Notice east bidding 1 NT with no problem at all showing 15-18 with her 14 points :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: I am|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: of course he would find it hard to get back to hand safely to take lots of finesses through south anyway|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sommer: ..ahh maybe a squeeze will helt E now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think N HAD to play small @D to ruff to make sure of 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to finesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..he has to ruff @D high..take @SH and run the @S'|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see what Lauria will do if N open 2@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doubles 100% |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 tricks  we can see directly the 9th not easy |pg||
nt|fann4: East has to switch to the @S2 to beat this now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: correct Povi! S is squeezed .|pg||
nt|athene: east can see no point plodding on with diamonds with no entry|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I have a very simple rule. Act as early as possible ans don´t balance if you not are very sure that it is correct|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem a little odd here that south never admitted to club support, but perhaps all is not as it seems|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: so he tries to help his partner out a bit|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes lauria-versace auctions have hidden depths and cunning double meanings :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: down now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: That is coming from good confidense now after beating alot of contracts|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: many specs point out north hasn't got 8-12|pg||
nt|athene: well, he has 11, but only if you count in base 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Angelini really bid 2@D? Must be true, hard to believe|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he meant to bid 1@D and pulled the wrong card|pg||
nt|athene: the wrong bidding card|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: ..and finesse!!:) ..of course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but not any longer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He counted his kings twice I suppose|pg||
nt|bobholl: an overtrick even |pg||
nt|athene: he knew he was running into club ruffs if he tried playing north for a singleton @HJ |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim time|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psyck: ya, interesting @s position :)|pg||
nt|fann4: So said GIB. But I think declarer has to find the @HJ still to make.|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 9 in the OR - same 5@D doubled.|pg||
nt|fann4: But played by N, so going  300 for another 5imps to ANG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also when it means 'only'|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sommer: a shame|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer lacked entries to finesse diamonds twice...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: the cards do lie well for declarer - IF he reads them|pg||
nt|psyck: may have been trying to swing due to a couple of bad boards i guess|pg||
nt|athene: west endplayed in three suits now|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how bad these natural sandwich notrumps are|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but c lead v 3nt|pg||
nt|rv: sry this should score better, same no of tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hT|nt|athene: the odds of partner being broke are just so high|pg||
nt|bobholl: prevents often stealing but now ??!!|pg||
nt|athene: even if you are worried about people responding on air all the time|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: contract home |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 th trick a @S |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can unblock his @C8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: if he wants|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, she could have made it, with the very lucky lie in diamonds, but that was hard to visualize|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: more elegent than finesse but makes life simpler|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S is endplayed for -1|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: He did, surely|pg||
nt|athene: you rarely find you really needed 1nt natural to avoid missing a game|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: depends if he wants entries to hand|pg||
nt|athene: or if he wants to be able to cash the clubs smoothly any time|pg||
nt|athene: i suspect he would have unblocked the 8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|athene: east gets squeezed in spades and diamonds now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: only 8 with the @s's|pg||
nt|athene: oh no sorry he needed another trick|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he could have guessed spades from west leading that club|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: if west had nothing in spades might he have exited a spade at trick 5|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he made it to tie the board, alas not the match|pg||

nt|bobholl: so sandwich 1nt should be a 2 suiter :) |pg||
nt|pelu: with perfect distribution u often has to press the bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt 3nt 9 tricks |pg||
nt|fann4: OR quite a few boards behind.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board of the match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Staffan, Liz, Bill and Jóhann|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: set 3 was all Brown as set was Klinger|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Not from West|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd probably open 1NT just like Buchen did...better description of values than 1C then 3C|pg||
nt|psyck: not an easy game to reach, or make (need @c guess rite)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It' easy when @CJ is covered|pg||
nt|granguru: easy 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mundane game|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: well i know there are many strong players who like it to be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i see helgemo bidding it all the time|pg||
nt|rv: should be prosaic 1n for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: some number of S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting board 9 - 7@s down 2!|pg||
nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural or not, the bid still needed a source of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: good playing strength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sometimes bridge is easy like on this board:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 10 on small @S|pg||
nt|fann4: Another quiet board, it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bill and Jóhann will be back for more|pg||
mb|1D!|an|!H|nt|psyck: that helps i guess :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont play prosaic system what is it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Liz too, but she will skip a match|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: would u open the East hand?|pg||
nt|kemperg: no|pg||
nt|granguru: no|pg||
nt|pelu: until now 5x NO :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe Bara Boys play next|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am off to hone my typing skills|pg||
mb|2H|an|12-14BAL, 4!H|nt|sommer: ..yes..they went for the 33% grandslam|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  change the @c and @s suit around, and 1N looks much better|pg||
nt|granguru: about the slam a kib says:WITHOUT the diamond lead, the slam needs only club break and 4-2 heart break. No finesses. |pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri has heard John and decided no more prosaic bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now north will double for takeout |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you double 1nt for penalty and opps run, your next double is takeout|pg||
nt|athene: i remember david burn saying very firmly why this was a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone plays this way and it seems sensible to me|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes the players makes easy to difficult :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Even without a @H ruff, 4@S goes 1 off here.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: 2@CXX interesting final spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how much is that|pg||
pc|d9|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
nt|caruga: is 1@D looking for troubles?|pg||
nt|granguru: I use zar point to evaluate|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pass for a bit of fun|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odd contract|pg||
nt|granguru: which is right. so 6@C by WEST was the right contract finally.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no sense of humour|pg||
nt|fann4: But stick around everyone, there are 2 very interesting boards to finish with.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as NS don't wait too long to play @C|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and will raise...or should|pg||
nt|athene: sadly i wasn't really listening to david so i can't say what his reasoning was :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s true Peter:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No game makes but you can't avoid bidding one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: With no singleton, 11 tricks in diamonds looks very distant|pg||
nt|psyck: those playing walsh style may have started with 1@s instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|fann4: That 8 card @C suit headed by QJ10 - E opened 3@C in the OR.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S good stop |pg||
nt|jcomyn: now thats funny - kibs come up with 560,660,760 and 960|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|sommer: ..hmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never say will Povi|pg||
nt|psyck: this seq also shows the 45 minors with E probably|pg||
nt|athene: with 4333 and soft cards versace doesn't bother with the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or should:)|pg||
nt|athene: no squeeze - just the 11|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yeah wonder what happened to 860|pg||
nt|athene: 2@CXX+! NV is 960 surely|pg||
nt|athene: XX+1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S may have a chance|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 1@c losers with the ruff|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri lucky @ds are breaking and no one fancied a X, he could have gone for 300|pg||
nt|granguru: this hand has 11+8+2+3=24 2 less than minimum|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|andyv:  this should just make|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and wouldnt you think bridge players would be good at maths|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Not realistic to get there I think|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|mikael_w: this is an importent play now. Its a matter of 5 IMP if you make 2 @h or not|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: not the best tecnic|pg||
nt|athene: haha, sorry, 760|pg||
nt|athene: only 300 for a NV game :) |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|granguru: surely Daman will bring us the zar points page in a second :)|pg||
nt|athene: ZAR points are ok if you are in third or fourth seat, but you need that long to work out how many you have :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, and I'm not sure if N/S knew what they were doing here.  4NT is worse even than those 2NT contracts you despise|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|sommer: duck?..or chicken?:)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this covers only a 3-3 split|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri's O/C of 1@d was no win bid, he had very little to gain and everything to lose|pg||
pc|cK|nt|woozle: With North guarding hearts and diamonds, and South spades, there's no squeeze for 12|pg||
nt|athene: if you know hearts are 4-4, why shouldn't you play for the @DQ onside just as much as the @CQ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a@H @D squeeze|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: curse all this bbo automation - we get no practice at calculating scores OR sorting our cards any more|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sommer: still 10, tho|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and another @c...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  trying for trump promotion still was best defense|pg||
nt|athene: on board board 5 and 10, garozzo made 4@S and fantnues made game the other way|pg||
nt|athene: so that is a double double game swing|pg||
nt|athene: and one of them was doubled|pg||
nt|athene: so that was a doubled double double game swing|pg||
nt|athene: (or avoiding revoking)|pg||
nt|athene: it's a nightmare when we go and play live|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 50 minutes|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@D looks a reasonable spot if the trump broke - club finesse likely to succeed when East has opened - but they never bid diamonds|pg||
