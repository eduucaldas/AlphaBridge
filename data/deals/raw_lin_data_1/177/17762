nt|granguru: hi bruce|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|granguru: entering at the right moment I see|pg||
nt|granguru: a good slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bg: N made unlucky opening lead in other room of club ace so 6 dia made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|jcwla: I don't think N has done justice to this hand which is worth a jump rebid in @H's.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile S might follow up with 2NT and the @H game could still be reached.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|granguru: yes.. but I think there were also chances without a @S lead|pg||
nt|granguru: we will never know...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Manado is the capital of the North Sulawesi province of Indonesia. Manado is located at the Bay of Manado, and is surrounded by a mountainous area. The city has about 400,000 ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|  |nt|josj: but comparison will have to wait till the end|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|josj: we start comparisons on board 37, to be played after this new one|pg||
nt|josj: looking at the EW hands, you might even want to be in 6@H|pg||
nt|josj: but on the actual layout, you will feel happy after making just 4@H|pg||
mb|r|mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|josj: against the Strong Club, NS apparently are playing Crash|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: in which case X would show either reds or blacks|pg||

nt|josj: this X of 3@H certainly is premature|pg||
nt|josj: hi Joto!|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|josj: but it also seems to talk EW out of their best fit|pg||

nt|josj: this auction certainly is not the way to beat the leaders|pg||
pc|c5|nt|josj: imho 3@D shows a much better suit so I have some sympathy for W's raise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|otoj: agree Jos, it seems E's bid based on the HCP not the quality of the suit..|pg||
