mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|scotty: N needs to duck 2 diamonds (best if smoothly) then declarer is likely down, though not certainly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After this round and during the next round we will have some scores up to and including this round being played now i.e. with one round to score|pg||
nt|scotty: Declarer may duck the first trick |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wwe will broadcast the leaders|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Duck two clubs and rise !K on low club|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Or duck two diamonds and not cover the @CQ|pg||
nt|scotty: This doesn't look too smooth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lastt round VG liuneup Levin weinstein vs Jansma Paulissen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyakl Wolpert vs Grue Moss|pg||
pc|d4|nt|scotty: Now can overtake with DK if he believes...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Stewart Woolsey vs Chambers Schermer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Moss sure that North has the @DA due to thinking is contemplating overtaking and playing another diamond|pg||
nt|scotty: @d7 was either 3-card or 107 doubleton, and N showed A with huddle...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 100% thinking about it|pg||
nt|scotty: Only worry is stiff 7, but N would probably not have "burned" @d6 on first round - and might have chosen a @d lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North should not have thought for so long to make things clearer for the declarer|pg||
nt|scotty: Right, but, not seeing all four hands, he had other worries...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Still thinking about what to do|pg||
pc|d5|nt|scotty: Even after overtaking, declarer is not out of the woods....|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Everything favourable for declarer here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|scotty: This will probably make exactly - even if defenders don't shift to @d, declarer will be more or less forced to play up to @DK for his 7th trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: A realy interesting person to follow is Del Monte. A comming man.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Odd play by Joe in spades|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Amoils caressing the @CJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|scotty: Normally, @SJ denies the 10 - that's why he played low....|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|scotty: So it was really West who made the |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Point taken - Australian for your right and I am an idiot|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: I think what happened was he assumed declarer had @SK, so was trying to give SP|pg||

nt|scotty: At other tables, I think west will open 1D and they will finish in 4@s.  Some will make, some will not (but more will make, I think)|pg||

nt|scotty: That 1@h opening may help or hurt....|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: Hurt, in the sense that declarer will not play low on the heart lead.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No entry for the much  needed heart ruff|pg||
nt|scotty: but help in the sense that declarer may misguess @cQ...|pg||
nt|scotty: especially in view of west's pass of 1N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Unless he concludes that East has opened very lightly|pg||
nt|scotty: a 2@h opening would have certainly hurt E-W.... |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Declarer has two spades and a heart to lose the trick is not to lose a heart ruff and a club as well|pg||
nt|scotty: a 3@h opening might have helped - since N-S might play 3N (which would fail, I think)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Amoils shaking his head not knowing what is best here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Depends what lead Micahel|pg||
nt|scotty: I hear Zia made 3N - he's always trying to prove me wrong|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|dK|mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfb: Back soon for last round this table Levin Weinstein vs Jansma Paulissen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Other tables Kranyak Wolpert vs Grue Moss and last table Stewart Woolsey vs Chambers Schermer|pg||
nt|scotty: West needed to know what to do when he won @SQ - it is a difficult signaling situation even for a regular partnership (which they are not)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Closing and reopening|pg||
