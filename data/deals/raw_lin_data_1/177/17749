mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: I cant say I saw how he made six but anyway|pg||
nt|scotty: Actually a heart lead would defeat 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Ah only lost one heart|pg||
mb|d|an|T/O|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|robinswr: the doubleton diamond says double the 3-3 in the majors says pass (play in 4-3 fit)|pg||
nt|robinswr: but he pushed them up|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Nobody interested in defending. Cohenn says I am sick of being pushed around|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfa: That may have happened as they were playing so fast I missed pips|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|scotty: Zia was planning a 2N rebid, but the auction did not go well for him|pg||
nt|robinswr: zia passed for takeout|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: 3@SX would be 300|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: and here we are|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|mslair: very well judged:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: and what is double?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Zias body language suggests he was unsure but here we are|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|scotty: He did very well to pass - if they had a stiff club, they might easily be cold|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|robinswr: i don't lead the 9 from 98x. my 9 is from a doubleton|pg||

nt|scotty: Double shows at least a doubleton spade with no better bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzfa: Zia saying to Hamman you promised me you wouldnt and I think it was lead top of three after that|pg||
nt|robinswr: i guess zia agrees with me about the lead of the 9|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: I guess like me Zia hates opening a game force and writing -530 against that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: And lead it as if he has trump tricks why - Zia could have tried a @D|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|scotty: yeah, almost everyone else loves that|pg||
