nt|jbgood: looks like Rusinow (lowest from 2 touching honors)|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@s showed that if partner had @hs he was willing to play at 3 level ( a game try)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  bid highest level in suit you like the least|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|poohbear: www.bridgewinners.com will post the results at the end of each session. There will not be a running score. to get a feel for how each pair actually did , divide their score by 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|poohbear: these days dbl of 4@s primarily for take out but partner can pass with a weak balanced hand|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: now down to figuring out distribution of Bathurst's last 3 cards|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hurd wondering about underleading the @h|pg||
nt|poohbear: would be right if partner held the King and no Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H5    tough card to read regardless if  count or attitude|pg||
nt|jbgood: taking the plus is no bad strategy|pg||
nt|poohbear: but partner's sp play in trump indicated a @d card not a @H card|pg||
nt|poohbear: sp + suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: I think count makes this hand trivial? Since that gives the declarer 8302, no?|pg||

nt|jbgood: only 1 down at the other BBO table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|poohbear: NS play a standard system but open very light as if they were playing a strong @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 1NT rebid after the TO dbl shows better than a 1NT overcall. Hence the 2@d Q bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or was 2@D a [re]transfer?|pg||
nt|poohbear: I doubt it|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|poohbear: in the meantime it git South to lead a @d where he never would habe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S seems to confirm 2@D was a forcing noise|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jbgood: and the double of 2@d was forcing a good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kalita-Gawrys playing 4@H     North didn't open, but competed after 2N from east|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "competed" = lead directing DBL after 2N-3@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Just so everyone knows we will be logging in-and-out after every single match for security reasons which I believe has been the norm for a while now?|pg||
nt|poohbear: yup|pg||

nt|vugraphzfa: Levin-Weinstein vs Gawrys-Kalita  and  Lev-Pszczola vs Multon-Zimmermann|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's in which room??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Well we've been writing both of these rooms as Open...maybe we should put one of them as Closed|pg||
