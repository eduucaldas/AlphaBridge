mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: passing the redouble could be a penalty pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: i would play it as such|pg||
nt|robinswr: what if you wanted to play 2diamonds doubled ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: partnership agreement about the pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: other room open now . sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|scotty: What if you wanted to have the best chance to get to your best fit?  The actual North hand is a perfect example|pg||
nt|robinswr: if they would always pull then you could redouble with nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Passell Compton v Wrang Fredin|pg||
mb|3C|nt|robinswr: you have to have an agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Smirnov writing a note to Kalita|pg||

mb|3D|nt|scotty: That is the most important thing - to have an agreement.  Far more important than what the agreement actually is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|robinswr: right a bad agreement is better than no agreement|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfa: Piekarek whispers something to Gawrys|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|scotty: On this hand, if N bids 2@h, what does he do when that gets doubled?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Gawrys checking last sessions hand records|pg||

nt|scotty: West might have doubled 3@c - but not clear|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Next round is the last round for the evening. We will Have Mohan Bertens v Hurd Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21  Fredin-Wrang played  2@SNorth -200|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: at the other table Meckstroth Johnson v Lev Pepsi|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|robinswr: no 3diamond overcall?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: west got there first steve|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzfa: 3NT anyone?|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you allow world class players all the room they need, they will probably get to the correct contract. By preempting you could easily make them use judgement|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 3@D might just lead to unbeatable 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: but as we see  too double dummy to lead @C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: cute    too bad that would have been one for the bulletin|pg||
mb|1C!|an|baltic|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: this 1@C very similar to Polish 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in this case  weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|scotty: One suit squeeze would have worked - but would fail if S had 2 honors doubleton in clubs OR if N had 4-card H (and @cAQJ10)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Baltic includes many natural @C distributions that Polish opens 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|robinswr: we're looking at all four hands where its easy to see what would work. easier just to play for the ace of clubs on sides|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if he does PASS   very lucky make|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Gawrys asks about carding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now needs 3@D  to go with 3@C 2@S 1@H|pg||
nt|scotty: I agree - it would be pretty unlucky to fail - and 4@s is not actually cold just looking at E-W cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and   south not getting in before he gets 9|pg||
nt|scotty: No, he will play on spades if S clears hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Smirnov thinking. Giving the show away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right   2nd @S will showout|pg||
nt|scotty: true but irrelevant|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: begrudgingly holding the @h J|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfa: then plays the 9|pg||
