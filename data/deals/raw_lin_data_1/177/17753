mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  some guess work in 4@s but most of the time it will be made|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|peachy: N does not quite have enough for Drury, even if they did play it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: but S knows a likely game and bids it like a human being :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  this will make 5 if no @d is led|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: interesting auction, that - most pairs play some sort of method to distinguish between 3@H to play and 3@H forcing  |pg||
nt|bg: light opening bid style|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: a 3@h rebid looks tempting with the South cards - good hearts and @SAK in partner's suit  |pg||
nt|granguru: S should keep @S3 |pg||
nt|granguru: to enter dummy (in case it is needed) after establishing @Cs|pg||
