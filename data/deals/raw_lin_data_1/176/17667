mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: (He will doubtless look through the BBO records later, to see what I said about him. I had better be a bit careful...)|pg||

nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||

pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Frances Hinden is another BBO commentator. It just shows.... one or two of the commentators can play as well. (Not that I claim to be among them.)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: well, Nevena did for her|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: not could did|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|benjy: it must have been|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing the great one|pg||
nt|benjy: best is to win in hand and play a @H i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and zia's fire will be met with fire|pg||
nt|benjy: Carroll will be delighted that his partner had a trump to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=14  for results|pg||
nt|benjy: over the moon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This has been a double elimination format where the one remaining undefeated team, Penfold, have special privileges. They can choose their opponents in the semi-finals, and they ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: can elect to play a 40-board match if they are behind after 32 (but they can only do it once). |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Penfold vs Hinden in the other SF|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Maybe @sK then @c?|pg||
nt|mamos: It's an interesting twist that MOssop beat Hinden by 62 imps in the first round  so a final rematch would have some "history" :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 52  |pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in such positions you just set up dummy's long suit because then at least that's one suit the defence can't play|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: and you let them do other things to help you|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|benjy: if you are going to play on @Cs then is there any gain in taking the @SK as opposed to running it to hand?|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men med 3-3, går det väl också hem|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|hesse: ikke lett å bete denne kontrakten, forsvaret var avhengig av @c stjeling som ikke er lett å finne|pg||
nt|athene: but that really only works well when there aren't any clear avenues of attack for them|pg||
nt|xenya: 7th trick|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: surprising duck|pg||

nt|mamos: East needs to play trumps now|pg||
nt|benjy: Looks normal to continue trumps here, his spots are so good, he can ruff in and keep drawing them|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|nt|odysseus69: right if declarer had k10 or q10|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you are worried about setting up dummy's spade spots but that was not so much an issue there with no entry to dummy|pg||

pc|s7|nt|nubmaster: åhh|pg||
nt|athene: before the diamond goes on a club|pg||
nt|benjy: this could make if west continues with a 3rd @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|benjy: looks like this should make|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how to get opps into the right contract|pg||
nt|athene: it's not clear for either defender to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|benjy: how does he know his pd does not hold A10 of @S when it would be critical to continue the suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: för mig one man show!|pg||
nt|hesse: her tok det av!|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3@h följt av 5@c så är man färdigbjuden|pg||

nt|mamos: WEll if WEst wins this hed better know what to do next|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|athene: declarer can't get back to hand but if she leads the @CQ, then the @CJ10x come down|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer can't get off the dummy though, so this will still fail|pg||
nt|athene: i mean lead @CQ after winning the king and unblocking in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even then a diamond shift takes the entry out before west's trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: so you still can't use the @C9 as a discard|pg||
nt|xenya: even that won'y help him|pg||
nt|benjy: her|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is similar to a 4@S in the semi-final|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @C9 here is playing for east to have misdefended|pg||
nt|athene: because with @CJ10x, objectively, he had to split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Aj10 of clubs with East is best faint hope|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E hesitated before playing @c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjy: pitch a @C on the established @S winner and lead trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course East would have played the 10 but sometimes people make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: now she might continue @CQ but really east can't do anything then but play a diamond, can he?|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hesse: og tilslutt endte det meget heldig for nordmennene som lå inne for slakt|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: vad kostar 5@dX 500 eller 800|pg||
nt|athene: he might be worried she has @DQx(x) in hand but if she has, there's no stopping the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: sabine could have walked into it here she could be going for a number instead of -80|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no upside|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: think all the same that N action very dangerous on vul|pg||
nt|friggi: strange line of play|pg||
nt|benjy: very odd, did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: ok, good play to give the defence a chance to go wrong|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: now there is no point playing for 4-1 trumps (so you can cash the @C9) because then east would have a trump winner anyway|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2@D seems to be better than 2NT, but there is not much to choose between them.|pg||

nt|ady: though continue with king now  and can lear the suit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ady: still make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is best to lead the ace from A-K-x-x-x at no-trumps, also the K from K-Q-x-x-x, just as you would against a suit contract.|pg||
nt|ady: J@H  a very good card in a weak hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H8 upside-down attititude perhaps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d6|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: She is a dear friend of mine|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: when east turns up with A@H   as wll as the strength in clubs   north will have no problem choosing the spade finesse rather than the diamond finesse|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: Och korrigerar dom till 5@s så är det automatiskt 800|pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: E could also return a club to the same effect|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|hesse: godt resultat for Norge i lukket|pg||
nt|athene: if Penfold doesn't use them at all, can she save them up for next year? :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: i think the main argument against the balancing double is that Zia couldn't overcall over 1@C, so the chances of finding him with a 5-card red suit are not so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS  making their aggressive intentions clear from the very first boards  -  the opening skirmishes of the longer battle|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, she is obviously pursuing an aggressive policy (early on at least)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed I would expect blood to be spilled in this match 4 very aggressive players|pg||
nt|mamos: Now the Irish find themselves in a rather uncomfortable spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|hesse: om spillefører nå gjør alt riktig kan det bli mye stikk|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hesse: bra dukk av Simonsen|pg||
nt|athene: it's worth noting that Auken re-opens with double despite holding only *two* in the unbid major|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: indeed Ben but tommy doesnt know how to spell PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you double there as often as possible|pg||
nt|athene: because your main upside is the penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|benjy: but you know partner isn't passing with the north hand|pg||
nt|benjy: looking at the north cards|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: well, it's unlikely if east is sane, but if partner DOES have a pass, it's big money territory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 10 tricks-as long as she doesnt cover this(she wont)|pg||
nt|athene: and we saw here east doesn't really have a 2@C overcall|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: according to the textbooks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|friggi: it is agressive at least|pg||
pc|h9|nt|benjy: but if partner bids 2@S which they often will, won't you wish you had passed out 2@C?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|athene: 2@H is risky, i agree, because it's a misfit auction - hearts can easily be north's best suit here|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hesse: Nå er gjerne spillefører glad hun ikke fikk @d ut|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not 10 tricks |pg||
nt|athene: partner will usually have five spades to bid 2@S there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 now|pg||
nt|mamos: it depends on which textbooks you have|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: yes, i agree, it can go wrong|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjy: I agree with one of the specs that if you are going to bid then at least overcall directly then you have the upside of getting to a game|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|benjy: but passing is also a big position, so it's not clear|pg||
mc|11|nt|jcomyn: I can see no one will be allowed to play in anything less than 3nt|pg||

nt|athene: zia loves all his cards now - @DQJ doubleton were a bit rubbish when he picked the hand up but they improved when partner opened 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks Hearts agreed|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence from west - most Acol players would bid 2@S second time|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: shows what i know|pg||
nt|benjy: 4nt looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|mamos: EAst has asked for Spade lead but Diamond looks best |pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer can throw a diamond on a spade and take a ruffing diamond finesse?|pg||

nt|athene: does he have the required entries? i think he does - he can just set up dummy|pg||
nt|athene: @S9, @D109|pg||
nt|athene: ah no, the ruffing finesse not enough|pg||
nt|benjy: you have to pitch a @D on the established @S and then take a ruffing @D finesse to make|pg||
nt|athene: since he has only one trump left|pg||
nt|athene: he has to actually drop the doubleton @DK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|nubmaster: Om öst sticker @hQ så kan det gå hem om dom inte fortsätter @d hela tiden, nu blev det automatbet|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|nubmaster: oj|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. cash the @DA and lead the @D2, not the @D10|pg||
nt|benjy: this won't make, surely he will just take a @D finesse|pg||
nt|athene: too hard (in my opinion)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well zia will give it his best shot|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate all these dull boards!! :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well this one DID look dull|pg||
nt|athene: sabine's missing fifth diamond is costly :) you are right, 4-3-5-1 would have had much more offensive potential|pg||
nt|benjy: yes but the downside of no eight card fit|pg||
nt|benjy: the specs have suggested that Sabine would bid 2nt to show 4@S over the 2@S enquiry and hence 4@C showed 4441|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there's plenty of room to show the shape exactly over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but you would need to be a more longstanding partnership than NS i think for that|pg||
nt|athene: now zia knows if he draws trumps he is short of tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine he will take straightforward finesse|pg||
nt|benjy: opposite a 4441 i think Zia had a slam try not a slam drive personally, if he had just bid 4@D that would involve partner, but perhaps he thought 4@C showed extras?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|hesse: @h ess var nok ikke beste forsvar|pg||

pc|cA|nt|athene: depends if 2@S was GF, perhaps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjy: Zia encouraged on the A@D as he wanted a ruff, /sabine thought he held the Q@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: i think the way people play these days, if you only raise partner to 2 and you have a singleton, you are always minimum|pg||
nt|athene: in other words 1@D - 1@H; 3@H is any non-min with a singleton|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s8|pc|h7|nt|mamos: wow |pg||

nt|ritong: but still needs a bit of magic|pg||

mc|8|nt|athene: very hard for west not to cover the @DQ there as zia might just have @DQx|pg||

nt|brolucius: If South had led the @SJ instead of a low spade, she could have set up a 4th-round entry to the North hand.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|benjy: Penfold gain 12 on the last boards when opposite a strong NT west did not drive to game|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was a bit wet i think facing a strong notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: and ended up going down in part score|pg||
nt|athene: even if partner has @Dxx you might make 3nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hesse: kampen er nå helt jevn etter dobbeltscore i spill 21|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hesse: kun 1 imp som skiller|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|benjy: what was the range for 1NT? was it 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: yes|pg||
nt|benjy: hands up if you X with the south cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: Er der et resultat, der skal rettes, Signe?|pg||
nt|hesse: operatør, kan du endre spill 20 til 2 bet?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy: So west had a normal pass, opposite a 15-17 then west is always going to bid game|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Giv mig spil nr. spilfører, og antal stik, så får du koden|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4HS-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: not me i don't think|pg||
nt|benjy: not me|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: but don't you make 9 tricks on a @H lead?|pg||
nt|benjy: so was there a @S lead in the other room perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: OK, will sign off and try to check the network before the next set|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it would have to have been @s 10|pg||
nt|athene: but 1NT sort of counts as a club bid so maybe this is just showing majors|pg||
nt|athene: and doesn't promise clubs at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|mc|8|nt|mamos: those eight went in a flash|pg||
nt|benjy: 4 imps to Sinclair when 1NT was passed un the OR and made 90|pg||
nt|athene: one other point worth a mention|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's really important to get into the bidding over 1nt if you have only a 4-4 fit |pg||
nt|athene: because that 44 fit just isn't taking so many tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: so with 44 majors maybe double 1nt is right and you just accept the other flaws|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Thnks all. Back soon.......|pg||
nt|benjy: Bye for now|pg||
