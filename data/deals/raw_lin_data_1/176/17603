nt|Walddk6: N-S play Magic Diamond, so you'd better get a CC|pg||

nt|rodal f: Re again Sveta and Daiva + specs:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: a suprising push|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: played east for 7 hearts|pg||

nt|hawe45: Hello Frank - er dette Vilnius?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|rodal f: Hei Hans. Ja.|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: someone call Larry Cohen.....  two ten card fits and the Total Tricks are only 17 :)|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: 12 imps swing for I_VVU .. they made 5@Cx on board 18|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision 2@c, 2@d asks|pg||
nt|shevek: I like the overloaded 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45: We start with a rather easy 4 @S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|andyv:  should arrive at 4@s|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|ady: 4 soades made in CR    trump lead best|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe I should drop commentating here - North is one of my (few) very good friends|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|r_tibre: yes.. easy 10 tricks here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: inspired raise by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it seems clear to me .. a fit and a void and partner is 15+ :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then it must be a good one. |pg||
nt|hawe45: Risky from North - Ace-King in partners singleton controls the suit - with wasted values|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  fortunately for declarer, a club ruff would not hurt as it would be done with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes andy :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: played by E they would lose first 3 tricks and then no problems|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzku: very well done at the other table .. Karaivanov put S in hand with 2 of @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: and imps flying around :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|patricck: An annoying layout for 3NT NS..... 9 tricks but no way to take them|pg||
nt|hawe45: Looks like Ekran-conv = majors and weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: indeed.. @D 3-3 means 9 tricks at @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N should bid 2@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: 140 should be easy|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hawe45: For sure, West will bid 3 @S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|patricck: taking the money in 4@C doubled was the best option, 4@H may lose 2@S, 1@D and 1@C, not to mention the @H situation|pg||
nt|patricck: An easy decision for Choti really.... he would feel sure that the chasing team will be bound to try 3NT on his hand, so he wants to do the same thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: - but not now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: a truly beauty|pg||

nt|patricck: very true, but there are 4 losers without that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oho!|pg||
nt|hawe45: This can be one down on an end-play - otherwise 2 down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2 down from the start - with 2 @d ruffs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: hand 13  whwere 620 score in 4@S  CR  seems an error to   watched the movie   play siimilar to here    cant work out how 10 tricks eree claimed|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the mighty deuce :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes, wonderful|pg||
nt|hawe45: It seems, that North has  values, showed by bidding 3 @C (Lebensohl)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sarkar_suk: poddar developers open their acount just now :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  play has slowed down to a crawl|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@S not my choice with a not opening  partner |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, looks like one off|pg||
nt|hawe45: Friendly match - no double|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so. but thes S should try to find 3nt contract, rather - asking partner for @s stopper|pg||
nt|hawe45: Has one player left the table? I mean, this @D-ruff is easy to "see"...|pg||

pc|d8|nt|r_tibre: we should get comparisons for 2 boards hereon|pg||
nt|patricck: next board please :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: they may have taken a break|pg||
nt|r_tibre: possible partial swing on 15, and a grand on a finesse on 20 is all i see as otential gains for PD|pg||
nt|r_tibre: potential*|pg||
nt|patricck: you never know what will happen at this crazy game we play :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: true :)|pg||

nt|patricck: oh, still not enough anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45: 4 @C is always 3 down, better bid 5 for one down|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after endplay, 2 down is expected - E will give ruff and discard, but EW take 2 @h tricks all in all|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|patricck: because declarer can't get to dummy for the trump finesse|pg||
