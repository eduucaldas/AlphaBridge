mb|p|nt|chilloncan: family battle here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chilloncan: EW plying standard fare, NS "minimeck"|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: interesting tactical problem facing S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: XX may seem a bit odd, but i suspect she is trying to dissuade opps from doubling a later heart bid or from bidding 4S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chilloncan: 3S understandable .... if 3S is game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: S strategy may end up backfiring|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S down on good defense|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and CC may keep them at 3|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: are we watching moscito?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cicus: unless something goes redoubled here we cannow safely congratulate Auguri to their win|pg||
nt|tomi2: so Auguri will join Unia and Wroclaw in the semis in may (20.-22.)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: well, i hadnt counted on S planning tio bid 4H....maybe they paly 2-tiered weak 2s so ts N hand is dead minimum for 2H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl3: the last one. thanks all and see you next time! :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: MiniMeck|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: NS did put up a valiant fight but that proved a little few for their excellent opposition|pg||
nt|chilloncan: after this lead, S must defend carefully|pg||
nt|sybarra: both pairs I  take it |pg||
