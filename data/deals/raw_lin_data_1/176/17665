mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|henryb:  busy Zia|pg||
nt|athene: the 2-way club can be weak tactically if opps overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you are worse-off than normal strong clubbers|pg||
nt|rmb1: There is some merit in playing in your seven card suit - even if it isn't game|pg||
nt|athene: because partner had to act over the initial overcall with the assumption you have the balanced rubbish|pg||
nt|athene: so he can't make a descriptive bid with 8+ points as he can in a normal strong club|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: South had to guess but guess good|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so south punts 4@S and gets lucky-ish|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: a fair shot - partner looks likely to be short in hearts so ought to have some spades|pg||

nt|odysseus69: and Mike|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@H had play|pg||

nt|athene: i don't see any reason here for declarer to play the king on the first round of diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: you might do it sometimes if you were scared south had @DQx/@DJx and could get a ruff, i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michael, do you have a score from the other SF after 3 segments?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is off, even if South plays @D|pg||
nt|athene: but that's not really consistent with the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: No, sorry.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it doesn't matter who plays diamonds, declarer will lose two tricks there along with two hearts and a club|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|henryb:  -50 looks to be well above par|pg||
nt|athene: -50 might gain big (4@H), might gain small (@H partscore) and can really only lose small (hearts going down in the other room?)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would think North might well have bid 4@h opposite partner's presumably negative double|pg||
nt|athene: hard to believe that NS in the other room would lie down to 2@S|pg||

nt|bluejak:  after 3 sessions: running score in ([brackets]):  Sinclair 28 ([74])  Mossop 1  ([53])  ====  Penfold 14  ([50])  Hinden 8  ([49])|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise the defence had better get themselves @DA, @DQ and @CK - that might not be too easy|pg||

nt|athene: it's one of those situations where declarer might throw either minor on the other|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond switch from West may not be so obvious |pg||
nt|athene: diamond back, club shift|pg||
nt|henryb:  playing on diamonds looks wrong to me|pg||
nt|athene: it may be very hard for Auken to imagine that declarer had only a singleton heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now defence in comfort|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  but easy to see that partner has @dA and that a @c shift would be good|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests he could play ace and another spade but that wouldn't work either|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|athene: west just wins and plays a diamond back to the ace and now a club switch|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer rises ace and comes to hand with @DJ to draw trumps he can't get to the diamonds in dummy any more|pg||
nt|henryb:  except that now they have conspired to let it make|pg||
nt|athene: naaaa|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
