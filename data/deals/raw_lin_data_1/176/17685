nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the Cavendish Teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ns play "Baltic Club" [a spin-off from Polish Club] which uses a multi-purpose 1@C opener |pg||

nt|ritong: might deserve a check|pg||
mb|1S|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18, 5+@D|pg||
nt|ritong: about the number of tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"    EW play their version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
nt|sybarra: we might be "right siding"  something  or ??|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H could actually be 3 cards with 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||
nt|hawe45: The double was a BIG mistak!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures updating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C FG   ostensibly natural or values|pg||
pc|cT|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: i am getting suggestions from spectators, none of which seem to fit, anyway the result is an ugly contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: too many |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: ok then cant be wrong :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board removes 20 IMP|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: i thought Piek had a way to find out shortness after 2@D  but don't know if he'd be able to learn about 3@H that way|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: it could be some application of xyz but seems more like $%& to me|pg||

pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: it appears to me that north took a position with 1nt and 2@D was an attempt to signoff at 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-18 HCP, 5+@S  maybe stronger if 2-suited|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: purists would find much wrong with this 2@H bid, but it often works well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18 with 5+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a limited opening 1@S, 4@S is much wider range than in standard|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S could be 3 cards with longer @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis-Bessis are playing  2 in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, INV+     but maybe he'll just gamble 3N??|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will have a tough bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as you see sometimes it is opening strength, but no slam interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: E Greco asking if they play precision|pg||
mb|1N|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
nt|ritong: now|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT is like 19/20 more or less balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit of a psyche?   i think 3@C=game force 3+@C natural or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry I can not see the explanations of the alerts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is sitting the thinker man's pose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helness DBL might actually help them find the 50% game that makes with @SK onside|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: yes I have check 19 and we will be fixing it|pg||
nt|ritong: would n t you facing a 2NT opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: it is the same situation, approximately  except that you suspect the opener to have some goods|pg||
nt|sybarra: its only 5 with nothing to write home about |pg||
nt|sybarra: and white|pg||
nt|sybarra: this cant be but so many imps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there are als strong options to 1@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: The textbooks recommend that you pass 1@C; there must be something wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund finds the featherweight response...Orkoneva is grateful to the 2D overcall which simplified his rebid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbooks say 6+ for a response|pg||
nt|woozle: Only Granovetter tip worth reading - never pass your partner's 1C at favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room that was quite a 2N bid from Mike Moss opposite passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: That's an error in the textbooks - a far better way to describe it is "6 points is the amount with which you must respond"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did his hand improve after 3@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 small ones in East's suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Do you think that North had not described the full majesty of his hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@s by N - only game if S can bid 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - but South first showed 3-card support, then received the message from North: I am weak - ant THEN overbid on the 3-level. Now North must bid 4 @S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude  with Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still i dont see where 9th trick coming from|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how do you explain to partner/teammates that you freely rebid a suit then lost 4 trump tricks  [if EW negotiate the @D ruff]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some tables are finishing up and leaving the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is playing with a spade|pg||
nt|kit: From Weinstein's 2NT call. Levin thinks Weinstein is 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|warrens:  East might think his partner is 2344 unless some of this is artificial|pg||
nt|kit: yes, many players would rebid 2@C instead of 1NT with Weinstein's shape|pg||
nt|ritong: missing both minor queens they won t be in 7|pg||
nt|kit: problem here is:  has a trump suit been confirmed?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  Normal practice in Northern Europe is to lead 2nd and fourth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: South has run out of pass cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 3S is descriptive anyway - he hadn't promised the fifth spade|pg||
nt|scotty: After 2N, East KNOWS there is an 8-card minor fit,  What he doesn't know is what slam to play|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible that 4@D isn't natural -- may be intended as RKC for clubs, may be some kind of relay|pg||
nt|kit: But if Weinstein is thinking here, they might not be on the same page.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: now just a guess as to how many down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me that 4@D made them guess -- 5@D now says  "they guessed right???"    seems there was at least one flawed thought there|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: I would think natural - no reason why not|pg||
nt|scotty: Tempting to bid 7?|pg||
nt|warrens:  must be tempted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby opens and closes his hand now has set his cards on the table and his head is in his hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: a big sigh|pg||
nt|scotty: West denied 4 good clubs by not raising over 3@c or 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: still Weinstein didn't have to jump to slam if he has a minimum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: here they all come |pg||

nt|warrens:  I think he'll make 7@C if he's in it.  ruff one spade and take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|kit: yes, it seems like he should make it if he plays carefully -- 5 trump tricks, 3 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|hawe45: Even if DK bids 3 @S here, they might score at least 3 IMPÂ´s|pg||

nt|scotty: finesse at worst|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|woozle: Orkoneva was right to double 3D - Rohrberg wasn't going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Easy club shift.  And when declarer finds AQ of clubs and king of spades in East hand, he will get the diamonds right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: no|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what about 3N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and NS win the war|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3NT is scary with no idea if he has a source of tricks|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Tor and Geir having a discussion|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @D is better than 6 NT!|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D makes if you take the spade finesse, fails if you try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: But a lot more tricky to play|pg||

mb|2H|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||

mb|d|an|3 card support|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 2@C on last board was a big position, especially with 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last bd of the 2nd round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it could be 5 5 the 2nt but North showed the 3 diamond cared|pg||
nt|kit: Double probably shows 4 or more spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||

nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: break is usually 10-15 minutes, but seems this table ending late so might be sooner|pg||

nt|ritong: depending on the third downtrick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4/5 imps = 19-11 VPs   but hard to imagine this hand being anywhere near a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator said  Bramley opened East hand 2@C "after much deliberation"|pg||
