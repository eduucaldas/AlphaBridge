nt|Walddk2: 3NT is ambitious but who cares|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They need to find the defence|pg||
nt|paulhac:  I thought it was automatic Victor:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Director call delaying the lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lead partners suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: 2NT described as weak with diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: definitely a possibility to lead a heart here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: in fact i would say it's the normal lead|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone and welcome back to Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplay in England, for the annual Schapiro Spring Foursomes. Semi-finals, four segments of 8 boards. This ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is the third|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: birthplace even|pg||
nt|mamos: hi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: well in the context birthplay is a good word|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: ...bathed in honey-coloured sunshine now|pg||
nt|benjy: Will Zia bid again?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|benjy: i think its risky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: minor game gone again|pg||
nt|bluejak:  2nd stanza running scores in  brackets :  Sinclair  32  46   Mossop  31   52   ====  Penfold  29  36   Hinden  18  41 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy: Although 5@C makes, it's not a game you want to be in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good discipline from both. E-W have a very lucky make in 5C or 5D so any pushing might egg them on|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Cornelia, Mike and Vladimir|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rubbish if there is game on anywhere i want to be in it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: egg who on where|pg||
nt|jbennet: p often has 8-10 black cards ; Qxx of no use in own contract. |pg||
nt|ritong: hello everybody|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no i am serious i dont miss games thast way|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Hi Henri|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a few penalties maybe|pg||
nt|bluejak:  3-0 to Sinclair|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjy: so are you suggesting that you would be in game on the e/w cards here?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|ppiglett: It is commonly accepted that you need to be 42% non vul games and 36% Vul games at Imps. This is about 24%|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbennet: North did indeed have 4c support; yet 3 h wouldnt have achieved anything positive.|pg||
nt|mamos: that must be the lowest scoring set of the entire event|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: +1 IMP|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mamos: one off|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: i had a 20 per cent chance of surviving two years ago - and that wasnt a card game|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
mc|8|nt|benjy: i think game is a lot less than 24%|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so what|pg||
nt|jbennet: so on the balance it must be winning to refrain from bidding again. (|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: ho hum.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|benjy: Sabine has a tough call here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|xenya: 12 tricks in a heart contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: I probably should do more work on my Maths the minor game was more like 16 or17% - not a good prospect.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: did u never back a horse peter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|jbennet: Think sabine just made sort of invitaitonal sequence. but Zia might interpret it as showing 4 sp + longer Diamonds|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes - why?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and di u ver back a 20/1 winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sabine giving S room to clrify hand type economically. would presumably have passed 3N|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: 5@d very difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I backed Trevor Immelman at 390/.1 for the masters - and he won as u know|pg||
nt|benjy: i wonder if she would have corrected 3@S to 3NT to show doubt?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Never - nobody ever gave me a 20-1 tip. They always kept those to themselves|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect so|pg||
nt|mamos: not quite sure what 3NT means here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@h is not a good contract, requiring either 2-2 hearts with the K onside or stiff king of hearts|pg||
nt|benjy: strong nt i expect|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: and graeme mcdowell at 85/1 for us open|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 4NT not discussed, explains Zia|pg||
nt|benjy: well bid, this is the top spot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Aren't the odds in golf so high to try and get people to stay away from backing Tiger and Phil. It is a simple numbers game.|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H isn't a contract I'd be happy to be in (at least not before I saw the @H lie) :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|jcomyn: a minor game - hooray|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Penfold won't mind|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bluejak:  Ruling requested on hand 17.  2NT described as weak with diamonds when East asked after 3D rebid.  South said description wrong.  Correct explanation is weak with diamonds OR game force with diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, they also have that 8-board option if things go wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: dull games are just what she is after at the moment|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes thats possible and the heart lead could be a winner when partner has KJxx but its easy to construct hands where any lead is fatal and easier to construct deals here a spade ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: works and a heart doesnt- like KQJxx spades and club ace with pd|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Slight communication problems |pg||
pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: east carefully trying to play a middling heart|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: if you think somebody or something will win bet on it then|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: is perpetual optimism an instinct?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes thats it exactly|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes there was some traps in the play , but sabine is way too good to misplay hands like the previous one.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: anyway going with the odds all the time is boring|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ppiglett: A bit of watermudding from Zia|pg||
nt|benjy: psychic XX from Zia|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, that psychic redouble fools them in the club game in Kandahar:)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Parner has a big hand with spades W should bid 4 I believe - tough for E now.|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S? is a huge underbid|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|benjy: west is close to a slam try than an invite|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ppiglett: It worked here!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|jcomyn: lol|pg||
nt|benjy: on board 17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jbennet: seeing the legend ZIA to his left making a RD made him absolutely terrified. So he made a panic-looking pass|pg||
nt|ppiglett: he had bid his hand though but I would not have risked the pass.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: understandable, since the reason Zia is legendary is that he always has his bid|pg||
nt|ritong: and more|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing bothers John Carroll i can tell you but Garveys bid was highly invitational not weak|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The problem was the 3S bid. I understand East's pass far more than a poultry raise by W. West could do same with - xxx, xx, Qxxx, Qxxx|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jbennet: they are not using lebensohl 1NT as a response to P TO x on 1 major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if this is "You be the Judge", i would clap the gyves on W. to me his only options are 4S and a cuebid.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know about  that Peter. it depends what pass over the XX wouild have meant|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: even Sabine can't make a silk purse out of this one|pg||

nt|benjy: i agree Henry|pg||
nt|mamos: lol   yes 3NT would have made |pg||
nt|benjy: i would have bid 3@S over 3@H and sat 3NT, you can still get to 4@H if partner can't bid 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Sabine is taking something off as the room is getting too warm. Need I say more??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Her coat I take it|pg||
nt|benjy: her hat?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I dI guess if S had H9 or KQ of hearts doubleton, this could make|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - the defence could always arraneg to play four rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  except that N-S could just continue @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: I'm told I'm sexist, as I wouldn't tell you if Zia took off his jacket...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|benjy: would you guys cue bid over a 2@H response?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: if he does, tell us, and I'll see if I can find a sexist remark to make, to compensate :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|benjy: One might just try 2NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: and the the prize for that was 5 - 7 IMP:s (dependning on many down 3NT is going to be -1 or -2 dependning on how whe plays the hearts).|pg||
nt|benjy: she effectively drove to game with her hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Oh yes forgot about the 2D bid. My judgement for these hand was if partner doubles and bid a suit you can raise to game with three trumps and an Ace (ish)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of what pass would have meant and what 2D showed, W had a game bid. especially against Zia. :) for God;s sake dont encourage him:):)|pg||
nt|benjy: 12 imps to Sinclair on 18 when 5@D went down|pg||
nt|benjy: and another 10 on 19 when they bid the cold 4@S|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The'll be trying that manouver in the clubs across England. It is a bit like the Cruyff turn!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone remember the herbert convention after a x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: then 2c by s shows a bust|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|jbennet: its adviseable to have a way to show weakness as a response to P TO double.  |pg||

nt|ppiglett: d'accord|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well it has one or two merits|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbennet: 1NT= weakness is (a long term winning concept) BUT b) 95% av all players disagrees with that. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I think the only possibility is if someone has @hKQ and only three @d|pg||
