nt|bjacobs: Still, it's not an easy slam to bid with any confidence|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is exciting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Even 6@S?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: heart lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: 6 spades from East Ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: How do you play on a heart lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, I can undertake to make it as West, but of course, I have to guess correctly|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I win @HA, over to the club, top spades, then play the clubs and pray|pg||
mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: both sides ok - North has 3 clubs with long spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And find you have led a good life after all - seem unlikely, Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Praying is often the best line|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well, you would do most of that, but you MIGHT take the diamond finesse instead, when you discover the spade loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Unfortunately, the discussion here that "6@h makes" was overheard at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: So they might not be able to play that board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not so good|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Which 6@H? The previous Board? Great analysis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But clever by the side that stopped in game :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Sorry, 6@c of course|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdv: or 6NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder if they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT pick a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5NT -pick a slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: And by "other table" I meant the other open room table, so not this match. This match is fine.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would have thought that 5NT was "pick a slam", but why this pause now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@S might play better opposite a singleton and no @CQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why Sabine was thinking is my guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe thinking about 7 clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: either way, it points to what a useful bidding tool "5NT pick a slam" is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Heart AK D A |pg||
nt|bjacobs: In our days of RKCB, the grand-slam-force is much loess common, so the 5NT bid can be used to a better purpose|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|hesse: her måtte vel gjerne @d ut for bet|pg||
nt|benjy: if east has one @S then 7@S is decent|pg||
nt|ppiglett: As the said a few years ago about bidding, the club suit is well gone, diamond are now gone and hearts and spades need to be carefull. Such a joy to see a few suits natural |pg||
nt|bluejak:  After 1 stanza:  Sinclair 14  Mossop 21   +++  Hinden 23  Penfold 7|pg||
mb|5S|nt|jcomyn: ok but lets see what suit they play in and at what level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bloodaxe: lengste og beste farge ut mot NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: og det var ikke naturlig for Simonsen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 7c on?????|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: really 5@s...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant be surely|pg||
nt|rmb1: Even if you bid clubs naturally, they get lost if you use blackwood|pg||
nt|benjy: firstly i dont think 7@C is making|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: well better than 5s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|benjy: secondly opposite 3 key cards for many 5@S would be forcing, but that is a matter for agreement|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I guess East was supposed to move wit 3 aces rather than none, but maybe he thought partner already knew he couldn't have none..... |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much easier to play 2NT with say 13 opposite 11 than 23-1|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Still, West seems to be endplayed on lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: And declarer can keep endplaying her if he guesses the layout|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the spade lead ... is it too much to pray that partner has at least one card there?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the alternative is a heart lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: I think that next door West thought they were playing in clubs and did not expect a pass over 5 spades|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this is the right line, @SJ at trick one is surely better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken did lead a low spade|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, this play sort of continues the end-playing process|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Feels better to take a trick, but he has got West back in the endplay|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and people often lead from nothing on this auction, so perhaps declarer thought East might have @SQx|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: we have a long way to go on this deal|pg||

nt|bjacobs: it's like a game of German Whist|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better for West to play heart 10 rather than confusing 7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: If @D9 is genuinely discouraging he could try a low diamond|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and West is again after @HQ and a low diamond, but not now|pg||

pc|s7|pc|h5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|rmb1: 2H = 0-4 no King, 2NT would be a real positive in hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|benjy: going back to the opening lead for a moment, for me it would be a @H lead, trying to go as passive as possible|pg||

nt|bluejak:  Unfortunately a remark was made at this table about board 16 and was heard in the other match.  So Hinden v Penfold is playing a substitute board 16.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I always take one trick less than everyone else, so if you can make 2, I can make 1|pg||

nt|rmb1: a random game try (last train at the two level)??|pg||
nt|benjy: if it was last train, which has been suggested to me, then why on earth is east bidding game?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Some sort last train style bid to describe a reasonable overcall and stay below 2S?|pg||
nt|benjy: terrible minor suit holdings, no ruffing value and minimum in points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes very soft values outside trumps|pg||
nt|benjy: i would be more worried about going off in 3@S than making game|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not if North raises|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that pass is a surprise|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: It's on the diamond finesse - rather against the odds when North has opened perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: or spades 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they playing with screens, Michael?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I might be wrong but I think 2@h shows 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: No screens, no|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Yes, South forgot the system|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, if it DOES show 5 spades, then E/W are just plain unlucky, because there has been no infraction|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah, no screens, no ask|pg||
nt|bjacobs: incredibly unlucky, and of course it explains West's silence|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|bjacobs: So if the director is called, N/S will have to convince him that 2@H systemically showed spades|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: They will need a system card that has it, or system notes, or whatever|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But they may be fined for not 'knowing' the system|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|rmb1: NS had copious system notes at last years Spring Fours (when I had to rule on one of their auctions)|pg||

nt|rmb1: Such finds would be unusual in England, South is allowed to forget the system|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Director called|pg||
nt|rmb1: Such fines ...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't think players should be allowed to play methods that they cannot remember. It is too hard on opponents|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's common in USA|pg||
