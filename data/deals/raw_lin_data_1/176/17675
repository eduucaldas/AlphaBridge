mb|2N!|an|GF 4+!h|nt|vugraphzcg: now Zold can be sure of partner's @h void|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H or even 4@S might be the contract and 5 @D looks as a good save, but 4@H are not yet made, so......|pg||
mb|d!|an|TO|nt|korszurku: 5@D is a good save, I am sure NS wont stop below 5|pg||
nt|korszurku: possibly even 6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But EW may decide to bid one more - and that would be interesting|pg||
nt|april7: S should not lead the singleton @S against a @H contract, rather @D with his 4 trumps|pg||

nt|korszurku: favourable vul, he sees partner has a @H void|pg||
nt|cuttysark: How strong can North be? does he not hope to beat 4@H?|pg||
nt|april7: the 4 @H in his hands made S pass the 4@H contract|pg||
nt|korszurku: surely 4@H COULD go down, but this is not a good bet imho|pg||
nt|korszurku: even if he does get a @H trick (surely he does not expect to get 2)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Will be disappointed to see @HA in West|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Might hope to get a spade ruff, 2 hearts and @DA|pg||

nt|vugraphzch: why?|pg||
nt|offthebend: but quite popular in many countries :)|pg||
nt|szalay:  1. gives more room to ops|pg||
nt|szalay:  2. better defences than against w2|pg||

mb|2S!|an|p or c|nt|april7: 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 3NT :|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3N looks very reasonable, so does double|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3NT - or 5@C - not 4@C|pg||
nt|korszurku: 4@C in their methods is @C + @H|pg||
nt|korszurku: so not an option|pg||
nt|vugraphzcg: 4@c is leaping michaels|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not fond of double - partner will bid 4@H on a 4card suit too often|pg||
mb|3N|nt|korszurku: if you are planning to bid 5@C why not double before?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: So 4@C not an option. Nonleaping Michaels is one of my least favourite conventions|pg||
mb|p|nt|korszurku: so many good things can happen (ie partner bids pass or 3NT)?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Double than 5! over 4@H should be a much stronger hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|april7: but you are not willing to bid 5@C for sure|pg||
nt|korszurku: is it a bad thing if partner bids 4@H on a 4 card suit?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|korszurku: could be good if we have slow winners in the red suits|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: not after a 3@S opening, E might easily have a 5card @H suit then|pg||
nt|korszurku: 3N might have no chance (like now on a spade lead) while 4@H could make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I like 4-3 fits as much as anybody - but not on deals where there the hands are very unbalanced|pg||
nt|korszurku: I would probably bid 3N myself I just don't think it is automatic|pg||
nt|korszurku: and double is the only other option imho|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Should East double 3NT for a spade lead?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: In that case - he can't very well double :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: it's not so much the level of the 4-3 fit - it's the likelihood of a 5-1 or 6-0 break |pg||

nt|cuttysark: 3NT :) call me Hamman|pg||

nt|korszurku: too strong for 3@C, to awkward for other calls|pg||
nt|korszurku: interesting hands... one after the other|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The sort of contract that might make, or go 7 down if clubs do not come in|pg||
mb|3C|nt|korszurku: I would worry much more about diamonds than clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@C probably what I would do at the table|pg||
