mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcd: hello :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Partscore in @S seems best.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: get|pg||
nt|cicus: the start that the trailing team needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: go for the @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: sorry about the technical problems|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 3@D=?|pg||
nt|cicus: some 4441 positive|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 4144 GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: has to find Hx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If u can explain the alerts it will help specs as well as commentator. Might a CC at the pairs?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcd: i can't explain, sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzcd: i can only see that what they are alerting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: probably key.card response so no slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: mighty simple bidding if it stays here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: tht it might have ended up overboard the way the auction was going|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner wasn't going to raise to 4@S (which they should with 2) then hard to see how 4@S won't have at least 4 losers, whereas 4@D might be making.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: well this should be a small gain for PD....  they all help|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: as the cards lie, 4@h can be made, but hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|patricck: singleton Q@S is of course an unusual exception|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: the difference between 7 and 8 tricks is nothing, both are 4 Imps.....need 9 tricks to get an extra Imp|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi rodal|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|patricck: If Partner has KQ@D and a small singleton spade then 4@D would be making and 4@S would have no chance, far more likely than the actual hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|shevek: same auction in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I'm sure W is bidding  out his distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be no trouble making 6 on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  all declarer will have to do is time the @c ruff correctly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h to Q, @d to A and @h to J, then play 3 rounds of @cs and ruff|pg||
nt|patricck: 10 Imps to PD from Board 22, the difference is now 34|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: i wouldnt fancy this as declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kemperg: will do that, they play well|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: absolutely correct line andy :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: B1 was as predicted max by @S EW. 50+50 made 3IMP|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: J@C may prove wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok since the 9 falls - but didnt need to be|pg||
nt|cicus: small @H now only way|pg||
nt|cicus: to create a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very difficult for the declarer for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: most hands are interesting - getting them right is difficult but instructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not done:)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd chance:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: defence will almost certainly assist b|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kemperg: and the 3rd:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|sarkar_suk: now no chance :)lol|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 10@S lead in CR   won by east  and a heart  south wone with ace and continued spades   east won and played a low diamond   and from there could not be beaten|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will be relieved|pg||
nt|cicus: I think S must know partner has @HQ - why id declarer not play on @Hs?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: you had that typed in advance:(|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dK|pc|s9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|c3|nt|patricck: the ruff with the 10@H has promoted an extra trump trick for East|pg||

nt|andyv:  W lucky this didn't go down on his line of play|pg||
nt|andyv:  an easy game missed in the OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite near a slam in @S here. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: last hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: one day i'll learn to check before I start typing :(|pg||
nt|r_tibre: -1 only|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C=upgraded strong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Latvian guys use 4-cards major opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: no some kind of two suiter|pg||
mb|r|nt|roswolf: G-DKR need to make a move soon|pg||
nt|patricck: so flat board and still 34 difference|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty, Daiva|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: 4@s might have some chances here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, but you possibly need to guess the Q@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzku: 7 top tricks now ..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if not such a vulnerability, 5@c could have been the best bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: west is already endplayed :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if @SK was at E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: only lead to make it|pg||
nt|kemperg: S bid 3@H ment as forcing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cicus: almost|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like a push - W has 7 top tricks and 2 more - natural came in majors |pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Slam:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here they had problems to read there cards good enough. OR had it easyer.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the play must be very fast here - nothing special|pg||
pc|s5|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W has only 13 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, it's hard to imagine NS can do something|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: now, for sure|pg||
nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @s to K|pg||
nt|shevek: first time|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a huge bonus for poddar :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|shevek: 11 imps to Shrikant|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and, as a spec points out, 6@s is cold...just have to ruff one club|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have lowered point count to be able to cope with nebulous 1@D more easily|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|shevek: easy to bid (I thought)|pg||
nt|patricck: really should have been enough to bid 7@D in this room as well|pg||

pc|h6|nt|roswolf: yes more imps likely to I-VVU|pg||

nt|andyv:  it's reflexive to duck, the A@h but I can't see where it's beneficial to do that.|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, we never got to that stage because Shrikant have just gained 11 on board 24|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|sfoxa:  but in practice they will rather land in 3NT, like next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||

nt|shevek: if the contract was 6@d that is|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov said that it should offer partner a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: but even then @Ds can be played into the safe hand|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|shevek: maybe take the @s finesse now|pg||
nt|patricck: very odd @H play in the other room that led to declarer going down|pg||
