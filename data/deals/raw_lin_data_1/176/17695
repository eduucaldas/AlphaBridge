nt|ritong: might deserve a check|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18, 5+@D|pg||
nt|ritong: about the number of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"    EW play their version of Precision|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
nt|sybarra: we might be "right siding"  something  or ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H could actually be 3 cards with 5+@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
nt|kit: question here is whether North is worth 3@H or not|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||
nt|hawe45: The double was a BIG mistak!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures updating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C FG   ostensibly natural or values|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: i am getting suggestions from spectators, none of which seem to fit, anyway the result is an ugly contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: too many |pg||
nt|kit: If he had bid 2@H South might have taken a move anyway, since the 2@H call should show something extra -- could have pased 1@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: ok then cant be wrong :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board removes 20 IMP|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i thought Piek had a way to find out shortness after 2@D  but don't know if he'd be able to learn about 3@H that way|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be some application of xyz but seems more like $%& to me|pg||
nt|kit: with the hearts 2-2, declarer always has 5 hearts, 2 spades, 2 clubs, 1 diamond.  If the hearts were 3-1, he would have to get a tenth trick out of one of the minors.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfb: North said sorry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Norway now +26 against Sweden|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: seems there was  some misunderstanding|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: this will be interesting race|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: both sides of the screens Greco and Hampson asking Piekrek and Smirnov what the bids are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy this looks like nice contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: if you get answers Debbie, feel free to share|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfb: reverse smith|pg||
nt|ritong: weinstein is considering a @h to the K|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems 6@H 4@D and 2@S [with King onside]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: it appears to me that north took a position with 1nt and 2@D was an attempt to signoff at 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-18 HCP, 5+@S  maybe stronger if 2-suited|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: purists would find much wrong with this 2@H bid, but it often works well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18 with 5+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of a limited opening 1@S, 4@S is much wider range than in standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S could be 3 cards with longer @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis-Bessis are playing  2 in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, INV+     but maybe he'll just gamble 3N??|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will have a tough bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: as you see sometimes it is opening strength, but no slam interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: E Greco asking if they play precision|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C invitational.  3NT is probably a better contract, since it might make and if it doesn't 3@C might fail also.  Not clear.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
nt|ritong: now|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT is like 19/20 more or less balanced|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit of a psyche?   i think 3@C=game force 3+@C natural or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry I can not see the explanations of the alerts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is sitting the thinker man's pose|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: Helness DBL might actually help them find the 50% game that makes with @SK onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can not see how E can move again |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: yes I have check 19 and we will be fixing it|pg||
nt|ritong: would n t you facing a 2NT opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||

nt|sybarra: its only 5 with nothing to write home about |pg||
nt|sybarra: and white|pg||
nt|sybarra: this cant be but so many imps|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein shifts to a spade, which he surely will, declarer has a difficult decision.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: at this table we will be lucky to see a hand played out|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not playing with Peter Gill you aren't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=multi-purpose  in this case, a weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|warrens:  a pretty good 6@C here|pg||
nt|ritong: bidding and making 6@c would be artistic, for that matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we are in a huddle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||
nt|pelu: a slam on finess of @sK - bid by Sweden (6NT) so they didnt miss 2 keycards|pg||
nt|woozle: I think we've worked out what about that situation is different|pg||
nt|kit: In other room declarer did go up ace of spades and made it -- but can the 9 of spades really be trusted?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: DBL  5-7 |pg||

nt|woozle: South shouldn't cue anything|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D inverted, but since a passed hand it isn't forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  1@c "Polish": usually a ballanced 10-13; sometimes strong (18+) or perhaps natural with clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't have thought South hand was worth another call, but perhaps they open more soundly so there could still be a game.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: This hand must be a worst-case for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C and 4@D forced S to show a @H-stopper|pg||

pc|cT|nt|woozle: Should start spades with the 8, planning to run the jack next|pg||
nt|pelu: over 3@C - 3@S = minimum and now 4@D by N = do u have a @H stopper? - not a free cue bid but forcing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Steve seriously thinks you should open 1@S on   xxxxx  --  A  AKQJ10xx   "I play 5-card majors", he says|pg||
nt|poohbear: Pepsi has to figure out who has the singleton @c . When defending a contract at the one lvl one has to imagine how he would declare it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: i don't have a CC  so unsure if the  'underlead' from doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from Greco's @C7  i suspect EW lead hi  from 2 |pg||
nt|poohbear: There is an indication that Lev has the stiff @c since most lead trumps on this auction|pg||
nt|poohbear: as pointed out. Not clear he has a trump|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: my bifocals are having a tuff time seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C tends to deny 4@H  [1N overcall = Raptor  4@H & 5+@C/@D]|pg||
nt|kit: if South overcalls and West tries a negative double, they will play there!|pg||
nt|po-s: negative free?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: hola|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know their style, but I don't think they play neg free bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this instance of 1@C opening is  natural   4+@C, 11+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are als strong options to 1@C|pg||
nt|po-s: so what was this?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The textbooks recommend that you pass 1@C; there must be something wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund finds the featherweight response...Orkoneva is grateful to the 2D overcall which simplified his rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Not sure if this is intended as weak or invitatinal, but not what Levin wanted to hear|pg||
pc|s9|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbooks say 6+ for a response|pg||
nt|woozle: Only Granovetter tip worth reading - never pass your partner's 1C at favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room that was quite a 2N bid from Mike Moss opposite passed partner|pg||
nt|kit: probably weak -- if invitational Levin might have bid more even with bad spade holding.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|woozle: That's an error in the textbooks - a far better way to describe it is "6 points is the amount with which you must respond"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks like a close race|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Tor is now really thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: the five diamond card is out|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will continue with queen of spades while club entry in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Piek bid again|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what 3@C means here-- may be artificial|pg||
nt|po-s: if it is difficult to tell if it is weak then maybe it isnÂ´t|pg||
nt|kit: he can't get diamond ruff, so hoping to discard a couple of diamonds and that North will be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|scotty: But then a promotion is almost inevitable - |pg||
nt|kit: I think he should cash ace of hearts first now --can't see how holding it can help|pg||
nt|kit: True, Mike, but what else is there?|pg||
nt|scotty: The better chance is to play a trump after @cAK and hope for honor 10 doubleton |pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps |pg||
nt|scotty: Trying the spade jack onluy succeeds when N started with KQx|pg||
nt|kit: But then he shouldn't have taken ruffing finesse in spades if he is going to do that it seems|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Norway only +6 on Sweden now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: first names around the table   N:Josef  E:Tor  S:Alex  W:Geir|pg||

nt|hawe45: I do not understand, that North bids only 3 @S afer 3 @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his hand improve after 3@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 small ones in East's suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Do you think that North had not described the full majesty of his hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@s by N - only game if S can bid 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - but South first showed 3-card support, then received the message from North: I am weak - ant THEN overbid on the 3-level. Now North must bid 4 @S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude  with Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still i dont see where 9th trick coming from|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you explain to partner/teammates that you freely rebid a suit then lost 4 trump tricks  [if EW negotiate the @D ruff]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some tables are finishing up and leaving the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is playing with a spade|pg||
nt|kit: From Weinstein's 2NT call. Levin thinks Weinstein is 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|warrens:  East might think his partner is 2344 unless some of this is artificial|pg||
nt|kit: yes, many players would rebid 2@C instead of 1NT with Weinstein's shape|pg||
nt|ritong: missing both minor queens they won t be in 7|pg||
nt|kit: problem here is:  has a trump suit been confirmed?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Normal practice in Northern Europe is to lead 2nd and fourth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: South has run out of pass cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: 3S is descriptive anyway - he hadn't promised the fifth spade|pg||
nt|scotty: After 2N, East KNOWS there is an 8-card minor fit,  What he doesn't know is what slam to play|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible that 4@D isn't natural -- may be intended as RKC for clubs, may be some kind of relay|pg||
nt|kit: But if Weinstein is thinking here, they might not be on the same page.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: now just a guess as to how many down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me that 4@D made them guess -- 5@D now says  "they guessed right???"    seems there was at least one flawed thought there|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|scotty: I would think natural - no reason why not|pg||
nt|scotty: Tempting to bid 7?|pg||
nt|warrens:  must be tempted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby opens and closes his hand now has set his cards on the table and his head is in his hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: a big sigh|pg||
nt|scotty: West denied 4 good clubs by not raising over 3@c or 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: still Weinstein didn't have to jump to slam if he has a minimum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: here they all come |pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room Moss attacked @C   and Pepsi shifted to @SK   that helped declarer|pg||
nt|scotty: Levin doesn't need much - @cQ, @hA and either red Q gives play|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll make 7@C if he's in it.  ruff one spade and take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|kit: yes, it seems like he should make it if he plays carefully -- 5 trump tricks, 3 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East is not even close to a game try|pg||
nt|woozle: operator error -bid by S?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Mathias have for breakfast??|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hurd opts to make a game try as opposed to lev who just jumped to 4H|pg||
nt|kit: Notice 1NT-3NT auction in other room -- brutally punished|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Only game possible for E/W is 3 @C D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: E may think that it's N/Ss board|pg||
nt|woozle: 1SXX?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I am getting the answer to my question: how do you get all the way to 3@S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thank you says Eric Greco|pg||
mb|4S|nt|scotty: South hand is pretty good for a preemptive 2@s - so he bids again!|pg||
nt|kit: This one should be a flat 4@S -- hard to see what else can happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On the previous hand eventually North would have to lead from his @s74 into declarer's 86|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@D opening, which wasn't obligatory, sure changed result of this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I was thinking 1C (X) 1S (3D/H) 3S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures udating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  In contrast to standard, Baltic Club needs a little more to raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Seamon starting an ambivalent suit-preference sequence in trumpm|pg||
nt|kit: Succesful save -- they will be disappointed to lose IMPs on it.|pg||
nt|kit: well, North did chime in with 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: and South now knows he is facing a stiff heart|pg||
nt|scotty: Takes a heart lead to beat 6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45: But still East is right - N/S can make 620, there should be only one way to play the @H-suit|pg||
nt|scotty: Seamon is listening to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This first rd is the last of the round robin, the next 2 will be swiss|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Were they ever going to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, some pairs don't bid game with 13 opposite 10 :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|woozle: Orkoneva was right to double 3D - Rohrberg wasn't going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Easy club shift.  And when declarer finds AQ of clubs and king of spades in East hand, he will get the diamonds right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|poohbear: one option is to win and lead a @d threatening crossruff or @c suit establishment|pg||
nt|scotty: Would the bidding have been different if East held @dQ?|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure|pg||
nt|kit: Levin considering overtaking in case jack of clubs is singleton -- but that can't be, as with 10xx declarer would have covered|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the @h position is not crystal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby is shaking his head|pg||
nt|scotty: In fact, mightn't he play EAST for the @dQ since West might have opened a 1N? |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 10 opp 13 opp is the new 13 opp 13|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 20 minutes left in the round|pg||
pc|c4|nt|warrens:  now A of @H and a @H for another @D finesse|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|poohbear: nice play by Cohler to get another trump play|pg||
nt|poohbear: but declarer has 7 trump tricks with a ruff in dummy plus 3 side tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45: East MUST have bid 3 @C - and nNOT 3 @D!?!|pg||
nt|kit: sort of tricky play problem here actually -- drawing trumps could be scary if trumps 3-1|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: sorry  at this vul  automatic 1@D    not sure why i was thinking he was vul    [best guess    i got dain bramage]|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: No, east did bid 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: But I think he has to do it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  opening 1@h or 1@s show 5+ cards (11) 12-17;|pg||
nt|warrens:  unblocks the suit and keeps the @S entry for the last @H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: Levin trying to hid the queen of hearts, so declarer will place him with queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer perhaps considering just crossruffing and settling for down 2.|pg||
nt|scotty: I think I'd misguess @d here - I don't know 6-3 clubs, so I don't know shape.  And West might have opened 1N with @dQxx |pg||
pc|d6|nt|woozle: Maybe East thought that he had a different hand|pg||
nt|hawe45: Alco-test then...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: reason he took diamond finesse first was so he wouldn't lose control if he misguessed diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: Now in more danger - but Weinstein does not know who has @hQ|pg||
nt|kit: But if West now plays a heart, serious problems for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|kit: What choice does Weinstein have?  |pg||
pc|sQ|mc|11|nt|pelu: East sh know the hole ditribution @Hs for sure 4-4 and S has a 6 card @D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|kit: Pushy slam in other room -- might not make on club lead|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows hearts and a higher suit, e.g. majors|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein trying to decide if worth 3@S -- I don't think so hand too junky|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45: 1 NT now might end the bidding|pg||

mb|2S|nt|scotty: It wasn't a serious question about which slam was better - just my quirky way of pointing out that Levin had the worse of the slam luck (as usual, he would say)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: No explanation of 2 spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C seems more likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: father and son Bessis defended correctly against 5@DX to pick up 5 imps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd singleton King of the set ---  always in a minor|pg||

nt|ritong: the fourth best of the longest strongest blah balh would not be asuccess here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: Norway in 6NT??|pg||
nt|woozle: At least 2H shows a good hand and doesn't risk missing heart fits|pg||
nt|hawe45: Facing a non-passed partner, West should bid 4 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: so now Norway +12 IMP (17-13?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made 6NT and are now +12|pg||
nt|woozle: should be quant here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: some misunderstanding about the 2d bid|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT would also have been forcing. Some play that 3@D is passable, and others play Ingberman 2NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Which is a good treatment|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what about 3N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and NS win the war|pg||
nt|kit: Mike, guess it depends if you see the cup as half empty or half full|pg||
pc|sK|nt|poohbear: 3NT is scary with no idea if he has a source of tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  probably alerted differently on the two sides of the table also|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner bids 3@s over dbl then his 3nt shows doubt|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Tor and Geir having a discussion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @D is better than 6 NT!|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D makes if you take the spade finesse, fails if you try to ruff a club|pg||

mb|3H|nt|poohbear: looks like 4@h might go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he showed the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: break is usually 10-15 minutes, but seems this table ending late so might be sooner|pg||
nt|kit: which makes South's double a support double|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bramley-Welland won't have this problem|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||
nt|kit: Seamon appears confident that Cohler doesn't have a doubleton heart.  I wouldn't be so confident about that.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired in grace period|pg||
nt|kit: South has shown extra strength with his second double I think|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: So he has nothing more to say|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein knows from the spots that his partner has the singleton club -- unlucky hand for those who lead low from doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: but that is just happenstance|pg||
nt|kit: Still, not clear how he should defend|pg||
nt|kit: danger with ace and a club is declarer may just discard a singleton heart -- but if he doesn't do this, he may not get his ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: And if he leads a low club, partner may be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|ritong: depending on the third downtrick|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
nt|kit: all things considered, I believe ace and a club is best|pg||
nt|scotty: When is a club better than a heart now?|pg||
nt|scotty: I see when it's worse - when partner has QJx or Q10x and declarer has a stiff heart|pg||
nt|kit: assuming partner doesn't have ace of diamonds, I guess it isn't|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i keep getting into a loop, still not sure if down 2 or 3 here|pg||
nt|scotty: third?  is the second so clear?|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he can get out for down 1 offhand|pg||
nt|ritong: okay 2 imps at stake  depending on the second downtrick:-)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wondering if Helness was supposed to cash @CA|pg||
nt|kit: as long as declarer has a heart and partner the ace, heart looks right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I take the bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 cokes|pg||
nt|hawe45: Declarer will suffer, when the @C-suit in invited into the battle|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith vs NT -- but does that apply looking at dummy's @C?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both respond     i've got 9 cards left|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|scotty: Only a heart void - and that seems impoissible...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired and grace period|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 the Bessis pair did find the 5@DX save against 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness is rocking his chair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Zimmermann team dominated this event last year|pg||
nt|scotty: he probably finessed @d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfb: just announced less than 15 min left in the round|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open, we will be back like in 5-10 min with next rd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see everybody then :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: okay back in about 10 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45: Why discard the @C 8 - and not the 5?|pg||
nt|henryb:  first match is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. We will be showing Blanchard vs Zimmerman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4/5 imps = 19-11 VPs   but hard to imagine this hand being anywhere near a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator said  Bramley opened East hand 2@C "after much deliberation"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp     P-2@C-2@D-P//5@D-P-P-DBL|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: Norway winning by 19 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time for Peter to calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: Buy your own Coke, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, *I* did not misplay it|pg||
nt|pelu: and+18 = 18-12??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open|pg||
nt|scotty: On a side note, Levin, if he thought it possible that declarer had a heart void and no more clubs, should discard the ACE of hearts  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we will be back shortly|pg||
nt|kit: good point Mike -- he knows a third round of clubs defeats the contract|pg||
nt|scotty: But I think that was an impossibility on the auction and dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we are going to be showing blanchard vs O rourke|pg||
pg||
