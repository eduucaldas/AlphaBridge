mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: we will likely see some fancy relay system in action like other table|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hello everyone. Welcome to the 11th round of Icelandic Championship Finals|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: This is the last round & finals from tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S are strong favorites to winning the title in tomorrows 4 team finals|pg||
nt|psyck: ah, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W will need to be quite lucky to crawl into top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Live score:  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|ady: just short of a slam for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: aeven with K@C onside would still need favourable trump split    and diamond split 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: velcome all - your operator is Isak Orn Sigurdsson|pg||
nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Orn|pg||
nt|ady: there is the chance that should n.s reach 6@S  east might lead A@H  which would set up 2 heart tricks for 12   or also  otherwise there is a possibility of east being end played|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We need our operator to shut down and reconnect|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not much luck when I ask him to|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: both pairs play standard their version|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isak?|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Prec. 16+|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please read on your screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
nt|psyck: EW 6th with 159|pg||
nt|psyck: NS joint 2nd with 175|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W play Precision with 14-16 NT. N-S play 2/1 with unbalanced @D and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome back to the final round of the Icelandic team championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs are playing Precision with quite unusual 2nd level|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has seen his partner's 1@H bids before|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h some king of positive response i guess, maybe with bal hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H seemed to be natural vs. a more solid citizen|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: The theme of today has been favourable slam layouts|pg||
mb|4D|an|cue|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome David and Warren|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
mb|4H|an|cue|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: don't need to preempt opps when they tend to do it themselves i guess|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
nt|xenya: well we all have been in worse slams i believe|pg||
nt|psyck: I can understand a try with 5@d, but 6@d looks to be a bit of a gamble.  This is a decent slam though, unfortunate as it needs nothing more than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The problem with the West hand is that it is only worth a GF in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry - was following the board|pg||
nt|ady: hi Roland    Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: And another potential slam hand.|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
nt|ady: not a great slam    but could make with wrong lead   either club or heart|pg||
nt|warrens:  S has to decide if he has enough for another bid here.  his Kx of @H's and only 3 trumps was not enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Here we have a making grand slam, which you would not want to bid though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 7 on a finesse.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: A double of 2@H, showing some 5-7 HCP had maybe worked better|pg||
nt|ady: now should be 12 tricks|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Unless, of course, as here, when you need a 23-7 victory|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the standings link:   http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then perhaps, if you find out that nothing is missing except the king of trumps, you might take the action to bid 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see in the running scores, Grant Thornton has a comfortable leading margin of 15 VP, so 10 VP is enough for them to defend their title|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but even this requires some good breaks (which work).|pg||
nt|santyclz: They are certainly trying for a grand and have bypassed rck so...|pg||
nt|santyclz: But they stop at the sensible contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: then best one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: the|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
nt|psyck: Actually, if 2@h denied @h stopper in addition to showing a balanced positive, 6@d bid looks much better|pg||
nt|friggi: home run|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dima:  Ina strong clubs context?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||
nt|santyclz: @s pitch may have let it through.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, the hearts come in so I don't think so|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: yes; he certainly has to guess with miscellaneous 6 or 7 counts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Now or never if he wants @CK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|icechem:  chance to make an imp|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: a strong 1-suiter (18 or 19 hcp) is notoriously difficult to bid in standard methods after 1x - 1y|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SA653HJ932D986CT3,SQJHAT4DAQJ732CA5,ST8HQ76DKT4CKJ842,SK9742HK85D5CQ976|sv|n|nt|mgb81: ok flat board, onto the next more exciting one|pg||
nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, I think 6@D was quite reasonable|pg||
mb|2S!|an|Ex. 5!S, 2-3 !H, 8-10|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H   an excellent spot     but may fail  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   has only 1 top loser    but not enough tricks   especially on a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   shows diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   natural   |pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@s on a low @h lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz: A truly awful contract.|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - but very unlikely to get there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is the deal here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs the 10,8 doubleton of @ss just for starters.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A painful pass from East|pg||
nt|warrens:  tough call for S now.|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3N not bad|pg||
nt|friggi: and then the rest to be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W's 2 of a major opening is quite unique. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Welcome to Germ Kemper.|pg||
nt|friggi: they must just used it when unvul or what StefánÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And I have noticed that the frequency is really high|pg||
nt|friggi: sry I have US keyboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They use it all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|kemperg: bit late, was on another table |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 3 trump losers or so|pg||
nt|friggi: welcome |pg||
nt|kemperg: much used in Holland those 2 openings|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  can be made  by playing a low club towards the jack  and if west takes the king   get the heart right|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
nt|ady: if west does not play the king  the clubs can be ruffed out as they lay and south then loses only a trump trick     but that is an obscure double dummy play   |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
pc|s8|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  may save|pg||
nt|warrens:  now East faces the problem of having bid 5@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
nt|psyck: about the same as allowing NS to make 1@s|pg||
pc|sT|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
nt|warrens:  safety first|pg||
nt|ady: this will only go down 1   unless a trump lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  trump lead looks right, since your side has all three side suits there should be no hurry|pg||
nt|santyclz: What are they?  5 card suit, not 5332, 8-12?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|friggi: 8-10 - ugly|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5major + 4+ minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8-10, 5-card with 2-3 other major, can be balanced or side suit minor|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6-10|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: well done    might still be down 2  without a trump lead    west can ruff 3 hearts  but would hacve to give up a club and as long as south ducks the first club  north can with the ...|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd club with the jack and play a trump|pg||
nt|ady: as it stands   9 trump tricks and K@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Stefan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They only variation is that in 3d and 4th they are not so strict about 2-3 other major|pg||

pc|dK|nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: For me, the south hand is a 3@H opening|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||

nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
nt|ady: 2 available slams for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: A "two-strike" multi -- side ace, side void.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
nt|psyck: x generally played as asking for @s here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting situation. The X sometimes asks for @S, sometimes for shorter Major|pg||
nt|psyck: they may run to 5m|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looking at the E-W cards only, you would have nothing against playing 4@S|pg||
mb|3C!|an|!H and maximum|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One way to find the queen of trump is never to play the suit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South had a pretty clear escape, no doubt|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
nt|sybarra: drury  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Drury, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@C is easier to play and a better contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
nt|psyck: S doesn't know N's hand, & opps x cannot always be trustede|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C might make with the hearts 4-1 so is a little better|pg||
nt|warrens:  some players play a bid to show a double fit over 3@C (such as 4@D), which would make it much easier to find this slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  nevertheless, if N makes a try, I expect S will get excited |pg||
pc|c2|nt|warrens:  do they play 3@C as natural and GF or just an artificial GF?|pg||
nt|kemperg: down start|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer would really like an entry to his hand, to throw his @C loser|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: gf|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was expecting same |pg||
pc|hK|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|psyck: but here if was a fairly clear choice i guess|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a very tough way to start a match, with slam auctions on every hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|iceak:  not communication to pick up trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H-1 but better than defending 2@S :)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to reach 6@C  if not natural way to show a 2nd suit|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|warrens:  in this cash, artificiality hurt them (imho)|pg||
nt|warrens:  in this case...|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h7|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
mc|9|nt|copeyj: hmm|pg||

nt|athene: if you never touch trumps here you make 11 without too much difficulty, but still 10 should be ok|pg||
nt|copeyj: no more trumpies :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just in case the @hs only provide 4 tricks.  |pg||

nt|athene: the point being that north has to have both majors to bid that|pg||
nt|athene: so you might favour the minor-suit lead |pg||
mb|2C|an|strong|nt|psyck: after a Multi, responder generally immediately bids to the level he is comfortable with|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psyck: also called 'Paradox Responses'|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: it's not completely clearcut because responder might just want to go to game in his partner's major with a strong hand but not that much in spades, i suppose|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: if declarer has to tackle spades from hand he will lead low, i suppose|pg||

nt|icechem:  yes, better play it safe|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
nt|psyck: NS have a 4@s sacrifice, but not findable|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The double asked for shorter/weaker major|pg||
nt|psyck: ok thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When my partners double like that, I lead my doubleton @H and find the ops have missed a 9 card fit there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Where as my natural @S lead from Kxxx would have hit partner with AQJTx|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Prec. 16+|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
nt|ady: I think better to play 3 of any other suit after transfer  game forcing   but natural|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|d|an|5-8|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt makes, but better stay away from 4@S.  most likely E will get the suit in first|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if W plays it but bidding wont permit that |pg||
nt|psyck: lol true, 1NT - 3N can come with wide ranging hands|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a spot for n/s|pg||
nt|warrens:  S passing, hoping to defend a doubled contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
nt|ady: not so easy for south|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: West will want to play the hand because of his KJ of @D|pg||
nt|santyclz: His 7 @ss might be an influence too.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good thing for him that East has a powerful singleton in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: He really can't afford to make a non-forcing, non-game bid with a 3 loser hand.|pg||
nt|kemperg: looks if 2@S was forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, seems like it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
nt|ady: the bidding has not suggested  solid 7 card suit with north     maybe 3@D better 2nd turn|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The leas of the Queen show either King or Jack|pg||
nt|ady: still a hard call for south  to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  now S has to worry about not having a double club stopper as well as having enough running tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
nt|warrens:  West comes alive.|pg||
nt|ady: hand 1     6@S was bid and made OR    A@H led|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
nt|kemperg: np here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite common in Iceland only to lead King vs. NT with a stronger combination, asking for count or unblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Perhaps in this case the queen asked for unblocking|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
pc|d7|nt|warrens:  oh, I hate that 4@D bid.  if North wanted to bid again, why not 3@S, giving partner a chance to bid 3NT?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: well they never are for me|pg||
nt|ady: if North is going to bid diamonds so many times    better to have jumped to 3@D 2nd roiund   or maybe open 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's the only one who knows his @D's are solid|pg||

nt|kemperg: does not know E has a lot more than a minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East has to worthless kings, he has 4 important cards = 14 working HCP|pg||
mb|4N|an|rkcb|nt|sybarra: different drury sequence here |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S by East simply means he does not accept game invitation|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s showing a minimum here i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does not promise 6 of them. West has shown approx. (9)10-11 I think|pg||
mb|5C|an|0/3|nt|cuttysark: 3-card limit raise - looks as if West had a no-cost double, but that might have been takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: 4@S was perhaps a bit much with that moth-eaten suit, but it did put pressure on West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Every bid by East is asking relay, West is describing his shape|pg||

nt|kemperg: @DK good value|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Of course, if East held xx in @D this was a noplay|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
nt|kemperg: what was 2@D,  @H's?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No 2@D was natural|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Asking|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think N-S want to stay out of slam here|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
nt|kemperg: Ah was alerted|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: if east was playing west for a singleton diamond  there was no hurry for the heart   diamond ruff first    |pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  on board 2, West doubled by 6@C and 6@H, which helped declarer find the right line|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get there with a key card & trump Q missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has only promised invitational values, I think, 10+|pg||
nt|psyck: but still possible due to 9 card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
nt|xenya: but 9 trumps -- an eternal problem|pg||
nt|kemperg: but then he knew the @H length with partner|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might take a safety finesse in trumps to get only 11|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well    ruff 1 spade low   and 1 with A@H    and combined wirh club finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  he can make this if he ruffs in his hand, harder this way|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||

nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||

pc|cT|nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||

nt|iceak:  expects to go down - minimizing damages|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I don't think Jón Baldursson ever expects to go down :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|suketbombi: has to hope the !L is with North and restrict trump losser to 1 no other chance |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised he didnt pitch the @D |pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: have to sort of untangle this hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: if pd has lead stiff then its irrelavant - id pd has XX then dec must have AK@D tight|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: If partner has a stiff diamond you give declarer a cheap trick which might be his ninth - much eaiser for us watching|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: I think the defence told him the truth and a @c it should be|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Valid point from a kibitzer - perhaps West more likely to pass 2@DX with AKx|pg||

pc|d8|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||
nt|athene: there is at least 1/2 hcp's worth of advantage in opening 1nt, after all - surely more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: learn to love your aces - hands with none are never great hands :)|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ianmcc: not much of interest here|pg||

pc|s9|nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||

pc|sT|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And North liked his ace of @C after partners trial bid, but forgot to dislike his bad shape and probably @S king or @D queen not working|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||

nt|copeyj: they are having a horrible time of it|pg||
nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h shaky|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|iceak:  much depends on @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably just bids 4 @H  |pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 3NT   if north plays|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  3@h or 1@h?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: multi from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit lite for my style of 2 @C |pg||
nt|ady: might get to 3NT now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if east will compet   4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||
nt|iceak:  south bids 4@h most likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it is like opening 2 nt? |pg||
nt|ady: must be north 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no & no|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South was in a scary balancing position|pg||
nt|friggi: but, against weak NT dbl should be 12+|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psyck: on non @h lead dec has to find @s fin to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: misclick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
nt|kemperg: but N has a bad 12|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary spot,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it can be made |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: takes Q@D lead   and a diamond ruff to beat 4 hearts motre than 1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h6|nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dJ|nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: opps|pg||
nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: north wondering whether to ruff ace in other to return that desperately-needed trump, i suppose|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|friggi: at persent time weak NT is very popular in Iceland|pg||

mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Not this one - they have a festival in Ferbuary which I attended once - highly recommended|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well not this one for sure, which is an Iceland championship; I was invited once to the Festival but forced to decline because of work conflicts|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 at nv|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Now it's more understandable|pg||
nt|mgb81: same as here|pg||
nt|iceak:  wrong as expected|pg||
nt|sybarra: got to get you invited back now Henry :)|pg||
nt|friggi: go bidding by Hrólfur|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 bds 11 imps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Dangerous N-S hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Can easily get to high|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: that has to be a fit bid as a passed hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am behind the times - the Festival is in January now. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East was wise not to double|pg||
nt|psyck: cheaply bought, EW make some 11 tricks in @s probably|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks strange|pg||
nt|ady: 13 tricks for n/s    but  needs 2 3-3 splits|pg||
nt|ady: may settle for game|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl is min 4@H + values|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North was hoping the opponents would bid 4@S, not his partner :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzdh: But this might easily be a double game swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
nt|friggi: but a nice slam try by Oddur|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Impossible, in my opinion, not to give it a shot|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
nt|ady: difficult  even to be confident of a small slam |pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck: E had some defensive cards in @h, but the rest of his hand was massively offensive|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec told me:  16 cm of snow fell last night - hasn't snowed this much in may for 24 years in Iceland|pg||
nt|warrens:  6@H looks like the right contract.  has many chances (either suit 3-3 or a spade ruff in dummy overruffed by the hand with 4 @H's or clubs setting up)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: -100 probably good going|pg||
nt|iceak:  plays @h to K - for a trump|pg||
nt|friggi: not imp 50%|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not a bad slam except the 1 minor flaw...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|psyck: sure did not expect the biddingto die down before 4@s|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E had a clear raise to 4 -- as a double shot at least|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|santyclz: It violates Burn's Rule of 8.|pg||
nt|friggi: nice bidding by N-S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer might get fatally shortened when West gets his @D trick|pg||
nt|kemperg: trump start was better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If declarer goes for @D he might make it|pg||
nt|friggi: we do not like rules in Iceland:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Rule of 8:  Subtract the number of aces the opps hold from 8.  Don't bid to that level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That's an excellent rule :)  I will try to memorize that|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might try a ruffing finesse in @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: well yes, only a 10 count, but 3 very likely tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: yes, he has too much work to do with too many cards unfav|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceak:  propably vins |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West's 3@S bid was not effective|pg||
nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: nice rule|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|h7|nt|xenya: should persevere with diamonds for 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@S or 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But with a passed partner 3@S is a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then when 4@H comes to him undoubled, perhaps he should consider 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mgb81: I suppose it's a bit fancifl to think that north will play ace of trumps and sprun the diamond finesse to get out for down two anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: did E pass 4@h smoothly?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Burn's Laws.  3 of them:  http://www.blakjak.demon.co.uk/burn_law.htm|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dima:  well done|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kemperg: only has to ruff 3@C's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mgb81: NIBU is the Northern Ireland Bridge Union, in effect the Northern Ireland second team|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody tries to draw trump here - can't have any embankments to walk|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mgb81: added to make up the round robin to an even number|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be 3 down and 4 imps to England|pg||
nt|athene: are england allowed to give some of their imps to wales for this match?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: does he have the count?  I think so |pg||

mc|11|nt|Walddk1: England leading now. Scotland only 11 ahead against Wales; that is 16-14 VP|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Opportunity for Gards Apotek now. They stopped in game at the other table|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|icechem:  north pretty pessimistic|pg||

nt|athene: maybe the moral of the story is, don't go raising partner with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not matter much what happens at this table from now on. It is being decided in the Scotland-Wales match|pg||
nt|steshome:  Aye <waves a daffodil>|pg||
nt|mgb81: Yes <waves a leek>|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Poetry in motion|pg||
nt|hawe45: A @H-contract now, possibly|pg||
nt|dima:  Pretty strong set for NS so far - that 4@h on N8 was a bit of a stretch but could have also made|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s or 5@d seems|pg||
nt|psyck: I would probably have hesitated a bit on 4@h, & having hesitated, bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East did not hesitate much, anyway we are playing on screens|pg||
nt|psyck: aah, ok thx|pg||
nt|friggi: sure it was|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Prec. 16+|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
nt|friggi: Hrólfur is a very good player|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||
nt|psyck: then yes, W cold consider 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: *could|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm still placing the blame on E|pg||
nt|psyck: me too :)|pg||
mb|1S|an|GF, 5+!S|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt n-s will get into the auction.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: club ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is that bid again |pg||
nt|henryb:  another hand (see board 1) where 3N is best despite the void|pg||
nt|sybarra: 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yet another slam possibly|pg||
mb|1N!|an|Asking|nt|sybarra: multi,  then 3 @c weak with hts, etc to 4|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H by E might have caused more problems than 2D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
nt|psyck: but it also depends on their preemptive style|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess 2 @H says nothing about hts? |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Not sure, but I think 1NT asks for controls (A = 2, K = 1)  2@D showing 3|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: cards fit well for EW here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sequences over the mult-strong-meaning 2@C must be quite complex|pg||
nt|ady: south using evasive action   intending to pass any reply to stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: sorry strong with hts|pg||
nt|psyck: compare this with the deal 9 2@c opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, this one is quite more normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: pther table did not bother to investigate grand on deal 9 either|pg||
nt|friggi: they should reach 6@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psyck: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1  on top   I think n/s will be happy to conceed 50|pg||
nt|ady: have we got stuck?|pg||
mb|p|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak (our operator) is doing a great job of showing the alerts |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is :) It's a fiddly process, but maybe he knows ahen they are coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if they have worked out who is on lead yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he would agree, you get used to it as operator|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
nt|kemperg: in the wrong hand then:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@D possibly showed @D control, which slows South down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdh: This is why I like to lead a low trump from quack doubleton :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes - must be|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
nt|warrens:  a reasonabl play by North, hoping to pitch 2 @H's from dummy on his clubs if this held|pg||
nt|ady: now worried about losing 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: lot of thinking about defense|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n missed his chance bo not leading single @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 @D was sort of smolen-ish|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|jbennet: that would have helped at all|pg||

pc|hT|nt|kemperg: I would play the Q|pg||

nt|friggi: I would play @D7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Neither defender can touch @Cs|pg||

nt|friggi: @S slam is better then NT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mgb81: Oh apparently the Scots have just let through the game....|pg||
nt|mgb81: This means Wales have pulled to within 1imp|pg||
nt|athene: i have quiet confidence in wales to do what needs to be done|pg||

nt|Walddk1: 54-0 to Wales over the last 8 boards, two of which were flat|pg||
nt|mgb81: Mean while in 4H North had no way to avoid losing 3 trumps to go with the king of spades and another completely wasted ten imps to England|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think the right (and on this hand successful) line is two rounds of trumps, cash the @dA, and three rounds of spades|pg||

nt|psyck: so only 2@h, 1@d to lose|pg||
nt|xenya: tough to get there though?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Off for east not to respond - at green I'd have though 1H had some appeal|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is cold N-S but hard to reach|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand not improved by 2@d overcall either|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is close to a maximum Precision @S opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: We can't say how they break a tie because there doesn't seem to be anything in the regulations|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Which is very strange|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s doubled will be interesting|pg||
nt|jbennet: another case for lebensohl 1NT response.|pg||
nt|psyck: should not have problems settling in 5@d w/o @h control here|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding  |pg||
nt|henryb:  very normal on BBO|pg||
nt|friggi: but diff to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Say, impossible|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|xenya: this is 8th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8 tricks are makeable, with the @C jack 3d and @H ace onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: here we go |pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: has Alice Kaye found the winnign bid to tip partner off to a heart lead?....|pg||
nt|Walddk1: a spec found something now, one moment|pg||
nt|friggi: nothing is impossible Stefán, just more diff then other things|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @c10 spoils the e hand -- otherwise about as bad as can be gotten.|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4333 no card above a 7...|pg||

nt|Walddk1: of VP.s the Trophy shall be held jointly by such countries.|pg||
nt|mgb81: I can't really moan - the queen diamonds seems so automatic|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: looks around 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: A double may have backfired.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: hard to imagine anyone reaching 5@D on an unconteated auction either. 3NT possible - but that does not make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn thinking heavily|pg||
nt|friggi: nice lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|steshome:  Where are we now in terms of VPs, Roland?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yues I think it's cold|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But remembers some of his partner's opening bids|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is actually pretty good: needs either 2-2 @d and @c not worse than 4-2 or 3-3 clubs and @d not worse than 3-1|pg||
nt|friggi: now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: clubs 3/3 will make this on easy for declarer |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: (an @D 2/2)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: A good hand to play slowly.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mgb81: There are 2 boards left to score in the Wales match and Scotland lead by 2 imps I believe|pg||
nt|sybarra: it always works that way when you are NOT in game |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps N might have doubled 1N -- then if S found 3@d over 2@s North could envision the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South commented when he saw dummy - passed 1NT?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: Yes, I think double would show the extra strength, but not convinced he would reach 5@D even if partner volunteered a bid|pg||

nt|santyclz: Gave the declarer a chance to go wrong.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Way too fast for me|pg||
nt|iceak:  end in 4@h - but risky|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that's a claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  now when both follow to the first @d S can claim|pg||
nt|kemperg: Why not @HQ instead ot @S ruff:(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Tapped himself out.  Might have saved a tap by winning the 1st @h in hand.|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
mb|1S|an|9-15|nt|henryb:  4@s is easy with the good fit and good splits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W probably end in 3nt or 5@C here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Allthough West would like to play against 2@H doubled|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: they might overbid here|pg||
nt|ady: n/s hav e a play for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: vul!|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think we can all agree with that discription of 2nt...|pg||
nt|psyck: W has a practical 3N bid, but E may want to show his @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@H from West here might promise a good @S raise, so 3NT is a likely bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: I think that doesnt take into acocunt the 1vo slow play fine does it sarah?|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s sry|pg||
nt|jbennet: tricky hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: 1vp*|pg||
nt|ady: this might lead to 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: in which case they could get overboard as Vladamir suggests|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbennet: good methos need to find the superious 3NT.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of a 10 count |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A bit of an upgrade by East for his 6-4 distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the single @D |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: propably counting loosing tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbennet: methods are:..|pg||
nt|iceak:  how strong is E?|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT= "i have a weak doubleton"|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: 19   but 2NT might have worked out better |pg||
pc|c8|nt|peachy: Looks like NS play weak NT first seat? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes. Hard to stay away from hopeless 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S might make. Possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good bidding might lead to 4 ! h - also down|pg||
nt|dima:  11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: club system e/w |pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs asks: "where"|pg||
nt|psyck: no @d cue meaning they should not crosss 5@c level|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: but with the @c break...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that North did not double 4@H might help South on the lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should not have raised with a purely defensive hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jbennet: "3NT i have weak doubleton in clubs"|pg||
nt|dima:  One might need mirrors to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: so play 4@hx as do not lead @h|pg||
nt|psyck: *some...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
nt|dima:  ok one problem solved|pg||
nt|iceak:  first problem solved|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
nt|jbennet: OK then ; then 4 major is no longer an option. EK stiff oppsite xx creates too many loseres in 4 major.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead is helpful |pg||
nt|henryb:  well worth 10-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North hoping that South has the singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
nt|psyck: quite normal to see a lot of overbidding in the final stages i guess, they even got to 6@hx OR in the 5@hx-2 deal |pg||
pc|hA|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
nt|ady: dont exit wirh small spade|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely suit for a vul overcall.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to do othervise|pg||
nt|jbennet: so if playong a good system, EW reaches 3 NT which is as everybody can see.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk1: Unofficially, we have a tie now. Scotland winning by 11 IMPs, just enough for 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Exciting|pg||
pc|d3|nt|santyclz: I'd be tempted to double finesse the @ss on the auction.|pg||
nt|psyck: As Stefan suggested, S got the lead right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: even then could not make|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45: Might be right, but WHY did´nt North bid 4 @H himself, South brought no new info|pg||
nt|psyck: easier in 6 than 5 though|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This will not be pretty|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: In 6 the ace of @D lead stands out|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Holding a likely trump trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: I wonder if you would |pg||
nt|sybarra: the lead was an obvious singleton |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbennet: far better than 4 spades.|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Maybe 3-8 was I dont like hearts?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess if declarer had the @HA but very weak clubs it might be possible to just lock him in his hand and east could take several club tricks|pg||
nt|icechem:  west thought the dia count was important at trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: east is now maybe worried that if he lays down the @HA and declarer has the @HKx, he can unblock to reach dummy?|pg||

nt|sybarra: transfer to 1 nt as I recall |pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  no, shirley, just denies a 4 card major|pg||

nt|santyclz: 13 bds, 14 imps!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  Opener will rebid 1N with a sub-1NT balanced hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|mgb81: I have to say this is the most exciting Lady Milne I've ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a possible overcall for north, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns) for ensuring that this fine event was brought to BBO. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: all over the world|pg||

nt|psyck: Malning will be inching towards the 4th spot maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H should make    3NT easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he did have 15  (but flattish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had kept quiet would have gone plus defending 1N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
nt|kemperg: still wins 3 imps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With both opponents bidding it is quite dangerous, but then you have to remember what they bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Grant is reigning team champions in Iceland |pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed, but sometimes silence is golden|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was Malning who went 4 off...|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||

nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: GT can afford to lose by 23 IMPs and still win the championship, regardless of how Sparisjodur fares. 2 boards to go after this|pg||
nt|friggi: luck|pg||
nt|kemperg: still 1 off|pg||

nt|henryb:  It worked|pg||
nt|henryb:  as you know|pg||
nt|ady: is this session 16 hands?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: did we skip 14?|pg||
mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, missing 14|pg||
nt|jbennet: well after 1 NT opening; 1 should should be able to find 44 fit in majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok |pg||
nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still be able to choose 3NT.|pg||
nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4M both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  that is a brave double by Bjarni|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10 tricks in OR, much|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
nt|psyck: only 3 levels lower than other room|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That was peaceful|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate deal of the event.  Thanks to the Icelandic Bridge Federation, particularly Olof for allowing us to visit here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Stefan Jonsson, great job!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: routine 4@S    on a lucky day could make 6    |pg||
nt|warrens:  this can make 6 with everything working|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my co-commentators, Fridrik Vigfusson and Germ Kemper.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
nt|psyck: Rabbi's will make the rest|pg||
nt|psyck: by dropping the kingleton|pg||
nt|friggi: ditto Joe:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: How do you find the time to give all that comments Stefan, I am impressed|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO for providing this platform and Roland Wald who works tirelessly to manage these vg sessions. |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|warrens:  on  board 10 at the other table, they bid 7@S! in their 5-2 fit!|pg||
nt|ady: thats unbelievable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk1: I have Scotland and England tied on 88 VPs before the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 9|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, Stefan was doing that in earlier sessions too, he is great :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|peachy: The ace just could not be right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzdh: N-S actually made 4@H in the open room !|pg||
nt|friggi: Stefán has many "hands"|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk1: Can you confirm, Simon?|pg||
nt|iceak:  if from 78Q - loosing 1@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: thank you all and also the specs |pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pg||

nt|athene: he didn't want north to be able to throw a club from @CKx, for example, on a heart|pg||

nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to Icelandic Bridge Federation and to those that helped bring this tourney to BBO.  We have enjoyed being with you.   |pg||

nt|sybarra: and again Stefan,  a great big thanks to you!!! |pg||
nt|dima:  NS will quickly be in 4@h i think as you have to playing vs. strong club|pg||
nt|iceak:  double 5-7 I think|pg||
nt|dima:  1@d is likely to be transfer overcall, X is usually 5-7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Magnús could have made it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Highly unlikely though, when East has 5 controls vs. his partners opening bid|pg||
mb|1N!|an|!H and !C|nt|sybarra: we also love our specs,  who give us helpful comments and thoughts  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course specs, we always love your input and comments to us. |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 40 min or so  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed we do - thank you everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe (not sure) that 2@s shows clubs and weak hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  but, as i sad before, 6@H was a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|ady: yes    they had been making a bit of a recovery|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45: 3 @H now - and off we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just over 1/2 hour  (15 til the hour is schedule) |pg||
nt|dima:  Aha - then 1@d is Majors or minors so EW will have some space to sort things out|pg||
nt|psyck: needed @dA to be @sA for that maybe|pg||
nt|xenya: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: OH - 5 even better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar has more ambitions than that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sorry, Karl|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I thought Magnús made all the contracts that could be made... and some more|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar, on the other hand, must have some ambitions now.|pg||
nt|psyck: E knows their values are limited, but great shape & fit will likely make him try |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C to play?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@s denies Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might get vaguely interested facing drury i suppose|pg||
nt|mgb81: 2C here is drury showing 9+ and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: some danger with this - if it persuades West that @cK is a good card for slam purposes...|pg||
nt|mgb81: 3C is some sort of long suit try|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand if 3@C is a long suit try, west must feel that at least some of those spade cards are wasted|pg||
nt|mgb81: wets might bid 3S now...4D from east 4H from west will east then pass it?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but facing @sxx  @hAKQxxx  @dA  @cAxxx, slam is well worth bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to all the specs who provide us with comments and humor through out |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx Shirley & Joe|pg||

nt|dima:  1@d + 3@s + 1@h survives|pg||
nt|dima:  since partner will help in @h|pg||
nt|iceak:  Has to know S has 5@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  seems like less than best methods where N with @sKJ96 cant opt to let partner play 2@sX|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to bid @D, when you belong in 3 @C...? |pg||
nt|henryb:  I find this auction is upsetting my equilibrium|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|mgb81: ok as usual I was nowhere nbear the real auction. The customary bash of game from west and east passes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Rather flat board perhaps, 500 N-S|pg||

nt|hawe45: Might "only" bring 500, depending a lot on the @C-guess|pg||

nt|henryb:  why think first?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a thinking player :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn always thinks - |pg||
nt|sybarra: and E was Liz's pard in tourney (was it Malta?) |pg||
nt|henryb:  but this is a position where you duck automatically, and think later|pg||

nt|friggi: 6@S plus +1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45: Good defence, kils dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, W knows there cannot be 2 quick losers after 4@c cue so hopes to lose only the 1 missing key card|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   re-doubled  several down     now n/s get the plus score|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: North is known to be balanced, so must have at least 2 clubs. |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|dima:  They should get it right|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South actually revoked on this trick, throwing a small @S while North is still in agony.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer noticed in a split second and turned his card around|pg||
nt|dima:  why revoked, he has no clubs ...?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Don't know if North saw it |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South played to the precent trick, out of turn|pg||
