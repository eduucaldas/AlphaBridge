nt|athene: you might then rise with the @SK on the trump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|snorris: a possibility yes|pg||

nt|granguru: if @H is opened soon enough|pg||
nt|granguru: from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 nt not a great success|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snorris: no..|pg||
nt|jpes: nothing shy about Wesst|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the fact that west only invited and east accepted suggests very strongly that 1nt was less than 20-21|pg||
nt|snorris: right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: well either that or it suggests that east is a very "happy" player and west is cautious to try to compensate :)|pg||

nt|psyck: being able to show 19-20 instead of 20-21 in a standard method sure helped last deal|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahalim: would you have bid 1NT w the E hand ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure there are relays here,  I just dont know them |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, relaying. Seems to end in 3NT with 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: a rather more simple auction at the other table |pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45: Depends on, what the re-bid of 2 NT shows|pg||
nt|sybarra: (for specs, put cursor over open room results under West and see auction)|pg||

nt|friggi: @S was pretty obvious lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: my aunt minnie would not lead a @H given E saying he has that suit,   |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Considering that 3NT made in the open room, East was doomed on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d would restrict them to 8 tricks though as likely to fin @s|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: I would have opened 1@D too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But the fact that the 1@C opening can include a 5 card major does it that they are more strict on the point count|pg||

nt|snorris: -1 or 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|snorris: -1|pg||

nt|athene: 6nt says "no, i don't know what is going on either partner, put dummy down and we discuss it later"|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: More like a choice between 3 and 4 @H|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c-(x) would not be neg there, playing typical the twisted swine style sequences anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: E opened this a 10-12 nt in the other room and n took the short route to 4@s.|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H actually make on this one, but quite impossible to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Norths underbid worked well|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andreasw:  dbl of 61hh by N might ask for @c lead:)|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jpes: he may promise 4 @H on a X|pg||
nt|athene: west obviously bid 4@D "hoping to push his opps into 4@S"|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with this is your partner doesn't realise your cunning plan and of course has short spades|pg||
nt|snorris: right..|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: now declarer can't take the ruffing spade finesse AND the club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: so three down|pg||
nt|athene: i think 500 in a phantom can't (or shouldn't) be dismissed as just "bad luck"|pg||
nt|athene: if west is allowed to bid 4@D on that sort of hand then east can't go around bidding 5 on HIS hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: dislke X , improves West|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And here we have a slam that is very hard to beat, needing a trump lead|pg||

pc|hK|nt|santyclz: A much better contract than that reached in the open room, where they demonstrated that this *is* a down-side to transfer advances.|pg||
