nt|copeyj: good start to the overtime for team Penfold yes|pg||
nt|dburn: but the weak no trump proved an effective pre-empt|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I think if E had to open 1@D West would have boosted in @D making it equally hard for N.S next door I suppose|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Sinclair 14-6 in that stanza. Penfold claimed 8 extra boards now being played.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: NS bound to have agreed some cunning raise structure|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S must be something clever showing @D support I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: might be a strong jump shift in spades or a limit raise in diamonds - zia might have played something like that with rosenberg if i remember correctly|pg||
nt|dburn: they're bound to have agreed at least two and possibly three, if my experience of playing on Zia's team is anything to go by|pg||

nt|athene: Zia maybe a bit scared east has diamonds for the 1@D bid|pg||

nt|athene: but it has to be clubs really|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1 down no bad for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  indeed - EW could make a partscore |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|bridge_one: slam for N/S down with @D lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting - could be a 5 or 7 deal|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or even 4|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: I dont like 4@s much|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  all on the lead now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with void in @H 4@S is a underbid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: surely Club bid would be better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 6@S the lead @D very difficult to find for defence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true but might have tipped off East what to lead|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  how good would West's diamonds have to be for bidding 5@d to be right?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall 2@S is very minimum - North could hold Q @D, so 6@s a great contract|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Sinclair 14-6 in that stanza. Penfold claimed 8 extra boards now being played.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This one is too it appears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and here is another big board|pg||
nt|copeyj: needs @D lead to break 5 or 6@S from N/S here|pg||
nt|copeyj: meanwhile E/W can make 10 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think|pg||
nt|copeyj: so plenty of scope for action|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|benjy: hold on to your seats everyone, this could be a bumpy ride|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Just the board you want to finish with in a match like this|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2N|nt|copeyj: I agree with Auken's failure to open 2@S with such a poor suit in 2nd position|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2NT probably limit raise +|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjy: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I have to confess I quite like 4@H in 3rd from Trendafilov|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No stopping Zia now|pg||
nt|dburn: by my calculations, these last crucial eight boards have taken a fraction less than half an hour|pg||
mb|4N|nt|copeyj: likely to play a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Zia wheeling out the trusty weapon - it seems|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|Walddk4: Can Karaivanov find the lead against 6 I wonder|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Trendafilov rather|pg||
nt|copeyj: we will find out shortly Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: difficult to place Zia with a void @H|pg||
nt|dburn: if not, then the swing will be 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|dburn: this may not be over yet|pg||
pc|d8|nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wow|pg||
nt|benjy: well done!|pg||
nt|copeyj: Brilliant|pg||
nt|copeyj: and worthy of winning the event|pg||
pc|dA|nt|benjy: what a cracker of a lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W in 5@D on b38 next door - so the Sinclair team will gain a game swing on that|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they will lose a big swing here now|pg||

nt|Walddk4: While this is playing out I will take the opportunity to thank the EBU for allowing us to participate in this thrilling event. Max Bavin and Michael Clark have been instrumental in ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: setting up a magnificent show|pg||
mc|10|nt|copeyj: this will be 13 imps for Penfold|pg||
nt|benjy: some specs think that a @D lead is normal, and i suppose if pd has a limit raise then he must have an honour in @D, you still have to lead one though|pg||
nt|copeyj: We have some very fine specs too Benjy :)|pg||
nt|benjy: of course, helping us along the way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to Roger Bryant, our excellent operator, and to all our expert commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well done everyone!|pg||
