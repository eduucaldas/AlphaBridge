mb|p|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i am getting suggestions from spectators, none of which seem to fit, anyway the result is an ugly contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: purists would find much wrong with this 2@H bid, but it often works well|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room that was quite a 2N bid from Mike Moss opposite passed partner|pg||

nt|hawe45: For those who like good bidding - some more boards are coming up...|pg||

nt|woozle: 2D and a club ruff means that you need to block a suit to reenter hand..could make extra issues with trumps 4-2|pg||
nt|hawe45: She had an automatical show-up squeeze agains North - but it has been a long tournament |pg||
nt|pelu: Im am glad that I am close to easter-luch with OP Andersson :)|pg||
nt|woozle: EW need to lead a diamond early to threaten 4H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: last bd of this first session, we will be back at 4pm vegas time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thats 90 min from now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzcv: Finland made 4@h on board 26|pg||
nt|hawe45: 620 N/S - unbeatble - 12 IMP maybe for DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can she know that the squeeze will work? And if it does, why is 6@D better than 6NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|poohbear: looks like 4@h might go down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 2@C on last board was a big position, especially with 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last bd of the 2nd round|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: no ruling yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||
nt|scotty: What card should East plasy at trick one?  @s3 or @s6?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 red finesses lose and 2 black aces|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I take the bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 cokes|pg||
nt|hawe45: Declarer will suffer, when the @C-suit in invited into the battle|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open, we will be back like in 5-10 min with next rd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see everybody then :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|hawe45: Why discard the @C 8 - and not the 5?|pg||
nt|henryb:  first match is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. We will be showing Blanchard vs Zimmerman|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway winning by 19 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time for Peter to calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: Buy your own Coke, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, *I* did not misplay it|pg||
nt|pelu: and+18 = 18-12??|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Our operator did|pg||
pc|cJ|mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfb: we will be back with second session in 75 min|pg||
