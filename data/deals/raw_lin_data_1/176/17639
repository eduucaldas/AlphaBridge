nt|janm: We get to start off with a board some would open 2@h and others would restrain because of the 4 spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: incidentally Barbara Travis's brother Peter Gill is playing for Sartaj Hans's team|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|rv: I expect North to bid 5@s over 5@c by West|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|janm: Hard for N not to bid 5@s, no matter how much the 5 level is supposed to belong to the opponents|pg||
nt|rv: 5@s is a good save over 5@c|pg||
mb|6C|nt|janm: But on A of heart and a heart, I think 5@c goes down|pg||
nt|rv: yes, even 5@c is down due to trump promotion|pg||
nt|janm: Or rather, with East declarere, heart to the J and then either a low heart or A of hearts to promote the club K. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Livesey should take the cash now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|janm: Nobody really knows which side is bidding to make here (except we know that neither side was!), but the players can't really tell|pg||
nt|rv: pass was not forcing here, I would have doubled with Livesey's hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|janm: I'm not so sure, give N the K of hearts instead of the A and they wouldn't be beating 6, would they (if declarer guessed the stiff club K that is)|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 4H-5C-5S-6C would be a good start to auction :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5C surely from Eaat|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S as well makes it less attractive|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: the red save look waaaaaaaaay too expensive |pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3C is feeble|pg||
nt|hoffers: Interesting that both Norths opened 2@h with a side 4@s|pg||
nt|marcsmith: makes things far too easy for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have seen peake open 1@H with hands like this|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: and both overcalled 3C|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: I would gues that the auction is missing a pass at the start|pg||
nt|sybarra: a pass missing here? |pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Tony Nunn is in another team, Bloom, who just missed out on the Final (finished 3rd)|pg||
nt|janm: Don't know if the DBL encouraged Reynolds to bid 4@s or he was always going to. |pg||
nt|rv: In my view Reynolds has enough for 4@s, 8 tricks in his own hand and partner has raised constructively|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: With such a lot of distribution it's hard to make an intelligent invite - and I miscounted tricks - he'll certainly make 4|pg||

nt|janm: 1 round of trump and then claim, getting us even farther ahead of the other room?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|rv: 5@h double for E-W has 3 top losers, but a @c ruff makes it 2 down and not worth at these colors|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: sry 5@H double for N-S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwi_joker: If reynolds eliminates hearts and clubs, Livesey will have to go in with the K@D on the first round of diamonds, or an overtrick will roll in|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Steve|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: not material now, of course :)|pg||
nt|janm: But dummy won't have any trumps left, so even if S wins the second diamond, he'll be able to get out with a club|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, and far far to many clubs in W to complete an elimination, anyway|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: too many|pg||
nt|janm: The only way to leave dummy with a trump would be to leave S with a trump, so he'd be able to get out with that I think|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: Peter Gill prefers not to play against his sister Barbara, he has managed to play in other table in last couple of sets, not sure who has seating rights for the last segment|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d2|nt|janm: I guess declarer might run all the spades to see if someone feels enough pressure to pitch a diamond, but looking at the dummy, that seems unlikely to work (famous last words?)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: in their match in the league phase, Barbara had +78 Butler set against Peter-Livesey, in other room Sartaj-Helena had +45 against Reynolds-Appleton|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|marcsmith: more of a mixed raise than a pre-emptive raise on that south hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: south gave north no real chance with his 3H|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4@H was not the best spot for Auguri in the CR...|pg||
nt|cicus: closed room chose the wrong  denomination|pg||

nt|rv: event which is highest prize money tourney in India|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|janm: Not sure why Reynolds bid 4@h - if 3@d showed a limit raise, that's what he has, and surely partner's 3@h says that he wants to play there opposite a limit raise - maybe the 5th ...|pg||
nt|janm: trump made him want to bid more, perhaps 3@d was less than a limit raise and he decided he really had a limit raise|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p!|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rv: routine 4@h here, easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h will make comfortably on this hand, as will 3NT, but I think 4@h makes 5 and 3NT only 4|pg||
nt|rv: Jan, Reynolds felt he was worth 3.5 @hs|pg||
nt|rv: Reynolds thinking of raising this to 3n with 4333 shape and all values outside|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p!|nt|rv: tempting to bid 3n with East hand, I might have bid 2@s with West hand instead of 2n|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: The 2Nt rebid might wrongside 3Nt, if, say, E started with solid Diamonds, and @CKxx.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I don't like 2n by West with 3 cards in partner's suit and stiff|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: right contract possibly by wrong route:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|janm: I like Reynolds bid - if his partner had stuff in clubs, they'd play 3NT, if not, they'd play 4@h and probably that's what you want to do with his hand|pg||
nt|panja: y....this is the hand where E should begin with 1Nt if the system allows....|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|janm: Putting game forces into 1NT overburdens it, I think|pg||

pc|s6|nt|marcsmith: nothing to the play|pg||

nt|marcsmith: can draw trumps and lead towards CK for a discard|pg||

nt|marcsmith: on a technical point, most people play 1H-2N and 1S-2N as jacoby, but it is more efficient to use 1H-2S as it gives you the extra step you need to show everything|pg||
nt|peachy: Better name, it really is confusing to use a name that is reserved for someo ther conventions|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: rdbl might simply be SOS..as 1@D was artificial...|pg||

nt|marcsmith: deserves partner's black suits to be reversed|pg||
nt|hoffers: Interesting what 5@h showed?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: south could easily have xxx spade and AK club -- clearly North should cue 3H hear 3S cue before using RKCB|pg||

nt|hoffers: Often in the ANOT final, the last set is played quickly, so players can get to the airport. Unlikely this time with so close a match|pg||

mb|2S|nt|janm: 6@d from East needs either no heart lead or the King of @ds onside - although even without a @h lead, you might need the diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|alok_daga: guess with 2 key cards missing will not be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Again, we don't really know what the auction means, only that it has gotten both diamonds and NT played from the wrong side|pg||
nt|rv: East is possibly showing 5@s+4+@c 11-14 if E-W playing Italian style 2@c relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: if they are playing that method 2@c is relay, 2@d shows min w/o 4@h, 2@h is further relay and 2@s shows 5+@s+4+@c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: I don't like to use 2@c relay with such a good suit like what East has here esp w/o fit for partner's major, I much prefer 2@d with his hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: "we" think so, seeing all hands|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: In the CR on  6, South actually opened the 10-count with 1@D! So the slam very likely now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p!|nt|kiwi_joker: ..which will give us a new leader|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|janm: OK, I now agree that Gill's 1@d opening doesn't have anything to do with diamonds - what is it? Hearts? - that would make more sense of board 5|pg||
nt|rv: did Peter Gill open 1@d here?|pg||
nt|rv: I presume it must be 1@h and in any case agree with Jan way too lite even by modern standards|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: Must be transfer opening bids. Also presumably why Livesey didn't open the South hand 1@d on board 6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|janm: So this auction is comparable to 1@h - 1@s - 2@c - 3NT, with the 1@h bid allowed to be VERY light (so light that maybe Livesey was stretching to bid 3NT)|pg||
nt|rv: Barbara opened 1@d on brd 6 with 10 hcp and they have bid 6@D, new leader in the match now|pg||
nt|janm: Wonder if he can make 3NT here? My first guess is no, with the clubs so bad, but I've been wrong before (often)|pg||
nt|rv: by ZAR point evaluation, North hand is worth 7 (hcp)+11 (length of 2 longest suits)+5 (diff in length between longest and shortest suit)+3 (no of controls)=26 ZARs, anything more ...|pg||

nt|janm: And indeed, the Hans pair bid 3NT on board 7 and made comfortably (looking at their auction, I think that West treated his hand as something like 17-19)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the heart play at trick 4 bemuses me here|pg||

nt|chilloncan: W worried about being endplayed|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he should decide that N unlikely to play clubs so early and committally with the ten in his hand|pg||
nt|hoffers: Even if 55 blacks, safe to duck|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: 1@D..even|pg||
nt|janm: Guess the play got confused, but as expected he couldn't find 9 tricks, or even 8|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rv: maybe home-grown|pg||
nt|janm: And 1@h apparently shows spades - maybe Moscito?|pg||
nt|panja: confirmation, 1@H to show Spades|pg||
nt|rv: transfer openings as basis|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|janm: That would be strong club, 1@d with 4+ hearts, 1@h with 4+ spades, and after that I don't really know|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|panja: and 1@S...says bingo, we have found some kind of fit...|pg||
nt|janm: No, must be something different, perhaps a relay type thing to find out what S had - surely 2@h was forcing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: maybe 1@s is F1 here?|pg||
nt|janm: Maybe 1@s is like a forcing NT?|pg||
nt|rv: yes, looks like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: 1@s is likely to be F1 with possible relay connotation, 2@h could be further relay|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rv: folks, all of us are guessing here to the best of our knowledge, none of us know their system well|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: If that's what it was, 2@d presumably showed a 5332 non-minimum (in the context of the openings we've seen, this is certainly a non-minimum, and 2@h was natural and game forcing? ...|pg||
nt|janm: After that I'm lost|pg||
nt|panja: North's bids seem to be relay bids..|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 3@d showed semi-bal hand min|pg||
nt|panja: so by definition...forcing..|pg||
mb|6N!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: North's bids after 1@s haven't been alerted though - if they were relays they'd be alerts.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: that is up to the operator..transcription error...possibly|pg||
nt|janm: Well, the A of clubs is onside, so they bid this beautifully :)|pg||
nt|rv: North would have played in @s strain as well because of transfer opening, surprised why he bid 6n?|pg||
nt|panja: now..this is not a single option play..|pg||
nt|panja: North might try to strip squeeze...if one of the defenders holds @CA and @DK..he could be strip-squeezed....|pg||
nt|janm: If 3@d showed values in diamonds, North might have thought that there wouldn't be any benefit to playing in spades, since he has solid hearts and wouldn't want to ruff a diamond?|pg||
nt|rv: North is better player and @CK is in hand as well, 6@S could offer more chances than 6n, a bit surprised why he choose that strain|pg||

nt|hoffers: Another 4@s save available, but I will be surprised if NS do save|pg||
nt|peachy: It really wasnt an easy hand without seeing all four|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a good result for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: mircale 500 in the save|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|cicus: this board may be another pickup for them|pg||
nt|jkotor: and thats all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3N is tha spot|pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to put the DK on lead and then guess the clubs to make 6N|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6S almost bound to fail as West has an obvious diamond lead|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hoffers: One disadvantage of transfer openings is that it gives South 2 ways of entering, X and 1@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: we are still waiting for a deal where the EW transfer opening bids show themselves to good advantage|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: I play that 1@h shows the type of hand South holds|pg||
nt|noodle:  well it s an exciting match for sure|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hoffers: while X is a GOOD takeout|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes transfer openings are very user friendly...for the enemy|pg||
nt|hoffers: NS may now find the save!|pg||
nt|frankaus: this may induce the 4@S save  - tho i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a few more hands |pg||
nt|noodle:  1@s 2@d by S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@H in CR was certainly anexaggeration|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the hardest part about ANY constructive method is designing the countermeasures to intervention. if our constructive system PROLIFERATES  the opportunities for the enemy to ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: intervene, it is going to have to show a MASSIVE profit over standard methods to be worth the candle|pg||
nt|hoffers: On @d lead, cold|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would want to get into this auction |pg||
nt|marcsmith: lots of guessing yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: transfers over 1/2 NT all but universal - i'm of the view that transfer methods improve ur results|pg||
nt|offthebend: can they find 2S now ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 queens might dissuade me|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: possible swing here --- only 6H and 6NT by N makes on a good club guess |pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to deciade whether to run the opening lead, or play for trumps 3-2 and a correct club guess|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can make 6S but not obvious that you will|pg||
nt|marcsmith: since it needs trumps 3-2 and a winning club guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: still 2 more to play, isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  if you disregard KJ10x@d lead can pitxh @cs and play towards q@d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|offthebend: well done |pg||
nt|offthebend: How did they make all 13 tricks :) D lead to the Q and C to K ducked |pg||
nt|hoffers: No. Win A, draw trumps, discard @c on @hs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, you have to guess who has the DK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chilloncan: well there is a bit of a difference. when we open showing a strong hand, the opponents dont intervene as often as they can at the one level;|pg||
nt|noodle:  not impressed by the P on 1@h|pg||
nt|hoffers: Unlikely to lead @dJ from KJ|pg||

nt|marcsmith: really?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hoffers: The play will be quicker, even for Peter|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|marcsmith: isn't it normal to lead a suit containing king of queen against a small slam, to set up your trick?|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: N-S bidding methods not very spectator friendly though it could be effective|pg||
nt|panja: B11, with 23 HCP, NS passed all through...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|rv: difficult for either N or S to get in Panja|pg||

pc|cA|nt|chilloncan: well, i hadnt counted on S planning tio bid 4H....maybe they paly 2-tiered weak 2s so ts N hand is dead minimum for 2H|pg||

nt|chilloncan: it sure seemed that E took a long time to pass over 3S. if so, and if 4S was an easy make, we would get arbitrage as early as board one|pg||

nt|rv: ty Roland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: as expected|pg||
mb|p!|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, EW had no busines making that 1NT, but for some reason North became anamoured with keeping @Dxxx and tossing hearts|pg||
nt|rv: short and sweet bidding by Barbara on this deal from CR, on partner's support double, she jumped to 6@h|pg||
nt|janm: 1@s presumably shows an opening bid with no 4 card Major|pg||
nt|rv: is 1@s equivalent to weak nt opening w/o 4M?|pg||
nt|rv: possibly equivalent to demicoma (system invented by Panja) 1n opening|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|panja: it seems like..but the hand is bit too weak..no Ace...unsupported doubleton Queen|pg||
nt|rv: what does 5@h ask partner to evaluate?|pg||
nt|panja: unless 5@H shows @D void..it cannot be the right bid here..and even if it does, it will probably not the right bid..|pg||
nt|rv: South has taken away 4 levels of bidding space and he can't be sure of what he is asking pd to evaluate, not very good system|pg||
nt|panja: I raise the offside flag..too far too fast|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Guessland|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|Walddk2: 5@S = I have no clue|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: Peter is bidding next bid which is a good strategy when you don't know what to do, maybe he is asking partner to bid 5n if 2 aces are missing|pg||
nt|panja: it seems we have missed some bids..surely the Pass should not have an alert mark here|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|panja: the first pass, by Reynolds, that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The alerts are perhaps a little random|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Peter was afraid 2 aces are missing and wanted to play in 5n and systemically he had to bid 5@s to play in 5n|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Gill's pass over double is also alerted|pg||
nt|rv: Livesey has earned 6 IMPs for his side by his agricultural bidding, why do you need science?|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: slams bid on this sort of auction are more often than not cold though|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he might as well try to cash the DA|pg||
nt|peachy: Barbara could claim|pg||
nt|noodle:  no  in case there s an unknown ruff|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can't really claim just in case of a club ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: suprisingly Barbara missed slam on brd 10, she is normally very aggressive bidder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like we've gotta give Sartaj Hans some credit at the other table for NOT doubling 6@H  :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|rv: unfortunately her partner had the goods and had to take decision to move on in that deal|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, you're right, Steve, we do - tough not to double with 2 aces|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: in 4th suit, do N-S play natural opening?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rv: sry in 4th seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Looks like it, doesn't it|pg||
nt|janm: This auction has a very different feel to it than the auction in the other room, where West opened the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: idea is partner surely has lesser values and no point in transferring to weaker hand and describing stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: the courtesy raise in hearts will surely get 4 from North .... NOW its time to double something, David Appleton  :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: oh well ..no courtesy raise ... so  a success for NS|pg||
nt|janm: Perhaps they're still playing a strong club in 4th seat, so Livesey decided that they aren't likely to have a game and he should stay low|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the 3rd set. Noty easy to predict when the final set begins, as we are a bit off schedule already. Maybe 10-15 mins after this board is complete|pg||
nt|janm: North in the other room took only 7 tricks, but of course he was trying for 10 - here, trying for 8, will Gill succeed?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he will win @dA, unblock @cs, play @sq to @sA and try to cash @CA|pg||
nt|panja: he should...he should not try to discard a @D at all..instead, play a small trump trick two|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|janm: probably will play KQ of clubs and then a spade to the Ace? (or finesse) to pitch the diamond on the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: you read his mind exactly, RV|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: If they don't cover they don't have it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gill followed Zia's advice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: if appleton had followed Zia's BOLS tip, he would have made 4@h earlier in segment:)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janm: Interesting decision to over-ruff instead of pitching, but he doesn't have a prayer of another entry to dummy, so maybe figured now was as good a time as any to score the heart K|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: Reynolds deciding whether to ruff this or let partner win it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rv: Peter has hand well in control, should make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|panja: he cannot now..|pg||
nt|panja: trumps..out|pg||
nt|janm: K of diamonds, 3 rounds of hearts, win the spade and claim for the defense?|pg||
nt|rv: yes, sry|pg||
nt|panja: the trouble with trying a @D discard was that it consumed all of dummy's entries at once..|pg||
mc|7|nt|janm: It was a very awkward hand|pg||
nt|panja: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|rv: thx all|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Hi Ed :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard save to find at the other table|pg||
nt|marcsmith: no one can make anything here|pg||
nt|noodle:  saving rarely appealing with 2 aces, but then jumps to slam are often done with a void :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: saving with 2 aces over a small slam  - that takes some courage|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: both these pairs are only occasional partnership|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Justin!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|marcsmith: someone likely to get overboard at the 3-level|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: Liversy plays a strong @C system with lots of curls and whitles|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard for East to bid less that 3D|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and certainly won;t defend 2S |pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: quiet partial|pg||
nt|marcsmith: useful to have a 2NT bid to show minors in this auction|pg||
nt|noodle:  not my style to withhold support|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 2C is potty|pg||
nt|noodle:  3@c as fit jump more to my taste|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3D or 4D seems more normal|pg||
nt|peachy: Dawson was so sure they will raise spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: Peake a very dangerous player|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i thought gill was travis' brother|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a gr8 immagination|pg||
nt|frankaus: lights are "green"|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4C seems closer|pg||
nt|noodle:  y|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|sybarra: guess he just sneaks it home |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|marcsmith: 4C is most likely to get South to stretch to 4S (doubled)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: made it too easy for NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  obviously the 1@d can be a singleton|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: should be "coffee hand"  unless declarer decides not to lead toward his @S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: in which case he will hold clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  so less tempting to raise violently as in std|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4C shows both minors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marcsmith: silly system where 1C/1D show less than 4 IMHO|pg||
nt|hoffers: However action has got NS into auction at at least 3 level|pg||
nt|peachy: well, Precision :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: as i said silly system|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely West can hit this now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: transfer advances by gill-liversy|pg||
nt|frankaus: Liversy will know gills shape and they are in GF  auction|pg||
nt|pelepele: just hope n/s have enought pass cards|pg||
nt|chilloncan: as opposed to 1C-1D-2N-3H, where responder's shape would be a mystery?:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@C may be playable but who can bid it?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: standard could bid it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if after 1C-1D, E rebids 3C|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W could visualize slam facing as little as:  Kxx   AK   xx   AQT9xx|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6@C no laydown |pg||
nt|marcsmith: wet pass from West|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: prob concerned about 4@S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: really? with Kxxx and a known heart ruff available|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and his partner bid at the 2-level|pg||
nt|noodle:  if E has a trump :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he must have a trump of NS would be in 4S now not 4h on their 9-card fit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: of perhaps partner is 0-0-6-7 and gave up at 3c?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hoffers: On a @d lead, Peake has to avoid going a lot down|pg||
nt|hoffers: On a @c lead, only a few down|pg||
nt|frankaus: no much value in X , 50 V 100 and the X hepps declarer place the cards|pg||
nt|marcsmith: closer to 500|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|vugrapha1: Barbara and Peter discussing the fact that the last time they met in a Final was the 1980 Youth Teams|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||

nt|peachy: Perhaps Hans was confident that just a plus would suffice. I would have doubled|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer should at least have won trick one with the K|pg||
nt|hoffers: Still dangerous for Peake on a @d switck|pg||
nt|marcsmith: double seems normal -- hoping they run to spades|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: we can see an overtrick by winning @H in hand, leading to @D, pitching @C and leading @S and that's the line he seems to be taking|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|frankaus: Hans seeded 9 - Travis seeded 5|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|marcsmith: club continuation is weak|pg||
nt|peachy: can anyone concoct a reasoning for it?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: none at all|pg||
nt|marcsmith: particularly after declarer showed him KQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|hoffers: Fortunately still 1 down|pg||
