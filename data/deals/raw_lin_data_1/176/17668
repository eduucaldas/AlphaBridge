nt|Walddk2: It's not a contract youb want to be in when looking at dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or could play @c rather than @h hoping to force opponents to open up @h|pg||

nt|benjy: if east has one @S then 7@S is decent|pg||
nt|ppiglett: As the said a few years ago about bidding, the club suit is well gone, diamond are now gone and hearts and spades need to be carefull. Such a joy to see a few suits natural |pg||
nt|bluejak:  After 1 stanza:  Sinclair 14  Mossop 21   +++  Hinden 23  Penfold 7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: ok but lets see what suit they play in and at what level|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjy: if you play on @Hs which looks normal, do you play one to the 8, then you might make, or the king?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bloodaxe: lengste og beste farge ut mot NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx forbidden in some partnerships|pg||

nt|jcomyn: with 7c on?????|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: really 5@s...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant be surely|pg||
nt|rmb1: Even if you bid clubs naturally, they get lost if you use blackwood|pg||
nt|benjy: firstly i dont think 7@C is making|pg||
nt|benjy: to the king looked normal to me|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: well better than 5s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjy: secondly opposite 3 key cards for many 5@S would be forcing, but that is a matter for agreement|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: settle for six-something|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: fairly arbitrary - but someone might duck the king when they should not|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|nubmaster: Det svänger gott, 10 imp tillbaka till Sverige|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  bare @cK is not pulling full weight|pg||
nt|copeyj: seeing as 2N wld be 18-19|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the sort of hand often used in magazine panel competitions.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3N is usually a strong hand based on a long strong @D suit|pg||
nt|athene: yes, and many people reverse into hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult when the response is 1@H instead, too. |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer 3NT to bidding a major you do not have|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i am not a big fan of Bridge World -style evil lying fake reverses :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: over 1@D-1@H some ppl play a gadget - for example 2@S would be artificial and a 16+ hand with 6@D3@H or 5@D4@H or FG with @D/@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brolucius: 3NT shows long diamonds, of course. I mentioned not long ago that 2NT is the rebid nowadays on 19 points.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians play the same on this auction. 2@H an artificial reverse with different hand types|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Sandra penfold is hoping to find her partner with 5@c|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: However, the 3NT rebid can give mixed results. I remember an England team in a world championship stopping in 3NT while their opponents bid and made 7@D.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|c4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alternative, you can play 2@C as Gazzilli'ish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which the Bulgarians did in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: zia playing with rosenberg played i think 1@D - 1@S; 3@H was a 1-suiter too strong for 3@D|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ppiglett: I dont have nothing, I have absolutely nothing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: which means a hand that would bid 2@D then make a second negative over whatever South bid next ,,,|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C looks like some sort of transfer|pg||
nt|benjy: Does anyone possess an intimate knowledge of the bulgarian bidding methods?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's gazzilli?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another Jxxx lead?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bloodaxe: dårlig med innkomster i vest|pg||

nt|nubmaster: @c ut och tillbaka, han fick stjäla en @d och nu måste han maska @s för hemgång i 6@c|pg||
nt|hesse: men Eide hadde et vanskelig kast, og @d avkastet var gjerne naturlig|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|hesse: nå har kontrakten gode muligheter|pg||
nt|bluejak:  I thought Gazilli was a rebid after 1M - 1NT, 2C being artifiical|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|hesse: syd må lasje nå rettnok|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  excpet he is going to suffer from jet lag when he gets there|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table, they are no doubt playing a 5-card major system. Since North had already shown five hearts, he was happy to pass 2@D.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  hope there are no late night sessions in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|athene: passing 2@D looks normal anyway|pg||
nt|athene: you have found a decent fit, there is no game possibility, why rebid 2@H facing perhaps a void?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I seem to suffer from jet-lag all year. I suppose it is the passing of the years...|pg||

nt|athene: hard to imagine having to respond 2@D systemically on that, though |pg||
nt|brolucius: A sorry part of 'Acol and the weak NT'.|pg||

nt|rmb1: a random game try (last train at the two level)??|pg||
nt|benjy: if it was last train, which has been suggested to me, then why on earth is east bidding game?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Some sort last train style bid to describe a reasonable overcall and stay below 2S?|pg||
nt|benjy: terrible minor suit holdings, no ruffing value and minimum in points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes very soft values outside trumps|pg||
nt|benjy: i would be more worried about going off in 3@S than making game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in fact a useless hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and against both opps bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: as will be demonstrated in the play no doubt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bloodaxe: 2@D er 6kort hjerter, enten WJS eller solid utgangskrav uten sidefarge|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the main problem, in my opinion, with having to bid 2@C on that sort of hand is, partner is going to be passing it if she opened light for the lead|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is commonplace (and correct) to open a strong 1NT when you hold a 5-card major and 5-3-3-2 shape. Weak no-trumpers tend to be less keen on the idea.|pg||

nt|copeyj: suggest she wouldnt duck smoothly with the K|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the world is divided on that issue, David|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some always open 1NT with a 5-card major, some never|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zia has attempted a brilliancy, leading 4th best from a sequence. It can work OK, but it is against the odds.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and some somehwere in between|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: zia's reasoning is, i imagine, that on this auction it's very likely either declarer or dummy has four diamonds|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Exactly so. On this auction, the defenders have one card more than declarer/dummy in the majors. There is therefore a strong bias towards opening leads in the major suits.|pg||
