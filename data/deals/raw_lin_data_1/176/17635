nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hello everyone. Welcome to the 11th round of Icelandic Championship Finals|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: This is the last round & finals from tomorrow?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S are strong favorites to winning the title in tomorrows 4 team finals|pg||
nt|psyck: ah, thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W will need to be quite lucky to crawl into top 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Live score:  http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
nt|psyck: EW 6th with 159|pg||
nt|psyck: NS joint 2nd with 175|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: E-W play Precision with 14-16 NT. N-S play 2/1 with unbalanced @D and transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has seen his partner's 1@H bids before|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h some king of positive response i guess, maybe with bal hand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H seemed to be natural vs. a more solid citizen|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: don't need to preempt opps when they tend to do it themselves i guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
nt|xenya: well we all have been in worse slams i believe|pg||
nt|psyck: I can understand a try with 5@d, but 6@d looks to be a bit of a gamble.  This is a decent slam though, unfortunate as it needs nothing more than a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The problem with the West hand is that it is only worth a GF in NT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A double of 2@H, showing some 5-7 HCP had maybe worked better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|dJ|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|hawe45: Claim|pg||
nt|hawe45: Trump back would have defeated this contract|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|iceak:  EW use relays|pg||
nt|psyck: Actually, if 2@h denied @h stopper in addition to showing a balanced positive, 6@d bid looks much better|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dima:  Ina strong clubs context?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: the problem with stripping side-suits and hoping for some elimination is that it's always really obvious what you are doing|pg||
nt|athene: so opps know to throw their kings brilliantly from Kx and stuff like that when it's needed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like making now|pg||
nt|santyclz: @s pitch may have let it through.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, the hearts come in so I don't think so|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, I think 6@D was quite reasonable|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Prec.|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A painful pass from East|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 3 trump losers or so|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
nt|psyck: about the same as allowing NS to make 1@s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: but he has to draw trump also |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: East sensibly preserving his trump|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: more pain|pg||
nt|xenya: N will be pleased to score all his trumps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h8|pc|d9|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
mb|d|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
nt|psyck: x generally played as asking for @s here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting situation. The X sometimes asks for @S, sometimes for shorter Major|pg||
nt|psyck: they may run to 5m|pg||
mb|4D|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One way to find the queen of trump is never to play the suit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: 4 i mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South had a pretty clear escape, no doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: West took my advice|pg||
nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
nt|sybarra: drury  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Drury, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) will they get to this 4@S difficult tho but a 10 card fit is such an Asset|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
nt|psyck: S doesn't know N's hand, & opps x cannot always be trustede|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||
nt|copeyj: they shouldnt find out about ot until it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well, it's easy to bid from up here but they didn't find it at either table.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: I was expecting same |pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||
nt|athene: sure|pg||
nt|athene: but playing one round of trumps would have been ok if declarer had then remembered rule 1 of crossruffing (take side suit tricks early)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: but here if was a fairly clear choice i guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|iceak:  not communication to pick up trumps|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
nt|psyck: NS have a 4@s sacrifice, but not findable|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The double asked for shorter/weaker major|pg||
nt|psyck: ok thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When my partners double like that, I lead my doubleton @H and find the ops have missed a 9 card fit there|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Where as my natural @S lead from Kxxx would have hit partner with AQJTx|pg||
mb|1H|an|11-15|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here we might have our fun|pg||
nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if W plays it but bidding wont permit that |pg||
nt|psyck: lol true, 1NT - 3N can come with wide ranging hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The leas of the Queen show either King or Jack|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live IN RUNNING LADY MILNE SCORES - http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|athene: and partner might sometimes pass it or something horrible|pg||
nt|hawe45: He must have seen many bad openings from partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: One more  @H from North  = 620|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I prefer a direct 4@S bid on the East hand. Don't want the ops to find out about both strength and fit|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Needs @ds and @hs both 3-3.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite common in Iceland only to lead King vs. NT with a stronger combination, asking for count or unblocking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Perhaps in this case the queen asked for unblocking|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk1: Scotland currently +23 against Wales|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|athene: EW in the other room will be hoping that their counterparts bid 6@D, of course|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: different drury sequence here |pg||

nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does not promise 6 of them. West has shown approx. (9)10-11 I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: 3-card limit raise - looks as if West had a no-cost double, but that might have been takeout of hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: West has shown 6-4 Majors and 8+ HCP, East has just shown 16+|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye as Dima said has it's own advantaage the system have to live with the problems|pg||
nt|dima:  An interesting point about the lead - if NS know that W has 6-4 in majors they might try to conceal diamond split|pg||
nt|sybarra: true in any system, has advantages and disadvantages on certain hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting point Dima|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jbennet: hoever if North can splinter i spades. they might reach 5 h.|pg||
nt|ady: north making some sort of effort   |pg||
nt|ady: I think north a little ambitious    south has a maximum with a 5th heart   and little wasted in spades|pg||
nt|ady: some might consider south a little top heavy to open 1NT  with 17 + a decent 5 card suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jbennet: i suppose that this hand is an example why many players play 1430 instead of 0314 RKC|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think N-S want to stay out of slam here|pg||
mb|2N!|an|4!H|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
mb|3D!|an|No shortness, extra HCP|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to get there with a key card & trump Q missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has only promised invitational values, I think, 10+|pg||
nt|psyck: but still possible due to 9 card fit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
nt|xenya: but 9 trumps -- an eternal problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||

nt|dima:  BTW was 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He might take a safety finesse in trumps to get only 11|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Has partner one diamond, or two?|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dima:  nice play the @h 8|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||

pc|h8|pg||

pc|hK|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||

mc|12|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||

nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: can't figure out why 3@d instead of @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: seems misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT looks a practical shot from South|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||

nt|cuttysark: North contemplating slam, East wondering how cheap a save might be|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N showing facial expressions - looking to the air|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Allthough he denied 4@H himself, his partner might be weak in @D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||

nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||

nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||

nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||

nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||

nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: opps|pg||
nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||

mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Not this one - they have a festival in Ferbuary which I attended once - highly recommended|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: east might have considered 3@C|pg||

nt|mgb81: Ah - I am now told that the actual auction was 2H (2S) 3H all pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: N finding the 1 @S call "interesting" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I think E-W will not bid slam unless N-S push them by 1 more @S bid?!?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - I am behind the times - the Festival is in January now. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Good poin Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk1: point even|pg||
nt|santyclz: How many for a 2@s bid on 1st round?|pg||
nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: East was wise not to double|pg||
nt|psyck: cheaply bought, EW make some 11 tricks in @s probably|pg||
nt|xenya: E's pass looks strange|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzdh: But this might easily be a double game swing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||
nt|jbennet: seems 4 sp too high.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: E had some defensive cards in @h, but the rest of his hand was massively offensive|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec told me:  16 cm of snow fell last night - hasn't snowed this much in may for 24 years in Iceland|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: well e/w are missing some spots in @D,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see a way to make this|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|steshome:  With a 10-count opposite a weak two?  Nah|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit here...|pg||
nt|xenya: i think E had a clear raise to 4 -- as a double shot at least|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|hawe45: 3 @S X = 800, better than game|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think though best bet is too draw trumps ending in dummy and then start the clubs|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer might get fatally shortened when West gets his @D trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: well yes, only a 10 count, but 3 very likely tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: yes, he has too much work to do with too many cards unfav|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|iceak:  propably vins |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West's 3@S bid was not effective|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|xenya: should persevere with diamonds for 1 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@S or 4@S would have worked better on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But with a passed partner 3@S is a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then when 4@H comes to him undoubled, perhaps he should consider 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mgb81: I suppose it's a bit fancifl to think that north will play ace of trumps and sprun the diamond finesse to get out for down two anyway|pg||

mb|2C!|an|Weak !D or majors or strong|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @H  likely makng +1 for e/w|pg||
nt|hawe45: The @S 10 in East is the only card to defeat 7 @H, but also a @S-lead kills it|pg||
nt|hawe45: Black squeeze against West|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: save in 4 @S?  a trick in every suit  |pg||
nt|psyck: then yes, W cold consider 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: *could|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm still placing the blame on E|pg||
nt|psyck: me too :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mgb81: in the event of a tie....is it the head to head match that counts? |pg||
nt|santyclz: Doubt n-s will get into the auction.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: club ruffs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now East can really "disturb" the slam-bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: here is that bid again |pg||
nt|henryb:  another hand (see board 1) where 3N is best despite the void|pg||
nt|sybarra: 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Walddk1: Investigating|pg||
nt|athene: spade lead very costly in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45: But the more E/W bid @D, the more South will be happy for partners values - showed in controls allready|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, East seems to think that 2@D was a takeout of @Ds!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi,  then 3 @c weak with hts, etc to 4|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H by E might have caused more problems than 2D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good practical bid by South|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
nt|psyck: but it also depends on their preemptive style|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||
nt|athene: then east just has to lead a diamond rather than a spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: right, didnt notice the club ruffs|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: S 2 @S looked like a 2 suited (tartan type) bid |pg||
nt|iceak:  no reason to find play to loose 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: some call it Muiderberg|pg||
nt|sybarra: tartan's are 5/5  and muiderberg can be 5/4+  |pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: I guess 2 @H says nothing about hts? |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: cards fit well for EW here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sequences over the mult-strong-meaning 2@C must be quite complex|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Claim on a @C finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: sorry strong with hts|pg||
nt|psyck: compare this with the deal 9 2@c opening :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, this one is quite more normal|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psyck: pther table did not bother to investigate grand on deal 9 either|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|psyck: right|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mgb81: I am told that Maida Grant has just found the onlylead to beat a game against Wales that her team-mates missed|pg||
nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||
nt|mgb81: so it might be 6 to Scotland instead of a possible 10 to Wales|pg||
pc|hK|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak (our operator) is doing a great job of showing the alerts |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed he is :) It's a fiddly process, but maybe he knows ahen they are coming|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder if they have worked out who is on lead yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he would agree, you get used to it as operator|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No one seems to know how they break a tie. I asked 5 'competent' people|pg||
nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mgb81: with 5H and 4S north bids 3H waiting to hear a 4 card spade suit from south|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n missed his chance bo not leading single @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 3 @D was sort of smolen-ish|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jbennet: that would have helped at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that was a question) |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|h4|nt|jbennet: would not have helped.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|mgb81: Oh apparently the Scots have just let through the game....|pg||
nt|mgb81: This means Wales have pulled to within 1imp|pg||
nt|athene: i have quiet confidence in wales to do what needs to be done|pg||
nt|dima:  With KJx in trumps it did not really look that one WANTS to ruff|pg||
nt|iceak:  sure - but in this|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mgb81: and England are Leading the Lady MIlne for the first time this tournament!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 54-0 to Wales over the last 8 boards, two of which were flat|pg||
nt|mgb81: Mean while in 4H North had no way to avoid losing 3 trumps to go with the king of spades and another completely wasted ten imps to England|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  I think the right (and on this hand successful) line is two rounds of trumps, cash the @dA, and three rounds of spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: It looks as if 2@D was a transfer and 3@D showed 4-5, but last time he transferred into a 4card spade suit.....|pg||

pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a somewhat lucky make|pg||
nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT - hara kiri|pg||
nt|ady: if the hearts behave   it looks either on A@D right   or the clubs as they are   or possible setting up spades   really needs to avoid losing 3 trump tricks to have a reasonable ...|pg||
nt|ady: shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts 3-2 with the ace onside is 34%, but even that is not necessarily enough. As it is, Jón can't go wrong|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can but if that loses to the queen, he is on a guess at best next time|pg||
nt|ady: if the jack loses to the queen  can take a view on 2nd round  maybe dropping ace doubleton offside    it is more than just playing for the ace onside and 3-2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David but if Skúli had Qx there would be three trump losers if he rises with the queen|pg||

nt|mgb81: I really wish the players would hurry up and finish so we can switch to the Wales match!|pg||
nt|mgb81: Here 4S is off in top tricks on a heart lead..but not if east switches at trick 2 as happened in another match|pg||
nt|hawe45: Slam without a @C-lead here|pg||
nt|jbennet: if singleton lead then club loser goes away.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The lead does not matter. If you lead singleton @D you loose the @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H should make E-W here, allthough the trumps are weak|pg||
mb|1S|an|11-15|mb|2D|nt|henryb:  I think 2@d showed gf values opposite 18-19 and 2@h showed 18-19, then 3@d was a transfer and 3@h showed 3 hearts and not 4@s|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, a @cJ drops|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbennet: many seems to upgrade 19 counts to 20-21NT.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There are light opening bids, and there are ridiculously light opening bids, and there is this opening bid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: The theory is to save room with the stronger hand for a game try.  I'm not convinced there is any real advantage.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D anyone for n/s ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: clubs are friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: very |pg||
nt|psyck: so only 2@h, 1@d to lose|pg||
nt|xenya: tough to get there though?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mgb81: Off for east not to respond - at green I'd have though 1H had some appeal|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is cold N-S but hard to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand not improved by 2@d overcall either|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is close to a maximum Precision @S opening.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: We can't say how they break a tie because there doesn't seem to be anything in the regulations|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Which is very strange|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s doubled will be interesting|pg||
nt|jbennet: another case for lebensohl 1NT response.|pg||
nt|psyck: should not have problems settling in 5@d w/o @h control here|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding  |pg||
nt|henryb:  very normal on BBO|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|xenya: this is 8th trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 8 tricks are makeable, with the @C jack 3d and @H ace onside|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: here we go |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mgb81: has Alice Kaye found the winnign bid to tip partner off to a heart lead?....|pg||
nt|Walddk1: a spec found something now, one moment|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mgb81: That would be a no...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: The winners of the Trophies shall be the countries with the greatest number of Victory Points gained over the series. In theevent of two or more countries gaining an equal number ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: of VP.s the Trophy shall be held jointly by such countries.|pg||
nt|mgb81: I can't really moan - the queen diamonds seems so automatic|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|santyclz: A double may have backfired.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: hard to imagine anyone reaching 5@D on an unconteated auction either. 3NT possible - but that does not make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn thinking heavily|pg||
pc|dT|nt|steshome:  Where are we now in terms of VPs, Roland?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yues I think it's cold|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But remembers some of his partner's opening bids|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is actually pretty good: needs either 2-2 @d and @c not worse than 4-2 or 3-3 clubs and @d not worse than 3-1|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: clubs 3/3 will make this on easy for declarer |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: (an @D 2/2)|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mgb81: There are 2 boards left to score in the Wales match and Scotland lead by 2 imps I believe|pg||
nt|sybarra: it always works that way when you are NOT in game |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  Perhaps N might have doubled 1N -- then if S found 3@d over 2@s North could envision the game|pg||

mb|2D!|an|1 major, 6-9 or GF|nt|henryb:  4@s is easy with the good fit and good splits|pg||

nt|jbennet: 2NT= "i have a weak doubleton"|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|peachy: Looks like NS play weak NT first seat? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes. Hard to stay away from hopeless 3NT here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S might make. Possibly 4@H|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good bidding might lead to 4 ! h - also down|pg||
nt|dima:  11-13|pg||
nt|sybarra: club system e/w |pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs asks: "where"|pg||
nt|psyck: no @d cue meaning they should not crosss 5@c level|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: but with the @c break...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that North did not double 4@H might help South on the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Stephen, can we leave the table open for confirmed results, please?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: ok|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe W should not have raised with a purely defensive hand|pg||
mb|6C|nt|santyclz: So both significant swings so far have gone against Vestri.  |pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: "3NT i have weak doubleton in clubs"|pg||
nt|dima:  One might need mirrors to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: so play 4@hx as do not lead @h|pg||
nt|psyck: *some...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: South now knows about 2-2 in @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S can make 620 - "can"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And he actually knows that 4@D is most likely the "right spot"|pg||
nt|hawe45: 4 @S is he right spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But vulnerable at IMPS he will guess some game|pg||
nt|dima:  ok one problem solved|pg||
nt|iceak:  first problem solved|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: I would rather try a Moysian than 4D|pg||
nt|jbennet: OK then ; then 4 major is no longer an option. EK stiff oppsite xx creates too many loseres in 4 major.|pg||
nt|sybarra: lead is helpful |pg||
nt|henryb:  well worth 10-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North hoping that South has the singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
nt|psyck: quite normal to see a lot of overbidding in the final stages i guess, they even got to 6@hx OR in the 5@hx-2 deal |pg||
pc|d2|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to do othervise|pg||

nt|steshome:  Oh the slow play fine :(|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Many thanks to Stephen Peterkin, our brilliant operator in Belfast!|pg||
nt|mgb81: Oops!! Alice just memory squeezed - someone remind me to ring her up int en minutes and have a chuckle at her|pg||
nt|Walddk1: And to our many excellent commentators over the three days|pg||
nt|sybarra: *an|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 1@s doubled?|pg||
nt|jbennet: EW punished by playing an inferiour system.|pg||
nt|iceak:  EW use to have a good system|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to 14 |pg||
nt|jbennet: passing is showing some weakness in personality and causes a lower status in the hiearchy . |pg||
nt|sybarra: and we will come back to 16 as last bd |pg||
nt|sybarra: some early thank you's are in order |pg||
nt|iceak:  Interesting how SÃ¦var will bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Ideland celebrated for at the year |pg||
nt|cuttysark: They were 'quite pleased' :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  and all four players in the other room are on the Iceland team for this year's Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|xenya: was it really 4? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Very uncareful play by declarer. South's double should have warned him|pg||
nt|psyck: y, lost a @s too|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He lost 2@D, 2 trump and a @S|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision 16+|nt|xenya: i see|pg||
nt|psyck: that will even the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Could have ruffed that @S loser|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0-7|nt|sybarra: N could well sit |pg||
nt|santyclz: We say 1@sx'd after an overcall with n's @s suit go for 1100 yesterday.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes about to say the same Santy |pg||
nt|peachy: 1@H = 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our operator Stefan Jonsson. A job well done! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But Baldursson has just mistimed the play in 4@H on Board 11 and Grant Thornton have quite a big lead now|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer to 1 nt as I recall |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no, shirley, just denies a 4 card major|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!H or balanced|nt|hawe45: North could also open 1 @H 11-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Opener will rebid 1N with a sub-1NT balanced hand|pg||
nt|psyck: Sarpisj still comfortable to make it to the finals though|pg||
mb|1S!|an|Mandatory|nt|mgb81: I have to say this is the most exciting Lady Milne I've ever seen|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a possible overcall for north, i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Finally, our gratitude to Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns) for ensuring that this fine event was brought to BBO. Greatly appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: all over the world|pg||
nt|mgb81: 1NT? is that a joke bill?|pg||
nt|athene: err....wasn't meant to be|pg||
nt|vugraphzbb: not at the moment everyone has left but I will find the scores and be back|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the educated lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: why, is it so bad?|pg||
nt|santyclz: (saw)|pg||
mb|1N|an|20-22|nt|jbennet: easy to get too high here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: 8 tricks on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to say, if declarer goes for @Cs, he's doomed.|pg||
nt|dima:  Karl is feeling well now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: with 100 for honours in spades? a 14 count and two suits wide open?|pg||
nt|hawe45: Undo, pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Thin intervention by North, looks likely -1|pg||
nt|psyck: Malning will be inching towards the 4th spot maybe|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mgb81: yes its so bad!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: looks roughly like a 1nt overcall to me, but ok|pg||
nt|hawe45: Small @H now = only hope|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbennet: but if souths now signs off then North should respect that.|pg||
nt|iceak:  Sees @d fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: he did have 15  (but flattish)|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he had kept quiet would have gone plus defending 1N|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dima:  Is 2@s GF or only RF?|pg||
nt|dima:  Ok answered|pg||
nt|jbennet: 2NT was probably telling "i am week"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: @D now to the Jack - and SMALL!!! from North = best defence|pg||
nt|hawe45: But as the @H´s are cleared, normal defence also works|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|jbennet: north respected it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With both opponents bidding it is quite dangerous, but then you have to remember what they bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Grant is reigning team champions in Iceland |pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed, but sometimes silence is golden|pg||
nt|xenya: but it was Malning who went 4 off...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: oops yes|pg||
pc|s9|nt|santyclz: Best defense would seem 500.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur lost 11 on 11 by playing 5@d instead of 4@s|pg||
nt|jbennet: on a bad day even 3 D is -1|pg||
nt|iceak:  2NT was most surely showing a weak hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The ship has sailed for Málning. Probably making 10 tricks in a partscore on this board|pg||
nt|psyck: W surely had an invite|pg||
nt|psyck: A & intermediaries|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Cash 4 @cs and exit with @ha, @h.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mgb81: anyway ns have come to rest in a partscore|pg||
nt|peachy: crucial moment|pg||
nt|iceak:  3@d would have been GF and strong|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|mgb81: south can lay a top club|pg||
nt|mgb81: and its one down|pg||
nt|mgb81: if she goes for disvcards west ruffs and cashes the heart so thats 2 down i think|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Don't go too far away, specs. Stephen will come back with the official results when the teams have scored up. Should not be long|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: thnx all|pg||
nt|steshome:  Just a reminder to spectators that we are keeping this table open for confirmed results|pg||
nt|mgb81: A little spillage at the end but still a convincing win for England and the title. |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Joined title likely|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate half of it|pg||
nt|athene: i thought it was likely a tie?|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|dburn: we believe so|pg||
nt|eamongall: England will win because of the direct match|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Cut the trophy into two, nothing else to do|pg||
nt|steshome:  I don't think it's ever been tied before - what do you think David?|pg||
nt|highshore: don't England win on a split|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  regulation say 'Where there is a tie in Victory Points both teams receive the award for winning.'|pg||
nt|dburn: there is no split tie - the trophy is jointly held|pg||
nt|Walddk1: No Eamon, we found the tie-break in the regulations|pg||
nt|mgb81: Well even if its officially a tie, England feel like the winners as they beat Scotland in the head to head match.|pg||
nt|athene: well, just take half from each word - take the "ENG" from england and the "LAND" from scotland|pg||
nt|athene: put them together|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok there is no split tie .. ENGSCOT win the lady milne |pg||
nt|Walddk1: No, never a tie in the LM, England and Scotland tied twice in the Camrose|pg||
nt|highshore: whatever the result nice to have it go to the wire|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: Seems to be confirmed as a tie...thnx all|pg||

nt|dima:  BOOM!|pg||

nt|jbennet: stupid bid.|pg||
nt|iceak:  But bid at both tables|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, it is very hard to teach the scorpion not to bite|pg||
nt|jbennet: we all hate to be preempted.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like 4M both ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  that is a brave double by Bjarni|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Welcome everyone to the final set of the Lady Milne|pg||
nt|mgb81: the current score as we just saw see Scotland only 1VP ahead of England|pg||
nt|mgb81: so there is literally everything to play for|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Sarah, Michael and Bill|pg||
nt|mgb81: here north has made an inverted minor suit raise and south indicated a weak no trump hand|pg||
nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
nt|psyck: only 3 levels lower than other room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That was peaceful|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|c7|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
nt|psyck: Rabbi's will make the rest|pg||
nt|psyck: by dropping the kingleton|pg||

nt|mgb81: Although having said that it never occured to me that Alice was going to leap to a grand slam two sets earlier with a flat 11 count, so who knows...|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah the legendary Bill Frisby! Hello Bill|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also to Liz and Henry, for your time and insights  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: easy slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Isak our terrific operator. Gre4at Job! |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Joe and Ian, for you great comments  |pg||
nt|hawe45: and now 3 NT from Sævar|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 2 @C is NOT @C, so...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and again Stefan,  a great big thanks to you!!! |pg||
nt|dima:  NS will quickly be in 4@h i think as you have to playing vs. strong club|pg||
nt|iceak:  double 5-7 I think|pg||
nt|dima:  1@d is likely to be transfer overcall, X is usually 5-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: we also love our specs,  who give us helpful comments and thoughts  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course specs, we always love your input and comments to us. |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 40 min or so  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed we do - thank you everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe (not sure) that 2@s shows clubs and weak hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: 3 @H now - and off we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just over 1/2 hour  (15 til the hour is schedule) |pg||
nt|dima:  Aha - then 1@d is Majors or minors so EW will have some space to sort things out|pg||
nt|psyck: needed @dA to be @sA for that maybe|pg||
nt|xenya: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: OH - 5 even better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar has more ambitions than that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sorry, Karl|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar, on the other hand, must have some ambitions now.|pg||
nt|psyck: E knows their values are limited, but great shape & fit will likely make him try |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C to play?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@s denies Major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might get vaguely interested facing drury i suppose|pg||
nt|mgb81: 2C here is drury showing 9+ and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: some danger with this - if it persuades West that @cK is a good card for slam purposes...|pg||
nt|mgb81: 3C is some sort of long suit try|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand if 3@C is a long suit try, west must feel that at least some of those spade cards are wasted|pg||
nt|mgb81: wets might bid 3S now...4D from east 4H from west will east then pass it?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but facing @sxx  @hAKQxxx  @dA  @cAxxx, slam is well worth bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to all the specs who provide us with comments and humor through out |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx Shirley & Joe|pg||
nt|friggi: it should do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: we scheduled to back at:  6:45 am Los Angeles, 9:45 am New York, 15.45 Paris, 2:45 pm London, 11:45 pm Sydney|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceak:  seems 5 imps to Aron|pg||
nt|dima:  3NT will be peaceful -1|pg||
nt|dima:  though North will have to find 5 pitches on @c let us see ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Luckily for North no endplay can hurt him|pg||
nt|dima:  1@d + 3@s + 1@h survives|pg||
nt|dima:  since partner will help in @h|pg||
nt|iceak:  Has to know S has 5@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  seems like less than best methods where N with @sKJ96 cant opt to let partner play 2@sX|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to bid @D, when you belong in 3 @C...? |pg||
nt|henryb:  I find this auction is upsetting my equilibrium|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: 4 @D cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @h cue|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mgb81: ok as usual I was nowhere nbear the real auction. The customary bash of game from west and east passes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Rather flat board perhaps, 500 N-S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Flat, but not dull|pg||
nt|hawe45: Might "only" bring 500, depending a lot on the @C-guess|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, was just going to say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: you will either need a coffee or a mimosa for next set |pg||
nt|henryb:  or perhaps to sleep through it|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spade lead is not best here, but I guess any lead will do|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: XX |pg||
nt|sybarra: first round control |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: The x gives them an extra round of bidding.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|henryb:  East can almost count the high cards|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will think - then duck|pg||
nt|henryb:  why think first?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a thinking player :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn always thinks - |pg||
nt|sybarra: and E was Liz's pard in tourney (was it Malta?) |pg||
nt|henryb:  but this is a position where you duck automatically, and think later|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rhodes - first ever transnational Mixed Teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Liz forgot what you said|pg||
nt|psyck: the 6@cx-4 result has come in & its the last nail on the coffin for Maining|pg||
nt|psyck: Standings: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|mgb81: today this was well judged - tomorrow move the ace of clubs and there would be recriminations all round...|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@S plus +1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: Good defence, kils dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, W knows there cannot be 2 quick losers after 4@c cue so hopes to lose only the 1 missing key card|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North is known to be balanced, so must have at least 2 clubs. |pg||
nt|psyck: Top 4 play the RR finals starting 12GMT tomorrow|pg||
nt|psyck: with VP carryovers|pg||
nt|xenya: ironically, EW did make 12 tricks on that hand -- but they had stopped in 4@C...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Rhodes, Malta, both small Mediterranean islands. Easy to confuse|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|friggi: well done|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks all|pg||
nt|psyck: it was played well, after the friendly lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: there went the entry|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|santyclz: And a quick claim...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dima:  They should get it right|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South actually revoked on this trick, throwing a small @S while North is still in agony.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer noticed in a split second and turned his card around|pg||
nt|dima:  why revoked, he has no clubs ...?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Don't know if North saw it |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South played to the precent trick, out of turn|pg||
nt|dima:  Screen covers NE so likely no harm done|pg||
nt|iceak:  Could become directors problem|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|hawe45: North deserved this trick - after his 5 @H-bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye all; this hand is making me go to sleep|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all |pg||
nt|ianmcc: bye|pg||
nt|peachy: bye for now, more in 1hr 15 min|pg||
pc|c3|mc|7|nt|psyck: NS have played well & given away little this set. good luck to them tomorrow|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Vlad, Stefen, & specs|pg||
nt|psyck: 11GMT sry|pg||
nt|psyck: bye|pg||
pg||
