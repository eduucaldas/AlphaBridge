mb|p|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
mb|2C|an|alert|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||

pc|cK|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|an|alert|mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: purists would find much wrong with this 2@H bid, but it often works well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18 with 5+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S could be 3 cards with longer @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis-Bessis are playing  2 in 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, INV+     but maybe he'll just gamble 3N??|pg||
mb|3C|an|alert|mb|d|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit of a psyche?   i think 3@C=game force 3+@C natural or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry I can not see the explanations of the alerts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is sitting the thinker man's pose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helness DBL might actually help them find the 50% game that makes with @SK onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: If @S9 promises the 10, then fine|pg||

mb|1N|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  1@c "Polish": usually a ballanced 10-13; sometimes strong (18+) or perhaps natural with clubs|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: it could be 5 5 the 2nt but North showed the 3 diamond cared|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: no ruling yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||
nt|scotty: What card should East plasy at trick one?  @s3 or @s6?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 red finesses lose and 2 black aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bramley-Welland won't have this problem|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i keep getting into a loop, still not sure if down 2 or 3 here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: wondering if Helness was supposed to cash @CA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: I take the bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 cokes|pg||
nt|hawe45: Declarer will suffer, when the @C-suit in invited into the battle|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both respond     i've got 9 cards left|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|dK|nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: on  8 the Bessis pair did find the 5@DX save against 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness is rocking his chair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Zimmermann team dominated this event last year|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: just announced less than 15 min left in the round|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open, we will be back like in 5-10 min with next rd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see everybody then :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|nt|hawe45: Why discard the @C 8 - and not the 5?|pg||
nt|henryb:  first match is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. We will be showing Blanchard vs Zimmerman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4/5 imps = 19-11 VPs   but hard to imagine this hand being anywhere near a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator said  Bramley opened East hand 2@C "after much deliberation"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp     P-2@C-2@D-P//5@D-P-P-DBL|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Norway winning by 19 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time for Peter to calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: Buy your own Coke, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, *I* did not misplay it|pg||
nt|pelu: and+18 = 18-12??|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator did|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfb: we will be back with second session in 75 min|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: all info  http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: results will be shown in the open table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill close this table now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: bye for now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: so maybe this is a play instead of bidding problem|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: thanks Debbie|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually 10-15 minute break between sets|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Joseph told Alex to play and Alex says please|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: okay they have left the table to go and compare back in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for my commentators|pg||
