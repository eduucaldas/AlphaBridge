pc|sJ|nt|cicus: probably key.card response so no slam|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: tht it might have ended up overboard the way the auction was going|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner wasn't going to raise to 4@S (which they should with 2) then hard to see how 4@S won't have at least 4 losers, whereas 4@D might be making.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are following play-off, 2 best teams from each group participating|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: well this should be a small gain for PD....  they all help|pg||
pc|s7|nt|shevek: as the cards lie, 4@h can be made, but hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|patricck: singleton Q@S is of course an unusual exception|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Good morning everybody - seems you have no commentators here :)|pg||
nt|doks: Hi all, better later than too late|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: not too late just 2nd board|pg||
mb|3C|an|natural, but could be very weak|mb|p|nt|kemperg: it was the @C decision|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5+4m and prec. EW placed by there system|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: I like 3@C in 1st at these colours|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And apologies to Ian who is surely doing a great job|pg||
nt|Walddk7: How about you?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: NS have slam on but difficult to reach even without the itnerference|pg||
nt|doks: I dont, but because minor pre in my system is constructive|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Walddk7: Welcome Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I coudn't possibly comment in case one of my partners is watching....|pg||
nt|doks: same hand with Major and ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: the contract should be the same|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk5: Semifinals now, 2 segments of 10 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H looks to me better than 3NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are on the 1st Baltic Cup - an event organized by Lithuanian bridge association - brilliant idea for this part of Europe!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Sveta:) Nice to comment with u again:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hi Frank! nice to meet you, too|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: If North bids 4@S now South is worth a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Yes, 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: same auction in OR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@c treats those suits as equal - do we agree?|pg||
nt|doks: S hand very good, AQ@C ok, short @D ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The initial 4@C shows a najor 2-suiter. When partner picks a majr and you bid the other one you show extra length and extra values|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At leas I do :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good treatment|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: I'm sure W is bidding  out his distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be no trouble making 6 on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  all declarer will have to do is time the @c ruff correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think Ian does too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I might double?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: South would not like the heart suit, but should think 'how much worse could I be?,|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|doks: 4@H not promise a single point, You have 4+ at least, so why not tell this to partner|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Thr trouble with double is that partner may pass when you have rather less defence than this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  @h to Q, @d to A and @h to J, then play 3 rounds of @cs and ruff|pg||
nt|patricck: 10 Imps to PD from Board 22, the difference is now 34|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: i wouldnt fancy this as declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I make it 800|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kemperg: will do that, they play well|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: absolutely correct line andy :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: B1 was as predicted max by @S EW. 50+50 made 3IMP|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: J@C may prove wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok since the 9 falls - but didnt need to be|pg||
nt|cicus: small @H now only way|pg||
nt|cicus: to create a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very difficult for the declarer for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: most hands are interesting - getting them right is difficult but instructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not done:)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd chance:)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ady: 10@S lead in CR   won by east  and a heart  south wone with ace and continued spades   east won and played a low diamond   and from there could not be beaten|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will be relieved|pg||

mb|p|nt|patricck: one day i'll learn to check before I start typing :(|pg||
nt|r_tibre: -1 only|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C=upgraded strong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Latvian guys use 4-cards major opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: no some kind of two suiter|pg||
nt|doks: 2@C precision style|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: G-DKR need to make a move soon|pg||
nt|patricck: so flat board and still 34 difference|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty, Daiva|pg||
nt|doks: do we know NS system? Its Polish club based?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes lithuanian pair play polish club 2club presicion|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h looks OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 4@s might have some chances here|pg||
mb|2N|an|6 clubs, stronger|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - major finesse wrong but clubs compensate|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2NT probably maximum with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|doks: over 2@D relay there are too many possible treatments|pg||
nt|doks: here 2NT show good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, but you possibly need to guess the Q@S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  either N or S should devaluate his hand and stop low - no any game in play here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzku: 7 top tricks now ..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if not such a vulnerability, 5@c could have been the best bid|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can there be to many treatments? :) The improtant thing is to discuss wjat you do with partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|shevek: west is already endplayed :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if @SK was at E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: only lead to make it|pg||
nt|kemperg: S bid 3@H ment as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: almost|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like a push - W has 7 top tricks and 2 more - natural came in majors |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, no, both are "real men" and @h A is only second, not third|pg||
nt|ntmon: 1@D seems to be Precision based - then N overbid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as I temember from yesterday, both these pairs we are following bid very acute. EW use 9-14 range openings on 1st level |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  only 1@c is strong|pg||
nt|ntmon: we shall see how many strong 1@C comes - contrary to load of dull balanced 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is North not able to bid @h?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Slam:)|pg||
nt|doks: Yes, basicaly discussions with partner|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East now regretting not doubling 2@D - but then they might not reach 3NT |pg||
nt|doks: @H never came into picture, sad news and deserved bad result|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here they had problems to read there cards good enough. OR had it easyer.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the play must be very fast here - nothing special|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And now East is happy that he did not doule|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W has only 13 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Wonder what put him off the 'obvious' spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
nt|doks: in this auction lucky lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, it's hard to imagine NS can do something|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|patricck: now, for sure|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|shevek: 11 imps to Shrikant|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  and, as a spec points out, 6@s is cold...just have to ruff one club|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: they may have lowered point count to be able to cope with nebulous 1@D more easily|pg||
nt|rodal f: The IMP came|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ianmcc: declarer praying @cQ drops|pg||

nt|ianmcc: bid what you can see|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: i myself prefer a help suit try|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ady: 9 tricks the limit   on heart guess|pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: but E said sorry to his partner after that board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: i prefer short suit tries, that would have worked well on the actual hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: Back to a easy one for all:)|pg||
nt|doks: Who vote for transfer to @C by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like "nothing to add" board - EW will definitely find a way to the game |pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: that blow will be difficult to recover|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, 13 imps to Shrikant after all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: One|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|kemperg: well deserved:)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|ntmon: East apparently did not believe in lead from such strong holding and did not play @h at all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: duck a diamond   defence may not switch to clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  N has a lot of work to do and defenders can establish @s tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: now we have another dynamic deal|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|patricck: the 3 card diamond support is key|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: easy to bid (I thought)|pg||
nt|patricck: really should have been enough to bid 7@D in this room as well|pg||
nt|shevek: operator , go 1 step back :)|pg||
nt|patricck: at the moment the 6@D by North is an error, will be by east|pg||
nt|shevek: give him another chance  lol|pg||
nt|shevek: why give up when you got the right answer, I dunno|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes more imps likely to I-VVU|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  but 3nt looks like normal contract and should be a push|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  with the E holding in trump and looking at dummy's @ds, I'm not sure I'd duck the J of @h|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

nt|andyv:  it's reflexive to duck, the A@h but I can't see where it's beneficial to do that.|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, we never got to that stage because Shrikant have just gained 11 on board 24|pg||
nt|patricck: so 6 to PD, but 11 to Shrikant and the lead is 39|pg||
nt|patricck: 41 even|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not so easy to overcome such a bad trump break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Chagas finess would be helpful, though playing for @h K onside is more obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good vul for sac|pg||
nt|rodal f: Need a @S lead for make EW down at 6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Udca for EW? At the lead @H/ came from E.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sfoxa:  but in practice they will rather land in 3NT, like next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  moreover, S has to get inspired for leading @s K after E opening|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: oic, only 1 down in 3 hearts for 4 imps..... busy typing and missed something in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: vuln multi|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H7|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  can't touch this|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: 8 imp to poddar :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  should win the A@c and play K@h|pg||
nt|shevek: 13 imps to Shrikant in bd 4|pg||
nt|ntmon: more and more 1NT openings including major 5-card appears nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, should be one more push after nornal @h lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Gudni  -  Janis and specs. |pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: hi :)|pg||
nt|doks: EW need stay very low here, no fit and only 22 points|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  with 15 points it became quite a rule|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|patricck: one would think so|pg||
nt|doks: lucky M position allows You take 9 triks on this lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems an ok sequence|pg||
nt|roswolf: @CJ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: everyone wonders about the meaning of 3@H even Mihov :) |pg||
nt|cicus: small club, deblock @CJ|pg||
nt|shevek: if the contract was 6@d that is|pg||
nt|ianmcc: This should play OK, hard to switch diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov said that it should offer partner a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: but even then @Ds can be played into the safe hand|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D could be made    but  needs luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 3 finesses ? :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: and @S break :)|pg||
nt|shevek: there are some problems with the comparison|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that should nail it for Shrikant|pg||
pc|c7|nt|shevek: 3NT has chances here|pg||
nt|ntmon: sometimes it may come to that 5-4 fit is lost|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if one opens 1 in major (with 15 points) and partner bids 1nt - what should be a rebid?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's a reason|pg||
pc|c9|nt|patricck: take the @C finesse now and claim|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but - indeed - if one opens 1nt with 5-card majors, partner can pass with 7-8 points and 4 cards in one's major. that's it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  pure guess for declarer - who has the 4th spade|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well... partner has discouraged spades, declarer is playing clubs, and those hearts in dummy rule out that suit, so....|pg||
nt|doks: @C are very reasonable alternative to make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: dont think heart finesse needed in a diamond contract the with spades easily set up|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|shevek: maybe take the @s finesse now|pg||
nt|patricck: very odd @H play in the other room that led to declarer going down|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessed right!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Bit funny to see the different 1@C openings at H1-2 and 3-4. A miss here.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: IF 1@C 2nd hand is 15-17|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: OR E opened 1@D and S bidded 1@H. Than a auto @H lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: not suggesting to be in a slam   but it can make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm they are matching the other room's contracts which is good tactics when holding a healthy lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: South decided not to take a trick - following granny's advice 'never win a trick till you know what to lead to the next one,|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: yes, I think declarer should've ducked the @h|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s will need a great deal of guts to keep in the match|pg||
nt|doks: now even 10 tricks available|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: they are discussing the board with a @C lead|pg||
nt|shevek: they did well to bid 6@h here|pg||
nt|shevek: very poor slam|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm....that is one way of looking at....I'd prefer to say that they were lucky to make an anti-percentage slam|pg||
nt|shevek: on the @h finesse and 3-2|pg||
nt|patricck: no, it isn't quite as bad as that because the @H pips give you extra chances|pg||
nt|patricck: K@H onside, or J10@H onside|pg||
nt|patricck: run the 9@H to begin with and then finesse the Q@H the second time|pg||

mb|2C|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||

nt|patricck: I don't think there is any way back for PD now, even if they bid the grand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: pass was also alerted|pg||

nt|kemperg: :))|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing lead - win in S & play on @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - establish a discard for a diamond and play a diamond to the king. Fingers crossed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: hand generator in Vilnius is still sleepy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  and 1NT - the most interesting contract from both (declarer's and defence's) point of view |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: How was the def at 3@S in the OR?. NS have 2.7@S on.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the best choice in red, but not forbidden by the Law :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it's might right by E.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well might be found|pg||
nt|ady: not a clear cut make|pg||
nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with him |pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: sorry no alert on pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each side is struggling for 7th trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|patricck: 57 to recover now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with such a weak hand, if E opens and opponents will play - the opening makes their life easy |pg||
nt|ianmcc: I don't see why North ran from 1NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As is pointed out, 1NT has pre-emptive value, and the alternative of 1@C is unattractive, and since they made 2@D how could anyone complain?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP for NS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to park his fourth @d or ruff it - lot of work, actually|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  if partner is stronmg enough, E will get his chance to bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Daiva? U are always forgiven. U with the hardest job here.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||

pc|s2|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  and this plan promotes second trump trick for W|pg||
nt|ntmon: but spectators don't like 1NT contracts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||
nt|patricck: There are vacant spaces issues which complicate the maths, but I'll take a stab at 43%|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree :), 6NT doubled looks better|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: ok, patrick I go with that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: so much for our analysis|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|patricck: after finding that South has only 1 spade and 2 hearts it should be easy to guess to finesse the Q@D that way|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Now cash @CJ and get off lead with a spade. leave declarer to open up new suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sfoxa:  and here defenders will get one more @d trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4IMP now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: South will be known to have 10 minor suit cards to North's 5 which essentially gives you 2 to 1 odds|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: without 3 cards in spade |pg||
nt|ady: problem is if 3T the contract  may be wrong sided|pg||
nt|kemperg: E could have been much stronger|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now E can be reluctant to introduce his @h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vuln isn't promising for NS, but N sees double fits in majors by EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: My lungh torpedo allready at work and the helicopter ready for that single on for S.|pg||
nt|doks: I see 14 points in W hand, so what is range for 1 NT in this position?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east compete as happened in the other room?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|cicus: some pair play that it evenpromises 3-card support as well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and when in with @HA he underled diamonds to the king and got a spade ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this sacrifice may well be made :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even 6@D was ok, but this should be a winner NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well thought out|pg||
mb|4H|nt|shevek: obviously was an error by operator|pg||
nt|shevek: but we don't know for sure what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *ok sac|pg||
nt|ntmon: italian players yesterday avoided such a style|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: just saw it on Vanderbilt vugraph|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like 4@D but i can see the temptation to bid it|pg||
nt|ady: looks 1 too high|pg||
nt|kemperg: wait for the 2nd @H have a signal|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't be an upgrade with @DKQ doubleton, so I guess 13-15 or 14-16|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: What do pass mean from E after W opened? A small "hum"?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Often it is better to bid 2/1 than prec.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT was more or less ral, at least|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *real|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  close to reality, so I would say|pg||
nt|ntmon: overbid forecast confirmed, but i attribute it to non-opening from S |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so am I|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  when partner opens, I'll have comfort with selling my hand, when opps open - I can hide the info|pg||
nt|ntmon: operator's locked again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: W is thinking|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|doks: 12-14 in 1st and 2nd position . I get a tip|pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, it is a maximum weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But then why is East inviting game? Protected by being a passed hand?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: might need to find @c10 next|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: three losers but one entry|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ntmon: thx :-)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||
nt|doks: nice switch|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|ady: both black aces right   but no more entries|pg||
nt|patricck: more imps for Shrikant here, they will certainly have a commanding lead going into the last set|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  good point be spectator: if W sells his hand as s two-suiter, EW may well find 5@h  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: That's what Kaubash did in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: wd|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Got an encouraging @D4 and underled|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, back in 10 mins or so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kemperg: no difference in 4@H|pg||
nt|r_tibre: a good time to thank the organisers, BBO, ROland, the VG team and the specs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: oh|pg||

nt|shevek: so, stick around for the 4th set everyone|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: so falling further behind|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|rodal f: NB. 9-14 with limited opening|pg||
nt|sfoxa:   7 may be very costly board, let's see |pg||
nt|ianmcc: should be 1NT here|pg||
mb|1D!|an|9-14 at least 2 diamonds|nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1 @d/@h/@s - 9-14|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Go to go to Iceland - enjoy the rest of this very interesting match :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: It has been 3 days of play so far ... so it is normal to be tired and misplay some deals|pg||
nt|andyv:  definite slam here|pg||
nt|andyv:  best is 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  precision 1C|pg||
nt|kemperg: yeh, and 2@S?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a xfer to @cs|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ritong: it was not a grand slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|rodal f: 15-17HP but to many @Ds|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr To good @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: on the last bord 1 diamond opening was with single K|pg||
nt|doks: thanks for company|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: cheers Liz|pg||
mb|r|mb|2C|nt|roswolf: yes fatigue is often a factor in teams of 4|pg||
nt|patricck: a shame that EW weren't penalised there, 4@H wouldn't have been pretty|pg||
nt|shevek: not sure about the bidding....|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. 5@D not Xed at OR.|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1@s Xfer to @h ? :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like better to X at N if any bid.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even pass looks more reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h by W|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|patricck: perhaps East, knowing that hos side has 31 Imps to recover threw in an early psyche to make things happen?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or any kind of crash bids after strong club opening|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. U can balance later as ure pard also will do if needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: very strange system :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: west intended to invite|pg||
nt|cicus: yes I often feel it already at board 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is ok with the heart finesse right|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. By 14 and could not open 1@C cauce unbananced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w in both games|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT a bit heavy, isn't it?|pg||
nt|ady: some entry problems   not knowing where spade honors are|pg||
nt|patricck: I fso it wouldn't have been clever to psche above your real suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: Shrikant had a 27imp lead after 1st session which they have maintained after the 2nd sesion|pg||
nt|patricck: If N/S bid 3NT it will need a @H lead to beat it|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT i mean|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm..... on 2nd thoughts my maths there is fairly bad :(|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|doks: maybe 2NT -1 open room not too bad, but 3@H too high|pg||
pc|c2|nt|patricck: A difficult situation to be in 49 behind with 14 to play|pg||
nt|rodal f: This time to strong for 1@C=15-17 again cauce the unbalance. They play a funny system.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: 2/1 for me and finito.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  claim should be made at trick one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck: 6@D does indeed have a chance, and a very lucky lie of the cards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: he has nine on top|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: but has to play for the hearts to come in|pg||
nt|patricck: AK@C and ruff followed by KQ@D and a spade to the Ace to draw the last trump|pg||
nt|patricck: then can just concede 1@S|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ritong: as long as @h are not 5/0, is a claimer|pg||
nt|ady: declarer content to take just 1 heart finesse  and clear the suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Devil and a @H?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|patricck: imps flying back and forth with each replay :)|pg||
nt|shevek: pity, was a good slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kemperg: @SA, then @H|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd prefer my partner returns a @d in such position. if I continue the suit after disaster in first trick, I should have a bold reason |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: another relatively straightforward hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  N was caught in squeeze|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|cicus: 3@D?|pg||

nt|rodal f: 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  cruel board - who plays - fails|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whom to stop where? This can cost for some.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does E dare to pass?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@h?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kemperg: no problem|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  S's turn |pg||
nt|ianmcc: however weak East may be West has very good support|pg||
nt|doks: S thinking of reopen?|pg||
nt|doks: better dont even think about |pg||
mb|d|an| |mb|p|nt|patricck: both 2@D and 2@S are fairly straightforward|pg||
nt|shevek: respect for partner here?|pg||
nt|patricck: the only real partscore accident comes in 1NT which can be beaten with K@S A@D and 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome Rajesh :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: we skipped strong club :-(|pg||
nt|ianmcc: to the rescue|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kemperg: 1@S normal in precision?|pg||

nt|patricck: 2@D loks like it might be manageable tho|pg||
nt|r_tibre: uphill task for PD from here on|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if N's pass means @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT came. Well done.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that may be the best spot for NS|pg||

mb|3D|nt|andyv:  not really|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: or actually it doesnt|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1st second 1@C=15-17 and at 3rd 4th its 18+|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: There are 6 possible losers, but declarer should be able to either ruff a club or pitch one on a dimaond|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  even if playing 4 card majors, very little to be gained by bidding 1@s|pg||

nt|shevek: agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  though, not low enough )))|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sarkar_suk: i think they r playing precession :)|pg||

nt|ianmcc: this looks like making|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  they are|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1st - 2nd hand they also have 12-14HP so might 5cards after 1NT.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was slow by my thinking again, as I use to be normaly|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 12-14 at non vul and 15-17 at vul|pg||
nt|rodal f: Glad u specs don't arrest me but updated now. Or? Tell me if wrong.|pg||
nt|ntmon: anyway, good effort|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|doks: play on @C and 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ianmcc: South must finesse @c into West|pg||
nt|doks: can play @CA for sinleton K drop or 3-2 and K in W hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: That will help specs.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW will score several imps in this board, but the end result isn't clear - 10 next board to come|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: OK  but he upgraded the hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Better to get the lead from E at def, but still same result?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: partner can't have @DK + @CQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: they always alert 1 diamond|pg||
nt|doks: Not the winning start for Bumerangas, they need IMPs at every deal|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a chance perhaps for the trailing team - although perhaps the red card was in order|pg||
nt|ady: n/s would have some play for 3NT on better minor splits|pg||
nt|r_tibre: easy 10 tricks here in @Ss|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last board of the first match of the 1st Baltic Teams Cup|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4nt is a clear overbid imo|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzku: bad trump break .. |pg||
nt|roswolf: and as west i would have axed|pg||
nt|cicus: could not have doubled thenbid 3@C?|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: and a bad lead :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: and still may gain a few imps|pg||
nt|ritong: well pard doubled 1@s|pg||
nt|ritong: chances are high, if not certain that he has a 4+ minor|pg||
nt|cicus: of course I don't think that double will make the textbooks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A standard to come after the 11-14NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so contemporary bridge looks like - W opening and E bid could have been horror for one's granny|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW landed in their best spot, all in all|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Daiva, thank you for your work - keep trying - lot of matches are coming :)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  and standard lead beating it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: even then, S got carried off|pg||

nt|kemperg: see if 4 suit is gameforcing|pg||
nt|doks: kind of, but differen from other pair|pg||
nt|ianmcc: magic 4@h with @h9 dropping|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  looks like EW playing 2 way NM|pg||
nt|kemperg: no:)|pg||
nt|doks: in modern approach 5422 is normal for 1NT, but I dont like it with 2-2 in Majors|pg||
pc|c5|nt|r_tibre: on a forcing defence, S can plan to ruff out all @Cs|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  that may result in 10 tricks only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, no, 11 as well. so, a push for the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bought at the MOL?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: She have been suveren as you Sveta:)|pg||
nt|doks: and other possibility for S is bid 3@S Smolen, showing longer @H|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I don't like it at all but am not modern|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Could an other system make the NT end at E? For 9?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lunch break after this match and the 3rd round in approx. 2 hours|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  2@c forced 2@d which W could have passed or start of invite sequence... here, W invited in @hs and E declined.|pg||

nt|ianmcc: up to 8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: claiming|pg||

nt|ianmcc: one more @c pitching @s then @dQ testing|pg||
nt|ianmcc: East would need to unblock @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: we have long 10 boards - both sides thinks alot after each trick|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: not 3 imps |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  even when strong NT in the system, W opens 1@c, E bids 1@s and W rebid is rather 1nt, than 2@c|pg||

pc|h2|nt|hawe45: Her we have a very long way to 9 tricks, and the defence started well by leading a @H. West will come in - and fire back a "H|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: 4 soades made in CR    trump lead best|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe I should drop commentating here - North is one of my (few) very good friends|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once again - 1NT - the most interesting to play/defend?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: 3NT best here, 4@S can be beaten with 2 @H ruffs|pg||
nt|ntmon: South has found invitational values?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, I'm wrong with my prediction - S hopes for the best and invites... what for?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|r_tibre: yes.. easy 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: inspired raise by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it seems clear to me .. a fit and a void and partner is 15+ :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then it must be a good one. |pg||
nt|hawe45: Risky from North - Ace-King in partners singleton controls the suit - with wasted values|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  fortunately for declarer, a club ruff would not hurt as it would be done with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes andy :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: played by E they would lose first 3 tricks and then no problems|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  feeling underbid from previous board?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: System at level 4 ain't my road|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C tell?|pg||
nt|hawe45: East MUST discard a @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2NT is even more interesting! |pg||
pc|d4|nt|shevek: yes, he fought the Law, Patrick :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but even DF would rather fail|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see human factor in action|pg||
nt|ntmon: it's too easy to tell the contract has no play - everything can happen|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly! that's why - let's wait :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  errare humanum est - this proverb suits very well to the bridge table happening|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to CK|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: so I would probably start with @D J and if wins, play a club to hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  very natural line, agree|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i guess dec will go after black suits in some order|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S 3 will be missed later on...!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Daiva and Hand + specs. back|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Hans:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Double dummy, North should have taken the @C Ace and play the @S Queen|pg||
nt|doks: making 9 now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45: Must be splinter with unknown singleton|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzbz: Contract sold on lead - Arun is thinking asking Ramavtar some Quest|pg||
nt|kemperg: he found a good line|pg||
nt|doks: but 1NT never in real danger, so big damage|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hawe45: With the @S 3-discard, North can take 4 @S, 2 @H, 1 @D and 2 @C = 9, game OK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do that at the table is hard. Might a flat one?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|doks: no big damage|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c3|nt|ritong: i certainly would be scared to pass and display this dummy|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzku: very well done at the other table .. Karaivanov put S in hand with 2 of @S|pg||

nt|ntmon: but EW found 300 nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: and imps flying around :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|patricck: An annoying layout for 3NT NS..... 9 tricks but no way to take them|pg||
nt|hawe45: Looks like Ekran-conv = majors and weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|r_tibre: indeed.. @D 3-3 means 9 tricks at @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Should lead to a part-score in @S N/S|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|andyv:  N should bid 2@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: 140 should be easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 6@D on @S finese or even better from E hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|hawe45: 2 @H non-forcing obviously|pg||
nt|xenya: a 50% 6@D here|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hawe45: For sure, West will bid 3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: taking the money in 4@C doubled was the best option, 4@H may lose 2@S, 1@D and 1@C, not to mention the @H situation|pg||
nt|patricck: An easy decision for Choti really.... he would feel sure that the chasing team will be bound to try 3NT on his hand, so he wants to do the same thing|pg||
nt|psyck: pass may have been better than 2@c, assuming it was precision style|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, much better by E, Janis |pg||
mb|4C!|nt|hawe45: - but not now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: *than 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  E seems to be optimistic - hoping for 4cards-spade by partner  |pg||
nt|ianmcc: beter than that. If @hA rises could throw @s and xruff?|pg||
nt|xenya: right -- it is cold as the cards lie|pg||
nt|doks: if @HA hold, yousimply play on @S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes|pg||
nt|doks: but if You lead trump, rise with @HA and trump back, You need eastablish @S for last @C discard|pg||
nt|xenya: and i strongly suspect they will get there|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not time. We'll see|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzku: a truly beauty|pg||
nt|shevek: easy to fing the @hJ now....|pg||
nt|patricck: very true, but there are 4 losers without that|pg||
nt|ntmon: 2@H = hoping for wonders|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT alerted, maybe this promise @S?|pg||
nt|doks: so 6@D bid and...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: might make 140|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oho!|pg||
nt|hawe45: This can be one down on an end-play - otherwise 2 down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2 down from the start - with 2 @d ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: hand 13  whwere 620 score in 4@S  CR  seems an error to   watched the movie   play siimilar to here    cant work out how 10 tricks eree claimed|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the mighty deuce :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes, wonderful|pg||
nt|hawe45: It seems, that North has  values, showed by bidding 3 @C (Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit cosy. Many love 12-14 at 4th hand here. A nice one. I'm to old by my 17Y 421M and like the 15-17 from N|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: no 1nt al least 10 points and one 5 card major|pg||

nt|shevek: yes, looks like one off|pg||
nt|hawe45: Friendly match - no double|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  seems so. but thes S should try to find 3nt contract, rather - asking partner for @s stopper|pg||

pc|s7|nt|hawe45: 4 @C is always 3 down, better bid 5 for one down|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  even after endplay, 2 down is expected - E will give ruff and discard, but EW take 2 @h tricks all in all|pg||

nt|rodal f: Ups.|pg||

nt|rodal f: What was the reason that N didn't play more @H?|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - 200|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ady: nice end play for 11 th trick if west leads a minor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: sadly i will not get no pigeon i m sure:)|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45: To defeat this, you must duck with the @C King, I´m sure|pg||
nt|doks: after @C lead 7 top tricks and lot of possibilities for 8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: low spade lead in CR   so 11 tricks off the top as minors are|pg||
nt|cicus: after seeing @Ds 3-3 he may try @CAK then @S finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: For the @S kill to kome?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *come|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can duck. Can take it and play @S etc|pg||
nt|hawe45: You must play @S to defeat 4 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: It seems, that Godun puts his money on trumps 3-2 and @C King by West|pg||

mb|d|nt|hawe45: Wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  after @s lead, both 3NT and 6@c need 2-2 club split, or club guess with single honour by W. so I do prefer to go down in a small slam, not in game|pg||

nt|hawe45: Do not understand the double - has no tricks at all|pg||

nt|rodal f: At least the A will come next time.|pg||
nt|psyck: or the hand with longer @h not having longer @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 4-4 @h split makes 3NT looking better |pg||
nt|psyck: though, in some case they may switch from 1 major to anoth|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: Mihov is not intimidated|pg||
nt|doks: NS start axing all contracts|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: 3@S rise by no cards and EW in to a force pass variant? This they need to dicuss|pg||
