mb|1S|nt|sybarra: not sure how high anyone will get here |pg||
nt|sybarra: W likely to bid 3 @S,  then waht |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is likely to expect the queen of @H to pull more weight|pg||
nt|granguru: if @H is opened soon enough|pg||
nt|granguru: from S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: 3 nt not a great success|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we agree that u2 are right:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friggi|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S can be beaten just in 1 way|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sold free from the MOL|pg||
nt|granguru: @D lead and small @H from W..N must guess|pg||

nt|psyck: very, just @s fin & @d finesses alon not enuf|pg||
mb|4C|nt|friggi: sure under 20%|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: south will probably stay low club KQ often useless and no help in p suits.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: still have 3rd @s & 4th @d to take care of, & problems ion trump lead|pg||

nt|jbennet: to on souths hand at this stage would be an insult. |pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|psyck: ha can make as cards are, if he reads it right|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psyck: fairly common to try aggresive leads in little slams|pg||
nt|friggi: but he has to play E for Jx in @D|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was very unlikely to get that, though as he can see communication problems, it was a likely line|pg||
nt|friggi: now he needs to play W for @CA|pg||
nt|jbennet: at least justice will be served (unless east lead back a club).|pg||
nt|psyck: he played for @d33 & 1 or 2 honors in basically|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|jbennet: lol.|pg||

nt|friggi: home run|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Down 1 doubled is the best bridge :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he was not doubled |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs did well to stay low on that dangerous deal, I presume there will be some larger figures somewhere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so maybe we say great bridge :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see, N-S 1@D opening is really a "catch all"|pg||
nt|rodal f: ormal tp bid game EW but will fail.|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Joe:)  welcome |pg||
mb|1C!|an|Prec.|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@h will likely make here, 3NT more comfortable|pg||
nt|sybarra: both pairs play precision |pg||
mb|2C|an|Nat. GF, 5+!C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Their 2@C opening shows both minors. |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|psyck: Strong @c styles popular in Iceland|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we have a great operator,  with super alerts and explanations |pg||
nt|santyclz: Great, a simple natural system (in some of it's 22,534 varieties).|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said earlier, re precision, "i know just enough to be dangerous" |pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzdh: A wise pass from West, as 3@D make easily|pg||
nt|granguru: @D neg 1@S second neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Ahalim|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sverrir thinking|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Sorry, I see it is Arifin|pg||
nt|psyck: Helped them win the Bermuda Bowl once, in 1995 i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well stopped|pg||
nt|granguru: 1991 |pg||
nt|psyck: thx|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahalim: np :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: In some versions 2@h would have been an asking bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz: "Natural and asking"|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 off the top here (with @D hook),  looks like best place |pg||
nt|sybarra: spades favorable so maybe 10 |pg||
nt|sybarra: N may not be inclined to play nt however |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: 4@H looks OK with both minor suit Kings well placed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It's past my bedtime|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you might scrape home 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 6 however |pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 of 3 finesses on, a real Roland slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No, it requires good news in @S and @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is why it is a Roland slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Roland would make 7, with KJx onside in @D :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|santyclz: But of course.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|sybarra: not a lot of entries to declarers hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: in NT |pg||
nt|santyclz: So if you're gonna take the @d finesse...|pg||
nt|sybarra: now or never? |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: It was a odd numberJohn.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which, of course, you don't need any more.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andreasw:  yes.. he know N-S is vull and problebly stands better in 3@d so no reason to dbl them out of a bad score:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|granguru: they made a relay @C which could describe precisely 99% of the hands .all 13 cards|pg||
nt|granguru: distribution I mean|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence might score 3 trump tricks for a set !|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzdh: A @S now kills the contract|pg||

mb|6D|nt|psyck: all players aggresive here apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: they might play on "momentum"|pg||
nt|friggi: very much so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|friggi: very agressive bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: another poor judgement call. |pg||
nt|jbennet: he opened the bidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: 3@s at unfav was a bit of a stretch, but understandable, & it worked well in pushing opps overboard|pg||
nt|jbennet: then bid freely on 4 level in a mionor (giving up chances for 3NT).|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: 3@H opening and 3@S balancing is likely|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was to young in 1991. Only 17Y 176M|pg||
nt|granguru: After it there were some exciting  systems Relay precision by danielson Ultimate club by Granovetter, rubin et al|pg||
nt|psyck: being able to show 19-20 instead of 20-21 in a standard method sure helped last deal|pg||
mb|1D!|an|Prec.|mb|p|mb|2C|an|GF|nt|hawe45: 4 @S is the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S @C opening includes all 11-14 balanced, can have 5-card Major !|pg||
nt|granguru: we were all very young in 1991 I was 45|pg||
nt|sybarra: the catch all 1 @D |pg||
mb|4S|an|GF :)|nt|sybarra: lol|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psyck: I was in college then :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 45? months?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: dbl from Hrólfur?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see a X in his hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: At this vulnerability, South has maximum defence, so double by North is hard to find|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: some of the world champios are playing this tourney|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would have put NF  for alert |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||

nt|granguru: what was 2@C I wonder|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ahalim: N has not enough tricks imo|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to start @h|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: suit prefs on 2nd @d if played would get it rite for them|pg||
nt|rodal f: checkback?|pg||
nt|granguru: Gazzilli most probable|pg||
nt|granguru: 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: convention - either 16+ or @s and @c|pg||
nt|psyck: upside down carding for EW looks like|pg||
nt|granguru: well got 1/2 of the agreement right|pg||
nt|psyck: a more complicated version than Gazzilli maybe, hexa sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to handle the @d loser and the @H's |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely as the the cards the sit  |pg||
nt|santyclz: No overtricks, precision bidding as advertised.  In this case playing the 4-4 wouldn't bring an o/t.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahalim: or hoping @C J will drop|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sensible @sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: @sQ is an entry, @s return gives a trick|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes he is hoping for 5@C tricks and 2 @D tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: esp with that club suit |pg||

nt|sybarra: *if any |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He should ruff a @S and then play 3 @D from the top|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to see |pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there a rule in Iceland that all team names must start with "G"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Get the defence to open @H or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: that cuts him in half|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Stefán lays his cards down thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that declarer got a favourable lead and favourable trump layout and is still 1 off supports my opinion on the 4@S bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: He has the @h9, can just double-finesse.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bit funny. Non asked what 1NT ment at last board. |pg||
nt|sybarra: of course was playing agst Grant Thornton|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is very likely to be the standings link:   http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||

nt|sybarra: back to 20 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: whoever bids @H first =in trouble |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Quite unusual 2@H opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5/4 muiderberg or something? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Weak, with exactly 5@H and should be 2-3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: probably because they play a relay system|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Many use the same at 2/1. At the edge by 5HP and 3@S by the 2/1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sybarra: roaring into 4 @S now if my guess |pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: Ambitious - 200|pg||
nt|granguru: things returning to normality|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Exsept that a color is lost EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  why 200?|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - it´s too late - one down then|pg||
nt|granguru: both pairs have found their fits|pg||
nt|granguru: W pass showed continuous suits|pg||
nt|granguru: so 2@H shows @H and @S|pg||
nt|granguru: Therefore it was alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 2NT too far|pg||
nt|psyck: A form of twisted swine defense after weak NT-(x)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not going to be a successful double (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A bit tempting, knowing you have at least 21 HCP and massive control of all suits except trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Note that South also knows pd has 2@S !|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: 3NT even further|pg||
nt|sybarra: does E bid  2 nt now?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahalim: 3NT EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: should be a routine @s game here|pg||

pc|s2|nt|psyck: I used to play Twisted Swine when I used Precision & weak NT, mostly play 2/1 now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru: as u see here names overlap on the bidding square|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahalim: would you have bid 1NT w the E hand ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure there are relays here,  I just dont know them |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, relaying. Seems to end in 3NT with 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: a rather more simple auction at the other table |pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45: Depends on, what the re-bid of 2 NT shows|pg||
nt|sybarra: (for specs, put cursor over open room results under West and see auction)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Oddur reasonably is thinking about 5 or 6 @D rather than 3 nt|pg||
nt|psyck: Some I know like to play Prec when NV & 2/1 vul, an interesting style...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|granguru: so that they cant be caught in 1NTx with 12-14|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|granguru: vul vs not|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, part of the reason, also when you are nv & opps vul, they will not interferse so easily over your relays, several other reasons for it probably|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that @H2 was showing @Cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that disappeared for me, maybe changed, as we see to +3 |pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzdh: After a @C lead, finessing @D will be too dangerous|pg||

mb|2N|nt|ianmcc: do they play the same system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: both play standard but differently|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like asking|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather important to have an agreement about this auction with your partner.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now 3 @D may be pass or correct also|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ianmcc: I suppose I meant the opening 2s|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Obious pass I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too |pg||
nt|sybarra: fixed and hope you beat them enough|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law of total points|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: so there!|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@ss has  play in spite of the distribution with the QJ doubleton in @cs and the @Ha onside.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@S probably make, because of the nice @C layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And over that, West has to decide between Pass, Double and 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the bidding not sure anyone has confidence @H ace is on side |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 2@h not normal contract|pg||
nt|psyck: Spec suggest 1@d 4+ cards for them & hence they cannot open such min balanced hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1NT is 12-15|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s can be beaten with a @h ruff, but it's not a direct one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: We are playing with screens, South and West are sitting on one side, so North and East don't know who is thinking so much|pg||
nt|santyclz: @h, @h and @d when in with the @sa for your ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They actually both are|pg||
nt|sybarra: both players went to sleep maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: temtpting for W....... |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, a game could be made either direction|pg||
nt|sybarra: W is on lead in this hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: From West's point of view, give partner 1-1 in blacks and game is on|pg||
nt|sybarra: in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North has a huge maximum for his bidding, because 3@S here is not inviting game|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont count on pard for perfect hand,  He never has it !  (someone famous said that) |pg||
mb|5D|nt|psyck: guess they do not play Drury either|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normal lead from S after a @S opening always @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: or maybe an different form of it :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This should be down quickly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North probably downgraded his hand after the double of 2@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: spade lead will not be good for declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  a clear 1@D in my system by S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way South or even me would lead a heart on this auction |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good lead by South, knowing that his partner was prepared to pass a 2@S reply to Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And that declarer is not particularly scared of a @H lead|pg||
nt|friggi: @S was pretty obvious lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: my aunt minnie would not lead a @H given E saying he has that suit,   |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Considering that 3NT made in the open room, East was doomed on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: @d would restrict them to 8 tricks though as likely to fin @s|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s could well make on normal @h lead though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: trumps!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure we are playing here yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok now we are|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzdh: I would have opened 1@D too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But the fact that the 1@C opening can include a 5 card major does it that they are more strict on the point count|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzdh: I think they "only" open with 11 balanced if they have a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: The tempo needed for EW|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|psyck: can even make 4 by dropping @s now, @hA lead & @d switch would have been reqd to ensure no 10 tricks double dummy|pg||

nt|jbennet: that has nothing to do with it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@s is hard work|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@H would not have been my choice of opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: More like a choice between 3 and 4 @H|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c-(x) would not be neg there, playing typical the twisted swine style sequences anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: E opened this a 10-12 nt in the other room and n took the short route to 4@s.|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4@H actually make on this one, but quite impossible to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Norths underbid worked well|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|psyck: nice, thanks Gudni|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: 2@d good raise & 3@h asking for stopper|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4n is 1 stopper tooo many :)|pg||
nt|psyck: S wondering whether to pass, or maybe if 5@d would be nat or rkc response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: not easy to defend|pg||
nt|psyck: esp with the 1@s response|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear for W to show suit pref if @hA lead either, even if his card would be SP|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzzh: NS tell opp that some misunderstandings in bidding|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|psyck: EW will ask they what they meant by each of their bids then|pg||
nt|psyck: 7 a little too mild a SP|pg||

nt|psyck: hmmm, would be correct to do so b4|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|psyck: a little higher @h may have acted as an alarm clock but not clear for E to do so|pg||
nt|psyck: if N took 3@h as @s fit, he nay have meant 4N as rkc in @s|pg||

mb|1H|nt|andreasw:  Ok so im back seing S did not find the @c lead :)|pg||
nt|psyck: a hand designed to get one overboard|pg||
nt|santyclz: I lived in Bergen county 30 yrs ago and uses to play against Marty and his "Guideline" (which never failed to get a rise.)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahalim: sry bid|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rodal f: A possible swing to come?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: borderline between 2@d & x, with a passed pd, i prefer x as it give more spots to play in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: dislke X , improves West|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And here we have a slam that is very hard to beat, needing a trump lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a chance for GA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looks like E-W will score some undertrick IMPs here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|santyclz: I called it the Guideline Of Total Tricks so you could say "mein Gott" when it worked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is bidding very slowly with his @D monster|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He will hardly find out about partners @H stopper from now on|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|psyck: also, i like my 2 level minor overcalls to be six carders|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  even with a trump lead it should win... .. |pg||
nt|andreasw:  6@s now on the weak hand .. goos thing it does not matter here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good*|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahalim: after this board we'll have a new leader|pg||
pc|h3|nt|santyclz: Not a successful bidding plan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I might have opened 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If not, then bidding 2 or 3 @H next round to ask for stopper|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzdh: Tough hand to bid, the fact that South showed a positive hand for @H might actually push them to 7 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But I doubt North will take such a guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: A much better contract than that reached in the open room, where they demonstrated that this *is* a down-side to transfer advances.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
