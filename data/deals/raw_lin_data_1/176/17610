mb|r|nt|hedyg: sry, back|pg||
nt|hedyg: they started before the CR finished|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D    the safest game|pg||

nt|ianmcc: except grey hair|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: haha|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this one is 20-20 game a stretch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a keep out of trouble hand to start with|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi John :) |pg||

nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may need these,  since this is "not standard" |pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a horrible bunch of misfits - not us - the hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be us also LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: best if all stay low |pg||
nt|sybarra: I would open N hand  |pg||
nt|sybarra: ak, a|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Strong club for N-S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Daniela|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Bob, Bill and Andy|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Good evening |pg||
nt|psyck: we have the 2nd & 3rd place teams here: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|granguru: ciao a tutti|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@d on EW|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@D w/o  a @C lead...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kiwibridge: I enjoyed watching Braithwaite & Richman|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hawe45: N/S can make a very lucky 3 NT here, but hardly bid it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S or 5@D |pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi all|pg||
nt|daman: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: 4H is fair (but down)...vulnerable I'd definitely want to be there|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: can NS really make 3nt? how do they get to dummy to finesse diamonds?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT would be my (bad resulting) bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is -1, but I think they will take a sacrifie - which will make|pg||
nt|rv: Please access http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for running scores|pg||
nt|granguru: 3N or 5@d is an easy task to fullfil|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|woozle: Buchen might very reasonably drive to game here, particularly considering the hands that this pair haven't overcalled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now what?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be played doubled? |pg||
nt|psyck: 1N=@c or puppet to @c i guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe in spades, given time :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S Jack is the entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: - but I said: VERY lucky|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt might be some either/or bid - those are sort of the norm after strong club|pg||
nt|athene: so clubs or something else, maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning all|pg||
nt|bobholl: typical screen wait :)|pg||
nt|psyck: @d's put to sleep|pg||
nt|rv: huge surprise Lavazza out of contention|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|granguru: N Asks for majors|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|athene: many people play the overcall in responder's suit as natural here - but not by a passed hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobholl: strong enough for one try ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning - and it is another sunny morning in dublin - can we take all this good weather|pg||
nt|rv: yes sunny in Dublin and wet in Bangalore good for resp regions:)|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome to see some of the best players in Italy - and in the world|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcomyn: source of tricks very scarc e here|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 @D should end the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, could be a suction variant with @c or red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: and getting scarcer|pg||
nt|sybarra: was typing,  "not sure this is success either"|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @D is jumping into fire |pg||
nt|sybarra: (out of frying pan)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: best to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|athene: @SJ not an entry for trump finesse playing in diamonds :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  may not have to try anymore|pg||
nt|bobholl: double all pass :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes   we are very lucky to see this match|pg||
nt|granguru: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: Hi John|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will be defeated - with the @S-ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45: - not any longer|pg||
nt|athene: now he can just play ace and a diamond, lose @SAK, @DK, @CA|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sybarra: and its "good luck pard" with a smile |pg||
nt|jcomyn: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 1 down with 5@d cold!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Henry!|pg||
nt|henryb:  I wonder why West did not raise diamonds|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s lead?|pg||
nt|rv: East won't find inspired @SJ lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4S bid is very loose, and possibly down more than one|pg||
nt|ianmcc: rescue|pg||
nt|woozle: Likely phantom|pg||
nt|jcomyn: would you?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Fabio Carugati|pg||
nt|rv: on this auction, there is case for leading @sj instead of @C since you have no entry and best to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Fabio, I will seriously consider @SJ lead|pg||
nt|caruga: hi all, the weather is not so good here in Northern Italy....let's hope|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I certainly would since no suggestion declarer or responder have spades|pg||
nt|rv: did the weather affect Lavazza?|pg||
nt|caruga: is possible :)|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer can make this contract by playing @HJ and rising with @CA if West wins and continues @C|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how about kibs any spade leaders out there|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: but close to down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: only way the contract might go down is spade shift and then try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|athene: East's double just showing a good hand i think?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|daman: this seems like a decent contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: right John!  this can not be worse  (only 50's) |pg||
nt|psyck: S will have to provide an entry to dec hand for @c fin|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: it is easier for East to lead a @s from shortness here since partner has most of values and odds on to hold 4+@s|pg||
nt|athene: this is a swift clam|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: then @DK overruff, @S ruff|pg||
nt|athene: claim :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: Sometimes I think dbl is used very bad instead of supporting|pg||
nt|caruga: Paolo Uggeri is a very imaginative player but the first board in rama......|pg||
nt|rv: now 1 down again|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle: diamond, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff, club or heart to come (if the defense don't cash the HA the heart runs away...if they do, two clubs run away)|pg||
nt|granguru: yes, for the ones who are asking...WE ARE watching the bridge legenda|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: 2@cs + 2@D and 2@hs|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s very limited in range...3-7 hcp which may be reason for lack of try by S...W's balance will not meet with teammate approval|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: playing 4@C no risk on card play playing for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S can not find his parner entry for a ruff but might try it |pg||
pc|d3|nt|jameslee 2: claim  for 10 not 11 should be |pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: but fall of @CQ ought to change declarer's mind|pg||
nt|rv: Franchi did have a tough play problem even on favorable @c lead, to play for either @SK right or hope for right @HT guess and 4-4 @cs|pg||
nt|granguru: hi |pg||
nt|rv: he didn't take a very unreasonable line |pg||
nt|rv: Hi John|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Plaut|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why not pressure w|pg||
nt|granguru: namaste|pg||
nt|caruga: hi, ciao|pg||
nt|athene: yes, indeed - west's first name is "THE"|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito Garozzo, born in September 1927|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok David you lead a @c when your pd asks for @s :)|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong club|mb|1H|mb|p|an| |nt|ady: but a weak hand opposite   |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: not right now...  looks like i'll be buying a small condo...  100-120k|pg||

nt|woozle: On a good, day, 4H NS might make ten tricks. This is not a good day.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spec points out that East's low @d was spot on|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: first board and last board are the killers for keeping concentration|pg||
nt|athene: the ones in between, they are hard too|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  -800 usually not what you expect when opps are not in game|pg||
nt|athene: i think that possibly east should bid 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: the point being it's very likely his partner might balance disastrously|pg||
nt|athene: east is a passed hand - how bad can 3@C be?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just with benefit of hindsight|pg||
nt|andyv:  but in imps, is there a reason for W to balance?|pg||
nt|andyv:  poor quality suit, and, except for 6th @h, the hand is balanced|pg||
nt|athene: well the hand does go to prove one point which is that just because opps have stopped low, doesn't mean it's safe to come in|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, the severity was pretty extreme|pg||
nt|psyck: unlikely S would try pd entry with all hcp marked though|pg||
nt|rv: early summer rains have really cooled temperature here in Bangalore|pg||
nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|granguru: end april time is like ending the summer...not so cold not so warm...|pg||
nt|daman: so*|pg||
nt|daman: with another entry in dummy|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry was the other way|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo´s partner is around 45/47 years nice guy|pg||
nt|athene: he might downgrade to 1nt - 4333, poor spot cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: fantoni nunes defended better as usual in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: so -2!|pg||
nt|athene: but still should have been a much bigger swing|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D was cold|pg||
nt|athene: it's almost always safer to act aggressively earlier rather than pass and back in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 4@h on EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  good thing E-W missing 2 aces. otherwise W might drive to a no-play slam|pg||
nt|athene: but still it is an 18 and not that bad an 18|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i agree with 1nt here|pg||
nt|athene: now it's usual to treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|sybarra: dealer having fun today?|pg||
nt|athene: at the point he won the second club|pg||
nt|hawe45: 3 NT better be played by East - only @D-lead brings trouble|pg||
nt|pelu: but he need to discard a@D on @s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: they have a higher range for their 2NT opening I assume|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1 @S denies 4 sp |pg||
nt|athene: but that was a particularly tough one |pg||
nt|psyck: no problems in 4@h with trump breaking if they can get there|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Kristina have we got our vugrapher around to ask for any doubts?|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't know, we can try :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi Jeff|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Jeff|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi again Krishna:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract |pg||
nt|jcomyn: h nicely placed|pg||
nt|athene: but Versace wants to get both majors into it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s too|pg||
nt|kemperg: specialy with the bad 4 and good 6|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: heading for trouble|pg||
nt|caruga: is this a strong club?|pg||
nt|rv: Cossu's pass says I want to play here?|pg||
nt|daman: yes   the discard would be necessary|pg||
nt|granguru: fantoni nunes range is diff|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|athene: 1@C is natural (ish) and 14+|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: West not worth 2 bids|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so 1NT shows 4 s then?|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me look for sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: hitting the deck again? |pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just a natural game force|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: he knows E opened 1 @C a "good hand" |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead and heart back, ducked|pg||
nt|athene: if NS find that you call the director|pg||
nt|hawe45: and the police|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D control & slam prop that N will decline |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|fann4: Not good to have North playing it.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 tricks could be claim soon after 2 round @H |pg||
nt|rv: I play pass here by West says I want to play in 1@d XX|pg||
nt|granguru: thats the top level meaning|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: I'm told 3@c was transfer last deal, that makes sense|pg||
nt|psyck: Common to play transfers after intervention|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H = 2/2 help to make contract easy |pg||
nt|caruga: me too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: me three|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: they play transfer responses so 1@S response would be limited with no major|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt stronger than 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|athene: basically if anyone has not seen NS before, they play an unusual system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a fast claim I hope|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri-Cossu possibly play it differently|pg||
nt|granguru: I must confess that I agree with it but at the table I use my instinct|pg||
nt|rv: why not lead @sK?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ianmcc: the vul got him|pg||
nt|athene: fairly strong, forcing 1 level bids|pg||
nt|athene: 14+ or thereabouts|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: 2-level bids are 10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that @d suit is never mentioned.|pg||
nt|athene: so after the 1-level openers, responder can force to game on ten counts|pg||
nt|athene: and they can set up a game force quickly and often|pg||
nt|bobholl: guessed east would lead red but this is better|pg||
nt|athene: normally you would prefer to have the lead running up to a strong notrump rather than through it|pg||
nt|athene: but here the red tenaces are protected at least|pg||
nt|bobholl: will be so !|pg||
nt|henryb:  At my local club :) there would be two pairs in 5@h and at least one in a partial|pg||
nt|henryb:  also, probably, one in 3N|pg||
nt|athene: very nice breaks, nice honour mesh - game is there but hard to get to with no great fit|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good spot|pg||
nt|sybarra: spades might have been @D,  I am still chedking |pg||
nt|daman: the @H 10 is nice to have|pg||
nt|pelu: 8 toptrick and with @h10 S can setup a @D trick|pg||
nt|granguru: but it used to be 20-22|pg||
nt|kemperg: 21-22 on the CC|pg||
nt|granguru: for you to remember all 1 openings are 14+ hcp|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: I'm all for supporting with support, but West's 4D looks excessive with the secondary misfit|pg||
nt|athene: worth pointing out that if north at any points found the @H7 lead(and south had not led the suit) and declarer plays the king, south has to duck|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see 52 cards the 8 is so obvious :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: good question|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: very common to duck the first round if you have AJx(xx) over KQx|pg||
nt|athene: keep communications open|pg||
nt|rv: when God has give you KQJ, you lead it:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could make to min the loss|pg||
nt|hawe45: 9 tricks without the @S-guess|pg||
nt|athene: you wait for partner to get in again and everything is happy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45: South thinking - telling: I do NOT have the @D Ace...|pg||
nt|athene: what is south thinking about? his partner can't have @HQ left can he?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i second that|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo used to win many world championships with Forquet, belladonna, Avarelli, DAlelio and PabisTicci|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|granguru: 1NT is weak 12-14 permits 5M 6m332 or semisolid suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|granguru: all 2 openings (yes Imean ALL) are 9-13 5+ UNBAl|pg||
nt|daman: a @H shift will hold him to 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru: because S thinks that @C might be run  for W discards if defense plays pasively|pg||
nt|granguru: I third it|pg||
nt|rv: can't see a way to beat 1@s on any lead|pg||
nt|granguru: all 3 openings are 5+ weak|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: otherwise 10|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: lot to do  but looks doable|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good word that - brave bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand is there,  (per many specs)  but not sure I want to be there |pg||
nt|jcomyn: me nayther|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this could take a while|pg||
nt|psyck: may fin @s into safe hand & be forced to set up @d later|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|granguru: 3NT any one suited solid suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: want to have x-ray vision to even think of game|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo, also nicknamed the submarine, was considered the best defender in the world |pg||
nt|jcomyn: met him back in 1980 - good lord am i that old|pg||
nt|kemperg: they are world class, but also a bit lucky here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: 6 @d 4 @c 2 @s 1 @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats true too|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bobholl: there we are|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6 back to Brown|pg||
pc|dK|nt|granguru: Cima is the only not world champion here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|athene: declarer knows that north must be out of diamonds AND south does not have the entry|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: I suspect declarer will make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|granguru: small @S is best now|pg||
nt|jcomyn: didnt think there was an italian who wasnt a world champion|pg||
nt|kemperg: pius 12|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: best defence, holding it to 8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: but now?|pg||
nt|athene: north must be out of HEARTS sorry|pg||
nt|athene: as the defence took the @HA and switched like that|pg||
nt|caruga: first 6 imps caused by the slam in the board 1 in the closed room|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|d7|pg||

nt|athene: small diamond was good enough, then dummy still has to ruff or let garozzo make that little trump|pg||

nt|hawe45: 4 @H 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@h NO PROBLEM THANKS TO @d t |pg||
nt|psyck: W's sequence on deal 1 was likely game forcing, E may have forgotten|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Fantunes playing for Angelini, Lauria-Versace playing for which team? I don't see Zaleski in list of teams...|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C good @H; 4@D good @S 4NT 6-5 minors|pg||
nt|athene: that's a good example of why 6-4 is usually a 1-suiter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru: 4M and 5m: to play|pg||
nt|athene: partner has two more cards in the 4-card suit and it still makes two more tricks in the long suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: missing DK will hardly bid 7|pg||
nt|hawe45: With N/S bidding the 3 other suits, West will find the @C-lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: their "strong" weak twos often score well (especially against the dutch:)) |pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 1, in OR, 4@h was played by N|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so this north hand is a game force for Fantoni i am sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on NS?|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S obviously weak |pg||
nt|granguru: and 2 obvious passes|pg||
nt|rv: quick pass by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 1@s followed by 3@h would be normal by N|pg||
nt|athene: one more trick sorry|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: This time EW might reasonably attempt 5D|pg||
nt|athene: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: north is intending to just show a heart raise so not bothering with the spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 1nt on N even if only 14|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't bid it if he doesn't guess to bid 1 nt now (too ligth imo)|pg||
nt|granguru: what should E do?|pg||
nt|pelu: u have done your homework. John, wd :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|woozle: Buchen's 2D overcall a little ugly with only a five card suit, but the excellent hand and unsuitability of every other call justify it|pg||
nt|woozle: Christie, unfortunately, doesn't know what a vul v not 2-level overcall looks like|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd sooner bid 5D than pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Povl Sommer|pg||
nt|jcomyn: does s hand not qualify for 1c|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, 2@c playing a strong @c system...|pg||
nt|athene: usually you do that with a game force which i don't think north really has|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so easy to reach unless N overcalls a weak 1NT |pg||
nt|jcomyn: ouch|pg||
nt|jcomyn: same again 6-4 in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Povl,  welcome |pg||

nt|bobholl: some kind of truscott i guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  Especially if E elects to respond|pg||
nt|henryb:  which I would|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: stayman & a 4@H shoot |pg||
nt|rv: close decision, I may pass because nearly half of my values in @s|pg||
nt|granguru: E will run into trouble|pg||
nt|daman: he is a fount of knowledge|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..4@D now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@H both majors nice convention but now ?! :(|pg||
nt|granguru: decided to pass, which was best as the cards lie|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: a bold X pls don't convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will make a slam try with 4 @d |pg||
nt|rv: L-V playing for Sbarigia, Roma|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@H would have been  a disaster|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Zaleski not fielding team since foreigners not allowed in this event|pg||
nt|granguru: I played the system|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @S |pg||
nt|sommer: ..and they should be there|pg||
nt|athene: so, a spade lead and a club loser goes away|pg||
nt|hawe45: 2 @S for the lead???|pg||
nt|granguru: all 1 openings are F1. after 1@S for instance 1N shows 0-9|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen steps out a little with a reopening double, diagnosing the short hearts opposite. Christie still thinks that he has a balanced yarborough and just returns to diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: N was too strong for his action after all :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This cuts communication a little|pg||
nt|athene: ok now declarer can't get to dummy for a pitch on the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: sensible lead|pg||
nt|athene: lead the singleton with a weak hand|pg||
nt|psyck: @h will be entry later|pg||
nt|hawe45: Listen folks - does 2 @S mean: Lead what you like?|pg||
nt|athene: Garozzo said "if you don't lead your singleton, pd shld assume u don't have one"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 aces away and claim |pg||
nt|henryb:  they might beat this enough to compensate for the game!|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes agree.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sommer: 4@S.. now|pg||
nt|sybarra: up the line cues I guess |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: danger hand with @D 5/0 Q@S off side & a @H looser |pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H was min,|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/gazzilli.html|pg||
nt|jbennet: it all comes down what the 6 card suit is like.|pg||
nt|athene: west's @SAJ gets a lot better when partner shows six of them|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|athene: that doesn't quite mean "always lead your singleton" as people sometimes say|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but it is fairly close :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Still 12 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't it the Q he led ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  so what?|pg||
nt|bobholl: otherwise i didn't understand the duck :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this aint much better|pg||
nt|jbennet: if however SpQ was h Q then the hand should be bid as both majors.|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks why cima doesn't use stayman - well, this is what we are talking about|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: @D set as trump |pg||
nt|jcomyn: that dk still missing though|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are off to the races |pg||
nt|athene: he has SPADES (and hearts on the side)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: EW will win seven imps, but a completely worthwhile vulnerable game has gone begging|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@S any 4card|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like no breaks :) - 2NT was a possible winner|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now 11½|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he took the pitch earlier|pg||
nt|granguru: why is garozzo playing then?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|hawe45: Even if East ducks the first @H, still 12 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: east covers in case his pd has @H109x or something|pg||
nt|caruga: foreign players are allowed|pg||
nt|caruga: we've players from France, Poland, Venezuela....|pg||
nt|pelu: @H back - if decl has @h10 N can kill the ruff of the 4. @d|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Madala had a 2@h-opening in S! (@h+minor)|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 3@CX - looks like down 2 - but u never know :(|pg||
nt|daman: the auction almost guarantees that declarer is 3541 |pg||
nt|daman: and so ot will help with the D|pg||
nt|daman: it*|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwibridge: still a plus with Klinger stealing 3@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and as WE see, it makes 13 tricks fast|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and this WONT take long|pg||
nt|athene: always hard to duck with a doubleton honour|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hmm...!|pg||
nt|athene: clearly this is trivial unless south has all the hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: nunes fantoni didn't take their tricks against 4@H either|pg||
pc|c5|nt|psyck: ok, 8 will be entry now :)|pg||
nt|athene: @D8 nice entry|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - that´s better|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|granguru: Hamaoui is from venezuela but also italian|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: sorry unless north has all the hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: I shouldn't be so harsh - Christie couldn't have known that he had four trumps, a king and a key singleton|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entry in dummy for the 2 finnesse |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is being harsh|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is NS play 2@C as natural or a 3-card limit raise |pg||
nt|athene: quite common idea so you can stop at the 2-level when partner has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|psyck: that would be a likely explanation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c to shorten dummys trumph|pg||
nt|pelu: this trick prove that even the italians cant see all cards :)|pg||
nt|granguru: the Fantunes 2 openings are 9-13 unbal hands. they show 2 types of shape|pg||
mc|10|nt|jbennet: the way to treat 64 opposite a NT is: if a doubleton adds a loser to the 6 card suit Then bid it as a 2 suiter.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: another one where we can't see what happened in the CR|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this 4@s could make needs W to break @d?|pg||
nt|woozle: EW can put on some pressure by bidding to 5C here, which needs hearts led at trick one or two to beat it|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S, meanwhile, appears to need a diamond shift to beat it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nor should this|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is a good sac against 4@H here|pg||
nt|hawe45: Only game here is 3 @D doubled|pg||
nt|athene: nunes obviously did not think his hand quite good enough for a 2@D opener|pg||
nt|athene: (10-13, unbalanced, 5+@D)|pg||
nt|athene: they tend to be ultra disciplined with those|pg||
nt|athene: so it has to be a ridiculously good 9|pg||
nt|psyck: not with all values outside i guess|pg||
nt|athene: a 9 that is basically a 12 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: we will have to wait a little longer for the imps to flow|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so as well as 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: the least you would expect from this legend :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 84 year old think|pg||
nt|psyck: the @s return probably tipped him off to play that way|pg||
nt|psyck: 83|pg||
nt|daman: now NS can show their 2 suiter|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle: With +600/620 or -100 as the options, I'd much rather be playing than defending|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nice to be spectating this one|pg||
nt|woozle: Sorry, not so sure that the diamond shift is necessary to beat 4S - discard is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but endplay?|pg||
nt|sommer: this?..this may be a swing|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if N dares to bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 18-19 i take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: X will now = @D I suspect |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: :) ty not far |pg||
nt|psyck: 84 later this year i think|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@S by NS will be an easy task|pg||
nt|granguru: the main idea was 1. to have always and alternative to run into |pg||
nt|granguru: as you would, as partner never fall into a void dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: but if the defense never break diamonds, a one-suit squeeze on east will work|pg||
nt|caruga: do you all bid with N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: no|pg||
nt|athene: south is close, in my opinion, to a double of 2@H (he is in the pre-balancing position)|pg||
nt|jbennet: as usual activity will now be rewarded.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D interesting - sometimes you have to open 1@D with various "loose" hands in a strong club system|pg||
nt|athene: but usually with 6 clubs you can open 2@C!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their 2@C opener denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|granguru: 2. you can lead trumps agaisnt any doubled contract if it was the case|pg||
nt|athene: but combination of mediocre shape and minimum hcp and being vulnerable|pg||
nt|athene: so pass is sensible enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: and no @S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sommer: 2@S may be 2 controls|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt think sacrifice now|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..very passive by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i really must hunt out a CC for NS :) then i could actually stop just guessing haha|pg||
nt|psyck: Papi has been practicing with N quite a bit on BBO recently, you can catch him with the id sillafu here often|pg||
nt|fann4: Clearly 1@S would not have been forcing by S here.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not bad hands for a start for Benito 16/18/17/19 in 4 hands :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: s might now go overboard|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: Bridggida, the goddess of Bridge, clearly favors him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Usually, in a strong @c system, it is the long relays we cannot make sense of, here even their natual bids are unnatural :(|pg||
nt|athene: well 1@D is always a bit of an amorphous blob in 5-card major strong 1@C systems|pg||
nt|athene: just not usually this sort of blob :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their system (yet) but looks like strong club with conventional answers |pg||
nt|pelu: u see "only" 13 HCP so N cant open 1@h (= 14+)|pg||
nt|daman: Running scores at  http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|kemperg: good 12/13 also allowed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: got a chance there too, to X|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs probably shows both minors.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: well, what would 2nt show? this is a bit odd i have to say|pg||
pc|h3|nt|woozle: Perhaps not. My imagination is getting ahead of me. East will be endplayed if he comes down to KJT of diamonds, but if he keeps the 6 and ditches a minor honour then West's diamond ...|pg||
nt|woozle: pips will save him|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i dont like this style of bidding with this kind of shape|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D making N 3Nt only by S|pg||
nt|fann4: maybe heading to 3N by S, if N bids 3@H now.|pg||
nt|granguru: if @D forces N to a new bid 4@S can be reached|pg||
nt|granguru: ditto|pg||
nt|kemperg: stif K not good|pg||
nt|granguru: 3. There was a chance to find a 4-4 fit even if you opened a "weak 2"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: we can just ignore the 1st round of bids & it looks fine though...|pg||
nt|hawe45: With an easy @H-guess, East can make 4 @D - if N/S do not find the @H-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: i assumed it was just 1@C natural, 1@H transfer, 1nt natural, new minor forcing|pg||
nt|granguru: good bid by Montanari|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone know tha ditto system|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tak 'em or dont get 'em |pg||
nt|athene: not trivial perhaps to bid 3@D with east |pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT much better than 4@S @C lead and swiftly 1 down |pg||
nt|fann4: Down a lot if the @DK offside - 5@D much better|pg||
nt|jcomyn: brave or what?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: only in nt |pg||
nt|sommer: sry..I'm told, E showed 5c@H|pg||
nt|athene: might feel he is just hanging partner for a good balancing action|pg||
nt|psyck: E was afraid of crucifying pd for balancing|pg||
nt|athene: also he might just assume that north has implied some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: since usually you will do if you open 1@D and rebid clubs, even if you might have longer clubs|pg||
nt|hawe45: I also have to sleep some time, this contract is a 2-minut-one...!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/apr/fantunes-and-garozzo-play-angelini-salsomaggiore is about this match|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d looks like xfer to @hs, otherwise 3N doesn't make sense with E hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: must be used to poor overcalls|pg||
nt|granguru: I am also not accustomed to bid suits like N, but it is a good strategy to enter over 1 in a minor  with such type of semisolid suits|pg||
nt|caruga: NS are very good and very young players|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: i'm told that 1@D generally promises a 4-card major in the NS methods, so 2@C showed 4 spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: but lauria-versace do have a lot of funky little bits of system that come up in odd places :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: i was wondering why he ignored the spades, but if he has implied them, that is ok :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems they are heding to a good 5@D|pg||
nt|granguru: because it is around 50% chance that NT might be bid by 3rd hand so defense wins a critical tempo if the lead is in the mentioned suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well if my pard overcalled vul I wont stop in 4s|pg||
nt|granguru: by passing the chances that partner leads another suit are overwhelming|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: ..the 3@C did|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H lead expected |pg||
pc|h7|nt|woozle: It would all work if the D8 was in North|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@S was "wheater/or"..and then 3@C showed 5c @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: NS stole the auction from EW    Ew can make at least 8 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|daman: 9 actually|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR is in 3@S|pg||
nt|daman: according to the OR|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: ufffff|pg||
nt|jbennet: and now folks lauria entered the bidding on the 3 level vulnerable and earned himself a wel deserved double part-score swing.|pg||
nt|athene: these partscore hands are 6 imps a time so it's not enough just to say "i might go for 500, i have to pass"|pg||
nt|jbennet: lucky?? no the least. just acting with the odds.|pg||
nt|athene: if any specs are wondering what i meant when i mentioned that south was in the "pre-balancing" position - he isn't actually in the passout seat, but opps have had a limited fit ...|pg||
nt|athene: auction|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  some think it was nmf, but does that guarantee @hs?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, the bidding makes more sense now, thanks |pg||

nt|jcomyn: wouldnt doubt it|pg||
nt|psyck: Another 'routine' 1@d opening for N now|pg||
nt|hawe45: Seems impossible to make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: @sA was sleepy|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess transfer too :)|pg||
nt|caruga: slam time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: we can see that but can they?|pg||
nt|daman: so now    when N opens 1H   it shows a minimum of 14 HCP|pg||
nt|jbennet: and b) NS can double. (lots of times balancing actions escapes from being punished with a double even if it gets down 2. |pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo has 13 World Champ., 3 OLymp. & 12 Europe Champs plus others|pg||

nt|sommer: EW missed even 6@D at the other table in b 3|pg||
nt|fann4: Certainly a big swing possibility. West may not open in the other room or declarer may still take the @D finesse.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 2..sry|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H or 3@S the limit but ???|pg||
nt|granguru: fit is what its all this game about|pg||
nt|caruga: isn't easy|pg||
nt|granguru: and there is an important 4th adventage: the relay. It permits opener to show the 5-4 or the 6th card suit at ease|pg||
nt|dima:  hi all :) 6@h on 1-1 split?|pg||
nt|daman: yo Dima|pg||
nt|daman: You Di Ma|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible that NS use 3@C there to show both minors because if you start with 2NT you allow east to double to suggest a penalty|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: x wide ranging opp a nebulous opening|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the double of 1@D just says "i am doubling whatever minor he has for takeout " :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: will they miss @H now ?|pg||
nt|athene: many people bid 1@S with that west sort of hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@s from S?|pg||
nt|pelu: but NS are missing 2 key-cards - so no slam|pg||
nt|dima:  If they find out that they have 11 trumps and havea chance to Qbid @d ace on the way ... but unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C might make it harder|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: these nebulous minor openers cause a whole lot of interesting problems for both sides|pg||
nt|jbennet: but for every -500 the activity philosophy will earn 8-10 partscore swings. (worth 4-6 IMP:s every time)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you see it a lot more with short 1@C openers|pg||
nt|hawe45: In fact, best game is 3 NT - with @S 5-1, 4 @H might be a looser|pg||
nt|athene: but they they are stuck when the bidding comes back to them in 4@H or something|pg||
nt|athene: they have to bid 5@C and now partner can't go back to 4@S if he wants to|pg||
nt|athene: much more descriptive to bid clubs first then spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @C lead 4@S migth make|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get closer |pg||
nt|jcomyn: especially as s d are pretty scruffy|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@C-4@D might do it|pg||
nt|athene: NS play a slightly modified form of stayman|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: could be lively auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: and some were worried about missing 7,  John and I were both chickens  and happy to be in 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: right pair of chickens we are shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: that ok |pg||
nt|bobholl: now N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that nunes splinters for hearts with no more than a minimum opener (in their style)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians generally lay great stress on showing the shape in competition like this |pg||
nt|bobholl: will bid 5@D now i guess|pg||
nt|athene: two small in clubs looks very bad from north's point of view - but not if you know partner has a singleton :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but may be not strong enough sure :)|pg||
nt|athene: will west lightner double hearts?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would force NS to find the better spot in @hs|pg||
nt|dima:  4NT is turbo?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: over 900 watching this match now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to go after this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: at the end of the last hand Buchen just showed his kj10x @d to Smolanko, and they both agreed 1 off|pg||
nt|hawe45: I think is says "nolo comprendo" - or so - in Italian. What could 3 @C mean???|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 lead now maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes should convert this|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to underlead in @C to deafeat 5@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 3H?|pg||
nt|granguru: no|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: Anderson's 4H almost looks like an underbid, but if you're going to stop low, that North hand won't disappoint|pg||
nt|sybarra: wtih no apologies to mates :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: not any more|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT probably 18-20|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: no chance|pg||
nt|psyck: can set up an extra @s trick as cards are to get home|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: J@D lead or 10@D with agreement |pg||
nt|jcomyn: can hardly bid on now|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of spects claim that the slam sh be bid - but when N ask for keycards he will get 2 - could be @HK and @DA - then missing 2 Aces|pg||
nt|dima:  Turbo shows even number of key cards so Fulvio knows they are off 2 keycards|pg||
nt|granguru: well seems yes|pg||
nt|jbennet: i think that the 2NT shows both minor BUT south shall choose clubs if eqal length.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H showed a maximum hand without majors|pg||
nt|granguru: many other things like a 5th (if memory doest fail) with his wife Lea Dupont, a pro/am victory with Martin Woltman (wollies) watching now here|pg||
nt|athene: OR four hearts]|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: back, sry had conn problems|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not much point west underleading since he is on lead against diamonds not hearts :)|pg||
nt|athene: east might deduce the diamond void from the auction|pg||
nt|granguru: Coach of italian natl team and the italian juniors - european champios|pg||
nt|jbennet: whats does 3 club mean???|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S just asking what he has|pg||
nt|jcomyn: assdume 5d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: i donno what 4@c is either|pg||
nt|athene: but a diamond lead could be wrong in many ways - if partner doesn't ruff you just gave a vital tempo away|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 5@H is made|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll deduce it now but it's too late|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but no entry in parner to make damagge |pg||
nt|psyck: actully not, cannot afford it now|pg||
nt|granguru: if it is a cue|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: but can endplay S |pg||
nt|pelu: so for sure impossible to bid if u dont just use dice's :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...no reason not to try|pg||
nt|granguru: 6 reached|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well on the way now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: of course, "Normally", you only lightner double at the slam level|pg||
nt|bobholl: not the ace :)|pg||
nt|athene: but there are other times when perhaps it might apply|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that it does interfere with when you just want to double for penalty because opps are saccing|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps, I think E had enough to go on to try a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: so you can only really use it when you are known from the previous auction not to be strong enough to need to double just to protect your equity on the deal|pg||
nt|andyv:  and question for W was whether to bid on, to dbl for lead direction, or to pass....this time pass looks costly|pg||
nt|bobholl: he didn't know for sure his P had @C Q|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@C in N -1 |pg||
nt|psyck: @c doubleton sees him home too|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: and may be someone has no @C|pg||
nt|granguru: Merit for Franchi|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@D is a VERY though bid to make at the table|pg||
nt|jcomyn: agree we see so few minor slams these days|pg||
nt|caruga: agree|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sommer: closer to 8 than to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: on spot 9 make |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|rv: yes, tough to get to this slam, if I had @DQ or @DT in Franchi's hand, I might have bid 3@d on 2@c to set suit with an extra card than min |pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/TurboConvention.pdf|pg||
nt|granguru: good tip daman|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: a guess is that 2NT at 3rd bidding turn would show minimum to allow then to play 2NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: ducking the opening heart lead is leaving Smolanko poorly placed - it's hard to see him going down if he rises with the ace and knocks out the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just pitch|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ill tell him|pg||
pc|d9|nt|woozle: Perhaps Christie is contemplating an undercut|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo in 4@S on this one|pg||
nt|daman: EW are in 3@CX in the OR|pg||
nt|athene: will north bid 1nt over 1@H?|pg||
nt|jbennet: too many controlls for that|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so it's ugly, but so are the alternatives|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: would she know how to bid it in Angelini's system though? :)|pg||
nt|athene: "i'm not opening 1@D with 1 diamond and six clubs!"|pg||
nt|athene: quite right too|pg||
nt|granguru: 6@H depends on the @SK position|pg||
nt|jbennet: D best|pg||
nt|athene: i would be a 1NTer i think|pg||
nt|athene: i don't want to double and hear diamonds from partner|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: S had a chance to find 5@C by bidding 2@C....|pg||
nt|hawe45: She would bid 1 @H - 3 @H - 4 @H - all alerted|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H "hearts"|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H "game"|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@D or 7@H even|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but when s passes no slam bid|pg||
nt|rv: need @s 3-3 or honor doubleton inside, poor slam|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito, at 83 can play 10 different full systems ...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbennet: some times overcall 1NT with singleton honour is OK but this is not such an occasion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone asked about a low spade instead of the queen. That's complex, and I think that Smolanko would have had to find the weird play of the jack from dummy to make|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone open in s|pg||
nt|pelu: also here?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: NO|pg||
nt|athene: so east bid 1nt over a strong club with clubs, now 1@H with spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: I´am proud of the fact, that I do´nt understand one single of these bids|pg||
nt|athene: so it looks like some sort of suction|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing the next suit up or some other 2 suiter|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe just simple transfers but that is a little passé surely|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo east in 4@S here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if they are too sophisticated they'l discover missing @D Q|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knows 65 now i suppose so simple RKC can do the trick now (7@D)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he surely takes enough time for it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|athene: well, versace is a good partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no on previous one|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be one of his better fits:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @D finessed in board 4 hedding to a confortable 630 swing |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: having an actual anchor suit! that's bordering on natural bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45: Can one open 4th in hand - and let the opponents play - undoubled|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi peter|pg||
nt|fann4: the dbl presumably showed @H, and 2@H showed 4 card support.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 12-12|pg||
nt|granguru: @Sk stiff, doubleton or tripleton on side|pg||
nt|pelu: would X from Fantoni be take out - also here??|pg||
nt|athene: lauria was hoping he would bid the right suit and he did|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sommer: IF Buratti had bid 2@C, N might have fallen i love with his hand and go for 5@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter:) |pg||
nt|granguru: no one would think of it at the table...just commenting how easy 4@h will be|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: it seems so|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45: Look at this board, no mistake possible in the play|pg||
nt|athene: only three trumps and two clubs to lose here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psyck: there is a defense to strong @c called DONTTON where 1 level bids are transfers showing length or shortness in the next suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: claim :(|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed overcalling 1nT might have caused a missed an excellent 4 msp|pg||
nt|athene: now versace might have to decide whether to deep finesse the heart or play east for a singleton honour|pg||
nt|jbennet: so what should he have done if he had got a D response.|pg||
nt|jbennet: treat the hand as a 18-20 NT of course.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem here is that he would like to just crossruff it - but to cash two heart tricks (or three) he needs to draw east's trumps|pg||
nt|athene: so he is a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene: of course to cash the @CK he needs to draw west's trumps too!|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see this coming home|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how a 1nt overcall would have fared but it looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and will take some time i daresay|pg||
nt|athene: a spec asks, can we not just play west for both hearts? well, yes, but if we draw trumps and do that we only make 3 trumps, 3 hearts, @CAK, and one ruff|pg||
nt|athene: no way to organize TWO diamond ruffs and keep control|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes a 4-4 trump fit just ain't enough|pg||
nt|jbennet: looking at NS hands alone 4sp looks good. But knowing about the club suit.|pg||
nt|athene: on this sort of hand what you really, really want is a ninth trump|pg||
nt|jbennet: N might have realized that the breaks was bad (knowing bith west and south was short in clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: still, these borderline game contracts in a 4-4 fit are really tricky to defend|pg||
nt|athene: and versace has had a lot of practice at making them|pg||
nt|jbennet: but lets see D king at tricks 2.|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps 3+3+2 D ruffs+AK might be possible.|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 4 spades an overbid??|pg||
nt|athene: so if he plays the @DK to the ace, what does Garozzo do?|pg||
nt|jbennet: the defence prevails if for example garozzo bangs down AX in spades.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: easy grand - more interestig to bid without @cA |pg||
nt|rv: OR, North did bid 3@d on 1@s by South and now South could visualize slam easily|pg||
nt|granguru: but there are still some other chances with @SKxxx in W,,such as @CKQ alone|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psyck: & 2 level bids like DONT|pg||
nt|athene: well, no-one managed to find their 5-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: but there is work to be done|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: and Pass lead directional in Pointed suits, & Double lead directional in Rounded suits :)|pg||
nt|psyck: So far we have been able to follow NS bidding anyway, usually they are more esoteric :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/2 no problem in 4@H = or Q@C placed for +1|pg||
nt|jbennet: h to the 7?|pg||
nt|granguru: for the askers: Leo Cima is from Tuscany a very good player, training almost daily with Benito thru Internet|pg||
nt|granguru: as said 45/47 years old|pg||
nt|kemperg: called 100 dog?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|kemperg: Garozzo is smispi?|pg||
nt|athene: no, that's dano de falco|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 sp looks in fact unmakeable as long as defence doesnt slip.|pg||
nt|granguru: Smispi is Dano de Falco|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is sillafu here|pg||
nt|kemperg: No sillafu, mixed them|pg||
nt|granguru: LAURIA was born one year later as me 1946|pg||
nt|athene: of course it would help declarer if garozzo had overruffed there|pg||
nt|granguru: Versace is much younger 1969 I think|pg||
nt|athene: you shouldn't give up the ace of trumps so casually|pg||
nt|athene: holding Axx of trumps in defence is very powerful in many ways|pg||
nt|athene: for example, often declarer wants to draw exactly two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but you can prevent that by ducking the first round|pg||
nt|athene: then if a second round is played you can win and play a third|pg||
nt|jbennet: A diamond now. to the ace. if garozzo at that stage plays AX in spades. then 4 sp will make|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks like imps to ew|pg||
nt|kemperg: think that wil happen |pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: The defense here seem to have taken to heart Zia's tip "always play the nine"|pg||
nt|athene: you can't really hope to make use of the diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: all the grandmothers in the audience are shaking their heads|pg||
nt|pelu: well defended by Nunes|pg||
nt|dima:  One might use 3@d for takeout and X for penalty but who am I to suggest here ... :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: so you just have to scramble some tricks by ruffing hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|psyck: not or, need both|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sry true need to find Q@C to make |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|sommer: I was talking about board 5 of course:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..where NS make 5@C|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: i believe it was Belladonna's Bridge Tip to "hold up the ace of trumps!"|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo-belladonna top pair in the 1970s, early 80s|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|jcomyn: i agree -100 could be good for ew|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbennet: yep he didnt play a D to ace so now he have opened himself for a heart ruff.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think you can go back further than that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: kib says last world title was as far back as 75|pg||
nt|jbennet: only way to let 4 sp now is overruffing and return spade. then and only then 4 sp makes|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo is just trying to work out if he can beat it if versace has five trumps|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3 loose always |pg||
nt|fann4: Nothing much to this hand really.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so needs to find the Q@C |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: but versace would not have had anything like such a problem with five spades in his hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: luckily   EW avoided a big penalty because of system|pg||
nt|jbennet: if declare has 5 trumps there nothing to be done.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: tie game now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|psyck: will not try drop this time :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: basically there is a big practical advantage in complicated artificial schemes of interference|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: in theory it is supposed to give the other side more room |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S & J@C |pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: but in practice it just gives them more room to mess up|pg||
nt|jbennet: Game Over|pg||
nt|jcomyn: apparently benito won first title in 1961|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: and more chances to have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 5 EW also in 3N in the OR.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: now ruff the @H8 and west must overruff with a trump trick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: slipped it thru|pg||
nt|athene: if you double a transfer is that showing the suit bid, or takeout of the suit shown, or what?|pg||
nt|athene: or penalty interest?|pg||
nt|athene: it all needs agreements|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i assume west actually overruffed that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but now the defence can't stop the @S8 scoring|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead at trick 1 (or trick 2) and it was a bit more interesting|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pc|h3|nt|athene: if south had doubled 2@C for takeout that might have worked out quite nicely|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fine |pg||
nt|athene: i wonder where the music would have stopped?|pg||
nt|jbennet: bridge must the game/sport with the longest time span between 2 titles of the same kind won by the same player.|pg||
nt|granguru: Garozzo won the italian open team in 1958|pg||

nt|woozle: 4H looks excellent NS - the clubs establish with one ruff|pg||
nt|woozle: Hard to reach though - someone has to bid an awful lot|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I have a spec says it's off|pg||
nt|sommer: Bocchi/Madala bid the 6@D too..of course|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs (lauria versace i think) play for example that 1nt - 2@H double is takeout of spades|pg||
nt|hawe45: One looser in each suit, seems correct|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H being a transfer i mean|pg||
nt|athene: EW might well try 5minor|pg||
nt|athene: east surely isn't passing anything but a pure penalty double?|pg||
nt|athene: @SA lead against 5@C would be unfortunate perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C wasn't exactly best in trick 2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can perhaps still survive by ruffing hearts and unblocking the diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: lucky 3N for NS but will not get there|pg||
nt|fann4: more likely 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they bid this one|pg||
nt|rv: on brd 21, even on 2@c Franchi would have considered 3@d, chose to bid 2@d and subsequently changed his mind and bid 4@d |pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats shows what a great game bridge is - its longevity|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: and then lead the @DQ forcing west to ruff with a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: tap tap|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but they didnt find the sacrifice, despite Bocchi bid both @D and @S!!|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer a pitch for a diamond - then if he can ruff two hearts he can make|pg||
nt|hawe45: They will not bid 5@C before midnight...|pg||
nt|athene: and throwing a club loser from dummy when he does|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S?|pg||
nt|daman: intermediate?|pg||
nt|daman: 9-13|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1|pg||
nt|granguru: a @S too much|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: east has a nice hand but no bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: So do I. I don't think that anybody figured out the diamond tap thing without Deep Finesse though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Double?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in b 4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: another slam but can it be bid|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: you surely have to do something over 3@S with that east hand?|pg||
nt|psyck: this better|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S could push lets see |pg||
nt|kemperg: good 13|pg||
nt|daman: I thought you needed 14 HCP to open 1|pg||
nt|kemperg: or good 12/13|pg||
nt|daman: ok  thx|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: this X is outside my knowledge:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he goes |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c prob either @c or some strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: easy 4@S bid now for south - in fact larry thinks he should bid 5@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: ("bid to the level of your fit")|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i predict 5@C from east now|pg||
nt|athene: this is the sort of situation where it's much better to have screens|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strong enough for a "normal" weak 2|pg||
nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|pelu: I was told tyhat 13 good HCP also ok - and this hand for sure good 13 - remember that 1-openings are F1|pg||
nt|daman: I wasn't certain if the held to the 14+   as John explained in the beginning|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 15-17, no M are opened 1@C then 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: repsonsive type |pg||
nt|fann4: But here it's neither|pg||
nt|psyck: likely stop here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..he felt maybe too strong for jump to 4@S??|pg||
nt|athene: at club level, it only takes a slight variation in tempo|pg||
nt|athene: for west to double fast with a trump trick and slightly slower with values outside spades|pg||
nt|athene: and E knows when to leave and when to pull :)|pg||
nt|athene: i see so many pairs doing this and they might not even realise it is dodgy :)|pg||
nt|athene: decent suit texture|pg||
nt|daman: now that we have that straight...........|pg||
nt|granguru: bal hands with 18-19, no M are opened 1@D then NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: :)http://www.archiviobridge.it/FantoniNunes-CCard2-0.pdf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: even over 1@s pas he has no good bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: Smolanko's raise to 2H inadequate - that's what he would bid with a balanced minimum, and this hand is anything but|pg||
nt|psyck: strong being 15+ maybe|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: end 2@D |pg||
nt|jbennet: B schapiro won his first Gold Cup -title 1945 and his last  1997.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ireland's greatest ever woman player will be 100 in september|pg||
nt|granguru: trivia: Why the Blue team is called like that?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: played blue club i darseay|pg||
nt|athene: they formed two squads to select a team|pg||
nt|jbennet: the game does indeed have a life prolonging element in itsself.|pg||
nt|athene: the red squad and the blue squad|pg||
nt|granguru: good athene!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fann4: A spectator just messged that it shows 15-17 with 5@D and 4@H.|pg||
nt|fann4: I have my doubts.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: making 11 ruff a @S & K@H placed |pg||
nt|pelu: Ns can win 1@S and EW 9-10 tricks - so now they are on 5-level :):)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and  http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/conventions_o9/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|psyck: could be the 1st big swing now|pg||
nt|athene: never lead unsupported aces just because partner bid the suit! :) ok this was a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|athene: garozzo tends to overcall aggressively at the 1-level so he might well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C preclude to invite in @H i guess|pg||
nt|jcomyn: optimism rewarded|pg||
nt|granguru: it is not due to the italian squad colors|pg||
nt|jbennet: no i think blue team is named after the bidding system "blue club"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but did they play blue or roman club|pg||
nt|granguru: The name apparently derived from the 1956 ItaLIAN trials, when the blue team defeated the red team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well that solves that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jameslee 2: @H 3/3 for the 11 trick |pg||
nt|psyck: Papi understandably did not want to play in 1N with an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|caruga: 3@S=heavy limit|pg||
nt|rv: some might even bid 4@s on Franchi's hand |pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: 3H initially should incite Anderson to bid game, diagnosing the short diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|woozle: Still, making 3 or 4 will be worth 1-2 imps, potentially vlauable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree peter. I cannot see any reason for 2@c|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ is the 100% normal lead - but - again - a trump would have worked better|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: taking a long time to find that big s fit|pg||
nt|athene: now the problem is if declarer uses the @DA to lead a heart up|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it was certainly an uncomfortable lead situation for S|pg||
nt|fann4: Many would just pass 1N, on the basis that pard is likely to have some @C, having skipped both majors.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and this slam isn't good...but it makes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no chance on a bad day, but this isn't one of those|pg||
nt|granguru: the blue team system received its name from the blue team memebers|pg||
nt|jcomyn: martin johnston says it was neapolitan club - well there yar|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: NS would open 1@C with any balanced hand i think|pg||
nt|pelu: we have not aeen the best of Fantoni in the last 2 boards :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: strange lead|pg||
nt|daman: unfortunate lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|woozle: Klinger's "raise" to 2H in the other room just as bad, but then he compounded it by defending 3D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: agree again, but @c10 can solve the trumph suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: but can't west have akxxxx ax x xxx thats enough for 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: so they can use the 1nt rebid artificially|pg||
nt|bobholl: a@S 2@C and a@D to loose|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: no good|pg||
nt|athene: he is banking on the diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45: Not the winning line here|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psyck: we will not see a new leader yet|pg||
nt|caruga: 100% tied.....in a bad day or today :)|pg||

nt|caruga: no, only 99%|pg||
nt|jcomyn: trumps 5-0 club finesse wrong to be going on with|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: S can expect @Cs 5-3 and 4 by pd - and C10 will stop some cross_ruffs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|athene: he doesn't expect the @HA to be onside|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: 3NT will certainly be reached...Brown will be happy for a certainly flat board...Klinger won't be|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: lets see if they try to go to 6@H |pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d either nmf or some kind of GF checkback|pg||
nt|granguru: Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina was 13 when she came to play to Chile a junior tourney...we saw she would be a world champion sooner or later...|pg||
nt|jbennet: south refrained from insisting on 4hwith his balanced shape and wk suit.|pg||

nt|sommer: "double check-back|pg||
nt|athene: 5-level is wrong yet again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is all ghetting a bit confusing since we now have a kib saying vanderbilt club was first|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: on a @S lead it makes but on @D ??|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a little pushy, especially NV|pg||
nt|athene: but he has all four tens|pg||
nt|athene: and all four are potentially working very hard|pg||
nt|athene: for example give partner @HJxx on a  heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: and the @H10 saves your skin|pg||
nt|granguru: well Fantoni is NOT going to lead a @H against 6@C..but over 3NT :)|pg||
nt|athene: well, strong  club methods have been around almost since the very start of the game|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: It´s a long way... Why not a direct 4@h after the rebid 1nt from W?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: as the cards lay down|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|athene: @CJ on the @DJ|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

pc|h9|nt|athene: cash @CAK and play ace and a diamond, hope for a ruff and discard?|pg||
nt|fann4: And it's vul too, so new leader coming up.|pg||
nt|psyck: could afford safety play in @h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if other team go & make as spec tell me 12 is cold on a squeeze |pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: or hope for a minor suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|andyv:  after cashing @hs, @d switch should set this|pg||
nt|athene: no play for this as long as someone keeps spades and someone keeps diamonds|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could be a big swing here |pg||
nt|psyck: only after @c lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: cash the @CK and run the hearts|pg||

nt|granguru: Giorgio Belladonna and Walter Avarelli played the Roman System (3 versions made)|pg||

nt|athene: (i am talking about the defence to 4@H of course sorry)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the first 4@S on this table until now the only sizeable difference :)|pg||

nt|daman: 6@S is a contract that makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: much less easy to reach 3NT now|pg||
nt|andyv:  slam depends on lead....unless E can get to play 6@c|pg||
nt|athene: east would like to splinter now except he really hates that diamond lead coming through his @DKJxx|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 6@C now ?|pg||
nt|pelu: strange that Giubilo only bid 2@S - green against red|pg||
nt|granguru: so 12 was the max|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time the odds against decision to insist 4H rather than consulting his p was left unpunished.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fann4: No game makes here|pg||

nt|jcomyn: bit early in the day for this conversation I'll forget about bridge if you keep that up|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: hard-ish for north to find the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: but the defence might get a second chance if declarer tries an immediate club|pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: aq or 9 of @D ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course there is risk in this bid especially as partner will tend not to have four hearts (no negative double)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3NT a bit myopic (as well as where is the @h stopper?)|pg||
nt|athene: but it looks reasonable enough|pg||
nt|athene: if the play with KJxx in opp's suit doesn't bid notrumps who is going to?|pg||
nt|athene: the player|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 2@s leavs a wideopen way for EW|pg||
nt|granguru: Arno is the same as little roman club|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: over 3@S N could bid 4@S|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Anderson bids his spades...with 4162 or 4072 it would be more tempting to respond 1NT (to give a chance of bidding diamonds later) but this hand can pass a 2C rebid in comfort|pg||
nt|rv: South is trying for game here?|pg||

nt|bobholl: now he sees he has missed 6@C despite the bad @D points|pg||
nt|andyv:  old fashioned here Bill, I'd like a better stopper in unbid suit than the stiff 9 of @hs|pg||
nt|granguru: 12000 bridge players now at BBO..what a wonderful site...|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|woozle: A club looks more ordinary, but maybe he fancied his chances of catching dummy with 4531.|pg||

nt|rv: West must have been itching to double this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: bold=?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..nope..just the shot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt agree with that leap|pg||

nt|sommer: Exclusion, no?|pg||
nt|sommer: I would for sure bid 5@C...but thats me:)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|psyck: can only throw 2@h & 3@c, & squeezed on 5th @d itself in 3 suits|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|sommer: wd|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wrong again jeepers|pg||
nt|sommer: ..for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a typical hand where you should play 6@h because of ruffing @c with the short trumphlength|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also han play 7@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|granguru: He answered: Roman Precision" :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bobholl: bidding starts the same way at his table|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Christie overcalls with a rather less good hand than the one which Buchen passed earlier|pg||
nt|fann4: Note the pass by E on an 8 card suit. Very disciplined.|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri might win competition with his shape:)|pg||
nt|caruga: I'm not sure I would open 1 @H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: matter of style i suppose|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: 5@d would be more interesting to watch than 3N here...may require @dJ finess in 5@d...|pg||
nt|jbennet: little major was invented to counteract the italian blue club. (But Reese and schapiro,s sophisticated code language was more efficient than any bidding system ever will be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would say :(:(:(|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, but may just take finesses instead of playing for squeeze|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1@c as well, enough playing strength to reverse and bid @hs later|pg||
nt|granguru: if 1@C is not used as art opening @H is an error...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: as cards are E-W makes 6@c though 5@c us reasonable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko starts with 2S...a 3S splinter or fit jump in diamonds might have been better options, if available|pg||
nt|sommer: it is best chance|pg||
nt|chilloncan: transfer overcall it seems|pg||
nt|psyck: @c fin that is|pg||
nt|granguru: except they  are using canapé style|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psyck: we have been speculating quite a vit on their string @c defense :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: or is it "majors-or-minors" or something of that ilk?|pg||
nt|athene: north may balance 2@H now|pg||
nt|granguru: :9 :9|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: they seem to be on same wavelength here, West did raise to 5@c instead of giving pref to 4@h |pg||
nt|caruga: would  be the first time in 30 years :)|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry, he has opener's minor, he has to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: lead change|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko's 4C doesn't really do justice to his playing strength...Anderson didn't know how good his hand was (there didn't have to be a stiff spade opposite)|pg||
nt|psyck: likely a suction variant, but other possibilities too maybe|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NS well on their way|pg||
nt|athene: might be "spades or..."|pg||
nt|athene: it has certainly caused some confusion, which is the general idea :)|pg||
nt|psyck: suction would be @s or the next two suits (minors) here|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed|pg||
nt|granguru: best contract..as was said hey will make 6 but chances are less than 50% before starting to play the hand|pg||
nt|rv: correct contract in my opinion, 6@c is fortuitous|pg||
nt|jcomyn: bid slams on these hands and you wont live long|pg||
nt|granguru: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: :) :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobholl: but his partner bid 3@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like down 1 territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: The auction went very nicely in OR|pg||
nt|woozle: EW had the early running in the auction in the other room - East showed both majors, West jumped to 3S...North judged aggressively (and successfully) to double...but 4S from West ...|pg||
nt|woozle: might have stolen the pot|pg||
nt|athene: north must think that 2@S set up a game force?|pg||
nt|athene: he would surely not bid 3@D there with so good a hand if he thought it was not forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: S has a maximum|pg||
nt|psyck: asuming pass of 1@h was les than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i played suction ONCE. ishmael delmonte said "you are going to LOVE this". it came up, and when the smoke cleared we were -1400 againt a partial. i couldnt remember the details of ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it. so i said "got any more  gadgets i will love?":)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: made is fairly good possible|pg||
nt|athene: was west going to bid 4@S over 4@D, i wonder?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be a bit of a view|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Try DONTTON next time Marshall :)|pg||
nt|athene: another 4@S on a 4-4 fit - but this time Versace has 26 points between the hands|pg||
nt|athene: he will be worried at first as this is relatively new territory for him|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  W needs to shift now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C was gazilli i suppose ?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@S down 2 on @H-ruff? - Verdace in 3NT - @H-lead and S has to find @d10 in on @SA - adn N has to take the 2. @D with @dA - very difficult defense|pg||
nt|jbennet: scahpiro and reese used a twisted way of using stayman.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the correct facts at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Team_%28bridge%29|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: something must have gone wrong if 1400 vs nothing :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the auction developed extremely well for S here. was able to pass first, and then in that context could bid strongly|pg||
nt|athene: i mean surely you could have escaped for only 11 :)|pg||
nt|athene: east was perhaps wondering if his diamond spot there was suit preference|pg||
nt|athene: in case the @DK was a singleton|pg||
nt|andyv:  but this won't do it|pg||
nt|bobholl: even the 8 helps|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|sommer: he has 73% chance of making by taking @SA|pg||
nt|athene: south was a bit stuck if his partner bid hearts over 2@S, wasn't he?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nunes  started slam board 8 with a weak 1nt fantoni going for a @H slam invitation on the way to 6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fann4: What was he expecting opposite?|pg||
nt|athene: NS could make some spades, but to do that they have to bid them :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: they are in controls position & 4nt call |pg||
nt|psyck: we are all foxed Jeff :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: does he just bid 3@S as a sort of "do something intelligent, partner" noise?|pg||
nt|psyck: I think needs !j fin now as i mentioned earlier|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes |pg||
nt|jbennet: the number af fingers they held on the backside of thier cards was a response to stayman. (sort of).|pg||

nt|athene: give declarer @HAx(x) or something|pg||

nt|woozle: It's easy to be critical, but it would be shortsighted to deny Five Card Standard some of the blame - North had to tread very carefully lest he be facing a balanced minimum with ...|pg||
nt|woozle: three clubs (and potentially, spade wastage)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe there are layouts where it is necessary|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fantoni declarer |pg||
nt|granguru: I played roman for years, then some Blue team, and last Superpre for many years again. And against all of them.|pg||
nt|granguru: ooops|pg||
mb|1H|nt|granguru: @C 2-2 is 40% plus 1 of 2 finesses makes slam chances less than 20%|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Who's bidding 4S?|pg||
nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: but this time east can't weave his evil spells|pg||
nt|athene: not having a 5-card suit :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: garazzo still thinking in other room at 5 level in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but in general it's wrong to attack any suit where dummy has a decent holding|pg||
nt|bobholl: (previous board)|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer can't get rid of his losers there anyway|pg||
nt|psyck: 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and bad 5/0 distribution suit @S |pg||
nt|psyck: 4@s does look ok seeing just NS cards :)|pg||
nt|rv: another hand for competition here, auction could go to 5 level though both sides don't make game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what now - x|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jameslee 2: 6@H fantoni ,lead  4@D |pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: admittedly, the lack of a 5-card suit doesn't stop many people from weaving over strong clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Well, we will be avle to rule out DONTTON & narrow down on Suction if E doesnt act :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: you just suggested it|pg||
nt|jcomyn: stiff sk again. slams are growing out of ther woodwork|pg||
nt|jbennet: they also showed thier HCP- strength by altering the height above the table  of which they held their cards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: sorry, last hand....who's doubling and who's passing the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting gain of 3 imps for Fornaciari on board 8..3N by NS, 1@h there by EW|pg||
nt|athene: NS cheerfully play weak (and offshape) notrump throughout|pg||
nt|athene: and they seem to escape disaster most of the time|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C - if u only see the EW-cards|pg||
nt|fann4: The smart money is on E to make 6@H on bd 8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good heaven - and wasnt there a court case|pg||
nt|athene: no 2@S overcall for garozzo - he is one of the few players today who likes intermediate jump overcalls|pg||
nt|jbennet: holding the cards higher up was more points. holding the cards near the table was fewer HCP|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: another slam 6@s on a finess (but a stiff @sK in front)|pg||
nt|rv: East may bid 5@h for insurance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how about "wuction"? stands for wet suction  - you don't bid on 4-4 shapes|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wouldn't describe Claudio as cheerful:)|pg||
nt|athene: haha|pg||
nt|athene: in fact the italians tend to eschew aggressive weak overcalls by and large, i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: Fantoni is already counting 12 tricks on @h fin then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Buchen (foolishly to my mind) tries doubling 3NT, but a spade lead could be the last thing that he needs|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Buchen making it worse|pg||
nt|athene: interesting 1nt here - i wonder is this a forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|rv: at IMPs you much rather give away 50 or 100 instead of -420|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D 18-19 balanced, i assume, and 3@C puppet stayman|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3 clubs probably means Good hand for 1NT but need help in clubs.|pg||
nt|athene: double simply showing a good hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: right back to this match ok everybopdy|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Today, it's cold on any lead and he turns -7 imps into -9, but another non-rare outcome will be to talk his partner off the killing lead|pg||
nt|woozle: Smolanko runs. That didn't occur to me, with good spades and the doubler not on lead|pg||
nt|athene: looks strange otherwise with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously didn't think it was a forcing notrump|pg||
nt|fann4: These days, many pairs play that over the x, 2@H is a sound 2@S raise.|pg||
nt|athene: so Lauria clearly has a game force|pg||
nt|jbennet: this low good.|pg||
nt|athene: now if both red suits can be run - there are a LOT of tricks to be taken|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sommer: cant be bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wouldnt bet the way things are going|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2 control cards ar missing, so....|pg||
nt|sommer: I take the chance of commentators curse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..2 aces missing|pg||
nt|sommer: so he must jump now to 6@S... I doubt that|pg||
nt|pelu: why 1Nt and not 2@C by East?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C better than 3nt but wouldn't have made either|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H showing four spades, not four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: best thing to do is pretend 2@D was 2NT, then it all makes sense :)|pg||
nt|athene: the italians love using 2minor opener to show this "stronger than 1nt but not quite 2nt" balanced hand|pg||
nt|athene: it was first called the "mexican 2@D" opener and was sort of laughed at a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: so it was a good X after all?|pg||
nt|woozle: 4C will make four, for a flat board an Klinger still in the lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and picked up 1 on 31|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mr duboin giving it plenty of thought|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was forcing one round, might be only 4 spades|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, & 2@s a weaker raise|pg||
nt|fann4: right|pg||
nt|rv: North doubled because he has values in Other minor (not one bid by South)|pg||
nt|athene: but it has some interesting advantages elsewhere in their system|pg||
nt|jbennet: a source of tricks + AAKK should induce vercase to cooperate.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: is this a victim for the 5-carnd major opening?|pg||
nt|rv: this auction could get duplicated in OR as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: so redouble and then support is a little more than 9|pg||
nt|athene: basically it means they never have to open 1 of a minor with any strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|athene: if you need exactly four heart tricks, you cash the ace, but then if west drops the jack or ten, you don't finesse|pg||
nt|jbennet: verace now knows no spade control THAT is good news. |pg||
nt|athene: because it's a well-known ploy from J10x to give you a losing option|pg||
nt|jbennet: he should also know that the club bid is the ACE.|pg||
nt|athene: here, clearly, east is extremely unlikely to hold five hearts anyway so the question would not arise|pg||
nt|jbennet: not the king|pg||
nt|jbennet: why must it be the ace???|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: which means, firstly, 2nt bids can be cute things|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/MGlossary/MexicanTwoDiamonds.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Someone suggested that the doubler might have solid hearts, but HE'S NOT ON LEAD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Klinger also pulled out of the X|pg||
nt|athene: it's hard to say who was at fault here without knowing the details of the system|pg||
nt|jbennet: becuase there is no way lauria would have removed himself from 3NT if the club control wasnt the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks after a @c lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: card... |pg||
nt|athene: (look at the 2nt rebid on board 8, for example)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: very few top losers, but very few tricks too here|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a doddle|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fann4: Will 3@D make? GIB says no, but things can change.|pg||
nt|jbennet: and versace duly figured that out bidding the ggod slam. (hearts 33 or D Q drop).|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine he will cash the top trumps and then when they don't break, he just needs hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: not trivial though|pg||
nt|athene: given the likely 6-1 club split|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps he will play excatly 1 round trumps and the 3 times hearts.'|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: Now E known that it´s a finess slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry knows...|pg||
nt|sommer: yes...W told that nicely|pg||
nt|sommer: ..If I understood the bidding|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I love even money |pg||
nt|jcomyn: my slams are usually about 20 per cent|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: still looks normal to rebid 2@c on 1N|pg||
nt|athene: the club split makes it more likely that west has @DQxx|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: if passing 1nt with that north hand was right, then south had to find a stronger bid with his hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks so :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: without anybidding its not a play problem at all.|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with taking the trump finesse is that if it loses you are down on the spot|pg||
nt|athene: if you cash @DAK and someone shows out you are still alive (just)|pg||
nt|jbennet: EK of D if no drop then hope for Hearts 33|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tempting to try to postpone the evil hour|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which is more likely on the bidding d finesse or h 3-3|pg||
nt|athene: but finessing might still the best line|pg||
nt|kemperg: postponing he is|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course the finesse is better than 3-3 hearts but that isn't the issue|pg||
nt|athene: if you play the top trumps, and the queen is doubleton, you survive too|pg||
nt|jbennet: the bidding makes it more complex.|pg||
nt|athene: even with hearts 4-2|pg||
nt|athene: or a singleton @HJ or @H10 is good enough|pg||
nt|athene: you get the spade away on the @HQ and then simply concede one heart for two club pitches|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes a priori the slam requires either D Q drops in 1 or 2 rounds OR hearts 33|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he is giving it plenty of thought obviously|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a 9-card fit missing the Q, the odds are very close between the drop and finesse anyway|pg||
nt|kemperg: bidding almost implies 6@C i E and 6@S in W|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes there is another problem if u cash D king and queen drops.|pg||
nt|athene: if you know one defender has significant length in another suit (as east does here, with the clubs and @SQ by implication from the lead)|pg||
nt|athene: then the finesse is best odds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: trumps will cut down dec's trciks|pg||
nt|fann4: Now GIB says makeable - but remember that GIB is a double dummy analyser, seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
nt|psyck: now dec likely will cash @hk & x ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|athene: meckstroth-rodwell play this style of 1major rebids after a strong club|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer must play a @C or @HK now to make.|pg||
nt|athene: secondly it means that partner can pass your 1minor opener more happily|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|psyck: as long as he does not try @h fin...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: ok! so an overtrick for lauria|pg||
nt|jbennet: then u may draw trumps but if hearts are 4-2  then only 3 heart tricks.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: but responder shows right away the hcp count and whether 3 card support|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 5@c will also go down, because of the 3-0 in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: did S count the @S ?|pg||
nt|athene: playing standard methods, if it goes 1@C p p p, opener might have only 3 clubs in a balanced 19 count and is in a silly contract AND opps have nothing on|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru: well regarding last hand slam was in fact more than 20% asit wins also with @C 3-1 aand both finesses |pg||
nt|athene: playing this way, if it goes like that, you only have a weak balanced hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@D would be 5-7 hcp with 3 spades here,for them, over 1@S, i think|pg||
nt|granguru: which is an additionally 12.5%|pg||
nt|jbennet: that way of play looks vastly agaist the odds.|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think the spade split was so clear|pg||
nt|athene: east might have four spades for 2@C there perhaps|pg||
nt|jbennet: i do thin in fact the spades were favourite to be 6-3|pg||
nt|athene: if you think the @S8 was honest standard count, then 6-3 is most likely yes|pg||
mc|12|nt|ralfwil: I goe an aspect from  a kib - 5@s is a very bad contract. either 4@s or 6@s|pg||
nt|athene: that would make north's life very easy|pg||
nt|athene: another advantage which a spec points out is that partner can respond to your 1minor opener on air|pg||
nt|jbennet: becuase if east had 46 in black suits|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and there was a risk of 6+% for @D 4-0 too...so..|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C - 1@D, you are a bit behind standard bidders as you haven't shown any suits and you are a bit higher up|pg||
nt|psyck: I didn't exactly mean to make a prediction when I said we will have to wait longer for a new leader, but it seems to have worked out that way|pg||
nt|bobholl: alas the great garazzo passed 5@C|pg||
nt|fann4: NS need to steer clear of the 5 level here.|pg||
nt|caruga: not a good slam anyway|pg||
nt|granguru: plus stif @Chonor in South hand |pg||
nt|jbennet: he might have doubled instead if overcalling 2 clubs.|pg||
nt|jbennet: suppose u decided that east had 36 in black suits.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nuther slam|pg||
nt|jbennet: then his play was a really bad move.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I really agree with that aspect!|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@H off on a @D lead specifically|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: well bid in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and very well made the 3N who said Klinger was tiring|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 7@c anyone?|pg||
nt|woozle: Sort of well-bid...dummy could have had the stuff to make a grand good|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mine either unduectaed yoke|pg||
nt|athene: another weak notrump by fantunes escapes the righteous wrath of the penalty double|pg||
nt|psyck: NS should not get overboard with no fit here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|woozle: No 7C for me today|pg||
nt|athene: north should definitely have passed the double of 1nt in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: he is balanced with values|pg||
nt|athene: this is soemthing that people often get wrong|pg||
nt|athene: they feel it's like a takeout double so they tend to bid their suits|pg||
nt|athene: but with strong balanced hand you just pass the double as a first action|pg||
nt|psyck: have ther reversed the cards?|pg||
nt|psyck: unless they can get N to play it :)|pg||
nt|fann4: That overcall will likely help NS put the brakes on.|pg||
nt|rv: can it go all pass?|pg||
nt|athene: now we see if NS play a penalty double of a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: interestingly, if you look on meckstroth-rodwell's convention card|pg||
nt|jbennet: it was then fool proof to play D AK.|pg||
nt|athene: interesting decision now for Versace|pg||
nt|athene: bit shapely for doubler - but 4@S could well lead to a silly contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|sommer: I dont - exactly..wasnt W big favorite to hold @HAx(x) and @Cx instead?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding over the nature of the double - lots play X as artificial over strong notrump but you really want it as penalty over weak|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe they put the cards back in the wrong slots|pg||
nt|athene: yes, board must be upside down here i guess|pg||
nt|athene: bit shapely for double|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5C an even more interesting ploy|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  5-5 hand|pg||
nt|fann4: The meaning of 2@C anyone?|pg||
nt|psyck: relay any G i would guess|pg||
nt|psyck: *any G|pg||
nt|psyck: GF|pg||
nt|jbennet: looks as D is most flexible.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sort of sounds like a heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: or, you mean 5@C from garozzo?|pg||
nt|athene: that looks like a club raise to me :)|pg||
nt|athene: disaster in the other room|pg||
nt|kemperg: 7@S there|pg||
mb|5H|nt|woozle: Haughie's final 6C bid was just a guess...successful, today|pg||
nt|athene: they play different defences to weak and strong notrumps|pg||
nt|pelu: I prefer the "weak" NT in 2@C - and then 2@h/2@S = weak sign off (5 card suit) 2 @D relay - u can even play 3@c/3@D weak 6 card suit|pg||
nt|athene: north probably did not imagine his partner had a club void|pg||
nt|athene: as he had only the bare ace|pg||
nt|athene: so thought that 6@D had to have a bit more (the @HA, specifically!)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it just goes to point out the old rule about bidding grand slams when you can't count the tricks (don't)|pg||
nt|jbennet: who said "be cautious  when opponents preempts vigorously"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Tks Krishna|pg||
nt|athene: (as do many pairs)|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: they also say|pg||
nt|daman: My mother would say "double"???   in a high voice    that meant it was optional|pg||
nt|athene: "all 1nt openers in third seat are weak!"|pg||
nt|athene: in other words|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bobholl: why not 1nt now ?|pg||
nt|fann4: Someone suggest it shows @H, which fits in with the 3@H bid (maybe)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: gee whiz great H contract gone|pg||
nt|psyck: operator will have to enter the score manually|pg||
nt|psyck: or redo the auction to make S declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 1nt from E?|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm guessing though|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Anderson has the same guess|pg||
nt|pelu: ehis time 1Nt would work - but Easr "never" trust" partners @c-openings :)|pg||
nt|psyck: they play that kind of relays sometimes, not sure this seq though|pg||
nt|athene: they have seen people psyche a strong notrump so often in third seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Smolanko seems to have a gadget...Anderson learns nothing particular of use and takes the same guess as Haughie for a flat board|pg||
nt|psyck: I don't like the 3N rebid|pg||
nt|andyv:  acutally, their card reads 10-13 5+ unbalanced|pg||
nt|bobholl: his timing is bad :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|woozle: Christie's spade lead might speed the play|pg||
nt|kemperg: N did not believe the void, thougt S had an extra ace to bid 6 |pg||
nt|athene: many specs are suggesting that Garozzo should have bid 6@C, rather than just 5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i don't believe it, rather than not liking it|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like it was @h indeed & 3@s continuing to describe|pg||
nt|athene: well, these hands are very guessy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  good slam here|pg||
nt|psyck: sensible stop, albeit helped by opps|pg||
nt|fann4: Swing potential on this board - NS did well to stay low, and also they right sided it.|pg||
nt|athene: they feel the need to bring out the stern stick of justice over it (penalty double)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so looks like Klinger has done it against the odds|pg||
nt|athene: south just had a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|psyck: yes|pg||
nt|psyck: 15-181NT overcall generally|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt 5@C and 4@H all make|pg||
nt|fann4: E brought home the slam on bd 8 - very well done.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobholl: and 6@C is best|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 6@H made 10 for angelini|pg||
nt|psyck: he must have gotten a count to tell him to sq instead of fin|pg||
nt|fann4: Yes|pg||
nt|athene: just bidding 5 can do a lot of damage in many ways|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  I think even 1@s by S makes:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: but many italians play x with bal hands & values|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: NS need to pull of something quite special here|pg||
nt|woozle: A good result for Klinger in the other room - 3NT with only eight obvious tricks. Now Brown is probably watching the clock run out of time|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's better :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: cant be made....|pg||
nt|caruga: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rv: South possibly follows rule of 14, no of points+@s length should be more than 14 for opening in 4th seat|pg||
nt|daman: here in Canada   we had a pair   Joey Silver/Irving Litvack      they psyched on nearly every hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: any minor preempt?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: loks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on EW?|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps there is a point in that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: so robsson had gone 1 unlucky down+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobholl: 4@D and a@C if they don't find the @H ruff so can be true|pg||
nt|pelu: then its not a psyke - its a part of their system and sh be declared|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S opener possible here - much less disciplined in third seat|pg||
nt|daman: one never knew what was going on but did know not to believe them |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might double 1@D for the lead here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty, Daniela|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S 0-11 no 4card major|pg||
nt|athene: (1@C is forcing)|pg||
nt|rv: is 2@h muiderberg or tartan?|pg||
nt|athene: that sounds like douglas adams' reciproexclusiversion mathematics|pg||
nt|daman: but they announced that they psyched frequently|pg||
nt|athene: a bid is defined as showing anything except what it shows|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: thanks Daniel great on the vugraph, thanks Ian and Kieran and all specs, Nick Fahrer and the ABF for organising and BBO for the broadcast|pg||
nt|woozle: This is the last board, so as long as Christie-Buchen don't go for about 2000, they're safe|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee that died quickly|pg||
nt|daman: and I use the term frequently very loosely|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C should show extras, or five clubs, i think, as it uses up so much bidding space|pg||
nt|athene: people playing 2/1 game force think that magically solves all bidding problems so they can happily rebid 3@C on 5-2-2-4 11 counts|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not that easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: must be 1@d not 2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway encourage s to bid d slam|pg||
nt|rv: if it is muiderberg, it shows 5@h+4+m less than opening hand|pg||
nt|granguru: that makes a total of around 42.5% less some restrictions such as a ruff on lead or weird distributions|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 3@S is just michaels - no leaping michaels for this EW pair!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: but if it is game forcing whats the hurry|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: be suspicious when they lift volunteerily :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X over 2@H - only 10 HCP - but perfect distribution - |pg||
mb|3N|nt|sommer: ..still down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA and another @d for -1|pg||
nt|kemperg: we play the next bid as relay with less than 16|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@H less then 16 2@S 4@H's , 16+|pg||
nt|athene: Fantoni Nunes in the other room agreed clubs, cue-bid, then i suspect 4NT was turbo, showing an even number of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: well done to Christie Buchen, Klinger Haughie and Richman Braithwaite who will now represent Australia in the APBF in June and the Bowl in October|pg||

nt|bobholl: for me 99,9|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: And thanks to Ian McCance, Gary Hanna, Daniel Braun, and all of the specs who joined in|pg||
nt|andyv:  perfect NT dummy|pg||
nt|athene: in theory i believe that 2@S denies four hearts in which case east might not play restricted choice in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: ruspa won't agree :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: t5hat too Bob|pg||
nt|jcomyn: gee whiz 5-5 d fit ignored|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: the NS system says 2@D was 8-12 balanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  too bad for declarer that deuces aren't wild|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club lead?|pg||
nt|granguru: btw 5@C had around .9 x .75 =67.5%|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: 5@d safer contract, this should score more tricks though|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: of course he would find it hard to get back to hand safely to take lots of finesses through south anyway|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sommer: ..ahh maybe a squeeze will helt E now|pg||
nt|sommer: I think N HAD to play small @D to ruff to make sure of 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to finesse|pg||
nt|sommer: ..he has to ruff @D high..take @SH and run the @S'|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see what Lauria will do if N open 2@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doubles 100% |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 tricks  we can see directly the 9th not easy |pg||
nt|fann4: East has to switch to the @S2 to beat this now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: correct Povi! S is squeezed .|pg||
nt|athene: east can see no point plodding on with diamonds with no entry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: I have a very simple rule. Act as early as possible ans don´t balance if you not are very sure that it is correct|pg||
nt|athene: it does seem a little odd here that south never admitted to club support, but perhaps all is not as it seems|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: so he tries to help his partner out a bit|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mundane game|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well i know there are many strong players who like it to be natural|pg||
nt|athene: i see helgemo bidding it all the time|pg||
nt|rv: should be prosaic 1n for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: some number of S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Interesting board 9 - 7@s down 2!|pg||
nt|athene: but i just think the risk/reward ratio is not good|pg||
nt|athene: or at least you have to make it more like 17-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural or not, the bid still needed a source of tricks|pg||

nt|ralfwil: sometimes bridge is easy like on this board:)|pg||

nt|pelu: until now 5x NO :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..yes..they went for the 33% grandslam|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  change the @c and @s suit around, and 1N looks much better|pg||
nt|granguru: about the slam a kib says:WITHOUT the diamond lead, the slam needs only club break and 4-2 heart break. No finesses. |pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri has heard John and decided no more prosaic bidding|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: now north will double for takeout |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you double 1nt for penalty and opps run, your next double is takeout|pg||
nt|athene: i remember david burn saying very firmly why this was a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone plays this way and it seems sensible to me|pg||
nt|pelu: sometimes the players makes easy to difficult :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Even without a @H ruff, 4@S goes 1 off here.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
nt|athene: 2@CXX interesting final spot|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how much is that|pg||
mb|2N|nt|woozle: I predict 11 tricks on a spade lead|pg||
nt|sommer: ..a little less than 30% rather, I think|pg||
nt|caruga: is 1@D looking for troubles?|pg||
nt|granguru: I use zar point to evaluate|pg||
nt|jcomyn: pass for a bit of fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: I think Christie had to enquire to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: odd contract|pg||
nt|granguru: which is right. so 6@C by WEST was the right contract finally.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no sense of humour|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: in the other room surely east had showed long clubs at some point so covering the club looks less appealing|pg||
nt|fann4: So long as NS don't wait too long to play @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: getting pushy|pg||
nt|sommer: after S' opening, W can upgrade his controlcards a lot|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and will raise...or should|pg||
nt|athene: sadly i wasn't really listening to david so i can't say what his reasoning was :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s true Peter:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: With no singleton, 11 tricks in diamonds looks very distant|pg||
nt|psyck: those playing walsh style may have started with 1@s instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|fann4: That 8 card @C suit headed by QJ10 - E opened 3@C in the OR.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S good stop |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: ..hmm|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never say will Povi|pg||
nt|psyck: this seq also shows the 45 minors with E probably|pg||
nt|athene: with 4333 and soft cards versace doesn't bother with the 5-3 heart fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..or should:)|pg||
nt|athene: no squeeze - just the 11|pg||

pc|c6|nt|psyck: 2@s, 2@h, 1@c losers with the ruff|pg||
nt|rv: Uggeri lucky @ds are breaking and no one fancied a X, he could have gone for 300|pg||

pc|hT|nt|woozle: With North guarding hearts and diamonds, and South spades, there's no squeeze for 12|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: saw that a desperation contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|psyck: yes, unfortunate to be so badly punished|pg||
nt|athene: having length and no strength in diamonds is a bad weakness in the hand, to be sure|pg||
nt|athene: but still who would not bid 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't open light in third as his spades aren't really what his hand is all about|pg||

nt|athene: in theory the transfer gives EW more room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|woozle: although the auction will tip declarer off that he should start spades from dummy|pg||
nt|ianmcc: too much in oppo suits|pg||
nt|woozle: The values are poorly located (NS have too many)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: doing well for 140|pg||
nt|woozle: Buchen's 2NT is a thoughtful effort, although if I were to reach 3NT with this hand I'd rather be dummy (a try like 2S might achieve that)|pg||

nt|granguru: it is a perfectionated Rule of 20|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: I am told this event is RR amongst 10 teams, 9 rounds and team with highest VPs after 9 rounds is winner|pg||
nt|athene: if you are planning to play against fantunes any time soom (or any other weak notrumpers) you need to discuss auctions after 1nt - X a LOT|pg||
nt|athene: because they come up quite often and there are lots of imps to be gained (or lost)!|pg||
nt|athene: of course when the bidding dies in 2@H, he wakes up :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|caruga: we've a great prob of server here, hope it goes|pg||
nt|athene: so here for example - it's possible EW knew what they were doing, but i have to say, it doesn't look like it!|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: awww just started to rain  here|pg||
nt|civginer: :)|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that east might have opened 2@H in fourth seat|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: Sbarigia with Lauria-Versace leading with 130 VPs and Angelini with Fantunes second on 120|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: This should score 140, maybe 170 on soft defense|pg||
nt|athene: no huge spectacular misunderstanding, certainly, but both players thought their partner would have a little more, i think|pg||
nt|granguru: sementa has here 14+9+3+5+1=32|pg||
nt|pelu: but Sementa (14 HCP) knew that Duboin was a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: oh yes|pg||
nt|athene: he was just hoping for a ten count opposite|pg||
nt|kemperg: Fantoni does not believe his partner has an entry|pg||
nt|athene: and duboin was hoping for a 16 count|pg||
nt|pelu: Fantoni also knew that West is a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: fantoni might think it's better to play his partner for the @SK rather than the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: so small spade switch might be coming|pg||
nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in defence you can solve these decisions by remembering that declarer would not hold up if there were another suit he feared more|pg||
nt|athene: but here that is not really the issue because duboin has to duck the heart anyway|pg||
nt|kemperg: my money on @HA|pg||
nt|athene: indeed, i am not sure what else it can show other than roughly that hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: that discard helped declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: william:(|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: of course Fantoni Nunes can go for penalties a lot with their super-sound 1-level openers |pg||
nt|athene: but still it was a view from east with all that stuff in hearts facing possibly 4 hearts in west's hand|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, was only a couple of imps at stake wonce E chose not to pass 1st|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kemperg: and gets more help than he needed:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: again - Fantoni not at his best :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: spec says : pay|pg||
nt|athene: he could have afforded the @SQ, i feel|pg||
nt|athene: i mean even if it blocks the suit|pg||
nt|athene: you are going to get two hearts two spades and the @CK if that is what you are getting|pg||
nt|pelu: but still down 1|pg||
nt|athene: i did say a small one but fantoni should defend better than me!!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  6 cashers off the top..S will need to finesse for J@h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fann4: 10 tricks only now|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|fann4: Bd 10, another swing heading to ANG.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fann4: Opening up a serious gap now in the match.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Angelini making a big gapp|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: very little, but yes...made him calmer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: Lavazza with Bocchi, Madala, Duboin and Sementa out of contention|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: oh no|pg||
nt|pelu: no I dont belive|pg||
nt|kemperg: ??|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think that happened|pg||
nt|pelu: operator, are u sure?|pg||
nt|athene: i think NS just cashed their five tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: w card should have been the @hK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcomyn: imagine that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 12 boards in a row played by NS - not fair|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Another point is that South did not raise spades or bid something else|pg||
nt|athene: the danger of partner pulling your re-opening double to a 4-card heart suit is very low in fact|pg||
nt|bobholl: but he won't|pg||
nt|fann4: clearly declarer did not play a low @H from hand |pg||
nt|fann4: Last board here now|pg||
nt|psyck: Well EW sure deserved to lose imps on 10 they way they handled it here :)|pg||
nt|fann4: Absolutely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: remarkable at this level|pg||
nt|rv: Cima and Garozzo practiced daily on BBO|pg||
nt|granguru: Benito was bor september 6 1927|pg||
nt|caruga: a very good player from Tuscany, 45/47 yrs old, nice :)|pg||
nt|daman: last board now|pg||
nt|kemperg: Fantoni has no luck today, still 22 imps ahead:)|pg||
nt|athene: ok last board now i think?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and no chance of a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 4 hearts he would double 1@S himself|pg||
nt|rv: this is last deal of this segment, many thanks to Vugraph operator and my excellent co-commentators John, Fabio and John|pg||
nt|athene: right, last board now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  didn't want to give up 3 imps|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if he doesn't have a trap pass that is|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch 2 (muiderberg) migth have kept NS out of @S |pg||
nt|fann4: It was 12 imps:)|pg||
nt|psyck: the more the merrier...for the kibs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thanks venkatash very pleasant morning|pg||
nt|rv: many thanks to BBO and Roland for co-ordinating these broadcasts and specs for insightful comments|pg||
nt|daman: 22 behind?|pg||
nt|kemperg: thank all commentators, to many to name them all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now its 13. interesting day and great response from kibs tx|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ianmcc: 3NT doesn't look good|pg||
nt|granguru: tks rv and all...c u in some more minutes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and our world wide weather forecast|pg||
nt|rv: rains have stopped here in Bangalore, should be a cool pleasant evening|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows one major (multi-landy)|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the @C-suit - is blocked in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1nt "12+-15"|pg||
nt|athene: looks like a reasonable 1nt bid for west there over 1@S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: bit ligth :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W agrees with you Bob:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it's V with AJ sec|pg||
nt|athene: west just has 1400 in the wrong column on his scorecard :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will make a game try|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT might be their strong 4-card raise|pg||
nt|athene: that's quite common|pg||
nt|psyck: the boards have certainly been interesting this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: and 6 in a row|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D would be mixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and before that a 1370 too|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: last board here ty to all Jeff&Krishna&specs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|woozle: I'm having difficulty believing Buchen's first round pass|pg||
nt|fann4: South 2@D and West 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: that's a fairly horrible 11 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Notrump wrong-sided but it would likely go down anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  which turns out to be 13 imps for Angelini as OR only got to 5@c|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks Jeff & James.  Good job by our unnamed Operator. Thanks to the kibs for joinnig us & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes people worry with hands like west ("what if he has hearts? i don't have a heart stop")|pg||
nt|pelu: best chance is to play @c10 and let it run|pg||
nt|kemperg: thanks all, see you next time|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Spade lead, diamond switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: take a point off for 4333, take another point off for the diamond spots, and take another point off for partner playing them better :) and what do you have left?|pg||
nt|andyv:  @hs can be guessed for one loser but bad @s break will sink 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: the way to find if partner has a heart stop is bid 3nt and see if he makes it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|woozle: Smolanko declining many opportunities to bid notrumps could cost dearly if Christie hits on the heart lead|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators Bill & Roland.  Well done Operator. Thanks kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H - P - P 2@S by S - and N will b9id 4|pg||
nt|daman: here is the vugrah schedule for after this match   http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry fantunes 22 behind|pg||
nt|daman: details|pg||
nt|granguru: not your fault Germen..|pg||
nt|pelu: or play @CJ and hope S will play the Q|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|fann4: Thanks Krishna and all.|pg||
nt|athene: someone has to own up to a heart stop some time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: my tip is@c|pg||
nt|rv: declarer will play @hs twice from dummy and score this comfortably |pg||
nt|rv: well played Sabbatini, they have got most of the big decisions right in this match|pg||
nt|rv: Please access url http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html for scores from this event|pg||
mb|3D|nt|woozle: Certainly, when your partner, marked with all of the values, didn't overcall over 1C, the only good suit he can have is clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but E could bid 2nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Thoughtful lead, but it leaves the result in limbo for the moment. Still probably down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the curse strikes again|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru: sorry germ|pg||
nt|athene: right, now 3nt at last|pg||
nt|kemperg: tomorrow 9.30 GMT last session|pg||
nt|athene: i assume this is all sort of over|pg||
nt|athene: is versace still thinking?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's farewell angelini, the imps of the crown are being stolen by bandits :) as bob would sing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: "just a table standing empty by the edge of the sea" - that's appropriate!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobholl: a somewhat bad board for angelini |pg||
