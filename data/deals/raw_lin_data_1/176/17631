nt|henryb:  have to find 3N|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pbmarstr: In 4 @s|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|pbmarstr: 3 NT is a fine contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 2@dX, which is down a few|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 2 down probably, is good vs one down in 4 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: No Smolen|pg||

pc|d2|nt|daman: I think he 2@D overcall in a live auction was frivolous|pg||
nt|daman: the*|pg||
nt|daman: and he deserves his fate|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Maybe, but other layouts can give success|pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Joe :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS - standard - EW = precision|pg||
nt|hawe45: hi|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks operators, appreciated information|pg||
nt|hawe45: Excuse me - can one play precision and be late for the start...?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: No you haven't|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Now you have|pg||
nt|hawe45: This board was played two hours ago|pg||
nt|hawe45: 100 % sure - director|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands to start with tho.. what happend on the board?|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur both world champions from Yokohama 1991|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  for running scores|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var and Karl have both often represented in open teams for Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think we start with board 1 in this room|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15 and 126 in the open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 15-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sry folks, need to restart|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n and ÃorlÃ¡kur play relay system|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Liz and all:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East is my partner from the Mixed Teams in Rhodes :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Isak our operator |pg||
nt|sybarra: great so you will know proclivities |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: hi - 2@d, 2@h and 2@s are same for both pairs - multi and 9-12|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unfortunately he agreed to play my system, so I cannot help much with his|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty |pg||
nt|sybarra: nt ranges?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good bidding - up to now|pg||
nt|peachy: operator seems to have some practicing session going, no cards :)  Hang on, I'm sure we will be on shortly|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hmmm....|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The bidding has not been like this :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You need to redeal to a board first|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You can't bid with a blank screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I have the board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ian |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like strong nt for e/w |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Good luck to everybody|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks normal to reach 4@S here, but game is off on top. So unfair|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Stayman|nt|mgb81: That's an odd choice of take out double from south I must say- makes it hard to express her hand type|pg||
nt|athene: yet another good hand for the "4333 plays in notrumps" rule|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|dburn: well, if it gets them to 3NT...|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks as though it definitely ought to have chances|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS have the chance for a brilliancy by bidding 3NT...seems a bit far fetched though|pg||
nt|athene: i am amazed how well 3nt scores over 4major when you have a 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a not so easy 3 nt|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: we will probably see smolen in use |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H showing 4 H! and 5 @S |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Smolen|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I think we just did. if East bids 3NT now West should trust him|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mgb81: North can try eliminating and messing around a bit but with everyone balanced there isn't any chance of a defensive screw up|pg||
nt|athene: you really want to be facing a 1-suiter though - not so good if the long spades are part of a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|mgb81: or is there...?|pg||
nt|copeyj: @DA lead should eliminate the problems at trick 1, 2 and 3 Michaerl|pg||
nt|copeyj: or even Michael|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the defence can begin with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if they get endplayed after that, they deserve to get endplayed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a bit desperate if @h led|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you could endplay them after that and force them to give a ruff and discard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and ht it is (was certainly likely) |pg||
nt|santyclz: I would have led a @c, probably the only lead that lets it make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the only way it might make is if west somehow loses her clubs and then east gets squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming to cheer for your favorites|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Oh well - worried about the clubs, does not know where partner's shortage is|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: this will go down (Unfortunately) on the club ruff |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mgb81: In the other room it looks like Susannah Gross pulled off a pseudo squeeze as Ruth Connelly sitting west pitched two clubs, squeezing her partner|pg||
nt|hawe45: @H - @D-ruff - and then @S from the defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|iceak:  could have a chance because of favourable @d lay|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that Jón Baldursson's @S2 in first trick meant that he wanted a @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: They play udca, so low card is usually encouraging, which in the case of a singleton in dummy usually calls for a trump|pg||
nt|iceak:  difficult not to find a trump switch|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: but since west hasn't got anything to keep but her clubs....|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: don't like that @h8 but still 5 tx for defence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45: @D Jack was a partner-test..|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mgb81: However declarer then claimed one down, so maybe the play record is inaccurate.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|hawe45: @S now, what else could work well?|pg||
nt|iceak:  declarer maybe on his way|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But it is very common to play Lavintahl when dummy shows with a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all sorry I am late |pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: High @S would have called for @D, small for @C, middle for more @S or trump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Dima Nikolenkov|pg||
nt|dima:  Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hi there :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI Dima Isak & Shirley:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence stands no chance now, should I tell Þorlákur :)|pg||
nt|dima:  Do pairs use some special systems?|pg||

nt|daman: do we agree with the 4@S call?|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h was also aggressive with 4-3-3-3; I think North is closer to 4@s than South to 2@h|pg||
nt|daman: yes   South could bid his hand with 2@S|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I agree that 2 @h was also too aggressive|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: But then again, trick potensial is between 8 and 9|pg||
nt|henryb:  The black suit positions mean that this can be made: @hA, three rounds of spades ending in dummy, heart, and eventually guess the clubs|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Well E can ruff twice of course|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: sorry|pg||
nt|henryb:  after three rounds of trumps, I don't think so|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|henryb:  On the other hand, North may well misguess spades with East showing long red suits|pg||

nt|mgb81: we can see that the defence lost its way in the other room|pg||
nt|mgb81: 4S looks booked for at least two down but west played ace and another diamond and declarer got a club away|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a quick lead for the team I'll not try to type.|pg||
nt|peachy: Then he does not lose the DK to ruff, tricky hand to defend|pg||
nt|hawe45: One @H to the 10, @D-ruff and trump|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think especially at pairs you want your systems in working order |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes E-W play strong @C, N-S standard 2/1|pg||
nt|iceak:  Think strong club |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east played the @D5 on the ace|pg||
nt|mgb81: with 5H cold (North is squeezedin the minors on an unlikely trump lead) there are several ways for this to gain a swing to England|pg||
nt|mgb81: will kelly bid 4S or 1S?|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT overcall definitely a bit whimsical|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe we can just call them SS |pg||
nt|dima:  ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: or pronounce|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: asking partner to have an ace out of the blue is a bit much|pg||
nt|santyclz: (It being only 7:15 here my fingers aren't awake yet.)|pg||
nt|psyck: 1N probably artificial|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzdh: 20-21|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us up much earlier watching the royal wedding :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/s could maybe make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I figured since they didn't invite me I wasn't obligated to watch.|pg||
nt|peachy: Often the defense indeed does well to start trumps early, the reason they play in trump contract is so they can ruff something :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Exactly|pg||
nt|dima:  looks like negative double will get NS to 4@h|pg||
nt|iceak:  How strong is NS NT?|pg||
nt|dima:  likely 12-14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S use weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
mb|2H!|an|good rais|nt|mgb81: this is interesting|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mgb81: what????????|pg||
nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 5 moving right along |pg||
nt|iceak:  no problems to win this|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 6@H actually can be made on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And Sævar has a bit of a problem, because he does not quite know partners hand type|pg||
nt|iceak:  My guess he will pass|pg||
nt|dima:  surely they would have some slam try bid (like 4@d) on the way available|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Does he have 15-17 balanced? Even 18-19? Or maybe 14-17 unbalanced?|pg||
nt|psyck: or not :|pg||
mb|3H!|an|interest|nt|mgb81: literally what on earth is going on|pg||
nt|athene: west has decided that she can get lots of heart ruffs|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe South really bid 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: I remember the grant thornton team from prior tourneys,  SS we saw in an early round |pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: why would you ever reopen with a double on the east cards?|pg||
nt|athene: best would be an SOS redouble from north|pg||
nt|ianmcc: howcome they left you out?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think being vul, N/S do not get in|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have prefered a mixed raise instead|pg||
nt|psyck: (mixed raise, 6-9, by passed hands or in competition)|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, with the @da well placed this should also make|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East can afford to be brave at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: I am not sure you can ever make 6 with a @D lead |pg||
nt|sybarra: I just dont see that,, unless you are talking about judging the spade position immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you can, by finessing @S at first opportunity|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Does not help|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: West has 3 trumps and 2 spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Then use entries to play @Cs twice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How do you get your diamond loser away in time?|pg||
nt|psyck: though 5@c clearly superior|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south might decide to float that too|pg||
nt|mgb81: well this looks to be 7 tricks on accurate defence i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: is this definitely the auction, operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I fear it is|pg||
nt|mgb81: I just cant imagine what goes through the mind of someone that wants to double 1S for take out when they are 7-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: it definitely is :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: :):)|pg||
nt|athene: well, received wisdom is that you strain to re-open with double as often as possible, but "possible" doesn't cover 0-7-2-4|pg||
nt|mgb81: I'm not sure why youre smiling Stephen - looks painful to me|pg||
nt|santyclz: An oversight, I'm sure.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: afraid to push them to game maybe |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S already rather high - even if he gets spades right there are problems|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: seems like it should make 6 but I guess that needs the @H's played correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45: No double? - but undertricks "en masse" as they say in France|pg||
pc|h4|nt|copeyj: he is smiling because he is scottish|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: absolutely|pg||
nt|hawe45: E/W will come closer to 9 tricks than North...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c 11-14 bal or nat|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|dima:  In Imps seems to be pretty easy board|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can make - the clubs are kind and he can establish a long heart|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|hawe45: Come on, North - take some tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: Perhaps there was some misunderstanding in NS auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|steshome:  Passing the double with the West hand is a bit odd though|pg||
nt|athene: that's one way of putting it, yes|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes it's the bid of someone who is going for the quick kiil|pg||
nt|mgb81: hoping partner is 2524 with a goodish hand say|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: but he has to draw trump also |pg||
pc|c8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East sensibly preserving his trump|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mgb81: Declarer is going to bash out a few trumps now and make her 7 top tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|h9|nt|peachy: 2NT seems like transfer to clubs, meybe they were not on same page asto what bid "likes clubs"|pg||
nt|hawe45: Do´nt forget, that the lead gave one trick away from the defence!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|dima:  If West overtakes to return a trump East is sqeezed in black suits|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s9|nt|mgb81: west should have count now and not uck the diamond|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mgb81: often its the vul overtrick that really costs. -790 when teammates make 620 isnt a disaster but -990 is|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|athene: if you go all the way round the bend, that's 360 degrees isn't it :)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure - East didn't overtake @cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: yes...I'm sure :)|pg||
nt|dburn: so a heart loser went away|pg||

nt|vugraphzaw: was also the auction...lol|pg||

nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Karl claimed the overtrick on squeeze |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when you have a 7-4 as opener on that sort of auction do you just lose the 4-card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: too late|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: lots for N/S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so opener just bids 4@H or something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 14-16 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: yes Bill|pg||
nt|athene: these actions aren't discussed much - e.g. what is a cue-bid by opener|pg||
nt|mgb81: it looks like declarer mistimed the play in the other room here. She allowed north to pitch her diamond and ruff away the ace|pg||
nt|hawe45: Here the spot is 3 NT - to avoid cross-ruffing defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: E will open |pg||
mb|1S|nt|dima:  He had a complete count here West turned up with 6-3 in reds and rhe position of club ace was known|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Is the grand biddable?|pg||

nt|psyck: should be a routine -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: What do you call AQJ9xxxx?  Trumps!|pg||
nt|Walddk1: even ith one card less|pg||
nt|athene: yes 4@H doesn't look too tricky|pg||
nt|copeyj: can just get a @C trick in the bank and cross ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think|pg||
nt|athene: make four tricks in the side suits and some number of trumps on a crossruff|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will be a good text of alice and bryonys temperament if they can get back on te horse and get a solid game under lock and key|pg||
nt|sybarra: drury  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Drury, I guess|pg||
mb|2S|an|weak|nt|ianmcc: North seems intent|pg||
nt|santyclz: If that is exclusion s should bid it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: voidwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: or exclusion |pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2@s was an ask. Could 5@c be an answer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerted at voidwood |pg||
nt|santyclz: N chose not to answer the "ask", that shows a suit whose loser(s) can be determined by b'wood.|pg||

nt|iceak:  Favorable lay|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Quite reasonably|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D position (in south) values fully |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think S has to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|hawe45: Without pre-empt, 4 @H is the normal contract to bid - not to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 4th lead, udca|pg||
nt|sybarra: W has nice hand but the flatness of it .....|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|athene: people sometimes panic when they hit a 5-0 trump break|pg||

nt|copeyj: just cash winners and x ruff|pg||
nt|ianmcc: agree, source of tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes should make this without any problem|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I expected North to re-open then - in my experience Icelandic players do not pass much|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: but they only bid 6 in the other room so a push|pg||

nt|copeyj: 2@D 1@S 1@C and at least 6 trumps|pg||

nt|copeyj: and another good result for England from next door here|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W got way overboard and Sally Brock told them it wasn't making|pg||
nt|athene: ok a classic misunderstanding here i think|pg||
nt|athene: if you double then bid a new suit that should not be natural and strong|pg||
nt|suketbombi: another 10 card fit|pg||
nt|psyck: NS have a 4@s sacrifice, but not findable|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: because with a strong shapely hand you start by bidding your suits not by neg Xing|pg||
nt|mgb81: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: so nash's 4@C really caused a lot of problems|pg||
nt|athene: probably interpreted as a cue bid supporting diamonds|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to the movie Gross as south doubled 7@D|pg||
nt|copeyj: I doubt it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to find 3 nt here for e/w ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: well its less likely that Sally passed it as north!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ianmcc: N/S probably 10 tx in @h but not enough in high cards to bid it|pg||

nt|suketbombi: would you open that hnad?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Solid 1 @S - I love it...!|pg||

mb|2C!|an|16+ or !s!c|nt|mgb81: "I didn't want to push the opponents into 7NT partner"|pg||
nt|dima:  South rates his hand as too good for 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They sort of have the values, but its a bit of a misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Alice Kaye will do well to take the low road and bid 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: well everyone will remember a 7@D not too long ago where the defender with the @DA had to double to gain on the board|pg||
nt|athene: and it wasn't at a humble level either|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Or the 7@D this EW pair bid against Scotland earlier today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Made on a finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well it was a quasi marked finesse Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: the hand under AQ@S had overcalled a vulnerable @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, they surely knew that :)|pg||
nt|dburn: very good auction, that was|pg||
nt|mgb81: one of the juniors watching has just quoted the old rhyming adage "Misfit -time to quit"|pg||
nt|copeyj: Let's not talk about slams anyway after the one in the first stanza of the day today|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Simon forgets to tell that the hand with @HQxxx bid the grand slam although her partner never cuebid hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But she found a void opposite|pg||
nt|dburn: her partner had guaranteed first-round control in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk1: When did she do that?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She never bid hearts|pg||
nt|mgb81: is Alice really still in the tank?|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D looks pushy here and east hasn't got any easy way to just invite it based on the diamond suit quality, has she?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: She jumped from 3NT to 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: when she bid six clubs as a grand slam try opposite a partner who had cue-bid 4@s when she could have cue-bid 4@h|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bill tries unsuccessfully to get us back on track|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Well, not much action right now, Sarah :)|pg||
nt|athene: there is a lot of action|pg||
nt|athene: but it's all in east's mind at the moment|pg||
nt|athene: she sees a big, fat 920 at the end of the rainbow|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Palli is agressive - was thinking of bidding 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hawe45: Par is 5 @S doubled 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: may get to 4 hearts here |pg||
nt|dima:  West opening is very aggressive, but he's protected by big club structure|pg||
nt|psyck: may have thought, but unlikely to act on it vul :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nothing breaks, best to stay low  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Gazzili in one of its many forms. Presuably East needs 9HCp to give a positive with 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 1370 even|pg||
nt|mgb81: as predicted she wheels out the woolley cue bid|pg||
nt|steshome:  East's first Lady Milne, I do believe, and the first of many, I'm sure|pg||
nt|copeyj: true speak Sarah|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Absolutely, she is only 24|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzdh: E-W open every 11 count and most 10 counts :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Much more dangerous to re-open in the no fit auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N did not think - my fault|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: likely to be duplicate auction in other room |pg||
nt|santyclz: You wouldn't really want to be there seeing both hands single dummy, even vul at imps.|pg||
nt|dima:  Not much of a problem in the play again.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45: Surprising, that South with 10  HCP and an opening bid from partner, just sells out to 4 @S undoubled|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mgb81: yes East was a reserve last year just misisng out on her first lady milne but this year she and Bryony qualified comfortably in the trials|pg||
nt|mgb81: good work|pg||
nt|athene: now east still might not want to bid 4@D because that might sound as though she looked for 3nt, didn't find a stop, and gave up|pg||

nt|sybarra: not sure I know the relays here|pg||
nt|dima:  So East is going to relay 4 times to finish in 3NT or 4@s?|pg||

nt|hawe45: 14-16|pg||
nt|cuttysark: can't afford to draw trump, again|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45: My 460 were based on a @S-lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rational of these tranfer positives with wrong sided Nt often has a huge Disadvantage I feel|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West has shown 6-4 Majors and 8+ HCP, East has just shown 16+|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dima:  Well you can't have it all - most of the time and especially on slam hands 1@c opener is going to finish at the helm|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|dima:  And most of the time you'll make the game on power|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: and this 3 nt plays better with the  W hand as dummy on S on lead (imo) |pg||
pc|dK|nt|suketbombi: ye as Dima said has it's own advantaage the system have to live with the problems|pg||
nt|dima:  An interesting point about the lead - if NS know that W has 6-4 in majors they might try to conceal diamond split|pg||
nt|sybarra: true in any system, has advantages and disadvantages on certain hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Interesting point Dima|pg||
nt|dima:  Had N led @d 2 (4th best I presume) declarer might be tempted to win @d J|pg||
nt|iceak:  In deal 1 - Arons team made 9 imps - contract 3@s minus 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: When declarer's shape is pretty much known, you probably should give wrong count on every opportunity|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes good point Dima|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dima:  Communication cutting move|pg||

nt|sybarra: easy from this  vantage point but at the table?......|pg||

nt|suketbombi: declerar knows the @D split and the position of @H Ace has to guess weather to finesse @S or for @HJ both working here|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|c6|nt|vugraphzdh: North will probably get squeezed out of his @D trick|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hawe45: No defensive-award for playing the @H Ace in the first trick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hawe45: The Jack is better - leaving the guess to West, how is the "H-situation|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Our operators never make mistakes. Commentators make plenty|pg||
nt|vugraphzaw: OK...now I'm cross...lol|pg||
nt|mgb81: That's what happens when you let Scottish bbo oeprators loose on the English match|pg||
nt|hawe45: Result board 5, pls?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 1@c standard opening|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|cuttysark: SOme scoers in now from boards 1&2: EW played 3NT on 1, but Baldursson brought home 4@S on 2, so all square|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: tartan usualy 5/5,  maybe  a diam. in with his clubs? |pg||
mb|2C!|an|Stayman|nt|sybarra: the "precision" 2 @C |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|hawe45: Difficult bid for North now|pg||
nt|peachy: Bow North has a lot of info to convey, perhaps the only choice at this point is heart cuebid|pg||
nt|peachy: *Now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The Law is not protecting E-W very well here, 9 card fit but even 2@H might be expensive|pg||
nt|hawe45: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: in the context of their earlier opening this East hand is a super max:)|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@s has no chance|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Hard to picture E-W making a game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No wonder when they have only 20 HCP and a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: bold 2 @D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a passed hand - an Icelandic passed hand, even|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar is thinking. Shall I check if he has hair on the cheast? :)|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Easily 200 in 2 @H D|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT seems to be reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1NT 18-19 Bal|pg||
nt|mgb81: This is why you should play 1C 1H X as take out without 4 spades - you have to make stupid passes like the one hre|pg||
nt|dima:  4@c - 4@h - 4@s - pass?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It would be nice if that were penalties, and when West has denied a major maybe it should be|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mgb81: However she came to the party on the next round which is good|pg||
nt|copeyj: in fact you should play X as 4+@S and 1@S as takeout with 4@S in truth Michael :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT looks OK despite poor guard in @c|pg||
nt|hawe45: I vote for 500|pg||
nt|peachy: S takes the plus, not unreasonable these colors|pg||
nt|iceak:  Both think their had is good - but no fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: cards friendly for declarer |pg||
nt|ianmcc: which red suit would you go for?|pg||
nt|hawe45: When you double hard - defend well|pg||
nt|iceak:  hand|pg||
nt|dima:  BTW was 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S is forcing, yes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes must have been|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Probably 3@H was forcing, but not promising another bid|pg||
nt|iceak:  better chance in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|steshome:  The play isn't going to be very interesting here|pg||
nt|hawe45: This is about the first penalty double, I´ve seen for months|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|mgb81: bah that's too modern for me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Has partner one diamond, or two?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@D did the trick here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: provided he ducks|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Frank Budai, Australia |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They have a system they are comfortable with and that's what matters|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sedcude by @D7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Low level doubled partscore is a rare bird at IMP scoring|pg||
nt|hawe45: East has no way to his hand for playing @H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dima:  North goes for forcing game with his 4 trumps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even seduced|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, as much as I fancy to lead my singleton no matter what, this was the moment to hide the singleton @C with the trumps :)|pg||
nt|psyck: only 3@s, 2@h, 2@c for dec due to lack of communication|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mgb81: Indeed it is playing a natural system where you can raise clubs, but it feels like having to pass th west cards after 1C (1H) isn't a good idea.|pg||
nt|hawe45: This @D Jack is candidate to worse defence in april 2011|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now North can not play @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dima:  nice play the @h 8|pg||
nt|psyck: wow, 3N= on deal 5 other table|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hawe45: We might be close to 670 instead of safe 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D K  was not well thought out|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|frankaus: @DJ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45: But the 200 will be the result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer still has to work on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If South stays away from them|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: he has to open up the clubs now, to get another entry, well done|pg||
nt|dima:  loses to H9x offside otherwise gains|pg||
nt|dima:  Well unless South is brilliant to duck @h AK|pg||
nt|iceak:  expects to go down - minimizing damages|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I don't think Jón Baldursson ever expects to go down :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: I think he's in trouble|pg||
nt|santyclz: @ds need qx, 10x or 3-3, plus it's easier to pitch three times from dummy, so I'd of course do the opposite of what the world class players do.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|suketbombi: has to hope the !L is with North and restrict trump losser to 1 no other chance |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|suketbombi: @HK|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised he didnt pitch the @D |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: have to sort of untangle this hand |pg||
nt|frankaus: if pd has lead stiff then its irrelavant - id pd has XX then dec must have AK@D tight|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If partner has a stiff diamond you give declarer a cheap trick which might be his ninth - much eaiser for us watching|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like defence will untangle it for  declarer |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: he'll have to play @c off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hawe45: If they get 500, I´m sure they had 800|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 2 off|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he wanted to come back to his hand witha @D ruff if the dream layout was there|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think the defence told him the truth and a @c it should be|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Valid point from a kibitzer - perhaps West more likely to pass 2@DX with AKx|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Clubs not blocked when they break 2-2, so all is well|pg||

mb|2C|an|18-19 bal, 22+bal or GF no M|nt|steshome:  Boo|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mgb81: Is North playing a weak or strong no trump?|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 7 ir by far more sporty|pg||

mb|3D|nt|hawe45: is|pg||
nt|iceak:  1D doubled?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|copeyj: 15-17 I believe|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am with you Michael|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is bad for the home internationals for the same team to win on all occasions|pg||
nt|dburn: useful result for ENgland, this - East-West can make 3NT, and North-South can make 1NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: would definitely open 1|pg||
nt|mgb81: The north hand feels worht an upgrade given the good suit and quality of the controls|pg||
nt|dburn: or at any rate, did make 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: can't figure out why 3@d instead of @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: seems misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3NT looks a practical shot from South|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: i think it is ok to open either 12-14 OR 15-17 NT with that north hand|pg||
nt|athene: it's right on the borderline and the extra tactical advantage for 1nt opener means you bend it as necessary|pg||
nt|santyclz: To view more than one table at a time: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  Open 1 browser window per table.|pg||
nt|hawe45: Might know, what 3 @C means??? |pg||
nt|hawe45: Anyway, it cannot be that hand|pg||
nt|psyck: S may have took is as minors as need not have @c if 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: has to be South playing it for sure |pg||
nt|cuttysark: North contemplating slam, East wondering how cheap a save might be|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N showing facial expressions - looking to the air|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lack of aces should put him off|pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  Trumps structure is not good enough to convert|pg||
nt|sybarra: one would thing |pg||
mb|p|nt|dima:  9 tricks next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may make declarer play the clubs right |pg||
nt|psyck: *as 1@c need...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|mgb81: England have got another brucey bonus board coming on 24, but all the imps in the world wont matter unless scotland lose some|pg||
nt|athene: there is at least 1/2 hcp's worth of advantage in opening 1nt, after all - surely more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: learn to love your aces - hands with none are never great hands :)|pg||

pc|sK|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|santyclz: Time for a caffeine run. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: this will be a costly misunderstanding with a vul game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  North will lose her @cA if she does not take it|pg||
nt|peachy: A lot of 2/1 players use 3C here as invitational with long clubs, passable or bid 3NT |pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: But to be clear, I am not familiar with their method of course|pg||
nt|iceak:  10 tricks most surely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @C is no bad contract. Without a @H-lead, it might succeed even with a bad @C-break|pg||

nt|copeyj: they are having a horrible time of it|pg||
nt|mgb81: So in the other room Ruth Connelly, who is somewhat of an agressive bidder, bid 1C, then 2C and gave herself 5C when 4S came back to her|pg||
nt|mgb81: Sally Brock though long and hard whether to bid 5S, but after some though she doubled for penalties.|pg||
nt|athene: if west really wanted to bid over 4@H then at least bid 4NT so partner can choose diamonds when it's right|pg||
nt|hawe45: There is a faster method to get 660 - just claim after the lead|pg||
nt|iceak:  4@h shaky|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceak:  much depends on @d|pg||
nt|sybarra: N probably just bids 4 @H  |pg||
mb|2C|an|same|nt|dima:  3@h or 1@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|an|4+!s|nt|athene: maybe she felt it might help in the play to have concealed the side suit|pg||
nt|mgb81: It doesnt even look like 4S is that easy - if south plays ace, king and ruff s diamond low east can overuff the 7 with the 8 and bang another turmp back|pg||
nt|sybarra: some part score here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: thin 4@s here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe 2 sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit lite for my style of 2 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: Moya Kelly as south had a few choices after 1C P 1H - she could double, bid 2NT, or just 1S.|pg||
nt|steshome:  Um, I'm with Simon on this one|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you show the 5-5 you can't really show the values - 2nt would usually be weaker|pg||
nt|copeyj: Why Sarah, what does Simon think? :)|pg||
mb|2S|an|18-19|nt|sybarra: can they get to it (nad do you want to be in it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: This way he got to bid both Dima :) 1 and 3 @H|pg||
nt|iceak:  south bids 4@h most likely|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it is like opening 2 nt? |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: she doesn't know but she knows you will be right|pg||
nt|athene: i'm with you too|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no & no|pg||
mb|3C!|an|!d|mb|p|nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|steshome:  Yes, you're right Bill made the 4NT comment.  But of course I'm with you in any event|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does not help England's cause that the Welsh are committing suicide at the moment|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: on non @h lead dec has to find @s fin to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mgb81: eek! I can understand both of EW actions (unlike -360 against 1S X) but this is going to get murdered on a trump lead|pg||
nt|dima:  :)|pg||
nt|dima:  seems natural to play double finesse in @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  Karl probably plays low @s and JÃ³n low @d|pg||
nt|iceak:  SÃ¦var sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: time for north to get out the big stick of justice|pg||
nt|athene: the 5-level is no time to volunteer 2-card support|pg||
nt|mgb81: this will probably be 1100 as well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Wish I knew their methods, but I dont|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Showing 4@H and 5+ @C|pg||
nt|peachy: There is alert on 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: well... |pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: 6-5 come alive, yes - but only when you actually have a trump fit in one of your long suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@C probably puppet to 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: tought to time this one |pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think a balanced 18-19 was included in 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: it was|pg||
nt|sybarra: hence the 2 @S alert |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Then one uses all sorts of transfers and relays and ends in 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: west has followed the rule "6-2 come alive"|pg||
nt|athene: or perhaps it should be "6-2 in the glue"|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I think we all agree that 3@H was an overbid|pg||
nt|mgb81: how about "6-5-2, that wont do"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: people often bid too aggressively when they have shortage in opps' suit but not that big a fit for partner|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Friendly defence may keep this to 800|pg||
nt|athene: these hands are really difficult to control|pg||
nt|athene: when the ruffing value is with only 2 trumps - even with 3 trumps it can get out of hand very easily|pg||
nt|mgb81: Alice can get pout for 800 now - it looks like she can cross ruff but the 7 of hearts will come into play|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: LOTT say 16 tricks, looks more like 18 to me.|pg||
nt|santyclz: (says)|pg||
nt|sybarra: low spade and ?|pg||
nt|dima:  now low @d and he has to guess |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Actually a trump from West kills the contract|pg||
nt|dima:  true heart is better as specs mention|pg||
nt|sybarra: scary spot,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure it can be made |pg||
pc|c3|pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Perhaps only 17.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, then 3NT after that apparently showed the clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Attitude lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: club return easy,  @D a guess, (with good guess will bring it home) hts and messes up communication |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Defenders must take care not to set up that long club - maybe had to switch to hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: clubs 4/4  is that enough?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk1: Scotland let a 4@S through that should have gone down as the play went, so +29 only now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: north would have done better to keep the spades|pg||
nt|mgb81: hello|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks like she's in the game now....|pg||
nt|athene: just let a little club go - what use is that?|pg||
nt|mgb81: that is a very expensive slip from south - turned 800 into 300 if declarer reads it right|pg||
nt|athene: if north had kept all her spades this was 1100 just the same|pg||
nt|athene: just ace and a trump, end of story|pg||
nt|mgb81: now eats has virtually claim on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk1: This is the board where Wales were allowed to make 4@S|pg||
nt|steshome:  Bit barking to play at the 5-level on a grotty 8-card fit.  Mind you, the opponents played at the 5-level on a grotty 7-card fit |pg||
nt|sybarra: opps|pg||
nt|iceak:  @h Q could drop - declares does not know|pg||

nt|jbennet: again at this situations its good to have 2 ways to bid spades.|pg||
nt|jbennet: N now faces a guess. does South have full valus or does he only competing?|pg||
nt|dima:  2@d is likely to be a constructive @h raise - 7-9 or so with 2@h raise reserved for really junky hands|pg||
nt|jbennet: the same should be applied to NS.|pg||
nt|iceak:  seems 4 no more than 9 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|jbennet: so 2H and 2 sp both show spade suit.|pg||
nt|dima:  North might try 3@h as gametry in @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: brrrrrrrrr |pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, it was great!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south might double here rather than bidding 3@S? |pg||
nt|hawe45: I would never bid 3 @S in this situation - just helping opponents|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well, depends on what 2@S meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: I am quite confident, that East knows, who is in position of the @C Queen = 680|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@S was 8-13 balanced, no @S stopper|pg||
nt|henryb:  you stay inside where it is warm and well lit -- always dark outside|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: so as not to overstate the support|pg||
nt|mgb81: NS can't make very much either a club ruff or a heart trick for the second undertrick|pg||
nt|steshome:  Double's probably game-try|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but of south only had competing valus 3 sp is likely to be too high|pg||
nt|dima:  Oh well he makes Sandra Landy game try - bid it first then try to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|iceak:  Favorable @c|pg||
nt|dima:  They might know each others 3rd seat opening bids |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Friendly @C layout might see this home|pg||
nt|dima:  brilliant small @h lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A small @H lead would have been killing|pg||
nt|iceak:  JÃ³n more likely to play small @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Seems that declarer might be tempted to work on @D which will not work|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I understand the hospitality is fantastic|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: lucky not to get hit in this|pg||
nt|athene: east might well consider double if really in need of imps|pg||

nt|jbennet: but lucky break makes it possible.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East thought there might be game if partner had some heart support - when he does not, screeching brakes|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mgb81: East does best to switch to hearts and then if north finesses she can give a club ruff for 3 down|pg||

nt|cuttysark: The one we just saw has been flattened|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after 2nt they are likely to end in 4@H the same in here|pg||

mb|2H!|an|18-19|nt|vugraphzdh: I actually wondered if he would open 6@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: Many play 3@c to be good w/@hs.|pg||
nt|hawe45: @D-lead - let´s see Søvar make the overtrick - but he will probably put his money on a @C-finesse. But with spectators, one is obliged to make the squeeze|pg||

nt|athene: there's surely a good case for just bidding 4@H over 2nt with that north hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|steshome:  Checking back for the 4-4 spade fit - might play better|pg||

nt|henryb:  standard transfer auction|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|mgb81: Here North south employ a common treatment whereby 3S is forcing with 4 spades and 4 or 6 hearts|pg||

nt|dima:  next case|pg||
nt|sybarra: need take the club or they dont get it|pg||
nt|dima:  might try to steal a heart trick but if it must be 5-5 then unlikely to work|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn is world champion from Yokohama 1991|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|mgb81: Declarer made a unusual play when she ducked the club lead in both hands|pg||
nt|peachy: if ten tricks are makeable some way|pg||
nt|hawe45: Why did South NOT support partners 3 @S - instead of bidding what he had allready showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Well bid by N-S I think|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mgb81: had she ducked the second club from dummy she would have made 2 tricks which would have been enough. as it is a spade switch will lead her to down one I think|pg||
nt|cuttysark: As are his pair in the other room, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: right you are McGowan|pg||
nt|sybarra: this was the team that was the surprise winner |pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: After AK clubs located and now SK, the HQ will not be hard to locate as with opening hand, E likely would have said something on 1D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South has no reason to think that @S are better than @H, the @H fit is actually much better|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: W is likely to take the @H hook |pg||

nt|steshome:  Hello Roland! |pg||
nt|mgb81: north might be thinking of a slam, but even the 5 level might be too high.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now S has to make it |pg||
nt|iceak:  SparisjÃ³Ã°ur seems to be winning back|pg||
nt|jbennet: very well put. |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not find it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lebesohl, probably the first step in showing 4hearts and game values|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: on a club lead however |pg||
nt|dima:  no play|pg||
nt|jbennet: everybody has a "reptile brain" ; which is governed by emotions not by common sense and judgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: you put it more succinctly dima|pg||
nt|iceak:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: if one should randomize a lareg number of layouts consistent with south:s opening bid.|pg||
nt|dima:  N does have a touching trust in his partner's suit quality preempt, but still 4@s is unLAWful and will lose IMPs here|pg||
nt|jbennet: then everybody would find that to enter with 4H is a huge huge losing bid..|pg||
nt|sybarra: could get very ugly if he goes up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  you have 8 trumps , opponents rate to have at most 9 so ..|pg||
nt|jbennet: and 4 spades was also a stupid action.|pg||
nt|iceak:  No reason to go up with K|pg||
nt|dima:  It could be from Q87 or so he preys ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is a very solid citizen, so North definately imagined 4@S as a rather good contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: but again the "repitle brain" caused a losing call. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: "Only" needing the ace of @C with the 4@H bidder|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes but if now 4 spades makes.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the 4 h is surely likely to be 3 off at least.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But a double seems to stand out at IMPs. Collecting a safe 300-800, instead of a 50% 620|pg||
nt|dima:  How in the world do you come to 10 tricks? Even opposite AK10xxxx + side King you need more then ONLY Ace onside|pg||
mb|3N!|an|prom !h and stopper|nt|mgb81: a misguess in spades is all it takes to go one down, as the two discards are useless to the south hand|pg||
nt|mgb81: ah thats a practical shot|pg||
nt|sybarra: alerfted leb |pg||
nt|sybarra: *alerted |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  slow shows the major. fast denies the major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: this is penultimate bd of this set |pg||
nt|santyclz: N didn't find that lovely @c preempt and e-w got to 6@s-1 for Vestri's 1st big score.|pg||
nt|sybarra: told you .... |pg||
nt|sybarra: was playing to make it |pg||
nt|jbennet: but bidding is a sort of "alfa male" action.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 3NT perfectly makeable, but scary|pg||
nt|henryb:  a treatment invented (or at least first shown to me) by Helgemo|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you were sure that you wanted to play in 3NT you would bid it right away|pg||
nt|henryb:  in contrast to showing the stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: will E make one more try? |pg||
nt|henryb:  No, bidding 3N directly (in this method) says I do not have hearts|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has his think: if @CKJ were @CA slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn seems to be in pain|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean East (sorry)|pg||
nt|henryb:  get him a couple of Tylenol|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is that a variant of lebensohl too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes. Instead of "slow shows a stopper" it is "Slow shows the other major"|pg||
nt|henryb:  stopper is shown by whether you bid 3N or cue bid|pg||
mb|4N!|an|RKCB propably|mb|p|mb|5D!|an|1 ace|mb|p|nt|mgb81: One of the kibbitzers has suggested north might raise to 4NT, but if souths bid 6NT with something like KQJx, KJx, J10xx, Kx there will be a small problem in the ace department|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is disapointment |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT is often played in this auction as "two places to play"|pg||
nt|psyck: 1 level higher than the other room, but unlikely that anyone was getting any higher|pg||
nt|henryb:  when W shows 0 or 3, will E think W has 3?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @s now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Horrible bidding by E-W leads to a horrible contract :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: hehe, NS have 4H|pg||
nt|peachy: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, 1 or 4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: (the 5 @D ibid showing 1 or 4 so can only be 1  key card|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he knows not 4|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|Walddk1: I have Scotland and England tied on 88 VPs before the last 16 boards|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 9|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|peachy: The ace just could not be right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzdh: N-S actually made 4@H in the open room !|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Can you confirm, Simon?|pg||
nt|iceak:  if from 78Q - loosing 1@s and 2@c|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|peachy: difficult with such a trump break and a side ace to dislodge|pg||

nt|Walddk1: England and NIBU both fined 1 VP for slow play I am told|pg||
nt|mgb81: this looks to be a slam on a finesse for east west - I dont think they will bid it though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: neat overtrick|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand of this set |pg||
nt|hawe45: Nice END-board here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Who said the 5 level belongs to the opponents?|pg||
nt|hawe45: In 6 @H you might easily guess the @D|pg||
nt|iceak:  new leader|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok now last hand of this set |pg||
nt|psyck: nice score from the other room, not too easy to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: last hand of this segment now, thanks Hans, Our operator Stefan for exc ellent job, and all spectars for coming.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to all of the commentators: for example Dima, Johan and Isak   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to Icelandic Bridge Federation and to those that helped bring this tourney to BBO.  We have enjoyed being with you.   |pg||
nt|iceak:  5@c seem to be easy|pg||
nt|dima:  thanks all, 5@c is on for EW but requires some work|pg||
nt|sybarra: Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Isak, as always a great job!  Thanks!|pg||
mb|2C|an|18-19 bal, 22+ bal or GF|nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|mgb81: Although having said that it never occured to me that Alice was going to leap to a grand slam two sets earlier with a flat 11 count, so who knows...|pg||
nt|mgb81: Ah the legendary Bill Frisby! Hello Bill|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty also to Liz and Henry, for your time and insights  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: easy slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Isak our terrific operator. Gre4at Job! |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Joe and Ian, for you great comments  |pg||
nt|hawe45: and now 3 NT from Sævar|pg||
nt|hawe45: But 2 @C is NOT @C, so...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and again Stefan,  a great big thanks to you!!! |pg||
nt|dima:  NS will quickly be in 4@h i think as you have to playing vs. strong club|pg||
nt|iceak:  double 5-7 I think|pg||
nt|dima:  1@d is likely to be transfer overcall, X is usually 5-7|pg||
mb|2S!|an|denies Major|nt|sybarra: we also love our specs,  who give us helpful comments and thoughts  |pg||
nt|sybarra: and of course specs, we always love your input and comments to us. |pg||
nt|sybarra: back in about 40 min or so  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed we do - thank you everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  I believe (not sure) that 2@s shows clubs and weak hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45: 3 @H now - and off we go|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in just over 1/2 hour  (15 til the hour is schedule) |pg||
nt|dima:  Aha - then 1@d is Majors or minors so EW will have some space to sort things out|pg||
mb|2N!|an|18-19|nt|hawe45: OH - 5 even better|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar has more ambitions than that :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sorry, Karl|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: Sævar, on the other hand, must have some ambitions now.|pg||
nt|psyck: E knows their values are limited, but great shape & fit will likely make him try |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C to play?|pg||
nt|sybarra: now |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 2@s denies Major|pg||
mb|3D!|an|!c|nt|athene: east might get vaguely interested facing drury i suppose|pg||
nt|mgb81: 2C here is drury showing 9+ and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|dburn: some danger with this - if it persuades West that @cK is a good card for slam purposes...|pg||
nt|mgb81: 3C is some sort of long suit try|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand if 3@C is a long suit try, west must feel that at least some of those spade cards are wasted|pg||
nt|mgb81: wets might bid 3S now...4D from east 4H from west will east then pass it?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but facing @sxx  @hAKQxxx  @dA  @cAxxx, slam is well worth bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to all the specs who provide us with comments and humor through out |pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx Shirley & Joe|pg||
nt|friggi: it should do|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: we scheduled to back at:  6:45 am Los Angeles, 9:45 am New York, 15.45 Paris, 2:45 pm London, 11:45 pm Sydney|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceak:  seems 5 imps to Aron|pg||
nt|dima:  3NT will be peaceful -1|pg||
nt|dima:  though North will have to find 5 pitches on @c let us see ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Luckily for North no endplay can hurt him|pg||
nt|dima:  1@d + 3@s + 1@h survives|pg||
nt|dima:  since partner will help in @h|pg||
nt|iceak:  Has to know S has 5@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  seems like less than best methods where N with @sKJ96 cant opt to let partner play 2@sX|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to bid @D, when you belong in 3 @C...? |pg||
nt|henryb:  I find this auction is upsetting my equilibrium|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4 @D cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @h cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|mgb81: ok as usual I was nowhere nbear the real auction. The customary bash of game from west and east passes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Rather flat board perhaps, 500 N-S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Flat, but not dull|pg||
nt|hawe45: Might "only" bring 500, depending a lot on the @C-guess|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, was just going to say the same :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: you will either need a coffee or a mimosa for next set |pg||
nt|henryb:  or perhaps to sleep through it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Spade lead is not best here, but I guess any lead will do|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: XX |pg||
nt|sybarra: first round control |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: The x gives them an extra round of bidding.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  East can almost count the high cards|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will think - then duck|pg||
nt|henryb:  why think first?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He is a thinking player :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Aðalsteinn always thinks - |pg||
nt|sybarra: and E was Liz's pard in tourney (was it Malta?) |pg||
nt|henryb:  but this is a position where you duck automatically, and think later|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rhodes - first ever transnational Mixed Teams|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry Liz forgot what you said|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|mgb81: today this was well judged - tomorrow move the ace of clubs and there would be recriminations all round...|pg||
nt|friggi: 6@S plus +1|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Good defence, kils dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: nicely done, W knows there cannot be 2 quick losers after 4@c cue so hopes to lose only the 1 missing key card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cuttysark: North is known to be balanced, so must have at least 2 clubs. |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|henryb:  Rhodes, Malta, both small Mediterranean islands. Easy to confuse|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|dima:  They should get it right|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South actually revoked on this trick, throwing a small @S while North is still in agony.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer noticed in a split second and turned his card around|pg||
nt|dima:  why revoked, he has no clubs ...?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Don't know if North saw it |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South played to the precent trick, out of turn|pg||
nt|dima:  Screen covers NE so likely no harm done|pg||
nt|iceak:  Could become directors problem|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|hawe45: North deserved this trick - after his 5 @H-bid|pg||
