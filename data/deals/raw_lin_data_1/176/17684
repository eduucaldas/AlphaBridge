mb|1D|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18, 5+@D|pg||
mb|1H!|an|@ least 3+ Hearts|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"    EW play their version of Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H could actually be 3 cards with 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||
nt|hawe45: The double was a BIG mistak!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures updating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C FG   ostensibly natural or values|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: i am getting suggestions from spectators, none of which seem to fit, anyway the result is an ugly contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D usually 11-18 with 5+@D|pg||

nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||

mb|4N|nt|warrens:  and Welland's bid was aggressive too.  a bad combo|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2nd seat, Zia does not open the strong major - only in 3rd or perhaps 4th suit, with Reverse Drury available|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfa: Zia and Welland playing a different system from Welland and Bramley|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with Warren that 1@S at the unsuitable vul was not the best choice of bid - want to stay low, so should bid low (open 1@C). |pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  7@D?|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfa: Zia says contract is good but that doesnt mean ill make it|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he cashes one high trump in each hand, he can make 7.  needs to be able to ruff the 3rd round of @C's low if North pitches.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H set @D, so 4NT was RKCB for @D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: To set up RKCB for @S, then West would have doubled 2@H to suggest 4 @S's, not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  actually, with the @D 10 singleton, it's easier than that|pg||

nt|poohbear: 2H shows a bad raise . This qualifies!|pg||
nt|warrens:  well this one makes 6@C if you find the offside !K of @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No explanation of 2 spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C seems more likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: father and son Bessis defended correctly against 5@DX to pick up 5 imps|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told if Geir remembers 2 spades is splinter|pg||
mb|3H|nt|woozle: If west is rebidding in a suit here, prefer 2H to any level of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today's Daily Bulletin includes the VP scale     http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/daily-bulletin|pg||
nt|poohbear: helps West as now he has a clear value showing dbl available|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, sorry, 6@C only makes from East, not West, 'cause of the @H ruff|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd singleton King of the set ---  always in a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: I wonder if EW play Support DBL  in this situation|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: Norway in 6NT??|pg||
nt|woozle: At least 2H shows a good hand and doesn't risk missing heart fits|pg||
nt|hawe45: Facing a non-passed partner, West should bid 4 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: so now Norway +12 IMP (17-13?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made 6NT and are now +12|pg||
nt|woozle: should be quant here|pg||
nt|woozle: West hasn't learned anything new to incite blackwood|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S convention card says 2@d transfer, but some notion that is forbidden (do not know why|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C denies a club stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and is forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@c sh promise 0-4-5-4|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd worry if it denied a club stopper and was non-forcing|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|woozle: 6-red better than 6NT here, although 6D might fail with an overruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures udating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is not uncommon over doubles in this country|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: director was called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: east and north left the room to talk to him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some misunderstanding about the 2d bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: first north said showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT would also have been forcing. Some play that 3@D is passable, and others play Ingberman 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco hasn't shown ANY sign of life|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ng|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: Which is a good treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45: For those who like good bidding - some more boards are coming up...|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think he should dbl again. partner can bid 3@s freely with doubt since he has denied more than 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about 3N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and NS win the war|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 3NT is scary with no idea if he has a source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  probably alerted differently on the two sides of the table also|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner bids 3@s over dbl then his 3nt shows doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Fallenius made it easier for Moss when he bid 2N instead of DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco says umph|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  he should play a @C to the Ace since he knows a @H ruff is possible|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: interesting question  --   how close is Piekarek to (1@C)-2N  instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Tor and Geir having a discussion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @D is better than 6 NT!|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D makes if you take the spade finesse, fails if you try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: But a lot more tricky to play|pg||
nt|woozle: makes if you go for a S-C squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu: will Marie bid 6NT - I exp that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made on that squeeze Kieran mentioned|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|woozle: I've almost forgotten what it's like to bid without brakes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: sorry misclick :)|pg||
nt|hawe45: I was afraid, Maria was thinking of bidding 7...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She has not made 6@D yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In fact, I think it's in jeopardy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks normal to ruff a club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: @s8 lead??|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: the agreement is that 2 d shows hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: south alerted it was hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: north also|pg||
nt|henryb:  Although transfers are allowed only over 1@c and natural NT bids, there is some reason to believe that transfers after takeout doubles are a defense to the opponent's convention and therefore legal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: after north saw trick 1 he notice his pt had spades and told gavin|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 4 ht or t ht |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcv: Finland made 4@h on board 26|pg||
nt|hawe45: 620 N/S - unbeatble - 12 IMP maybe for DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can she know that the squeeze will work? And if it does, why is 6@D better than 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: looks like 4@h might go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he showed the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 2@C on last board was a big position, especially with 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last bd of the 2nd round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it could be 5 5 the 2nt but North showed the 3 diamond cared|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: no ruling yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||
nt|scotty: What card should East plasy at trick one?  @s3 or @s6?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i keep getting into a loop, still not sure if down 2 or 3 here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: wondering if Helness was supposed to cash @CA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith vs NT -- but does that apply looking at dummy's @C?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both respond     i've got 9 cards left|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired and grace period|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: on  8 the Bessis pair did find the 5@DX save against 5@C|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: just announced less than 15 min left in the round|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
