nt|Walddk2: 5@C making here but it's not a great contract|pg||
nt|athene: not really biddable though, i suppose|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|athene: unless NS get together in hearts and force the issue|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have always liked 1@C when 4-4 in the minors (because you can find a fit in either minor). Unfortunately, the world's bridge teachers disagree - for some reason.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is takeout without spades, i imagine|pg||
nt|athene: well David perhaps you should have a game with Garozzo|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: The reason is that many bypass diamonds to show a major instead|pg||
nt|athene: he is a big advocate of 1@C with 44 minors|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must be thinking back to the 1940s when it was fine to open 1@D and rebid 2@C on 4-4 shape.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: yes, the main reason for opening 1@D is you are supposed to be able to show the clubs conveniently, but with only 44, you aren't planning ever to show it as a 2-suiter anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you play Walsh, you bypass a longer diamond suit for a 4-card major if you are not strong enough to force to game|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Makes sense|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: there are some times when it is slightly more convenient to have opened 1@D with 44 - for example 1@D (1@S) X pass now you can bid 2@C if you have nothing in spades and 3244, ...|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but I don't see that this is enough to cause you to open 1@D on such hands.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|athene: although i think most experts would just bid 1nt there anyway even without a stop :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: one other issue is that 1@D tends to be taken a bit more seriously by partner than 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever raises clubs anyway but they might raise diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well open the minor that partner will care about|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is a sound reason to open 1@D - if you do not guarantee clubs with a 1@C opening.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club suit died 50 years|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamonds rapidly following suit|pg||
nt|athene: but Garozz is very big on opening 1@C with 44 and responding 1@D with 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Does he then rebid a major with 4-4 shape? (In the French style).|pg||

mb|p|pc|hA|nt|benjy: i think its risky|pg||

nt|benjy: Although 5@C makes, it's not a game you want to be in|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good discipline from both. E-W have a very lucky make in 5C or 5D so any pushing might egg them on|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: rubbish if there is game on anywhere i want to be in it|pg||

pc|d6|nt|benjy: so are you suggesting that you would be in game on the e/w cards here?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|ppiglett: It is commonly accepted that you need to be 42% non vul games and 36% Vul games at Imps. This is about 24%|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jbennet: North did indeed have 4c support; yet 3 h wouldnt have achieved anything positive.|pg||

nt|brolucius: expert game, as on the last hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nicely bid by Auken and Zia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a good auction to match this result|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: This pair played in 4m in the first set too.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Wrong policy to pass over the Multi with Simpson's cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Get in immediately|pg||
nt|athene: there are defences to a multi-2@D which let you show a t/o double of hearts right away|pg||
nt|athene: and that might be sensible|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: He seems to have shown his hand pretty well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would not double at this level on much less.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In my book he can't have this hand for his double now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: That hand would have doubled 2@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both pairs bid it well.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would rather be able to show a t/o double of hearts at a lower level - this is risky AND less precise, for sure|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|athene: but if he had to pass first time then he has to double 3@H for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and what about if he gets 4@H?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is much to be said for an immediate double, suggesting 12-15 or a strong hand. But you could end up with a disaster if the NV multi bidder happens to have spades instead of ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: hearts. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What are the odds, David?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When you are 4-1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, Price's 5@D tells us that he knew how strong his partner was likely to be.|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure NS would have got to game if west had just responded a very gentle 2@H, actually|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are good, yes, and I would have doubled. Maybe they do not play that method.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: south will double 2@H, now north maybe just bids 3@D and even if that's lebensohl, south doesn't really do anything over it|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ppiglett: I probably should do more work on my Maths the minor game was more like 16 or17% - not a good prospect.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: did u never back a horse peter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|jbennet: Think sabine just made sort of invitaitonal sequence. but Zia might interpret it as showing 4 sp + longer Diamonds|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes - why?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and di u ver back a 20/1 winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: sabine giving S room to clrify hand type economically. would presumably have passed 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5@d very difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I backed Trevor Immelman at 390/.1 for the masters - and he won as u know|pg||
nt|benjy: i wonder if she would have corrected 3@S to 3NT to show doubt?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Never - nobody ever gave me a 20-1 tip. They always kept those to themselves|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i expect so|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzrt: 4NT not discussed, explains Zia|pg||
nt|benjy: well bid, this is the top spot|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Aren't the odds in golf so high to try and get people to stay away from backing Tiger and Phil. It is a simple numbers game.|pg||

nt|athene: bidding only 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is supposed to be in Las Vegas for the Cavendish|pg||
nt|athene: is just trusting south rather than partner|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Same with East's final pass. What does he think that West holds for his 3@S raise?|pg||
nt|athene: it's nearer to a slam try than an invitational raise, facing a double-plus-2@S bid|pg||
nt|athene: you know south is just having a little joke|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't agree with that. I put it at around 3.8@S. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: is perpetual optimism an instinct?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes thats it exactly|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes there was some traps in the play , but sabine is way too good to misplay hands like the previous one.|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: anyway going with the odds all the time is boring|pg||

nt|benjy: psychic XX from Zia|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, that psychic redouble fools them in the club game in Kandahar:)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Parner has a big hand with spades W should bid 4 I believe - tough for E now.|pg||
nt|benjy: 3@S? is a huge underbid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Double + bid shows 18-21|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you would round upwards. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: West had plenty to raise to game|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: once you accept that south has almost certainly psyched then any finesses you need are likely to be working|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe he was worried the redouble was honest and the third seat opener was dodgy|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's redouble is irrelevant to the meaning of the E-W bids, isn't it?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: but even so it's just a 4@S bid for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It is, David, just ignore it and trust your partner|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not least against Zia|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: at favourable|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is doing a lot of bidding on a flat hand.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: if you make a takeout double then cue like this it's pretty much always a strong hand with 3-card support|pg||
nt|athene: just because there are other bids you can make with other hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Auken is in 3NT next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think some people (zia maybe) actually say that double then cue definitely promises exactly 3 card support|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Yes, but he cue-bid twice and only had a flat 20-count, with an inadequate spade stopper for NT and no primary fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are committing suicide at both tables now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Mossop team|pg||
nt|athene: it would not be wildly aggressive for east to double this, in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps the 4@C bid put him off|pg||
nt|athene: making him think his @CK is not a trick, even though the ace is surely in dummy if not in partner's hand|pg||
nt|athene: there was some mention made earlier of "zia doubles" - when he was making his name at rubber bridge he used to love to double 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|athene: his theory was:|pg||
nt|athene: firstly, if people are in 5minor not 3nt probably they are not very good anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|athene: secondly, well, 11 tricks, that's a lot to ask, isn't it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think Colin Simpson is a retired Scotland Yard detective, but I don't think he can detect any winning line here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lol|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jbennet: seeing the legend ZIA to his left making a RD made him absolutely terrified. So he made a panic-looking pass|pg||
nt|ppiglett: he had bid his hand though but I would not have risked the pass.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: understandable, since the reason Zia is legendary is that he always has his bid|pg||
nt|ritong: and more|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing bothers John Carroll i can tell you but Garveys bid was highly invitational not weak|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The problem was the 3S bid. I understand East's pass far more than a poultry raise by W. West could do same with - xxx, xx, Qxxx, Qxxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: they are not using lebensohl 1NT as a response to P TO x on 1 major.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|benjy: One might just try 2NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: and the the prize for that was 5 - 7 IMP:s (dependning on many down 3NT is going to be -1 or -2 dependning on how whe plays the hearts).|pg||
nt|benjy: she effectively drove to game with her hand|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Oh yes forgot about the 2D bid. My judgement for these hand was if partner doubles and bid a suit you can raise to game with three trumps and an Ace (ish)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, regardless of what pass would have meant and what 2D showed, W had a game bid. especially against Zia. :) for God;s sake dont encourage him:):)|pg||
nt|benjy: 12 imps to Sinclair on 18 when 5@D went down|pg||
nt|benjy: and another 10 on 19 when they bid the cold 4@S|pg||

nt|jcomyn: anyone remember the herbert convention after a x|pg||

nt|jcomyn: then 2c by s shows a bust|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jbennet: its adviseable to have a way to show weakness as a response to P TO double.  |pg||
nt|ianmcc: one of the silier conventions|pg||
nt|ppiglett: d'accord|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcomyn: well it has one or two merits|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jbennet: 1NT= weakness is (a long term winning concept) BUT b) 95% av all players disagrees with that. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: like 1HX    1S (bust)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: one merit is that you dont have the "equal-level conversion" asymmetry -- you can double 1S  with long clubs:)|pg||
mc|8|nt|ppiglett: East might have cashed the diamond earlier - still going off|pg||
