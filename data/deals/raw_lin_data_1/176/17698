nt|kit: some are suggesting a trump lead thinking declarer will always get spades right -- but why would declarer always get spades right?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||

nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: HH opening 1-bids all show 4+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H could actually be 3 cards with 5+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have been tempted to overcall 1@S, this is a matter of style|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont seem to be posted yet|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: what are NS doing, all this looks strange|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably alerted as denying 4@H/@S  --  otherwise they overcall Raptor 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try refresh screen|pg||
nt|poohbear: 3@s was a super accept . Max with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=RELAY, INV+     but maybe he'll just gamble 3N??|pg||
nt|ritong: levin will have a tough bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: as you see sometimes it is opening strength, but no slam interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: E Greco asking if they play precision|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C invitational.  3NT is probably a better contract, since it might make and if it doesn't 3@C might fail also.  Not clear.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: having the other major makes it much harder for opponents to compete, specifically with a double|pg||
nt|ritong: now|pg||
nt|ritong: 1NT is like 19/20 more or less balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually it cost 1 trick in @C  --  2 tricks overall|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit of a psyche?   i think 3@C=game force 3+@C natural or values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: sorry I can not see the explanations of the alerts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is sitting the thinker man's pose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7    1N=17-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry typo   17-18|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Helness DBL might actually help them find the 50% game that makes with @SK onside|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can not see how E can move again |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: yes I have check 19 and we will be fixing it|pg||
nt|ritong: would n t you facing a 2NT opening?|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: it is the same situation, approximately  except that you suspect the opener to have some goods|pg||
nt|sybarra: its only 5 with nothing to write home about |pg||
nt|sybarra: and white|pg||
nt|sybarra: this cant be but so many imps|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein shifts to a spade, which he surely will, declarer has a difficult decision.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: If @S9 promises the 10, then fine|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg switches to a spade, but from the wrong side|pg||
nt|kit: He can make by going up and setting up the heart for a discard, but this is far from clear|pg||
nt|kit: Now it looks like declarer will have to lose 3 trump tricks -- not close to enough entries for trump coup |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Rohrberg telling partner what she should have led|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"  a derivative of "Polish Club"|pg||

pc|c2|nt|pelu: @D back could kill dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I can not see Joel's card so sorry if the spots etc count are wrong|pg||

nt|ritong: hiya warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi Henri.  a bit late for you?|pg||
nt|ritong: nah:)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: might have been better to take discard and hope for Jx of clubs onside|pg||
nt|poohbear: Declarer has started well on this hand . Taking 2@s tricks without losing one and guessing clubs. Gawrys might have done better to duck smoothlier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson 5 point hand provides THREE entries|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|woozle: Mortensen grabs her heart ace...ducking might have worked better, from a technical or deceptive perspective|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|woozle: or Tx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She is a good player with one significant flaw; she plays too fast for her own good and comfort|pg||
nt|woozle: nine tricks now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: and levinstein certainly are artists|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well they did take more bids to get to 1N than Krekorian-Casen|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: we will see if Weinstein can describe his shape in their methods|pg||
mb|3D!|an|Both minors|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: presumably showing both minors, don't know what else -- this may get them to 6@D|pg||
nt|jbennet: looks like a good slam (non spade lead or D suit for no loser or D and club length on the same hand|pg||
nt|kit: And played from South side, so might avoid spade lead and won't have to get the diamonds right.|pg||
nt|kit: If South make any kind of move, North will surely bid the slam -- he couldn't have much more.|pg||
nt|jbennet: what did 3 d show? |pg||
nt|kit: unfortunately, we don't know what 3@D showed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Sorry the handwriting is too small for me to see. I will try and get a better view after the auction is finished|pg||
mb|4H!|an|double keycard|mb|p|nt|kit: this is probably RKC|pg||
mb|4S!|an|1 or 4|nt|kit: am told 3@D just shows 5-4 in minors, nothing about majors|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: well, now will get spade lead -- but slam will make since declarer will play for 2-2, with extra shot at 3 rounds of clubs living|pg||
nt|jbennet: in fact the hand has become almost a 5 or 7 hand.|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H is double keycard I am told|pg||
nt|kit: 1430, so 4@S 1 or 4|pg||
mb|4N|an|Q ask|mb|p|nt|kit: king of clubs counts as keycard|pg||
nt|kit: 4NT probably queen ask|pg||
nt|kit: Levin will consider that he has the queen I think|pg||
nt|jbennet: wonder if South is going to ask for D queen and might get a negativ response.|pg||
mb|5N|an|trump Q + 1 other Q|mb|p|nt|kit: This I'm sure shows queen of diamonds, don't know what else|pg||
nt|kit: So they are in slam -- and Weinstein will even be thinking about a grand!|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: But that might be pushing too much -- may take right shape in partner's hand|pg||
nt|jbennet: there is enough bidding space to let 1 resonse show no queen but an extra Diamond.|pg||
nt|kit: well done.  In other room South was able to show his shape, but made no move to slam|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbennet: if south indeed managed to show 31 + 54 minor.|pg||

mc|13|nt|jbennet: it looks as a worst case scenario view not to move with norths hand.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW  reverse attitude but standard count|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: at this table we will be lucky to see a hand played out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it can't be confirmed/disputed    i bet vs 3N Gawrys would duck @C |pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Not playing with Peter Gill you aren't|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=multi-purpose  in this case, a weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||
nt|warrens:  a pretty good 6@C here|pg||
nt|ritong: bidding and making 6@c would be artistic, for that matter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we are in a huddle here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he have bid to show 31(45)|pg||
nt|poohbear: most expert pairs do|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|woozle: I've never downgraded a hand out of a strong notrump, but this South hand might be it|pg||
nt|pelu: a slam on finess of @sK - bid by Sweden (6NT) so they didnt miss 2 keycards|pg||
nt|woozle: I think we've worked out what about that situation is different|pg||
nt|kit: In other room declarer did go up ace of spades and made it -- but can the 9 of spades really be trusted?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and so we see|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: DBL  5-7 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C tends to be 1-suiter|pg||
nt|poohbear: decent slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play that 3@H can have 4@S, others 3@H MUST have 4@S, but most common  3@S 1@H (45)|pg||
nt|poohbear: I have bids for both|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ritong: suspect 4@d to be exactly 4@s and 5+ @hs|pg||
mb|5D|nt|woozle: Fagerlund is worth a try...I play 1NT:2H,2S:4NT as quantitive - perfect!|pg||
nt|woozle: for keycard, transfer at the four level instead|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva should stop bidding as soon as she's allowed to|pg||
nt|hawe45: A good hint here: Please decide, what you will bid over 2 @S - BEFORE bidding 2 @H|pg||
nt|woozle: sorry, he's|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: N can bid 3@C and over 3@S - 3 card -4@D and have 4@H cue bid|pg||
nt|woozle: South shouldn't cue anything|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D inverted, but since a passed hand it isn't forcing|pg||
nt|poohbear: Kalita's hand is so good that he bypasses 3NT despite the ample @H stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  1@c "Polish": usually a ballanced 10-13; sometimes strong (18+) or perhaps natural with clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't have thought South hand was worth another call, but perhaps they open more soundly so there could still be a game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: This hand must be a worst-case for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C and 4@D forced S to show a @H-stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You cuebid with an aceless hand that showed 15-17 already, Peter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet that most club players agree 3M=shortness in the suit  and make no further statements about @S length|pg||
nt|poohbear: but partner doesnt Q bid the @s ace|pg||
nt|poohbear: So kalita is forced to pass|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: whether to switch to clubs or continue spades is not so clear|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|kit: Weinstein chose aggressive spade lead -- not clear, as no immediate danger of discards|pg||
nt|kit: I would have been inclined to go more passive with heart lead, but it won't matter this time|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|woozle: Should start spades with the 8, planning to run the jack next|pg||
nt|pelu: over 3@C - 3@S = minimum and now 4@D by N = do u have a @H stopper? - not a free cue bid but forcing|pg||

nt|kit: winning line is to win club in hand and blast out spades with them 3-3, but that looks a bit double-dummy.|pg||

nt|po-s: negative free?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hola|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know their style, but I don't think they play neg free bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this instance of 1@C opening is  natural   4+@C, 11+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are als strong options to 1@C|pg||
nt|po-s: so what was this?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: The textbooks recommend that you pass 1@C; there must be something wrong|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund finds the featherweight response...Orkoneva is grateful to the 2D overcall which simplified his rebid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Not sure if this is intended as weak or invitatinal, but not what Levin wanted to hear|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: The textbooks are wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Textbooks say 6+ for a response|pg||
nt|woozle: Only Granovetter tip worth reading - never pass your partner's 1C at favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room that was quite a 2N bid from Mike Moss opposite passed partner|pg||
nt|kit: probably weak -- if invitational Levin might have bid more even with bad spade holding.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|woozle: That's an error in the textbooks - a far better way to describe it is "6 points is the amount with which you must respond"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm amused when the bid is explained as  @C & higher suit    [so how do you show @C and LOWER?]|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: the five diamond card is out|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will continue with queen of spades while club entry in dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder why Piek bid again|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Not sure what 3@C means here-- may be artificial|pg||
nt|po-s: if it is difficult to tell if it is weak then maybe it isn´t|pg||
nt|kit: he can't get diamond ruff, so hoping to discard a couple of diamonds and that North will be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|scotty: But then a promotion is almost inevitable - |pg||
nt|kit: I think he should cash ace of hearts first now --can't see how holding it can help|pg||
nt|kit: True, Mike, but what else is there?|pg||
nt|scotty: The better chance is to play a trump after @cAK and hope for honor 10 doubleton |pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps |pg||
nt|scotty: Trying the spade jack onluy succeeds when N started with KQx|pg||
nt|kit: But then he shouldn't have taken ruffing finesse in spades if he is going to do that it seems|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Did his hand improve after 3@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 small ones in East's suit|pg||
nt|woozle: Do you think that North had not described the full majesty of his hand?|pg||
nt|pelu: agree with 3@s by N - only game if S can bid 4@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - but South first showed 3-card support, then received the message from North: I am weak - ant THEN overbid on the 3-level. Now North must bid 4 @S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS upside-down count & attitude  with Reverse Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still i dont see where 9th trick coming from|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told 2@C  is really 4+@C and 5@H/@S    [so not like  DONT/Meckwell]|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: some tables are finishing up and leaving the room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is playing with a spade|pg||
nt|kit: From Weinstein's 2NT call. Levin thinks Weinstein is 2-3-4-4|pg||
nt|warrens:  East might think his partner is 2344 unless some of this is artificial|pg||
nt|kit: yes, many players would rebid 2@C instead of 1NT with Weinstein's shape|pg||
nt|ritong: missing both minor queens they won t be in 7|pg||
nt|kit: problem here is:  has a trump suit been confirmed?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|henryb:  Normal practice in Northern Europe is to lead 2nd and fourth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: South has run out of pass cards|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|woozle: 3S is descriptive anyway - he hadn't promised the fifth spade|pg||
nt|scotty: After 2N, East KNOWS there is an 8-card minor fit,  What he doesn't know is what slam to play|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible that 4@D isn't natural -- may be intended as RKC for clubs, may be some kind of relay|pg||
nt|kit: But if Weinstein is thinking here, they might not be on the same page.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein ARE investigating slam on  13    standby|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: now just a guess as to how many down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me that 4@D made them guess -- 5@D now says  "they guessed right???"    seems there was at least one flawed thought there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|scotty: I would think natural - no reason why not|pg||
nt|scotty: Tempting to bid 7?|pg||
nt|warrens:  must be tempted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby opens and closes his hand now has set his cards on the table and his head is in his hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: a big sigh|pg||
nt|scotty: West denied 4 good clubs by not raising over 3@c or 3@s|pg||
nt|kit: still Weinstein didn't have to jump to slam if he has a minimum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: here they all come |pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room Moss attacked @C   and Pepsi shifted to @SK   that helped declarer|pg||
nt|scotty: Levin doesn't need much - @cQ, @hA and either red Q gives play|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll make 7@C if he's in it.  ruff one spade and take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|kit: yes, it seems like he should make it if he plays carefully -- 5 trump tricks, 3 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|scotty: Unless he thinks no trump lead means something.  But it should not here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|kit: doesn't need to guess queen of diamonds|pg||

pc|dA|nt|warrens:  hi Al|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: club to ace, spade ruff, club finesse -- easy game|pg||

pc|h5|nt|warrens:  I'll try to help out until dinner time (I'm getting hungry)|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|ritong: hasta la vista baby|pg||
nt|kit: this is just as good|pg||
nt|scotty: West was hoping the stiff spade was important.  It may also have been an issue that 4@h over 4@d might have been KC in @d - I really have little knowledge about that|pg||
nt|kit: ruff spade with jack of spades, club hook, claim|pg||
nt|warrens:  only risk now is a spade overruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: I am not sure that the defense - better @D again|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|kit: QJ doubleton means hand cold -- plus wouldn't have played it that way|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jbennet: with this kind 1 club opening is rekommended then bid spades a couple of times |pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: I totally disagree -- 6-card spade suit must open 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  American style with equal blacks is to open 1@s and bid clubs a few times|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: 5-5 maybe opening 1@C is okay, but not 6-6|pg||
nt|scotty: What is the basis for saying "must" -  is it religious?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: ok that philosophy have to wrong contracts in the past , and will continue do so in the future too. becuse the bidding economy become better.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if opening 1 club|pg||
nt|scotty: If  the evidence showed 1@c worked better, I'd rather open 1@c.  If the evidence is not clear, I'd rather not have a "must" opinion|pg||
nt|kit: oops -- some kind of disconnect here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbennet: that is.|pg||
nt|kit: Levin apparently thought Weinstein could be a lot weaker|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Weinstein thought his 5@C call was a slam try|pg||
pc|d7|nt|scotty: Well, the only evidence we have is that 1@s failed this time|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: should Weinstein have just driven it himself and hoped for a decent catch?|pg||

nt|poohbear: hi all. routine 4@hs here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in which language?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: german|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: North is says he didn't do a good defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 25 minutes are remaining for this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if determining factor was Barry's statement about non @C lead  because of 33 majors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  the spade position was fortunate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh   he noticed the @C pitch too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: they got very lucky.  If they had been able to establish clubs as trumps at a lower level, they would have had a keycard auction and found out they were off the queen of clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+   honest|pg||
mb|d|nt|woozle: Actually, I notice that 4H can be made with a deft heart guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D, 4@H, fit 3@C   what's best?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2@d q bid will show at least a limit raise in @hs|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 3nt but not sure they'll bid it wtih 13 opposite 10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson and Smirnov wispering about last hand and shaking their heads|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How you get all the way to 3@S is a mystery|pg||
nt|poohbear: I differentiate between 3 and 4 card raises by using Q bid and 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot about possible 2N :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs natural 1@D   Piek could show @S & minor via 2@D    not sure if the 2+@D eliminated that option or just Piek likes hand enough to bid again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time -- i didn't think about 4@H from west|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: The intra-finesse|pg||
nt|hawe45: Even if DK bids 3 @S here, they might score at least 3 IMP´s|pg||
nt|scotty: I think that will be Weinstein's point in the post-mortem "If I had @hA, @dK and @cQ I would have bid 4@c earlier."  Meanwhile Levin was probably thinking, good chance it's cold, ...|pg||
nt|scotty: finesse at worst|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco was reaching for his bidding cards|pg||
nt|kit: South might well have bid 3@S here, making life even more difficult for opponents|pg||
nt|poohbear: slam is good if they bid it|pg||
nt|poohbear: i dont see how they wont|pg||
nt|poohbear: ahhhh thats how|pg||
nt|poohbear: dbl by hampson shows extra defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: in relation to the preempt|pg||
nt|poohbear: Partner pulls when he has a fit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how little he knows about amount of defense|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think kalita will redbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@D!??|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not even sure I would bud 1@S - I would prefer 2@c|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva appears to have done little justice to his hearts or his game potential with his first bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is not even close to a game try|pg||
nt|woozle: operator error -bid by S?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Mathias have for breakfast??|pg||
nt|poohbear: Hurd opts to make a game try as opposed to lev who just jumped to 4H|pg||
nt|kit: Notice 1NT-3NT auction in other room -- brutally punished|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Only game possible for E/W is 3 @C D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: E may think that it's N/Ss board|pg||
nt|woozle: 1SXX?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I am getting the answer to my question: how do you get all the way to 3@S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: thank you says Eric Greco|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: South hand is pretty good for a preemptive 2@s - so he bids again!|pg||
nt|kit: This one should be a flat 4@S -- hard to see what else can happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then Greco pulls to 5@D?|pg||
nt|poohbear: well thats one way to keep them outta slam|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  On the previous hand eventually North would have to lead from his @s74 into declarer's 86|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hampson's 1@D opening, which wasn't obligatory, sure changed result of this hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Like this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is today's Daily Bulletin that has article about Striped-Tail Ape DBL|pg||
pc|h5|nt|woozle: I was thinking 1C (X) 1S (3D/H) 3S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures udating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  In contrast to standard, Baltic Club needs a little more to raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Seamon starting an ambivalent suit-preference sequence in trumpm|pg||
nt|kit: Succesful save -- they will be disappointed to lose IMPs on it.|pg||
nt|kit: well, North did chime in with 3@S|pg||
nt|kit: and South now knows he is facing a stiff heart|pg||
nt|scotty: Takes a heart lead to beat 6|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hawe45: But still East is right - N/S can make 620, there should be only one way to play the @H-suit|pg||
nt|scotty: Seamon is listening to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This first rd is the last of the round robin, the next 2 will be swiss|pg||
nt|poohbear: john Lowenthal had a name for this dbl. Its called the striped tailed ape dbl. If you think opps can make slam then dbl them in game. if they redbl you run like a stripetailed ape|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Were they ever going to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, some pairs don't bid game with 13 opposite 10 :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva was right to double 3D - Rohrberg wasn't going to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Easy club shift.  And when declarer finds AQ of clubs and king of spades in East hand, he will get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that was introduced in the short-lived but great publication  The Bridge Journal|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|poohbear: one option is to win and lead a @d threatening crossruff or @c suit establishment|pg||
nt|scotty: Would the bidding have been different if East held @dQ?|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure|pg||
nt|kit: Levin considering overtaking in case jack of clubs is singleton -- but that can't be, as with 10xx declarer would have covered|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when the @h position is not crystal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bobby is shaking his head|pg||
nt|scotty: In fact, mightn't he play EAST for the @dQ since West might have opened a 1N? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 14  Krekorian opened 1@D [his 1N=15-17]   so Weinstein 1N South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute play   trying to induce ruff by Greco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just in case @S 4-1|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|poohbear: nice play by Cohler to get another trump play|pg||
nt|poohbear: but declarer has 7 trump tricks with a ruff in dummy plus 3 side tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45: East MUST have bid 3 @C - and nNOT 3 @D!?!|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: sorry  at this vul  automatic 1@D    not sure why i was thinking he was vul    [best guess    i got dain bramage]|pg||

mc|12|nt|henryb:  opening 1@h or 1@s show 5+ cards (11) 12-17;|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbennet: the drawbacks of opening 1 club is if opponents compete vigorously and NT is bid by someone. also if the hand belongs in spades , having bid clubs first might help defenders to ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: find the killing defence|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: they lost a strange number of IMPs on the board 8 -- 5@C got doubled in other room|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|kit: should Levin have pushed his luck when he got the heart bid?  Maybe.|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: And with the bad trump split, it may matter|pg||
nt|scotty: A spectator suggests spade throwing a club - looks like a reasonable idea|pg||
nt|kit: if hearts 3-2 he can just cash 2 top hearts and set up the diamond.  Can he protect against 4-1 without jeopardizing things if 3-2?|pg||
nt|scotty: Though it may fail here after club over, then a @d|pg||
nt|kit: yes playing a spade and pitching a club might be the right play|pg||
nt|kit: sort of go into crossruff mode -- but danger lurks in the diamond suit|pg||
nt|scotty: I'd be inclined to play vulnerable opponent who overcalled on ten-high suit for stiff heart... |pg||
nt|kit: maybe king of hearts and then the spade pitching a club?|pg||
nt|kit: seems sort of strange, but might be right play|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Drew Casen [drewsky]  overcalled 2@H      Levin-Weinstein in undoubled 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another  "weak nt" version of 1@C|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: i think Hurd's NT range in this position is 14-16   [that explains 1@D]|pg||
nt|poohbear: 6 is sort of on a finesse for the right red ace|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on  5  Welland also in 10@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
nt|kit: Pushy slam in other room -- might not make on club lead|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows hearts and a higher suit, e.g. majors|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein trying to decide if worth 3@S -- I don't think so hand too junky|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45: 1 NT now might end the bidding|pg||
nt|kit: North won't sell, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: Hurd and Wooldridge play 14-16 NT despite playing a std system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as we see here, Smirnov DBL might include Strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could help explain Piekarek's 1N   for those who don't like it|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Norway +1|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@H down 1 at both tables NO-SW - @S-lead @D to K and now 2x @D ruff inEast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to be honest  this is impact of Raptor NT that made me uncomfortable the few times i played it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks says J Piekarek|pg||
nt|kit: I think North's pass is awful.  With half the deck and short in their suit, never let them play it at 2-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: state of event|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@h is not a good game|pg||
nt|poohbear: thats what I meant :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|scotty: I guess for North the heart holding was a greater deterrent than the spade holding was an impetus|pg||
mb|d|nt|scotty: What is the better contract at imps, 7@c earlier or 6@h here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: quick claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  try a low @H now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|poohbear: 14-16 nt range gaining alot of popularity as people open lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Geir is showing his hand|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|poohbear: nice spec dbl by hampson. he knows that they wont redbl|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: also he might have picked up on gawrys hesitation that he is weak for his raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker had a character that was famous for that type of double - in fact she often had trump void|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|hawe45: That was a very bad @D-move|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||

nt|poohbear: i think at this point declarer knows who has the trump length|pg||

nt|poohbear: his spots arent good enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think only defense can let this make|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room, Levin did very well to PASS Welland's 3@H |pg||

mb|1N|nt|scotty: It wasn't a serious question about which slam was better - just my quirky way of pointing out that Levin had the worse of the slam luck (as usual, he would say)|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: every imp is a VP in close matches . then every 2 imps fpr a while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=4+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess they say 3+, but suspect 3@C is very rare|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another Precision 1@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45: Might bid this bad slam - easy to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  The cards lie well for an E-W 4@h contract|pg||
nt|kit: very heavy weak 2 -- many would open 1@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|poohbear: makes overtricks important|pg||
nt|scotty: "hope" maybe, confidently expect is a bit much - partner might be 4-3-2-4 or we might land in their strong suit|pg||
nt|kit: but 2@S would be reached anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Sw-NO now 15-15 - stop the match - Denmark will win both groups - Stop :):)|pg||
nt|poohbear: interesting problem for West|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2H shows a bad raise . This qualifies!|pg||
nt|warrens:  well this one makes 6@C if you find the offside !K of @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: No explanation of 2 spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@C seems more likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: father and son Bessis defended correctly against 5@DX to pick up 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told 2spades is mini spliner and 3 spades is cue|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I am told if Geir remembers 2 spades is splinter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@s good spot here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|woozle: If west is rebidding in a suit here, prefer 2H to any level of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today's Daily Bulletin includes the VP scale     http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/daily-bulletin|pg||
nt|poohbear: helps West as now he has a clear value showing dbl available|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, sorry, 6@C only makes from East, not West, 'cause of the @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd singleton King of the set ---  always in a minor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: I wonder if EW play Support DBL  in this situation|pg||
nt|ritong: the fourth best of the longest strongest blah balh would not be asuccess here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Norway in 6NT??|pg||
nt|woozle: At least 2H shows a good hand and doesn't risk missing heart fits|pg||
nt|hawe45: Facing a non-passed partner, West should bid 4 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: so now Norway +12 IMP (17-13?)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made 6NT and are now +12|pg||
nt|woozle: should be quant here|pg||
nt|woozle: West hasn't learned anything new to incite blackwood|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S convention card says 2@d transfer, but some notion that is forbidden (do not know why|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C denies a club stopper|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and is forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@c sh promise 0-4-5-4|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd worry if it denied a club stopper and was non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: needs little more than 3-2 trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|woozle: 6-red better than 6NT here, although 6D might fail with an overruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Event website http://cavendish.bridgewinners.com/ Also live table pictures udating every two minutes.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is not uncommon over doubles in this country|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: director was called|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: east and north left the room to talk to him|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some misunderstanding about the 2d bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: first north said showed hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Well, 2NT would also have been forcing. Some play that 3@D is passable, and others play Ingberman 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Greco hasn't shown ANY sign of life|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ng|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is a good treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45: For those who like good bidding - some more boards are coming up...|pg||
nt|poohbear: I think he should dbl again. partner can bid 3@s freely with doubt since he has denied more than 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about 3N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: and NS win the war|pg||
nt|kit: Mike, guess it depends if you see the cup as half empty or half full|pg||
pc|c7|nt|poohbear: 3NT is scary with no idea if he has a source of tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  probably alerted differently on the two sides of the table also|pg||
nt|poohbear: if partner bids 3@s over dbl then his 3nt shows doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like Fallenius made it easier for Moss when he bid 2N instead of DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: 5 minutes left in round|pg||
nt|poohbear: but here comes the little more|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco says umph|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|warrens:  he should play a @C to the Ace since he knows a @H ruff is possible|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: interesting question  --   how close is Piekarek to (1@C)-2N  instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Tor and Geir having a discussion|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45: In fact, 6 @D is better than 6 NT!|pg||
nt|woozle: 6D makes if you take the spade finesse, fails if you try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: But a lot more tricky to play|pg||
nt|woozle: makes if you go for a S-C squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu: will Marie bid 6NT - I exp that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway made on that squeeze Kieran mentioned|pg||
mc|8|nt|woozle: I've almost forgotten what it's like to bid without brakes|pg||

nt|woozle: 2D and a club ruff means that you need to block a suit to reenter hand..could make extra issues with trumps 4-2|pg||
nt|hawe45: She had an automatical show-up squeeze agains North - but it has been a long tournament |pg||
nt|pelu: Im am glad that I am close to easter-luch with OP Andersson :)|pg||
nt|woozle: EW need to lead a diamond early to threaten 4H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: thats 90 min from now|pg||
nt|warrens:  non-vul, I would |pg||
nt|ritong: so 7 back on an apparently innocuous board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: last board of this last rd of the round robin, we will be back with the last 2 matches (swiss) shortly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if Levin opens 1@D, they'll also get to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: last bd of this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what happens to 4@S from South hand?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: then do NS push to 5@D and if so -- what does EW do|pg||
nt|warrens:  another 5-0 @H break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=5-11 HCP, 5+@C & 5+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    1 more 9-board match scheduled for tonight|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Eric Greco is shaking his head|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzcv: Finland made 4@h on board 26|pg||
nt|hawe45: 620 N/S - unbeatble - 12 IMP maybe for DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can she know that the squeeze will work? And if it does, why is 6@D better than 6NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: looks like 4@h might go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he showed the diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: yes Hans but the squeeze only work if @SK in N - But at strange @C10 sh make her think once more|pg||
nt|kit: interesting that this time he doesn't open 1NT on a hand which many would consider a normal 1NT opening, but maybe they play 14-16|pg||
nt|poohbear: depends on the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|poohbear: but ace of @cs is a good possibility|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we will be back shortly with the last round|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: good day folks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 2@C on last board was a big position, especially with 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last bd of the 2nd round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it could be 5 5 the 2nt but North showed the 3 diamond cared|pg||
nt|kit: Double probably shows 4 or more spades|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45: 6 @D is better, because you can ruff a @C - NORMALLY|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She played it lightning fast again, that's the only thing that worries me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: no ruling yet|pg||
nt|henryb:  standard looking auction (by accident)|pg||
nt|scotty: What card should East plasy at trick one?  @s3 or @s6?|pg||
nt|poohbear: 2 red finesses lose and 2 black aces|pg||
nt|kit: difficult hand for Seamon -- is North supposed to raise with a doubleton?  If so, what if Seamon has 5 hearts?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and someone should tell her to slow down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: break is usually 10-15 minutes, but seems this table ending late so might be sooner|pg||
nt|kit: which makes South's double a support double|pg||
nt|scotty: Some pairs play specifically 4 or 5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Bramley-Welland won't have this problem|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: folks i am not late, i was not scheduled here :)|pg||
nt|kit: Seamon appears confident that Cohler doesn't have a doubleton heart.  I wouldn't be so confident about that.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45: No my taste this 2 @C bid, allthough the suit-quality is resonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired in grace period|pg||
nt|kit: South has shown extra strength with his second double I think|pg||
nt|poohbear: Many experts open 1NT with this hand type to avoid rebid problems. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: So he has nothing more to say|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein knows from the spots that his partner has the singleton club -- unlucky hand for those who lead low from doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: but that is just happenstance|pg||
nt|kit: Still, not clear how he should defend|pg||
nt|kit: danger with ace and a club is declarer may just discard a singleton heart -- but if he doesn't do this, he may not get his ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: And if he leads a low club, partner may be ruffing with natural trump trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|ritong: depending on the third downtrick|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: But I like the lead...|pg||
nt|woozle: North missed an opportunity over 2H - 2NT gives NS a chance to bid a better game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a good lead but it matters little when partner has no entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the difference Michael?|pg||
nt|poohbear: at the other table they underled the @c ace at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last board of the round   2 more 9-board matches scheduled for tonight  with short breaks in-between|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use  actually translates the 1 imp difference into a 16-14 VP match|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: seems like West is endplayed regardless of East's play to trick 1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45: Ist must be down now - any bet?|pg||
nt|kit: all things considered, I believe ace and a club is best|pg||
nt|scotty: When is a club better than a heart now?|pg||
nt|scotty: I see when it's worse - when partner has QJx or Q10x and declarer has a stiff heart|pg||
nt|kit: assuming partner doesn't have ace of diamonds, I guess it isn't|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|scotty: But they played @s3.  I think @s6 is preferable, because clubs is the more "likely" shift, and also because @s3 looks lower than @s looks high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction in other room  East has 3 or 4 spades -- is that enough to differentiate pure attitude, count, suit preference?|pg||
nt|scotty: It may not be enough, but the majority play SP when dummy has a stiff|pg||
nt|poohbear: I just dont agree here. Ace of @s is a more suit oriented card|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i keep getting into a loop, still not sure if down 2 or 3 here|pg||
nt|scotty: third?  is the second so clear?|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he can get out for down 1 offhand|pg||
nt|ritong: okay 2 imps at stake  depending on the second downtrick:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  17 Levin did open 1N, but Krekorian overcalled [multi]2@D    still 4@S North|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: wondering if Helness was supposed to cash @CA|pg||
nt|kit: as long as declarer has a heart and partner the ace, heart looks right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: I take the bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 cokes|pg||
nt|hawe45: Declarer will suffer, when the @C-suit in invited into the battle|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why? a spade is normal now|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK, Roland 2 for me, one for you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: God, he wants odds|pg||
nt|woozle: Rohrberg needs to keep his mitts off the DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith vs NT -- but does that apply looking at dummy's @C?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: now i think -3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Alex is asking about count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Michel Bessis also overcalled 1@H [we were wondering about 2N here to show @D & @H]  but Welland's 1@C=1+ or 2+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both respond     i've got 9 cards left|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|scotty: Only a heart void - and that seems impoissible...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hawe45: Min bank har lige ringet, Roland - I vote for 620 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating from Michael's comment about s/p when stiff in dummy     when 3rd hand is KNOWN to have choices   it is possible to differentiate   s/p and  "just continue"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: time has expired and grace period|pg||
nt|poohbear: and they can rebid 2@c to show 4-4 in the minors|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: on  8 the Bessis pair did find the 5@DX save against 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness is rocking his chair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Zimmermann team dominated this event last year|pg||
nt|scotty: he probably finessed @d9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfb: just announced less than 15 min left in the round|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: one other hand where they missed slam, i think 5@S has to confirm a diamond void so west should have bid slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open, we will be back like in 5-10 min with next rd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see everybody then :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfb: okay back in about 10 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h6|pc|s7|nt|hawe45: Why discard the @C 8 - and not the 5?|pg||
nt|henryb:  first match is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks for your company. The next 9 board match will start shortly. We will be showing Blanchard vs Zimmerman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4/5 imps = 19-11 VPs   but hard to imagine this hand being anywhere near a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vugraph operator said  Bramley opened East hand 2@C "after much deliberation"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gulp     P-2@C-2@D-P//5@D-P-P-DBL|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norway winning by 19 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time for Peter to calculate|pg||
nt|hawe45: Buy your own Coke, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, *I* did not misplay it|pg||
nt|pelu: and+18 = 18-12??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: ill leave this room open|pg||
nt|scotty: On a side note, Levin, if he thought it possible that declarer had a heart void and no more clubs, should discard the ACE of hearts  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we will be back shortly|pg||
nt|kit: good point Mike -- he knows a third round of clubs defeats the contract|pg||
nt|scotty: But I think that was an impossibility on the auction and dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we are going to be showing blanchard vs O rourke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of their big @C      i think  1@D//2@C  can be 3@D 5@C  4/5 either way ... but 44 extremely unlikely|pg||
mc|6|nt|Walddk2: Our operator did|pg||
nt|poohbear: not true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we should be back in about 5-10 min with the last rd|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1-4-4-4 is a likely holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Krekorian also opened 1N     which proves nothing|pg||
nt|poohbear: They have methods to avoid losing the 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|poohbear: 1@s denies 4@h unless GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  1@D-2@H/@S show  5@S & 4+@H    not sure i see how that affects bidding the 1444 hand though    interesting point to contemplate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 9 boards of this event will begin after 10-15 minute delay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tonight is auction for the big event  Cavendish Pairs starts tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yesterday's Daily Bulletin lists the pairs, not sure if also mentioned in today's bulletin|pg||
