nt|Walddk2: Jo, de kan cykle hjem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ligesom du gjorde i morges|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are off again|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hallo Beryl|pg||
nt|lark20: Sorry McGowan and Punch are playing weak no trump, 4 card majors and weak twos in 3 suits|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Welcome all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Afternoon all and welcome back to the second half of this match between Scotland and Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening everyone!|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 4s look likely here|pg||
nt|lark20: 20-21|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  hopefully we will get South's name corrected shortly|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy n/s to play in @S at some level|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play weak notrump but north must have decided that is too good, with 14 and 5 good diamonds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these good 14 counts are always difficult, do you upgrade to 15?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hej Chick!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  with bare spade honours and no tens?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Good morning.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good Morning and welcome to the Lady Milne from Belfast|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to be summarising the auction|pg||
nt|galadriel: Match 2 - Scotland v Northern ireland|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Ns are playing weak NT it might have gone 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good 4@S for EW subject to @H play.|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland are EW but we don't have names yet|pg||
nt|sheila a: It's not always straightforward to cash all your @s in this situation|pg||
nt|galadriel: The event is taking place in Belfast|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as west|pg||
nt|chick: Hejjjj Ralf, Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|coch draig: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Law - 4@S |pg||
nt|jbgood: Roland vil gjerne (be)vise at også dansker har humoristisk sans - well done R:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes that's a good point|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: morning Michael|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Germ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  those trump intermeiates are useful|pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 4@S I suspect|pg||
nt|galadriel: This will be a few down|pg||
nt|roswolf: if real|pg||
nt|galadriel: By North, obviously|pg||
nt|sheila a: Was 4@h the opening bid or just the final contract?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D from North might have shut East out|pg||
nt|lark20: Hi|pg||
mb|2C|nt|simonr: Should get there with west taking the bull by the horns|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stay out of game anyway|pg||
nt|simonr: Fourth suit forcing to set up the force|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is never stopping in a partscore once East opens, misfit in @d or not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is also making|pg||
nt|athene: west perhaps wondering now whether to bid 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt south is wondering what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Må være skuffende for Vest ikke at kunne bete 4@S, og da har makker endda et trumfstik!|pg||
nt|sharkey: På en god dag slem ØV|pg||
nt|athene: well they opened 1nt in the other room - maybe that was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S has some good fortune  J10@S doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I understand the vugraph operator often waits until the tray moves across|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@s would be forcing and East might have Q@s and some goodies for slam - but unlikely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: an easy start with 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  card says 2hx shows 6@h and 5-9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not wise to give them a push here mrs caplan|pg||
nt|athene: if west bids 3@S now and then 4@S later that definitely sounds like more hand than she has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sQ and singleton @h would ideal|pg||
nt|roswolf: operator are you sure east is playing it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Final contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so if she wants to commit to spades she had better bid four right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash-Connelly play strong NT, 5 card majors and 3 weak 2s|pg||
nt|kemperg: can make |pg||
nt|mikeirl: unusual not to dbl with N hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Jeg syns S skal melde 4@S første gang|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dårlig bruk av svak løft|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S er helt ude i hampen. Hvad hedder det på norsk?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 4@s er ok... svak løft gjør du på 3kortstøtte|pg||
nt|jbgood: kan si det, Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: helt på vidda   hører jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: Om S har noen quacks i tillegge betyr omtrent ingen ting - styrken hans er i trumfen - svakhet ingen motspillstikk|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised South bid not bid 3@h given her extra heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: what west played small !? - sacre bleu|pg||
nt|galadriel: Did West really duck?|pg||
nt|chick: NS are playing a 4 card major weak NT ACOL system|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: ignoring that seventh heart not a good idea|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's the strongest weak jump shift i have ever seen|pg||
nt|simonr: East is hating it!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with no @h stopper East was reluctant to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: J from Jx would be a very unusual lead|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, no|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: She didn't :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: but if north had bid a gentle 3@H right away over 2@H, even if that was not theoretically constructive, south might have given it a fourth|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  need @s guess to make 4@h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  convention card for EW http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/kaye-youngs.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: of course a lot depends on what 1@D - 2@S would mean|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: no guess now|pg||

nt|kemperg: @HJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  I was expecting South to high-low in trumps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For resten, da skal man ikke grine af mig, når jeg foreslår, at bergenserne skal cykle hjem. et er vel en dejlig tur op ad kysten, ikke sandt?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Burde være greitt å ta en lav finesse i hjerter nå|pg||
nt|baardolav: Å sikre 4 hjerterstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: blir litt vått etter hvert ellen laaaang omvei|pg||
nt|sheila a: a @c to the Q should bring this home|pg||
pc|sA|nt|coch draig: 4@c was a slam try of course and 4@h a cue|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|athene: yes|pg||

nt|athene: a very good hand for a 3@S opener, but maybe 2nd seat at adverse it's ok|pg||
nt|athene: usually with a sound 7-4 you open 4|pg||
nt|simonr: Depends on how weak they are!|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's sensible yes 1@D 1@S 2@C 3@S should be forcing if playing WJS but it's not standard for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: I will flick back and forward and see what I can find out re scores in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: Results and other good info here:  http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon Peter, good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|petepunt: welcome back for the final session|pg||
nt|petepunt: any running scores|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon operator (sorry your name is not showing)|pg||
mb|2D|an|multi|nt|yorkbeach:  Kennewell would open 4@s |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d-2@s = weak, 1@d-1@s-2someting-2@s = invitational?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West's name is spelt  Connolly, operator, and East has an Iceland flag|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Skulle være mulig å unngå utgang på disse kortene?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: ja|pg||
nt|simonr: 15-17 NT here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well game is easy to bid for e/w|pg||
nt|sheila a: slam in @d possible for NS|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3c both minors|pg||
nt|coch draig: looks like a run of a mill auction to 3N|pg||
mb|2N|nt|baardolav: spesielt etter 1nt åpning|pg||
nt|jbgood: litt oppvurdering fra begge sider i lukket rom|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@S should be good at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is assuming that her partner has what she would have :(|pg||
nt|sheila a: We seem to have had some difficulties with the first board - hope to find out what happened later|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes i think most are raising 3@S there with three quick tricks and two trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it looks cold to us but the English south went 2 down |pg||
nt|athene: looks as though you should lose just the two trumps and @CQ, doesn't it|pg||
nt|sheila a: The rooms seem to be linked now - got an imp showing|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3nt good here ns|pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D is poss.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like Wennell and Shea have decided to change compass positions but otherwise the linep is the same as the last stanza|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think Rolnd will give us them soon|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Scotland were in contention last time I saw them|pg||
nt|petepunt: are we sure Shelia shea is East ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  have you seen the bidding :)|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|Walddk2: Mest af Øst|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes @h goes on the @dA|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H makable     but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|athene: i would expect just 4@D from west over a strong notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h suit combo to make 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H will come down to how you play the trumps - double finesse is normal isn't it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: This isn't the boards they are playing...|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: result to follow shortly :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Interestingly, it seems 3NT made in both rooms on board 1?|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence had 5 @s to cash if they did the right things|pg||
nt|galadriel: There seems to be some debate about whether the scores are accurate|pg||
nt|sheila a: Is it just this board (2) that's come out wrong?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N hadde meldt @H forrige spill som kibs sier så 3 NT hadde gått hjem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what does the encyclopedia say?|pg||
nt|lark20: That should encourage McGowan|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or d pre empt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kemperg: Hi all ungagged now|pg||
nt|sheila a: N has some useful cards |pg||
nt|kemperg: no courage by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no no|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: This isn't right - wrong board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: seems some boards are wrong...back with u shortly we hope :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Putting us to test:)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks June - do we have names?|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have done the vugraph operation and it can be a nightmare if the set up isn't right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Agree, tricky assignment.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the Wales npc may have changed their seats in the hope of changing luck|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Det er vel meget rimeligt at opvurdere Vests hånd til 18-19|pg||
nt|simonr: They play Texas transfers so this should show mild slam interest. Should have just bid 4@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not according to suitplay|pg||
nt|athene: especially since there might be issues of trying to lose a trick to north rather than south, to protect the @SK (you might set up clubs for a spade pitch)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surprised East has not X 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  going to be expensive failing to do so|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay says to lead the 10|pg||
nt|kemperg: but even on 3@D N had the problem|pg||
nt|coch draig: both pairs playing 4 card majors and a weak nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: ofte greit med EN hardmelder i et par - med begge kan det gå litt for fort i svingene|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi germ|pg||
nt|coch draig: so 2N here is forcing 15-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: Hi Geoffry|pg||
nt|roswolf: whoops|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  300 instead of 800|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: i looked at the play record and it seems declarer did all sensible things and then claimed|pg||
nt|athene: well leading the ten works ok if you guarantee to pick the position later, but double finesse makes your life easier? nothing to think about :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it surprises me too - but never known suitplay to be wrong|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  running the 10 gains if North has 4@h|pg||
nt|simonr: Suitplay is a useful freeware program - http://home.planet.nl/ narcis45/SuitPlay/|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 404  play the ace  and lead small to Q  = 78%|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the fact that it is more convenient to start @h from East may tip the odds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, not so many entries to dummy, so i don't think running the ten is really an option here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: I'm not sure whether 4@d was keycard|pg||
nt|chick: South might regret calling Jxxx a stopper|pg||
nt|coch draig: McGowan could of bid 3@h on the way but all roads lead to 3N this time|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it was just some error in recording - she surely claimed 10, not 8|pg||
nt|petepunt: 88 scot (assume 16vp) 87 eng (assume 22vp)  from current match|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is there a defence for 4 off?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West ruffs the @h even when declarer ducks and then plays a trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with AK A East really should have doubled|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|athene: ah, a spec tells me that declarer revoked|pg||
nt|roswolf: small club was a practical shot|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|petepunt: A@D before the QC|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: Na 7 rozdañ przed koñcem para Tuszyñski-Nowosadzki plasuje sie na 13 miejscu |pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W turnieju bierze udzia³ 106 par|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: For kibs looking for commentaries in English go to Closed Room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did declarer really throw a @C on the @DA?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pressures of playing with screens|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: This is Nordanian, horrible language|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|sheila a: No problems on the actual layout|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jbgood: har du ekskludert søta bror, Roland?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is Wennell|pg||

nt|athene: another good 14 gets upgraded|pg||
nt|athene: this one is better than the earlier hand, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the 5-card suit is way better and no ugly KJ doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agree with the upgrade this time - decent intermediates as well as 14 HCp + 5 card suit |pg||
nt|yo_yo: revokes are common,  i  unfortunately do them quite often :)|pg||
mb|4H|an|krótkoæ|nt|yo_yo: yes  agree with the upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: if north tries 3@S then south should go to game even with the 12 count i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s get into the bidding even:)|pg||
nt|petepunt: misunderstanding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Jeg er faktisk den søteste af dem alle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: nr. 7|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hva er det som forgår her... Skal du si 1nt på 16 hp i andre melderunde... så får du heller åpne 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: with AAK and a spade fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very favourable lie of the cards for NS|pg||
nt|ady: north declined to go further  with good shape     maybe decided would need a transfer brake to consider game|pg||
nt|athene: north would have bid game after a super-accept but otherwise stop in 2; that is reasonable, so you play 2 or 4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no one has bid so the @S are likely to split|pg||
nt|simonr: Should be a routine 10 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dK lead expected|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is W asking questions?|pg||
nt|the saint: 6S/6H same thing realistically|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: i would certainly open the south hand a 15-17 notrump|pg||
nt|simonr: Right suit - wrong card. Soft Q to ask for attitude?|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@s has problems|pg||
nt|coch draig: W is worth way more than the 11 count shown|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably West always intended to bid again|pg||
nt|the saint: DEfinitely. Now if EW don't have their high level Pass/Double agreements sorted, West will be on a guess and will prob have to bid 7C as insurance|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW system card http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/wennell-shea.pdf|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no lead lets 7@c make|pg||
nt|the saint: But nobody knows who is making what|pg||
nt|coch draig: 6@h the optimum contract going just 1 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East's pass shows first round @h control, that is a duplicated value as far as West is concerned|pg||
nt|lark20: If you read note 7 on their cardd, they bid on to show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|the saint: That may be, but this hand surely well beyond that remit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  system card for NS http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2011/systems/ConvCardSpLmG.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if West leads a @h, declarer wil be doing well to make this|pg||
nt|athene: she has to duck a heart lead in both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Poor Lane is getting all the decisions so far|pg||
nt|athene: and play east for the @DA|pg||
nt|athene: or alternatively take the double spade finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  in view of the bidding, West is probably favourite to hold the @dA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is it her first appearance, i wonder?  If so, she will be nervous|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no played last year|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn TD called|pg||
nt|athene: eeek|pg||
nt|athene: if east was east leading a heart, declarer is just going to bar a heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's great,  she can forbid H lead :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what did the NPC say about leads out of turn? :)|pg||
nt|athene: he said, only against NV games, so this is fine|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Now that I dont do , always face down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d to Q and @h switch and similar position|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: card face up|pg||
nt|yo_yo: west on lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S lead probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: discussion about who opened screen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still go down even with @s lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  @D view |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but probably should take two @s finesses|pg||
nt|athene: there are ways it may still go down - if south plays it and forbids a heart lead, and rises ace on a spade lead and later misguesses diamonds...|pg||
nt|athene: but i think it is more likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Kennewell is now declarer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does that mean they can lead @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I will just have to give result|pg||
nt|athene: isn't there a theory that says you should always accept leads-out-of-turn, because a player who doesn't know whose lead it is is not likely to know what suit to lead? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if so that's a bad decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how does BBO cope with dummy being declarer?|pg||
nt|athene: it says "this would never happen if they were playing online!" and sulks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we might crash :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have always assumed that revokes and leads out of turn are impossible in an online game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should try it sometime :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: They did:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricky for south now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yo_yo: as i understand the revoke rule, it's Lane's decision as to who is declare and the lead|pg||
nt|mikeirl: np here, 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what would 2nt have been -lebensohl-ish?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Lead out of turn|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  No X to stop pard from saving?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is on the same side of the scren as West, so knows 7@c was slow|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is not going to know that 7@h is as cheap as it is|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will not be expecting void @c opposite for sure|pg||
nt|coch draig: should N dbl 7@c?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what I would have done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably she was worried South would take it as asking for a @d lead|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@H still makes even with 5-0|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: the normal play in the club suit is to take a double finesse against the QJ, rather than just lead to the king, entries and control permitting|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'm not sure what an immediate 3@s from E would have shown|pg||
nt|sheila a: That would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lark20: It may have shown a weaker hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the clue is that North bid 6@h not 6@d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so North should not have that concern|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  do we think she asked for a @h lead?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is this the correct auction?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  surely East was worth more than 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: The hand isn't that good if you assume the values are sitting over you|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  EW card says the queen shows a queen high suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: hallo Henry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@h was only one off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kemperg: coffee|pg||
nt|kemperg: also in 5@H on 1 in OR|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks strange must have meant to bid 2@C|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baardolav: Regner med ns spiller 15-17 nt som nesten alle i norge|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: 1NT-åpinng er 15-17, ja|pg||
nt|sheila a: now best to exit safely with a trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  In order to make 4@s declarer has to reject the @h finesse and play @hA, Q, later ruffing the hearts good|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  rare that you get a slam decision wrong and lose only a handful of IMPs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  claim soon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  yes that is what I would have bid|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baardolav: 1nt gjenmelding? 12-17?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to lose two clubs even with the ace onside so no point leading to the king first off and losing three tricks to AHx with west|pg||
nt|sheila a: People who pre-empt in 3rd often have quite decent hands|pg||
nt|sheila a: so can't guarantee that @h K is wrong|pg||
pc|c8|nt|simonr: East is looking at the jack though so should suspect this is from KQx|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: Spørsmålet er hva S skal melde på 1@S - som det gikk nå|pg||
nt|coch draig: the play should not take long|pg||
nt|petepunt: i fear turedness is creeping in at this stage|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
mc|11|nt|yorkbeach:  on the previous deal that @d7 lead looked like a short suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer wil be hoping for @d 4-0|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so that 6@h was making|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|chick: EW play a 3-way multi|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -2 in 3nt oc previous board was a difference of 20 IMPs|pg||

nt|sharkey: Men V åpnet|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  having the ace in your own suit is  a factor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh i see Pat , what was the lead?|pg||
nt|simonr: East play 2NT as 20-22 but will she upgrade?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry South's name is still incorrect - should be Ingham, not Ingram|pg||
nt|simonr: No|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told that EW play 3@D - 3@H shows a fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with the @C10 she might have|pg||
nt|sheila a: Both pairs here are highly experienced|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks a simple 4@H but is it to bid!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d = Multi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d is making|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: NS have had three hands so far where they could open 1nt playing a strong notrump|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the weak notrump was suppose to come up lots, or something|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common these days to give up on stopping in 3major facing a 2nt opener to clarify the degree of fit right away|pg||
nt|sheila a: Grant-Macdonald play Weak NT, Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|ralfwil: depending on what kind of multi - pass is an alternative|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no - at this stage ew are in 5@CX which is the normal save|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  normally it does|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  England South on board 3 opened 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult bid for North|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3@C is a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|sheila a: NIBU go into the lead |pg||
nt|sheila a: Yvonne Wiseman took an inferior line in 3NT on board 1, it seems|pg||
nt|sheila a: not sure why W didn't open 1NT on this|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure Millership isn't happy with herself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  minimum and poor suit|pg||
nt|coch draig: 3@d min with @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction any weak 2 in @s|pg||
nt|petepunt: probalby not now N has overcalled vul|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  3@d stopper ask?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some pairs play that 2NT-3@d-3@h promises 3 @h|pg||
nt|simonr: Completing the transfer with 3 cards is becoming popular|pg||
nt|athene: i think it makes more sense to play that 3@H actually denies a fit though? then you only force to game with at least a 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like they are doing that|pg||
nt|mikeirl: bid by North|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is not going to care whether West is max or min this time|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d will help put on the brakes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|sheila a: Burns and Greenwood play strong NT, 5card majors and Multi-Lucas|pg||
nt|galadriel: I'm sure Greenwood would have preferred to defend with that nice @D suit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks best spot to me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: or is it a @C raise?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I assume 3@h is asking but surely she is alwasy bidding game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: a bit difficult here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  from South over 3@c|pg||
nt|athene: north would like to cue the diamonds to show a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but 3@D cue takes her past the level of 3@C|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could bid 2NT|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt would get the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@d stopper would be enough as the cards lie|pg||
nt|athene: you can use 2nt as a good raise also when the cue is too expensive just in general|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting idea|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT should be 1 down|pg||
nt|simonr: Once you have established a fit it avoids the two way new suit bid - is it a new suit or a cue problem?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c + 2@s + 2@d = 8|pg||
nt|kemperg: they play 4crd major?|pg||
nt|roswolf: over a simple preference will east bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes germ|pg||
nt|sheila a: wow|pg||
nt|petepunt: danger time ...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: Sjanse her for Kristiansand|pg||
nt|sheila a: 2@s from Burns is @s and a minor|pg||
nt|galadriel: But nowadays, everyone likes to compete over the opps 1NT|pg||
nt|galadriel: even a strong one|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash obviously expecting more from the W hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry 5@C on board 1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  inconsistent to bid only 2@d and then look for a slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sharkey: ikke det...|pg||
nt|baardolav: Veldig hardt å komme i 4@s|pg||
nt|sharkey: Enig|pg||
nt|baardolav: Du har ikke anledning til å finne at 4@s er spillbart på så dårlig tilpasning som her|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood can guess which minor :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes she will:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Ok otherwise 2@H was the proper bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@h might have allowed NS into the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now we know - thinking of a slam|pg||
nt|the saint: Can East construct a min hand that makes slam good?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  Connolly added a point for good play, and Nash added three more|pg||
nt|henryb:  :)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes 10 tricks no game on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sheila a: This may go 2 off|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah west not in the mood - may cost her side a bushel of imps|pg||
nt|coch draig: 3@h advanced cue perhaps|pg||
nt|the saint: Depending on their ranges of course|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|the saint: If not, then no point in going through the relays|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sKxxxxx singleton @c red ace|pg||
pc|s9|nt|coch draig: good lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  need to play A as card lie|pg||
nt|the saint: If that fits their minimum then that is the one|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sheila a: Can get the majors going but still a trick short?|pg||
nt|coch draig: still can't make|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: e.g. (1@S) 2@H (2@S) 2NT is a good raise to 3@H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  struggling to avoid 4 losers anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South will not be underleading the @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as she can see two aces and a trump trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor bid by East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should have bid 4@s over 3@d|pg||
nt|coch draig: 1 trick in every suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  one of the advantages of a Multi is that the strong hand usually becomes declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thrown away that advantage|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's best hope i that whoever has 3@d throws one on the @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: south just has to hang on to her @DQxx when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: When it goes 1NT P P you know you have roughly half the points at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
nt|mikeirl: cards lie very favourably for N/S|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  I am sure 2NT would have been natrual for N|pg||

pc|c3|nt|athene: i mean assuming it isn't penalty|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  defenders lost the @hA in the other room when West led ace and another club|pg||
nt|athene: then west bids 4NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@h went on the @cKQ9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she decided to trust her opponents as they are vul against not|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @cK is declarer's 7th trick|pg||
nt|sheila a: This would have been much more comfortable in NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although everything is lying wrong regardless of where you play|pg||
nt|sheila a: E has been put off her natural @h lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  Will East lead a @h anyway?|pg||
nt|sheila a: might find a @d?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nothing else is any better|pg||
nt|kemperg: not me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: 10 IMP tilbake|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ø oppvuderte til 18-19 i LR - forskjellen her|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: I stad kritiserte dere lukket rom for å oppvurdere 17 til 18-19. Dere klager ikke på Nils i dette spillet?|pg||
nt|sheila a: luckily for McGowan, W has no entry|pg||
nt|lark20: Best lead for E/W|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no real alterative except pass|pg||
pc|cK|nt|coch draig: 8 tricks here however they are played|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has shown a hand too strong for a 1NT overcall, which seems a reasonable description|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  8 top tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play should be quick|pg||
nt|petepunt: 8H better|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: should really play the king  to have a chance of success|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: very hard for south to tackle hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? She has a double stopper|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: now a @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  so defenders need to cash out|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@d doubled looks like two down|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north can find the heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|simonr: Looks like it is making now they haven't found their hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: At least it's only 50s|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: time for a more exciting deal?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  little scope for more|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: assuming 4th best leads she knows her partner has only 54 clubs|pg||
nt|sheila a: East's original lead problem only postponed |pg||
pc|s7|nt|baardolav: Har ikke klaga på 18-19 og femkort nei|pg||
nt|baardolav: Men mere tvil om denne handa|pg||
nt|petepunt: still makeable|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|baardolav: 17 og 5kort er 18-19|pg||
nt|baardolav: Men to fillcard i to forskjellige farger gir vel nesten 18 hvertfall|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: Lukket er tre spill etter igjen. Blir noen småpauser her|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d3-2 is more likley that @sK with North of course|pg||
nt|athene: only 4 clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ONLY -2 PROBABLY|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h8 is missing, so no idea to enter dummy for @h10/9|pg||
nt|mikeirl: a few imps back here|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u they made an exciting dwal of it in the open room|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sheila a: @s seems the defence's best hope for more tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  + time to test bith suits|pg||
nt|athene: so they are not beating it on clubs alone|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lark20: I expected a spade but not the K|pg||
nt|sheila a: McGowan must suspect E has @h length here|pg||
nt|mikeirl: the defence is very good here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could try giving up a @c and see whether a suicide squeeze develops|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: east must come to 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at IMPs I would be saving my brain more a more interesting board|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  wise :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: and on we go|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: can alwasy try spades later if diamonds dont behave|pg||
nt|galadriel: Apparently there will be a problem with the scoring throughout the match, so we will be seeing 0-0 all the time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sheila a: needs to duck|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid to 5@d in the other room but NS bid 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has left  herself a @d guess but the J-x will resolve it|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: when people start out at bridge they get shouted at to a) lead partner's suit and b) return partner's suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: North's somewaht wild 2@h opener heloing NIBU overboard|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: should she finesse @S when she has 7 tricks?|pg||
nt|athene: and sometimes the trauma persists :) and they can't stop doing it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have led a @h as South|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: competing to 5@D gives north a bit of a problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer A-10-9-7 to A-J-x-x|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and it is a major|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  If she is watching, the only high spade left is the  J|pg||
nt|sheila a: odd discard|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|simonr: Put me down for a @h lead too|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yorkbeach:  unimportant with two discards coming|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|athene: if you push opps to 5@S enough times, they will eventually go down one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes N has too much in @c to bid on|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but S will want to bid 5@s|pg||
nt|sheila a: can now throw E in with the @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit that 2@h opener at unfave vul is one of the most suicidal bids ive ever seen yet it gained them a swing!|pg||

nt|vugraphzbj: Vi er klare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dAxx is good if you think partner is short|pg||
nt|athene: the play there was interesting|pg||
nt|simonr: Two flat boards so far - and there were only three in the first 16 boards!|pg||
nt|ady: which heart last hand?    could get blocked|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely no upgrade this time|pg||
nt|athene: objectively declarer should maybe try rising the @CK at trick 1?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting Wales to gain an IMP on 21|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be a big gain for N/S|pg||
nt|petepunt: S glad she didnt double as laydown on any lead with fav @D pos|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  26-0 so far this set to Scotland and potentially more on 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, sure, there are lots of ways NS can get into 5@S, but at least that makes them work for their 650|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it was S who bid 5@s at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: she can see it's down if she ducks, on best defence|pg||
nt|simonr: Sorry - correct three|pg||
nt|mikeirl: amazing result on B oard 2 in the other room - cannot understand why S does not raise|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzbj: Jeg tipper Nils meldte 5ru fordi han håpet det sto..   :)|pg||
nt|simonr: WJO here by South?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky for EW to make 3nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4 was flat Laura Woodruff for Wales also foun the @c10 lead against 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a weak 1NT for you :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: they need some imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: INDEED BUT THEY HAVE A SOLID START IN THIS ROOM I THINK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kemperg: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a missed opportunity nonetheless|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Routine 3NT here for NS.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuk i hate 2@D|pg||
nt|sheila a: 109 doubleton of @c is handy for declarer|pg||
nt|kemperg: pass by W correct, he'l get his chance|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  yes weak NV|pg||
nt|ady: n/s kept out of their heart fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance of getting @s right after East's opening|pg||
nt|athene: pim the jack offside not such good odds as drop the stiff king either side|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure I like 4@S though especially when they overcall so aggressively|pg||
nt|athene: but the opening big changes things a bit|pg||
nt|athene: opening bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs a club lead  to beat 4@H     south can ruff 3rd round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dQx @c 4-4 and @sA in front|pg||
nt|mikeirl: Actually, it was North that passed the raise - North opened 1@D and treated her hand as a minimum obviously|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yorkbeach:  how are you playing the @d?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: WHATEVER IT MEANS/SHOWS|pg||
nt|sheila a: and the natural @s lead takes out East's potential entry for @h tricks|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl now|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no pass is missing|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I doubt EW would bid 4@h even in an uncontested auction|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: low to J i assume|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbj: samme som her|pg||
nt|jbgood: legg merke til at begge sydspillerne meldte sparfargen fremfor å doble opplysende |pg||
nt|athene: with this diamond suit you lead small to the jack then back and lead the queen|pg||
nt|thedoc: undo operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont thinkl east bid 2@s here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no shape but no @c stopper - close choice|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kemperg: she, sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you are playing that 3@c/3@d from West would carry a serious suggestion of playing in the minor, East has more reason to choose the spade game - West could be 5-4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: if you lead the Q first time you lose to stiff king onside|pg||
nt|coch draig: i always prefer the major fit in principal|pg||
pc|s8|nt|simonr: East has a weak NT so will not get too excited|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard not to give  atrick on the lead here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baardolav: Endel spiller ut konge for å få fordelingskast på 4trinnet og over, tieren viser bare flere enn to|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  that is what I thought|pg||
nt|henryb:  but even without the club position, declarer could win the heart, play a @c and take a @d finesse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cashing the @sA wil give marked finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead to the jack then to the ten you lose to K9xx onside|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ady: low spade is best    could be sing king in either hand   where as playing the Queen  gains on against stiff jack with west|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even if declarer picked the trumps, it is hard to avoid 2@d losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: with the @cx providing 3 tricks this should not prove a difficult contract|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikeirl: perhaps not easy to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will get a shock though if sge tries to return to hand with a @d finesse|pg||
nt|coch draig: now duck a @s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  would give her 3@s, 2@d, 1@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|h3|nt|coch draig: sry scratch that no need|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is going to get a @d ruff, so it is going to make no difference|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will not be using the @hA as an entry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I suppose she could actually|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: might get some sort of end play to only lose 1 diamond|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if East had actually opened a weak 1NT, leading the Q would be right|pg||
nt|lestergold: difference in hand evaluation has led to a swing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|baardolav: Hvis du kan melde 2 ganger på hånden så melder du 1sp, svakere så er det vel mere popå doble|pg||
nt|baardolav: på essutspill|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  a strong NT |pg||
nt|lestergold: 9 count with a couple of tens a lor of players would not split hairs and consider that good enuf to raise a strong no trump to game|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  4 top winners for NS barring accidents|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead problem for south|pg||
nt|simonr: East now needs to invent a forcing bid|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @H only losers.|pg||

nt|athene: no-one forced opps to bid game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if @s4 is suit prefernce, is easy|pg||
nt|athene: so if you assume they sort of know what they are doing, making is more likely than -2, surely?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you are probably right|pg||
nt|athene: double might have a big upside if it caused declarer to play you for trump length and go down in a makeable contract i suppose|pg||

nt|galadriel: 5@C would be a good save - only one down , unless West finds an inspired @D lead|pg||
nt|chick: might tempt W to lead back the @SJ giving another uptrick|pg||
nt|mikeirl: needs to play Hq from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yorkbeach:  no justice sometimes :(|pg||

nt|athene: i assumed NS bid 4@S over 4@H in the other room but they went there on their own|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h is an artificial force|pg||
nt|athene: is that west might have four hearts but she will have four clubs less often|pg||
nt|ady: since you know from the bidding the opps have 9+ clubs  that is the likely lead evenif you dont tell them|pg||
nt|athene: so the heart stopper and club weakness is more of a bother than the other way round|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
nt|galadriel: Good result for Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: Witam serdecznie wszystkich na 51. Poznañskim Kongresie Bryd¿owym|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: so that last one was points to ingham for not opening |pg||
mb|1S|nt|simonr: Two chances here to open 11 counts - West gets in first|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that is a bad hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h for me as E|pg||
nt|jferg: grand available|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  21 was the expected small swing to Wales when East opened 1@s|pg||
nt|athene: one king, no aces|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scotland did not bid slam on board 4, hence the 14 imps back|pg||
nt|chick: NS play 4 card majors, so S can't raise even with a nice doubleton like this|pg||
nt|chick: but seems strong enough for 4@C to me|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yorkbeach:  but a couple of 10s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's young!  let her|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 6h/6c here ?|pg||
nt|jferg: yes mike are u keeping well|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: good score for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: having just gone down in a pushy 4@S, they respond by bidding another one on a 22 count next board|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and still a junior|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  and 3NT both make|pg||
nt|athene: i am not saying you should not open it, just that it's a bad hand :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure how wide-ranging the 2NT rebid is|pg||
nt|sheila a: Probably 15-19; Macdonald will be wondering if slam is on|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think it's 15-17|pg||
nt|petepunt: X unlikely here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: de stresser litt for å rekke fly...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer 4@d as W = @d and @h support|pg||
mb|5S|nt|baardolav: 7 eller 8 stikk i 1nt etter alle solemerker|pg||
nt|sheila a: In that case should sign off in 3NT with so little distribution|pg||
nt|galadriel: So she shouldn't get too excited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  some chance of making 3NT if declarer knocks out the @cA early|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Another 1NT that should play well|pg||
nt|chick: now N needs to shut this down fast, with an opening as bad as that :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also help E with the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW are consistent|pg||
nt|galadriel: A coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4NT why the hurry?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@D seemed automatic from east, followed by 3@H from partner|pg||
nt|kemperg: sure|pg||
nt|mikeirl: you would like @Hs played to protect @S King, but doesn't actually matter on this layout|pg||
nt|kemperg: now she has no clue with @S Hx|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW are gald they are NV|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W tej sesji bêdziemy mieli okazjê zobaczyæ grê wielu zawodników, gdy¿ co ka¿d¹ rundê nowe pary zasiadaj¹ przy stole :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: It is a style thing - if partner expects you to routinely open bad 11 counts then it is not a problem - but you need to be consistent|pg||
nt|yo_yo: briony youngs hoping they dont win the first 5 @H tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if the @cK is offside, 5@c is not making either|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood reluctant to underlead her K@c into the strong hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: its a great small slam good enuf grand for Roland and the rabbi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might have rather more than 15|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead ducked |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  encouraged|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play reverse, so expecting 9 from S, 2 from North|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  AQ109 well worth the upgrade|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky here to get plus score|pg||
nt|jferg: and lose 10 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: well playing a cold,grand in a dodgy 3N is not mtoo impressive|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer goes for spades, South needs to grab the ace and continue hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT = both minors weak|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yorkbeach:  laydown without the @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on @s finesse now|pg||
nt|ady: this time if 3NT fails   then so foes 5@C|pg||
nt|mikeirl: it'll b a sweat now on the Q@S lead :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: W nastêpnej sesji bêdziemy towarzyszyæ parze Tuszyñski-Nowosadzki|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Scotland had a string of above average results in this room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mikeirl: n room|pg||
nt|coch draig: @c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good play to win trick 1 in dummy - North might have a bare @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card perfect so far for both sides :0|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: i think she'll find the @c now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - in the wrong hand for playing @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  Brock-Gross have bid game on 9 out of the first 10 boards|pg||
pc|d5|nt|baardolav: spørs om svindahl legger liten spar når det blir spilt... og det gjorde han...|pg||
nt|athene: yes but 3nt might fail a lot more|pg||
nt|kemperg: just made:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c is less down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kemperg: well deserved sweat|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North has !k_x, declarer might not need the spades, so right to play clubs|pg||
nt|coch draig: can take @d finesse anytime|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if South had the @cA she would take it and play a heart|pg||
nt|petepunt: really want to get to 2H but N/S play in @S very well after auction 1@C pass 1@H.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  do not think I would want to play them at rubber bridge :)|pg||
nt|ady: this time 11 tricks in 3!T|pg||
nt|lestergold: after the jump Finn was surely worth showing some @d support|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East should trust the defence and continue clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: ¯yczê wszystkim wspania³ych wra¿eñ :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: well, they are only little 50s|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: even if the trump finesse lost you would have chances|pg||
nt|lestergold: lazy bidding in my view|pg||
nt|mikeirl: well bid in open room|pg||
pc|s9|nt|galadriel: The local website for schedule and results :http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: draw trumps, cash hearts, play two rounds of clubs and hope for a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: if you cashed the @CA early someone might have to get cute and throw their king from Kx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: well done N/S in both rooms|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  ruffing the @s did not look right|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rnmalik: why not pitch small @C and play for @S 3/3.|pg||
nt|sheila a: You couldn't totally disagree with someone who upgraded the N hand to a strong NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  plus declarer has cut herself off from the hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: we might see a claim now|pg||
nt|lestergold: what cost exploring slam when pard has shown a big hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: pressure on N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for round 1 results|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  not convinced that was the right way to play @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North's failure to continue @h marked South with the ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  1 more trick for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would we say that if @S was wrong, i wonder :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  however, if she played a heart, North could set up a long diamond for South|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sheila a: The score on board 5 was entered on the wrong side.|pg||
nt|coch draig: N could not have 3 aces too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: Briony they wont throw away @HA|pg||
nt|athene: north should wave the @HA around and look bored|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: sesjonens 3. flate spill|pg||
nt|sheila a: Running total is probably 3-1 to Scotland at the moment|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: our first flat board!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a 3@s opening from N?|pg||
nt|chick: I would think so|pg||
nt|jferg: think 9 tricks in dias is limit|pg||
nt|mikeirl: competitive par score @S & @D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing a spade to the king risked losing two spades if North had two low|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yorkbeach:  so maybe right after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  discipline from Woodruff|pg||
nt|athene: 5431 usually you try to open at the 1 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they play Lucas as 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: if it's close|pg||
nt|simonr: hate these South hands - they are what strong club systems were made for!|pg||
nt|athene: because these are complex hands so you need room to investigate|pg||
nt|athene: but if you have to just jump shift of course you might run out of room anyway|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT     no easy ride|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am a fan of 2@c openings|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me too|pg||
nt|galadriel: 4@H for NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Slemsonen her...|pg||
nt|athene: also you much prefer to open 1@C on a very strong hand than 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S can get passed out way too easily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  prefer 1@s to 2NT if they are my only choices|pg||
nt|simonr: That just delays the problem to the rebid|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w hold the power on this hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@C here, but will end with 3NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes automatic, good save if i down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expected 10 IMPs to Scotland on 7 when Wiseman-McQuaker bid to 3NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sheila a: 3NT = a balanced raise to game|pg||
nt|galadriel: high card raise in @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|baardolav: ingen dårlig slem dette her?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Presumably limited|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes and then 4@h would be making so on all grounds it was right to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: Witamy serdecznie po przerwie, zawodnicy obecni przy stole zaczynamy grê|pg||
nt|marekw: running scores http://kongres.brydz.wlkp.pl/wyniki2011/sb1.html|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: po tej sesji przewidziana jest przerwa na obiad|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: E wypytuje szczegó³owo o system i uzgodnienia NS|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jbgood: 12 sammenligninger gjenstår - og 30 imp skal hentes inn... |pg||
nt|yo_yo: for those who dont know, the Lady Milne is an annual competition, all female.|pg||
nt|athene: i would open that 2@C but close|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2NT rebid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: on thse hnads you bid to the 4 level and let the opps guess about the 5 level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West rebid 3@c and East probed with 3@d to show the stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: not everyone's 1@H overcall at adverse|pg||
nt|athene: it wasn't east's in the other room anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no 2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why say the hand is balanced when it is not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wesy mighr regret opening|pg||
nt|mikeirl: my philosophy 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Play looks straightforward|pg||
nt|jferg: if mary leads a spade 4 dias makes|pg||
mb|3H|nt|galadriel: Do I have to get another coffee?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Careful, you'll end up wired|pg||
nt|galadriel: De-caff :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: I guess she will win the A |pg||
nt|roswolf: north might be tempted|pg||
nt|roswolf: but resists|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Welsh supporters will wish the vulnerability was the other way round here|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sheila a: In case it's a singelton|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi roland @H@H@H@H@H@H@H@H|pg||
nt|mikeirl: H! Likely|pg||
nt|mikeirl: @H K|pg||
nt|the saint: Looks like South's aggression will cost 800 though|pg||
nt|coch draig: on 7 in other room 3@C was rebid rather than the underbid 1N in here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could still be 800|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT for EW, so not a huge loss even if it is 800|pg||
nt|petepunt: bail out time,  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to end up as declarer but unlucky|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they can investigate for a 5 card major|pg||
nt|simonr: Hate showing a game force in spades with such a poor suit. i would show this as balanced and hope to show the 5@S via 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|lestergold: in open 4@s bid poorly judged aceless flat hand|pg||
nt|jferg: lead as expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3@d is pushy, imo. this is either a dead minimum 3@d or a maximum 2@d rebid|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch encouraged to go on by her Q@d|pg||
nt|the saint: But if West gets her ruff, is there a loser on loser on the 4th round of the suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hvis Sven Olai cuer nå er de i slem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Anita :)|pg||
nt|sheila a: East can easily be kept from enjoying her @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  might have anyway if North bid 2NT over 2@s|pg||
nt|athene: with a different 5431 i might pretend i was balanced but that one it doesn't look like a necessary distortion|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as a believer in suit quality, I would open 1@d as North|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: I slem er @CK kanskje utspillet?|pg||
nt|sharkey: LR spilt av V...|pg||
nt|jbgood: og de har fått den på rett hånd hvis syd forsøker et kløverutspill|pg||
nt|athene: slightly tricky now on the entries front|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lead resolves the @c suit nicely but declarer still a trick short|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Best for brYony not to cover|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might think the @cK is offside and try a @d to the king|pg||
nt|athene: declarer doesn't know the @CK is right so might not use her dummy entry to repeat the club hook|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there are lots of options, not trivial to play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|baardolav: Men vil vel gå bet... det er ingen vinnende variant enn å spille AK i hj to runder trumf og tre runder ruter, så innspill i kløver|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1@h would not have occured to me|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you need a spade as entry to the diamonds but that means you can't untangle 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s + 2@h + 2@d + 2@c = 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if E does not cash the @hK, time to set up @d|pg||
nt|athene: spade return now would be my guess|pg||
nt|athene: east has taken long enough now that she obviously hasn't got the @CA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is a first cap for West, Dinah Caplan, a rubber bridge player, i believe|pg||
nt|athene: with the @CA she would have cleared the hearts a long time ago|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  long pause is telling declarer who has the @cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East would be playing @h if holding a sure entry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ahh  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entries now to set up a @h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 2@H tricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: and too many wasted values in oppos suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: unless the operator played the wrong card :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer's tricks are not easy to unscramble|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may be able to throw a @d on a @h to escape for 500|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: next please.:)|pg||
nt|the saint: Just was I had thought|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petepunt: run for the hills time....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|galadriel: Spec suggests some might overcall 2@D but 5@D is not good at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|sheila a: wondering about a @c hook now|pg||
nt|lark20: It is now or never|pg||
nt|sheila a: she could knock out the @d A and come back to dummy with A@s later|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h10 is a winner|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: are MUD leads so popular outside england? i find them very hard to read at trick 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  that does seem better|pg||
pc|c8|nt|the saint: And there it is|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont they they play them anywhere else|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  cards lie well EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: EW have ended up in 4@s on board 7|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||

nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd have bid 1@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|chick: NS play weak NTs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@H usually preemptive...|pg||
nt|lestergold: good enuf on a finesse basically little less than 50% |pg||
nt|mikeirl: ? pass from W|pg||
nt|jferg: not geting any encouragement to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Burns-Greenwood play that a 2 over 1 response is game forcing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: they might reach 3nt|pg||
nt|sheila a: not a sequence that comes up every day|pg||
nt|lark20: most would but in this instance may regret it|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of those bids that work out sometimes and produce a disaster sometimes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  alwasy bidding game once North does not pass 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would be a bit of view to pass, even with 4333 shape |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  AK ruff|pg||
nt|petepunt: always likely to get to 3@S but cards are very badly placed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @H switch|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mikeirl: Yes, N.I. bid to 5@D on Board 6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Kopi av meldingene i LR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously not for the welsh NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has a tough call|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is better but the hand has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they may not be able to stop so low|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 41H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel n/s are encouraging it .... in a way...|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to watch - |pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelievable|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||
nt|athene: interesting though - if you think east would lead a spade from @SKQJ on this bidding, then she pretty much has to have both hearts for the opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD MAKE SHOULDNT IT!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot think there is more chance of beating 4@h than amking 4@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: yes, opps didn't interfere|pg||
nt|coch draig: 2@s invitational with 4 spades (nf)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  yes it sounds like NS are playing non-promissory Stayman|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be pleased with the size of teh club led|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must be 4-4 as East did not double 2@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still scope to misguess @h|pg||
nt|coch draig: the hearts could not lay better|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should you lead the J - catering for AQ or Q9 onside?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: doubel game swing?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: forrige spill:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdrkwjXzPHE|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: LUkket spiller spill 11|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine videosnutter du produserer, Snorre!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  played the 10 at the other table, hence the overtrick|pg||
nt|sheila a: a sensible spot|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|coch draig: and diamonds 3-3 too|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HA, @C hook +1|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west must come to a @d trick so looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|coch draig: i'd lead the @h2|pg||
nt|petepunt: @D loser will go away|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|galadriel: I understand you have to bid 1NT in the system, but I'd feel uncomfortable about not bidding that nice @C suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence blissfully unaware of N's 6 card suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although this sequence normally shows some @c length|pg||
nt|pfbr: what would q@cs mean?|pg||
nt|galadriel: Give partner Qx and 3NT could be rolling home|pg||
nt|chick: it's still possible for N to go wrong, but not easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay does not have enough memoery for the @h combo|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now. Wrong minor to play on|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  yes only 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: where are the K@S K@D is Norths question|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  do not understand this line of play|pg||
nt|sheila a: Q asks for attitude so might have been from KQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: even if you put in the @S10 and then set up the diamond for a spade pitch, you still have to negotiate the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: so 11 tricks is a very good result for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: why the @c pitch?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: now has 9 for sure, and cashing out will pick up the @DQ for 2 more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes might finesse trying to make|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: declarer was banking on 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 major aces|pg||
pg||
