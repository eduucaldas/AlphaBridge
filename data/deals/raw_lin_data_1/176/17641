nt|ianmcc: that 2@h bold & successful|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|marcsmith: bit good for 2H OMO|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4H-5C-5S-6C would be a good start to auction :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5C surely from Eaat|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S as well makes it less attractive|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: the red save look waaaaaaaaay too expensive |pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3C is feeble|pg||
nt|hoffers: Interesting that both Norths opened 2@h with a side 4@s|pg||
nt|marcsmith: makes things far too easy for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: i have seen peake open 1@H with hands like this|pg||
nt|peachy: strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and both overcalled 3C|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that doesnt matter, but TWO is not enough|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3C is hopeless|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5C-5S-6C seems normal now tho|pg||
nt|hoffers: A good result for Travis in Open room. Note the transfer overcall in the open room|pg||
nt|peachy: E will surely make some noise here, then it is up to West to decide if he wants to go on|pg||
mb|3C|an|?|nt|sybarra: well perhaps someone could explain the OR auction |pg||
nt|sybarra: at least the first couple of bids|pg||
nt|marcsmith: jeez|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: east should clearly bid 5C after such a slow pass tho :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugrapha1: I would gues that the auction is missing a pass at the start|pg||
nt|sybarra: a pass missing here? |pg||
nt|peachy: Hmm,  maybe he thinks 4S goes down?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: serves him right for not biddinmg 5C on the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: rehi all :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes sense|pg||
nt|hoffers: Peake must be delighted with auction!|pg||
nt|marcsmith: for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|marcsmith: EW were incredibly weak|pg||
nt|marcsmith: candy from babies|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: director has been called, 3@C was not alerted by East|pg||
nt|hoffers: While Peake will get a @h ruff, this defence makes it easy for Hans. A trump lead would have been difficult|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: It is always a problem (unless discussed) what cuebid their suit is when they open 1C.  Of course 3C coulda been minisplinter, mixed raise, or something other.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ianmcc: North knows @dA won't cash|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: not sure how they made in the other room |pg||
nt|marcsmith: judging whether to save over 5S is difficult, but allowing them to play 4S is very poor|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|nigel: A lucky 3NT with the clubs coming in|pg||
nt|rv: maybe even on @s lead, declarer could have survived, play would be a lot more complicated though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time saving lead, then|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a little hard for East now; |pg||
nt|rv: is 2@c single suiter, capp style?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't know - a transfer is also possible|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p!|nt|tejjyid: I can guess 2@D is t/o of a xfer|pg||
nt|nigel: Good to see both sides bidding each other's suits!|pg||
nt|rv: in last deal, on @s lead, declarer should win in hand and play a @h out, defense is caught on morton fork|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: maybe 2@c is transfer to @d, 2@d seems to be cue showing shortness and comp hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: so, West may be inclined to push for the game now with his massive sharp suit stoppers|pg||

nt|marcsmith: 4H for NS if declarer guesses the trumps |pg||
nt|marcsmith: East surely going to bid 4S this time tho|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: apparently EW don't have any agreement about the previous 3@C bid. East thought it was a splinter, West thought it might be a 4-card limit raise.|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: more of a mixed raise than a pre-emptive raise on that south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: but not going to stop EW bidding 4S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to find the red save in 5H then guess the trumps|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Justin, I assume score was not adjusted or any other ruling made|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it seems the result will stand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugrapha1: it was one off in the other room as well|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: I suppose the defence is clear - @c trick for N then @s switch but there's many a slip...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: south gave north no real chance with his 3H|pg||
nt|hoffers: 5@h always 2 off (club ruff)|pg||

nt|tomi2: 4@H was not the best spot for Auguri in the CR...|pg||
nt|cicus: closed room chose the wrong  denomination|pg||

nt|hoffers: Overboard already|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: nothing to the play|pg||
nt|marcsmith: should make 11|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can draw trumps and lead towards CK for a discard|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|peachy: I think South took a view, 3S ostensibly shows 3-card spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marcsmith: on a technical point, most people play 1H-2N and 1S-2N as jacoby, but it is more efficient to use 1H-2S as it gives you the extra step you need to show everything|pg||
nt|peachy: Better name, it really is confusing to use a name that is reserved for someo ther conventions|pg||

nt|marcsmith: opposite 14-16 it's closer to a transfer, and if West breaks then East would go on to game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: we need to feed the dealer some red meat - this lot is not raising anybody's blood presure|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Some would bid 2C with S hand, but as S does not imagine a game, why locate GCP for declarer, whiule bidding the lowest ranking suit (and thus very unlikely to win any partscore ...|pg||

nt|marcsmith: deserves partner's black suits to be reversed|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv: I prefer inverted pseudo suction against strong @c, suit bid shows that suit or next 2 higher suits|pg||

nt|marcsmith: amazing that East would put that dummy down in 3N|pg||
nt|marcsmith: could easily have 12 on top|pg||
nt|hoffers: This may be Travis's chance, if they can beat 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: 1N|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there shd be no hesitation here|pg||
nt|marcsmith: West would have bid differently with AKxxx/xx/Kx/Axxx?|pg||
nt|noodle:  they usually puy dummy down in Oz  its traditionnal :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Three more hands at this table, it would be a miracle for the score to be close, let alone Travis charge in the lead.  But we'll see if there are still some interesting hands|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: before the bidding has ended?|pg||
nt|peachy: will this be a positive response|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's a load of jumk|pg||
nt|noodle:  A+K yes|pg||
nt|hoffers: I would move them to within 12 imps, with some good boards still to come|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chilloncan: grandppay always preached that 11 loser hands shouldnt volunteer to go to the 3 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: three sontrols nothing to sneeze at, with 6-4|pg||
nt|peachy: 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok,  i need explanation.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @H a spade raise?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1S  shows Hearts |pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: NS overbid to game in CR, can this pair stay low?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a negative on that would be perverse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: another explanation:  1@S positive w @H  2@H support|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1NT over 1S would have been Relay , I presume |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|offthebend: therefore 2H must be minimum with 3+ H |pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1NT was control showing?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: with traffic light "green"  - they were always headed to 4@S|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sure|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cicus: well done|pg||
nt|chilloncan: destined to be in 4SX for sure|pg||
nt|marcsmith: does anyone really still play that?|pg||
nt|peachy: I apolouize to colleagues and kibs alike for typos, my fingers are numb|pg||
nt|marcsmith: when i interviewed Garozzo for 'World Class' 10 years ago he admitted that control-showing responses didn't work|pg||
nt|marcsmith: this hand is a classic example -- north needs to show his shape and now has no room|pg||
nt|noodle:  except if you end up defending marc|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|marcsmith: if you open a strong club and make a control-showing response with oppo silent, chances are against having to defend|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: layout will help to make it -1|pg||
nt|sybarra: can a club lead be found?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 rounds of clubs and ?|pg||
nt|noodle:  was telegraphed by auction|pg||
nt|noodle:  a few double dummy defenses when opps intervened in blue book|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he's 6-5 and bid one of his suits once and the other one never -- great system|pg||
nt|noodle:  bought a good lead though :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: good lead -- declarer can now set up 4 heart tricks |pg||
nt|marcsmith: Jx/Qx are horrible leads|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much rather lead a diamond from Kxx|pg||
nt|hoffers: Having disguised His shape, the lead has given him a chance in the only possible making contract|pg||
nt|noodle:  In sales we call it Peake performance :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i thought -2|pg||
nt|offthebend: this should go one down UNLESS Hans peeps :) after 3 rounds of Clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cicus: to make 3NT you will have to be extremely lucky in the red suits|pg||
nt|offthebend: many options -- may go after clubs also |pg||
pc|d8|nt|marcsmith: ony works against blind school of course |pg||
nt|marcsmith: normal to play a heart to 10 now surely|pg||
nt|offthebend: S to the J and then revert back to H if D are not switched to |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|cicus: such as to find @HKQ onside 3rd and @Ds 3-3|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: altogether for red suits 9%|pg||
nt|offthebend: make 11 tricks her now for 13 imp pick up -- match  hotting up suddenly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|marcsmith: i think if you gave that East hand to an expert panel to rank leads on this auction, the JH would be right down at the bottom along with SA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: stranger things have happened, here is a good start for Travis on that path|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hoffers: After @cK, I think defence can always prevail|pg||
nt|peachy: I think this line is within percentages - clubs normal split|pg||
nt|hoffers: Amazing. An easy way to get them|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c7|nt|offthebend: well she found Partner's second long suit but not good enough spots:)  |pg||
nt|peachy: but not as the cards lie|pg||
nt|noodle:  does!5 change when q@c pops up ?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, not too robust even for a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|noodle:  %|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: should have changed horses then|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm such a slow tyuper sometimes|pg||
nt|marcsmith: would play Q from all sorts of 2-3 card holdings tho|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marcsmith: so could be Q QJ Q10 Qx QJ10|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: strange to play G jack|pg||
nt|chilloncan: D|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it can only help declarer, whatever his hand is|pg||
nt|chilloncan: now W worried N is 55 blacks|pg||
nt|chilloncan: W worried about being endplayed|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he should decide that N unlikely to play clubs so early and committally with the ten in his hand|pg||
nt|hoffers: Even if 55 blacks, safe to duck|pg||
nt|chilloncan:  but not if N has 5143|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|cicus: 7 fat IMPs for the trailing team,still hope|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and ten of clubs|pg||
nt|offthebend: he may still come home with some trump coup |pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|s7|pg||
mc|10|nt|offthebend: HJ lead and we all know the hands - looked easy  -- but  declarer took a reasonable line - hoping for 3-2 break in C or even 4-1 with single honour ( 10 ,J or Q ) on the left |pg||
nt|marcsmith: perhaps someone will play a diamond now?|pg||

nt|hoffers: Both defenders lost second @d trick!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: welcome david|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on last hand...big surpruse to both N and S that 4S was a phantom|pg||
nt|hoffers: Another 4@s save available, but I will be surprised if NS do save|pg||
nt|peachy: It really wasnt an easy hand without seeing all four|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a good result for NS in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: mircale 500 in the save|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|cicus: this board may be another pickup for them|pg||
nt|jkotor: and thats all|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 3N is tha spot|pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to put the DK on lead and then guess the clubs to make 6N|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6S almost bound to fail as West has an obvious diamond lead|pg||
nt|hoffers: If they go to extra boards, there will be a lot of planes missed!!|pg||
nt|offthebend: S may push here towards 6C -- thinking her team needs it |pg||
mb|1H|nt|hoffers: One disadvantage of transfer openings is that it gives South 2 ways of entering, X and 1@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: we are still waiting for a deal where the EW transfer opening bids show themselves to good advantage|pg||
mb|p|nt|hoffers: I play that 1@h shows the type of hand South holds|pg||
nt|noodle:  well it s an exciting match for sure|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hoffers: while X is a GOOD takeout|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes transfer openings are very user friendly...for the enemy|pg||
nt|hoffers: NS may now find the save!|pg||
nt|frankaus: this may induce the 4@S save  - tho i doubt it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a few more hands |pg||
nt|noodle:  1@s 2@d by S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@H in CR was certainly anexaggeration|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the hardest part about ANY constructive method is designing the countermeasures to intervention. if our constructive system PROLIFERATES  the opportunities for the enemy to ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: intervene, it is going to have to show a MASSIVE profit over standard methods to be worth the candle|pg||
nt|hoffers: On @d lead, cold|pg||
nt|ianmcc: could even make it|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|offthebend: not very likely opposite a nebulous D tho -- limited usually to 11 these days :)|pg||
nt|peachy: does 1S imply a real minor suit, clubs or diamonds, anyone know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would want to get into this auction |pg||
nt|marcsmith: lots of guessing yes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: transfers over 1/2 NT all but universal - i'm of the view that transfer methods improve ur results|pg||
nt|offthebend: can they find 2S now ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 queens might dissuade me|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: possible swing here --- only 6H and 6NT by N makes on a good club guess |pg||
nt|marcsmith: have to deciade whether to run the opening lead, or play for trumps 3-2 and a correct club guess|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can make 6S but not obvious that you will|pg||
nt|marcsmith: since it needs trumps 3-2 and a winning club guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: still 2 more to play, isn't it?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sorry hadn't examined the @c split|pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  if you disregard KJ10x@d lead can pitxh @cs and play towards q@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: well done |pg||
nt|offthebend: How did they make all 13 tricks :) D lead to the Q and C to K ducked |pg||
nt|hoffers: No. Win A, draw trumps, discard @c on @hs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, you have to guess who has the DK|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: well there is a bit of a difference. when we open showing a strong hand, the opponents dont intervene as often as they can at the one level;|pg||
nt|noodle:  not impressed by the P on 1@h|pg||
nt|hoffers: Unlikely to lead @dJ from KJ|pg||
nt|hoffers: Just to scare audience!!|pg||
nt|peachy: just shows you are not doubledummying, good for you|pg||
pc|c3|nt|offthebend: should pick up at least 1 imp here |pg||
nt|peachy: but there is a bit more to potential slam hopes anyway :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marcsmith: really?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: overtrick if careful|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|offthebend: SQ dropping doubleton easy 10 tricks |pg||
nt|hoffers: Should have made 10 in open room, so likely 1 imp to Travis|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|pc|c4|nt|chilloncan: difficult to imagine getting to 4H in less than 5 rounds of bidding otherwise...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cicus: this is going downso not that big pickup after all, only 3 IMP's|pg||
nt|peachy: Why is it so clear to make 10, am I missing something?|pg||
nt|offthebend: at this stage every imp counts :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|hoffers: The play will be quicker, even for Peter|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4C=3S=2D=1H|pg||
nt|hoffers: Remember 26, 27 and 28 are all potential pickups for Travis|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marcsmith: isn't it normal to lead a suit containing king of queen against a small slam, to set up your trick?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|marcsmith: king or queen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|offthebend: spec points out that 3D only 1down -- correct but N is aceless and not a great fit - can get into trouble if D are 4-1 instead of 3-2 with K onside |pg||

nt|hoffers: Note the adjusted score, from what was shown on BBO at end of set 3|pg||
mb|r!|nt|chilloncan: 3S understandable .... if 3S is game:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: unless something goes redoubled here we cannow safely congratulate Auguri to their win|pg||

pc|s5|nt|cicus: NS did put up a valiant fight but that proved a little few for their excellent opposition|pg||

nt|rv: not sure what rules are if there is a tie, in direct match between teams in league stage, Travis won comprehensively against Hans, not sure if that matters if there is a tie|pg||
