nt|Walddk2: if 1NT shows 18-19, I agree. Maybe it does not for them|pg||
nt|psyck: the good @d suit sure makes 2N a good bid|pg||

nt|granguru: EW 4@D|pg||
nt|granguru: hi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Good eve from Norway.|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@d would have to be played by W|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Joe|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hawe45: This one is new...|pg||
nt|granguru: in fact id can be beaten from any side|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: NS play strong club|pg||
nt|santyclz: It must be *very* strong if the n hand didn't qualify.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: sry natural system for NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: oh good, not my best expertise |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello again Stefan :) |pg||
nt|psyck: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure how high anyone will get here |pg||
nt|sybarra: W likely to bid 3 @S,  then waht |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: West is likely to expect the queen of @H to pull more weight|pg||
nt|granguru: if @H is opened soon enough|pg||
nt|granguru: from S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 nt not a great success|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we agree that u2 are right:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonderful non-fitting hand |pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Friggi|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@S can be beaten just in 1 way|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sold free from the MOL|pg||
nt|granguru: @D lead and small @H from W..N must guess|pg||
nt|psyck: was borderline for W to balance|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: Down 1 doubled is the best bridge :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he was not doubled |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Both pairs did well to stay low on that dangerous deal, I presume there will be some larger figures somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: better play to take @HQ in case 10 comes|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so maybe we say great bridge :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|1H|an|cannot be 5332|nt|vugraphzdh: As you can see, N-S 1@D opening is really a "catch all"|pg||

nt|sybarra: gm Joe:)  welcome |pg||
mb|d|nt|santyclz: Just what e wanted to hear...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@h will likely make here, 3NT more comfortable|pg||
nt|sybarra: both pairs play precision |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Arifin Halim|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hello everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Their 2@C opening shows both minors. |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: Strong @c styles popular in Iceland|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we have a great operator,  with super alerts and explanations |pg||
nt|santyclz: Great, a simple natural system (in some of it's 22,534 varieties).|pg||
nt|sybarra: I said earlier, re precision, "i know just enough to be dangerous" |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: A wise pass from West, as 3@D make easily|pg||
nt|granguru: @D neg 1@S second neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: Hi Ahalim|pg||
nt|ahalim: Hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Sverrir thinking|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Sorry, I see it is Arifin|pg||
nt|psyck: Helped them win the Bermuda Bowl once, in 1995 i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well stopped|pg||
nt|granguru: 1991 |pg||
nt|psyck: thx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Can w suss out the @s lead?  And does it matter?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahalim: np :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: In some versions 2@h would have been an asking bid.|pg||
nt|santyclz: "Natural and asking"|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 off the top here (with @D hook),  looks like best place |pg||
nt|sybarra: spades favorable so maybe 10 |pg||
nt|sybarra: N may not be inclined to play nt however |pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahalim: 4@H looks OK with both minor suit Kings well placed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It's past my bedtime|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Double dummy you might scrape home 6@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: not sure I would want to be in 6 however |pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 of 3 finesses on, a real Roland slam.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: No, it requires good news in @S and @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is why it is a Roland slam |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Roland would make 7, with KJx onside in @D :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: right|pg||
nt|santyclz: But of course.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: not a lot of entries to declarers hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: in NT |pg||

nt|sybarra: now or never? |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|rodal f: It was a odd numberJohn.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Which, of course, you don't need any more.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andreasw:  yes.. he know N-S is vull and problebly stands better in 3@d so no reason to dbl them out of a bad score:)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|pc|cK|nt|granguru: they made a relay @C which could describe precisely 99% of the hands .all 13 cards|pg||
nt|granguru: distribution I mean|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The defence might score 3 trump tricks for a set !|pg||
nt|santyclz: With the bad @C break, s needed to start the @ds with the slightly unusual j.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzdh: A @S now kills the contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: 3@H opening and 3@S balancing is likely|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was to young in 1991. Only 17Y 176M|pg||
nt|granguru: After it there were some exciting  systems Relay precision by danielson Ultimate club by Granovetter, rubin et al|pg||
nt|psyck: being able to show 19-20 instead of 20-21 in a standard method sure helped last deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|14-17 5332 possible|nt|friggi: strange not to cash the Q of @H|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Majors|nt|hawe45: 4 @S is the bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: N-S @C opening includes all 11-14 balanced, can have 5-card Major !|pg||
nt|granguru: we were all very young in 1991 I was 45|pg||
nt|sybarra: the catch all 1 @D |pg||
nt|santyclz: In the real world, that contract had very little chance although it might have made double dummy.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: I was in college then :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 45? months?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: dbl from Hrólfur?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see a X in his hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: At this vulnerability, South has maximum defence, so double by North is hard to find|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|granguru: some of the world champios are playing this tourney|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: I would have put NF  for alert |pg||
nt|friggi: S put all his money on @C Q on side as well as good @C brake|pg||

nt|psyck: @sj can be promoted on 4th @h|pg||
nt|granguru: what was 2@C I wonder|pg||
nt|santyclz: A good hand for SDAM (Six Diamonds Always Makes).|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ahalim: N has not enough tricks imo|pg||
nt|ianmcc: has to start @h|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: suit prefs on 2nd @d if played would get it rite for them|pg||
nt|rodal f: checkback?|pg||
nt|granguru: Gazzilli most probable|pg||
nt|granguru: 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: convention - either 16+ or @s and @c|pg||
nt|psyck: upside down carding for EW looks like|pg||
nt|granguru: well got 1/2 of the agreement right|pg||
nt|psyck: a more complicated version than Gazzilli maybe, hexa sounds equally menacing|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to handle the @d loser and the @H's |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely as the the cards the sit  |pg||
nt|santyclz: No overtricks, precision bidding as advertised.  In this case playing the 4-4 wouldn't bring an o/t.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: or hoping @C J will drop|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sensible @sK|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: @sQ is an entry, @s return gives a trick|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes he is hoping for 5@C tricks and 2 @D tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: esp with that club suit |pg||

nt|sybarra: who knows is any is cashing |pg||
nt|sybarra: *if any |pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzdh: He should ruff a @S and then play 3 @D from the top|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to see |pg||
nt|santyclz: Is there a rule in Iceland that all team names must start with "G"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Get the defence to open @H or give a ruff-sluff|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that cuts him in half|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Stefán lays his cards down thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The fact that declarer got a favourable lead and favourable trump layout and is still 1 off supports my opinion on the 4@S bid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|santyclz: He has the @h9, can just double-finesse.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Bit funny. Non asked what 1NT ment at last board. |pg||
nt|sybarra: of course was playing agst Grant Thornton|pg||

nt|sybarra: 5/4 muiderberg or something? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Weak, with exactly 5@H and should be 2-3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: probably because they play a relay system|pg||
nt|santyclz: So that's a chance for Aron... I don't know that it's biddable after a 1nt opening.  W has 17 in all primes.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Many use the same at 2/1. At the edge by 5HP and 3@S by the 2/1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: roaring into 4 @S now if my guess |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: Ambitious - 200|pg||
nt|granguru: things returning to normality|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Exsept that a color is lost EW|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andreasw:  why 200?|pg||
nt|hawe45: No - it´s too late - one down then|pg||
nt|granguru: both pairs have found their fits|pg||
nt|granguru: W pass showed continuous suits|pg||
nt|granguru: so 2@H shows @H and @S|pg||
nt|granguru: Therefore it was alerted|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ianmcc: 2NT too far|pg||
nt|psyck: A form of twisted swine defense after weak NT-(x)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not going to be a successful double (imo)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: A bit tempting, knowing you have at least 21 HCP and massive control of all suits except trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Note that South also knows pd has 2@S !|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT even further|pg||

pc|c6|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

nt|santyclz: The "wildly optomistic" 6@h (to be nice about it).|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahalim: 3NT EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: should be a routine @s game here|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If North finds a balancing 4NT, West might get an unpleasant surprise|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He probably expects 5@H to be several off and 5@S to make|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would be thrilled to put down the W hand (usually have voids in pards suits) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: so 2@h not a good move|pg||
nt|ahalim: not anymore :(|pg||
nt|granguru: can ask I got a pre script from QUEENOFHEA where it named as that |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: I think Double but 1NT also works|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andreasw:  wow|pg||

nt|psyck: ok|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: BBO needs to allow more than 10 charecters for login names :)|pg||
nt|granguru: the problem was with the graphics|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andreasw:  a vert nice @s suit by S  but also a hand that looks like a 1nt bid... what would you open Hans?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here comes the club lead |pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: I used to play Twisted Swine when I used Precision & weak NT, mostly play 2/1 now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|granguru: as u see here names overlap on the bidding square|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahalim: would you have bid 1NT w the E hand ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure there are relays here,  I just dont know them |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, relaying. Seems to end in 3NT with 9-10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: a rather more simple auction at the other table |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45: Depends on, what the re-bid of 2 NT shows|pg||
nt|sybarra: (for specs, put cursor over open room results under West and see auction)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Oddur reasonably is thinking about 5 or 6 @D rather than 3 nt|pg||
nt|psyck: Some I know like to play Prec when NV & 2/1 vul, an interesting style...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|granguru: so that they cant be caught in 1NTx with 12-14|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|granguru: vul vs not|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, part of the reason, also when you are nv & opps vul, they will not interferse so easily over your relays, several other reasons for it probably|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzdh: I guess that @H2 was showing @Cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: except that disappeared for me, maybe changed, as we see to +3 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzdh: After a @C lead, finessing @D will be too dangerous|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Best odd to handle the @S is?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Gevalia went + in both rooms on 17 for 1st blood.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|santyclz: GT also went -3 in 3nt on 18.  It seems strange because -2 was easy at this table and wouldn't give up chances.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|psyck: double fin i suppose|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|friggi: +3 in the open room is one too many|pg||

nt|friggi: yes it looks wird|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: assuming no other consideration|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer has a pretty good count of the hand though|pg||
nt|sybarra: it was +2, then changed, and not record of lead |pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree by the total 54%|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|friggi: ok that makes sense|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Bad lead did not stop them for the right defence :)|pg||
nt|psyck: if some intermediate cards were missing, then A & low to T would be slightly better|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||

nt|icechem:  if he had bid 2@h he would probably have played it|pg||

nt|psyck: not too sure about gamble, he probably just bid it as a practical bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: D followed by 3H might have showed a good 1 suiter. |pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: but when u like to play 4@H - why mess around|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H is a precical bid - and if S is very weak then make pressure on EW - 4@h in the long run is a winning bid |pg||
nt|kemperg: what is his problem now?|pg||
nt|pelu: to take @HJ and ruff with @HA if @Cs are 5-2|pg||

nt|vugraphzdh: North has a huge maximum for his bidding, because 3@S here is not inviting game|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont count on pard for perfect hand,  He never has it !  (someone famous said that) |pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@c usually shows a good wk 2 in @hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: guess they do not play Drury either|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normal lead from S after a @S opening always @D?|pg||
nt|psyck: or maybe an different form of it :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: This should be down quickly.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: North probably downgraded his hand after the double of 2@H|pg||
nt|friggi: that is an overkill|pg||
mb|4D!|an|cue|nt|sybarra: spade lead will not be good for declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  a clear 1@D in my system by S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no way South or even me would lead a heart on this auction |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Good lead by South, knowing that his partner was prepared to pass a 2@S reply to Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And that declarer is not particularly scared of a @H lead|pg||
nt|friggi: @S was pretty obvious lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: my aunt minnie would not lead a @H given E saying he has that suit,   |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Considering that 3NT made in the open room, East was doomed on this hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: @d would restrict them to 8 tricks though as likely to fin @s|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s could well make on normal @h lead though|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: trumps!|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure we are playing here yet |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok now we are|pg||
mb|4N|an|RKCB I think|nt|vugraphzdh: I would have opened 1@D too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But the fact that the 1@C opening can include a 5 card major does it that they are more strict on the point count|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: I think they "only" open with 11 balanced if they have a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: The tempo needed for EW|pg||
mb|5D!|an|1 or 4 aces|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|psyck: can even make 4 by dropping @s now, @hA lead & @d switch would have been reqd to ensure no 10 tricks double dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and at the other table, they got a low ht lead, winning q in dummy,  the rest is history |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better than the spade finesse|pg||

nt|sybarra: is it an obvious club lead with the X?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Surprisingly for East, a @S lead kills the defence|pg||

nt|granguru: but 1@S the previous round|pg||
nt|santyclz: You would think you'd want 3@h to show that hand unless the 3@c bid was a game force.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: 7HP by the bad @HQ but else a very good hand with nothing waisted|pg||
nt|granguru: Hauker should have bid 2@D, not 2@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told 2@c could be 4@s, 5@h so I guess that's what the 3@h bid would show.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: pass and let pard XX?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: The double is good news for South, almost doomed to bid slam now|pg||
nt|granguru: now he will think a lot and pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: So the right question is: N????? Did he X!!!!!|pg||
nt|friggi: this will make duw to @S10x|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: 3@S just showing 4@H and asking pd to choose between 3nt and 4@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: XX for first round control|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even with the @c and @h breaks?|pg||
nt|friggi: better line to overtake and discard @D on @C then ruff @D and play @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, didn't see that.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|santyclz: 3 rounds of @ss now beats it.|pg||

nt|sybarra: S may be concerned since he as not cued his @D |pg||
nt|rodal f: By 4-2-2-5 and hoped for a 3@D bid from pard|pg||

pc|s7|nt|psyck: with a passed pd, N knew he will not get overboard by an offshape x, & he was justified here|pg||
nt|sybarra: E trying to show all the hcp he can |pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzdh: That was weird|pg||
nt|sybarra: or safely settle for 5,  (wise choice) |pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He has horrible trumps though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|friggi: very safely |pg||

nt|psyck: hmmm|pg||
nt|psyck: not a truck declarer expected to win|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|warrens:  it's a great position where West, if he had led from the J of @D, would have to go up on the second round to prevent the extra entry.  here, it will lead to down an extra trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: but only one way to make this hand |pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: meaning S hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: 2@d instead of 2@c is an interesting suggestion, but i guess those @d's looked more like a 4 carder to him|pg||

nt|sybarra: as entry |pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzdh: The defence can only get 1 @C trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: but not in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: ak and x of @D  lead may be interesting|pg||
nt|psyck: I sympathise with West head shake|pg||
nt|santyclz: One of each so it depends on @s ruffs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: That peculiar 9 of @D is maybe an effort to get partner to play on @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: E is known to have a maximum of 2 @ss so the non-@s lead by itself is suspicious.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If some Wests choose to open 1NT, N-S might end in a @S contract :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: N, of course, isn't just suspicious, he knows.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Declarer's problem is that he looses a valuable entry if he goes up with the ace of @D|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzdh: The @S suit itself is playable for only 1 looser, but needs some entries for that|pg||

nt|pelu: hi all - strange 2@D - can u explain?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridge.is/meistarastig/20102011/magiccontest.htm  running scores|pg||
nt|vugraphzzh: 2@D is @D and @s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kemperg: th Gudni|pg||
nt|psyck: They play a kind of Twisted Swine runouts|pg||
nt|pelu: ok @S-lead and @C back = down 2|pg||
nt|psyck: pass would ask for xx etc.|pg||
nt|psyck: on weak NT, such runouts enable you to find your cheapest 7 card fit at the 2 level|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But your fit here is in clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: yes Roland, there are variations & could occasionally get you to 2nd best fit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|psyck: but the main point is to ensure that you play in a 7+ card fit|pg||

nt|santyclz: And he duly was.|pg||
mb|d|nt|andreasw:  Ok so im back seing S did not find the @c lead :)|pg||
nt|psyck: a hand designed to get one overboard|pg||
nt|santyclz: I lived in Bergen county 30 yrs ago and uses to play against Marty and his "Guideline" (which never failed to get a rise.)|pg||
mb|4H!|an|pass or correct|nt|ahalim: sry bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A possible swing to come?|pg||
mb|p!|an|!h|nt|psyck: borderline between 2@d & x, with a passed pd, i prefer x as it give more spots to play in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: dislke X , improves West|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And here we have a slam that is very hard to beat, needing a trump lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: And a chance for GA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Looks like E-W will score some undertrick IMPs here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzdh: could be luckier lead|pg||
nt|friggi: doubt that|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h break sinks this contract, N might be able to get out for -1 and 3 imps.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice tight match.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: I called it the Guideline Of Total Tricks so you could say "mein Gott" when it worked.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: South is bidding very slowly with his @D monster|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: He will hardly find out about partners @H stopper from now on|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|psyck: also, i like my 2 level minor overcalls to be six carders|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andreasw:  even with a trump lead it should win... .. |pg||
nt|andreasw:  6@s now on the weak hand .. goos thing it does not matter here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahalim: after this board we'll have a new leader|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Not a successful bidding plan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: I might have opened 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: If not, then bidding 2 or 3 @H next round to ask for stopper|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Tough hand to bid, the fact that South showed a positive hand for @H might actually push them to 7 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: But I doubt North will take such a guess|pg||
nt|friggi: now N has some hope|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh he has hope, I'm afraid it's going to be dashed, though.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: A much better contract than that reached in the open room, where they demonstrated that this *is* a down-side to transfer advances.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andreasw:  S showing @d K know should slow N down|pg||
nt|friggi: has to play low @C and hope for the best|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: it worked well here with W seeing no need to come in with those 5 rags in @d|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|h3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|psyck: & defensive @s cards|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't see a line from up here, but great declarers make contracts single dummy that I can't see double dummy.|pg||

nt|brgpro: hi. or Hei,|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello Jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ndew suit at the 4 level is a cuebid after a pre-empt|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kemperg: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect Sigurbjörn can't afford to bypass 4@H without a diamond cuebid|pg||
nt|brgpro: well...not really...many experts play, after 3@d@h@s. 4C=asking|pg||
nt|psyck: S has now highlighted his lack of @s control|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, CK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: would 3@S not be natural?|pg||
nt|brgpro: some of them play as direct key card, answers: 0, 1 1+Q, 2 2+Q|pg||
nt|psyck: on 4@h, S would have cues @s if he had control there|pg||
nt|psyck: so, 5@d denies @s control i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh now, yes, but after 3@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: some of them play as asking how do u feel like ur opening? 4@d=i dont like, from 4@h and one are key card answering...as above|pg||
nt|psyck: rightYou are right Roland, i was only commenting on 5@d there|pg||
nt|kemperg: not after 3@H|pg||
nt|brgpro: this hand, however, 4@c as cue bid works well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No alternative to making 7@H if you are in it|pg||
nt|brgpro: S might bid 7 now, although it is not the contract u want to be in|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: sensibly done|pg||
nt|kemperg: after playing it is:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand pre-e shd be a serious one, doesnt matter about the Vul. N can have either black K|pg||
nt|pelu: could S by bidding 5NT ask for 3. round control in minor?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|kemperg: we play 4@C and higher as special control askings|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brgpro: not this time i am afraid.....not even between my pdship.....an 11 years pdship|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: Yes, I also play sound preempts 1st two seat irrespective of vul, but preemptive style vary a lot|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|h7|nt|kemperg: so 4NT here, as 4@S is kickback RKC|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|brgpro: i do think 4@c as optional RKC is a good idea, it frees ur hands to open some wild 3 openings|pg||

nt|santyclz: Thanks, Stefan, marvelous job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Going in to the last board, GT has a 2imp lead.  One of BBO's patented vg matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Last board now. A natural hopeless 4@S I presume|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psyck: Last deal.  Thanks to my co-commentators.  Excellent job Operator.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & for their inputs.|pg||
nt|santyclz: ANT moves out by taking a 5@h sac vs the 4@s made at this table.|pg||
nt|santyclz: This hand you have to get a @s que from pd.  N made the q at the other table.|pg||
mb|4C!|an|F|nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|not first round control|nt|friggi: must be super forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdh: 3NT have a chance though|pg||
nt|santyclz: With 4333 and a maximum combined 29 hcp it's hard to see what s is contemplating.|pg||
nt|jbennet: this kind of board test judgement.|pg||
nt|friggi: Stefán is 2@s showing min here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: And obviously, with this shape, South is giving it a thought|pg||
nt|vugraphzdh: Yes, 2@S is not accepting invitation|pg||
nt|jbennet: already culbertson said "reduce points for 4333" he was right then and he is right now.|pg||
nt|friggi: rdbl|pg||
mb|r!|an|1st round control|nt|psyck: segments 9 to 11 starting 11GMT tomorrow i think.|pg||
nt|friggi: then 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm told the 1@s may be 9-15 rather than 11-15 so pass is possible.|pg||
