nt|athene: yes, but she will be vul against not in the other room too|pg||
nt|henryb:  400, I think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: my god in 3nt+4 on the d hand closed room|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky it wasnt 3N-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Får ikke noe her...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS are having a busy time|pg||
nt|athene: hard to see much of a swing here although EW may get 3 tricks - one in each side suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have 25 HCP but KQ bare is horrible|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cards lie well EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: EW have ended up in 4@s on board 7|pg||
nt|sheila a: which has entry problems|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I cannot think of a comment for that coming from an experienced international pair|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: in fact Wales are doing well all round in the bridge world this season|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a bit good for 1nt in the balancing seat here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|baardolav: Meget god 5ruter fra lukket... veldig lett å komme i 3nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you would expect that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Scores sorted now - 6-0 looks right|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s if bid rolls in here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h sit very nicely|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Multi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even 2@s could fail|pg||
nt|marekw: running scores http://kongres.brydz.wlkp.pl/wyniki2011/sb1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Double first and then bid NTs at the lowest level to show this hand|pg||
nt|athene: you double and hope partner has the common courtesy to bid 1@S so you can bid 1nt rather than having to bid 2nt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not this time|pg||
nt|ady: again 3NT   or 5of a minor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@d seems obvious|pg||
nt|simonr: South thinking about 1NT or 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: south considering 1nt?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  once you subtract a king, the hand is definietly not worth 3@d|pg||
nt|galadriel: Scotland's intrepid young South found the pre-empt|pg||
nt|coch draig: will still get to 3N|pg||
nt|petepunt: S may X this |pg||
nt|petepunt: good card fro a passed hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  lead directing overcall :)|pg||
nt|athene: East is a regular Overcalls R Us 24/7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  assume that West is the one thinking|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  though not clear why|pg||
nt|simonr: Ax could result in wrong siding 1NT so 2@D is prefered|pg||
nt|athene: south decides she can't have that much as she didn't overcall 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to be 3NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd have bid 1@s with the West hand|pg||
nt|chick: NS play weak NTs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 3@H usually preemptive...|pg||
nt|lestergold: good enuf on a finesse basically little less than 50% |pg||
nt|mikeirl: ? pass from W|pg||
nt|jferg: not geting any encouragement to bid it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sheila a: Burns-Greenwood play that a 2 over 1 response is game forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: they might reach 3nt|pg||
nt|sheila a: not a sequence that comes up every day|pg||
nt|lark20: most would but in this instance may regret it|pg||
nt|henryb:  one of those bids that work out sometimes and produce a disaster sometimes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  alwasy bidding game once North does not pass 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would be a bit of view to pass, even with 4333 shape |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  AK ruff|pg||
nt|petepunt: always likely to get to 3@S but cards are very badly placed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @H switch|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikeirl: Yes, N.I. bid to 5@D on Board 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Kopi av meldingene i LR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously not for the welsh NS|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has a tough call|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is better but the hand has a lot of losers|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might put up the @SQ confidently on a small spade lead and lose all faith in human nature :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might make if declarer picks the clubs, as she might given the opening bid|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they may not be able to stop so low|pg||
nt|roswolf: no 41H|pg||
nt|lestergold: wel n/s are encouraging it .... in a way...|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to watch - |pg||
nt|lestergold: unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade lead  holds to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's the 9th trick assuming she ducks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  who is ducking and risking a @s switch?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might rise ace, scared of a spade shift?|pg||
nt|ady: might go up with ace |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if West has a @h honour, it will be tough for her to switch|pg||
nt|ady: would worry about a spade switch  beffore clubs are set up|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  remember North has made a TOD|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and E has shown 5+ @h|pg||
nt|athene: interesting though - if you think east would lead a spade from @SKQJ on this bidding, then she pretty much has to have both hearts for the opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD MAKE SHOULDNT IT!?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west cannot think there is more chance of beating 4@h than amking 4@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|kemperg: yes, opps didn't interfere|pg||
nt|coch draig: 2@s invitational with 4 spades (nf)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes it sounds like NS are playing non-promissory Stayman|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer will be pleased with the size of teh club led|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must be 4-4 as East did not double 2@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  still scope to misguess @h|pg||
nt|coch draig: the hearts could not lay better|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should you lead the J - catering for AQ or Q9 onside?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: doubel game swing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: forrige spill:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdrkwjXzPHE|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: LUkket spiller spill 11|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine videosnutter du produserer, Snorre!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  played the 10 at the other table, hence the overtrick|pg||
nt|sheila a: a sensible spot|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nibu.co.uk/lm2011.htm  for results and standings after 2 rounds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|coch draig: and diamonds 3-3 too|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HA, @C hook +1|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west must come to a @d trick so looks like 1 off|pg||
pc|sT|nt|coch draig: i'd lead the @h2|pg||
nt|petepunt: @D loser will go away|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|galadriel: I understand you have to bid 1NT in the system, but I'd feel uncomfortable about not bidding that nice @C suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: The defence blissfully unaware of N's 6 card suit|pg||
nt|sheila a: Although this sequence normally shows some @c length|pg||
nt|pfbr: what would q@cs mean?|pg||
nt|galadriel: Give partner Qx and 3NT could be rolling home|pg||
nt|chick: it's still possible for N to go wrong, but not easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suitplay does not have enough memoery for the @h combo|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|simonr: Going down now. Wrong minor to play on|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  yes only 1 down|pg||
nt|petepunt: where are the K@S K@D is Norths question|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  do not understand this line of play|pg||
nt|sheila a: Q asks for attitude so might have been from KQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: even if you put in the @S10 and then set up the diamond for a spade pitch, you still have to negotiate the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: so 11 tricks is a very good result for sure|pg||
nt|sheila a: why the @c pitch?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: now has 9 for sure, and cashing out will pick up the @DQ for 2 more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes might finesse trying to make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: declarer was banking on 5 diamonds, 2 clubs, 2 major aces|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: west must have known that holding the 7@d was enuf to bat 4@s|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sheila a: There's some strenuous ducking going on by declarer|pg||
nt|galadriel: very good defence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did pass as dealer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  what was the harm in cashing the diamonds before the clubs?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kemperg: @HA|pg||
nt|coch draig: declarer to decide which red winner to throw|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the encylopedia confirms leading the J is right|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  as both red suist are 3-3, it does not matter|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sheila a: oops, wanted a @d at that point|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h i meant|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  well played|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Yes East passed initially|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kemperg: club hook first was better, prevent 3rd round of trumps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can unblock the @c by throwing the Q on th @h now|pg||
nt|pfbr: or, if you were diane, a @c :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|sheila a: now Grant can be endplayed with a @h|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kemperg: she didn't listen|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dQ|nt|yo_yo: is that an undo|pg||
nt|athene: that would be more spectacular but still the same nine tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kemperg: works also|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: too|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|nt|sheila a: I can't help feeling that maybe declarer should have managed to score at least one @c trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: you would have thought that holding 4 @s a club fit would have been enuf for her to bid game|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sheila a: not 2 off?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: First @H from table and @C and he makes.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|c6|nt|roswolf: 11 t5ricks|pg||

nt|yo_yo: do we open the south hand?|pg||
nt|athene: that was a very pushy 3@H bid in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not for me, by a long shot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not this S either|pg||
nt|kemperg: bossy like mine|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to Peter Goodman|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so could not hold both kings|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  amazingly low scoring second half|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3nt ew here?|pg||
nt|petepunt: aft all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  strong notrumps tend to open all 5332 hands that are in range 1NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but most weak notrumpers would open 1@s on the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  3 IMps in 8 boards|pg||
nt|ady: once trhe diamonds went 5-1   should have played a low club  frather than ace  to keep communications|pg||
nt|roswolf: possible slam hand now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: A Roland slam in @ds probably too good fro him|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: can the defence come to a spade ruff to beat 4@H here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW will escape to @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H looks obvious for north|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This board suits my system. 2@s forcing with 4+@h support and no @s control, 2nt forcing with @s control|pg||
nt|mikeirl: hard to find @D fit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h partial for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid 5@d in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT looks a more likley resting place|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  simplifies the auction :0|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: speclative 5@d|pg||
nt|petepunt: a big bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: one of my pet hates, that   - rebidding 1NT with a singleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but it shwos the values, whereas 2@c does not|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4N quanti, paas?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sheila a: NIBI bid more aggressively to 3NT on board 6|pg||
nt|mikeirl: good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it could be a very awkward slam if the clubs were not dropping|pg||
nt|mikeirl: or D not breaking :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume after 1nt rebid north is bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to beleive North is not bidding 4@h|pg||
nt|athene: that north hand doesn't say "3nt" to me, i must admit|pg||
nt|galadriel: Greenwood has a very minimum X - poor 15 and horrible lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: north may raise quantitatively|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: quickly|pg||
nt|lark20: In the other room N/S were in 3NT on board 6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 1@s from W and with a 5-card @d......|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: pass?|pg||
nt|baardolav: Magne har vel lyst å passe nå|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt rebid weak for this pair|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  does anyone else think 1NT is a strange rebid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback to look for 2|pg||
nt|ady: 16 does not appear to have been scored |pg||
nt|simonr: 3@H or 4@s |pg||
nt|petepunt: makes now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: i would rebid 2@D i think|pg||
nt|ady: 26  sorry|pg||
nt|kemperg: very quick:)|pg||
nt|petepunt: was a tough lead and may always hav emade anyway:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbj: han gjorde det   :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems ok  to me|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not used to playing 5-card majors|pg||
nt|simonr: "6 you maen|pg||
nt|roswolf: expect 11 tricks to be made|pg||
nt|kemperg: 12th isn't there|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u 3n is not chopped liver if clubs don't come in|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: But it gets them into a good part-score|pg||
nt|galadriel: But it got them to their 9 card fit|pg||
nt|petepunt: Dec should play 8@S to temp East to play J@S which East should not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: 26|pg||
nt|yo_yo: undo again |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT will not be a success|pg||
nt|simonr: Undo again - 3NT by West!!!!!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whichever side plays it :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: this is no picknick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  lack of entries to the @h is the main problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: north must think she has entries|pg||
nt|athene: well this auction does have one advantage which is that west has no idea what to lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be a big swing on this board|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H looks also to be down 1|pg||
nt|simonr: t dosen't matter though - off on any lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  why is 4@h down one?|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H would make surely played by north|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is 4@H down?|pg||
nt|simonr: $@H makes with the fortunate spade position|pg||
nt|yo_yo: look at the @S position|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unclear why South played the K when dummy did not cover|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: if played by south then maybe the @SJ lead would give a spade ruff to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|simonr: Getting late - too many typing errors!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  how could South get to play 4@h?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: jims åpning i lukket fikk farten opp på Nils - med rundsits i minor (som han vet det ikke kan være) hadde han vunnet 6|pg||
nt|athene: open a strong notrump?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  hard to blame West|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK ik wist niet wat de blauwe kleur precie betekent. nu wel, bedankt|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is this play right?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I can understand playing the K first becuase a ruff in dummy is possible|pg||
nt|petepunt: i think a big thankyou will be given to het partner for the dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  these repeat plays suggest West actually played the J first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I hate leading from J-x-x|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Selv med 21 HCP åpnet Ø med 1@D - vanskelig å vise 2 fargehender etter 2@C åpning|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  :)|pg||
nt|athene: that's what south did, isn't it? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no singleton kings this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Nash obviously unaware that McGowan opens light regularly in this position|pg||
nt|sheila a: double would have worked well|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry private|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|petepunt: yep,  and even then may be able to set up a @H |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: I dont know about records but i hope dinah caplan wont mind me saying that she might be the oldest player ever in the lady milne|pg||
nt|ady: J10@S stiff helps 4@H     agreed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we do not have the result from the other table on this board as yet|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer has one entry to dummy now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petepunt: suspect paly recorded wronh here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a great achievement |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I hope to break the record some day too :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|simonr: England Coach suggested it was certifiable to opne or rebid 2NT on Board 25 with this type of shape so strong NT would be similar!|pg||
nt|roswolf: well maybe only 10 now|pg||
nt|petepunt: scot have dripped 12 imps so all close again.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kemperg: entry killing play:(|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hoping this is a mistake by the operator rather than declarer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sheila a: It can be off-putting to double 1NT with no tempting lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  the record I am trying to avoid is playing junior camrose and senior camrose but not in between :)|pg||
nt|chick: NIBU has closed the gap to 9 IMPs|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that sort of statement sounds like an english coach :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard 2 @c on thi high @s and claim 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: what?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West must have lost track of the spades|pg||
nt|athene: west decided that the north hand was getting a bit left out of proceedings|pg||
nt|simonr: Certifiable!|pg||
nt|athene: so invited her back into the party|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ady: cant really see any merit in the heart switch|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now we know why North bid 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|sheila a: Burns finally gets into her hand to take the finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|galadriel: Although more people are using the "let's get into the auction" style of X of NT rather than penalties|pg||

nt|simonr: Can we get a score manually entered for Board 26?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 6@s now on EW|pg||
nt|petepunt: 91 scot 90 eng|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  24 was a 6 IMP pick up for Wales Woodruff-Ingham bid and made 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looks like 450 here - is there some reason for avoiding the trump finesse?|pg||
nt|athene: ok i really don't understand that |pg||
nt|mikeirl: good game to have bid;  may be missed in Open|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer should have played the second @s from hand|pg||
nt|petepunt: ni/wal/nibu all so close at other end too.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: best is a diamond part score for e/w   |pg||
nt|simonr: You will quickly find if you have a major fit |pg||
nt|petepunt: or put in the J@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 1@c = 2+ for EW|pg||
nt|sheila a: It doesn't feel reasonable to have to pass the West hand|pg||
nt|lark20: Will Connolly prefer to "come alive" with her 7/5 shape|pg||
nt|sheila a: As it happens, they have no good fit|pg||
nt|petepunt: as we know bridge 60% concentation 20% technique and then the skill and luck is a small factor|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  25 was another 6 to Wales Woodruff-Ingham bid and made 4@h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  wonder whether EW have any system here|pg||
nt|ady: would not be surprise if the try 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think there were enough points missing for North to have had the @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross with a @d and the finesse loses, you may suffer a ruff|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  unlikely to reach game now|pg||
nt|kemperg: he should change partners|pg||
nt|sheila a: no signs of life so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  all the players must be feeling the pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: she|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have been so tempted to pass as east opposite a multi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to find the sacrifice at adverse vulnerability|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mikeirl: now a good chance 4@H will b missed|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2@D and then??|pg||
nt|petepunt: sure @SK + another is best but @SK and then @D is a no play line.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would have passed 1@c with the East cards but I know some players hate to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: No opening - not sure this is a consistent approach. QT98 looks more than 2 points|pg||
nt|athene: west can just bid 3nt now to catch up|pg||
nt|sheila a: Macdonald's dredged up 1@s bid has kept Burns out of hte auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the blocked diamond position however means 5@h is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if you cross by ruffing a @c, it promotes South's @s9|pg||
nt|sheila a: Playing 5 card majors it's easy to respond 2@h of course|pg||
nt|petepunt: i passed once came out in a rash:)  very tempting to bid at this vul|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it will take a @h lead to beat 4@s I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yorkbeach:  + you cannot pick u the trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: caplan plays rubber bridge,  she wont finesse|pg||
nt|athene: aggressive 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: why open balanced 11 counts, not for me|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS can't really make anything|pg||
nt|chick: one keycard may give E pause|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  make all 13 double dummy unless N leads a @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it would be inconsistent to pass as dealer and then rebid 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: hang partner for a 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: do EW play multi?|pg||
nt|athene: i thought three weak-twos|pg||
nt|athene: if east has 2@D opener available then 1@D-2@D should be a hand, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS play a Multi but not EW|pg||
nt|simonr: You need to cut partner some slack if they open in third at this vulnerability - East must be the one to move on|pg||
nt|galadriel: Some Souths might overcall 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: Better was 2@H by N|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will need careful play with spades 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  much more careful than on the previous board|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: this is not trivial|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a heart lead the diamond guess is needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: right|pg||
nt|kemperg: normal start against a strong hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: def. not @S|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @DJ:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: north thinking about the lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: still!?|pg||
nt|chick: this would have been much better with a cuebidding sequence|pg||
nt|petepunt: no 4@S at this table!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: now problem for south|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have lead @H10|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Using cuebids will work much better here than 4nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: Given the rubbish that people open ( and respond) on - you may get robbed|pg||
nt|eamongall: ha .. Michael you never saw that one coming :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: 5@D? 2 or 3 better choice|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: now easy peasy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You were faster than me now Chick!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|simonr: Card says - Weak, 5-9  may be 5+ 1st and 3rd non-vul|pg||
nt|sheila a: vulnerable I think 1NT would be asking for trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: beaten now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: the lie of the cards is very fortunate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not so much care needed now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: small spade fair enough|pg||
nt|kemperg: did not take her chance:(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North should know her partner has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no of X 5@d either :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  same play to the first two tricks in the other room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2 aces and four trumps would be enough for m,e|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: clubs cleared then would hold to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North could have stopped 9 tricks by playing king and another club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another finesse coming up|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|galadriel: Although it's bot a great 15 count - maybe would prefer another point..|pg||
nt|sheila a: or two|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: of course not ace and another, losing to @SK9xx|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: after 4@s - 5@c - 5@d, 5@h, - 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Peter, would 3@h be forcing for you?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kemperg: @C entry was enough|pg||
nt|mikeirl: declarer needed to guess @C and finesse @D to make|pg||
nt|petepunt: yes and I woyuld still pass with East before the red card came|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mikeirl: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: next|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  27 was flat (in IMPs) - 4@h made at the other table|pg||
nt|petepunt: however I would have made a support D rather than the reverse with W|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  do not think West had that club in her bag|pg||

nt|athene: what went wrong!?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and why 6@s? singleton @c and @dK|pg||
nt|chick: right|pg||
nt|chick: both of which have not yet been shown|pg||
nt|kemperg: only possibility|pg||
nt|eamongall: some Norths would hit on a lucky 2@h bid which would have helped South ...mind you ruffing  2nd @S and a good @C guess was 5@D |pg||
nt|petepunt: may gain as 4@S may well be let thru' other way.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: czekamy na przeciwników..|pg||
mb|1S|nt|simonr: I think North will open this - not my style though|pg||
nt|sheila a: On board 10 Wiseman-Mcquaker got to 3NT. Going quite a few off, I think.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  club forces needed to stop 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petepunt: new leaders i suspect are ENG|pg||
mb|1N|nt|simonr: Wrong - good job I did not do the lottery this week|pg||
nt|ady: diamond partial |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  horrible spade intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  excpet spades outrank diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: NS will end up in 3@S i expect?|pg||
nt|simonr: Doesn't always stop Laura though|pg||
nt|galadriel: This is a tricky hand for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  E switched to a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this board will go in their memoires: "2011: a good year on the whole, but i missed a vul game in april"|pg||
nt|sheila a: was it S who opened 1@h?|pg||
nt|galadriel: That may not be the auction :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: OR getting far behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: wow, no overcall|pg||
nt|sheila a: Not sure why x and not just 3@h|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yorkbeach:  out of character for Brock-Gross to stop in a partial|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no stopping this NS|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: is that 3@H a one-round force or GF?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I would not bid 3@h but I would bid on after 1@s-1NT-2@h-2@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you cannot be serious|pg||
nt|ady: still thinks spade pips bad|pg||
nt|simonr: She needs a nicotine fix!|pg||
nt|lestergold: auction in closed suggested the need for a @d lead as clubs wasnt doubled and hearts had been bid|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough choice for East here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
pc|hT|nt|simonr: .|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  operator, we do not believe North's bidding|pg||
nt|athene: and she didn't double 1nt for the black suits either|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or rather lack of it|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she has given up dubious competitive actions for Lent|pg||
nt|lark20: 4@H would have been safer|pg||
nt|sheila a: the @c position is a gift for declarer|pg||
nt|sheila a: You never know whether to lead your suit into declarer's known K so that it's set up|pg||
nt|sheila a: or to look for partner's entry|pg||
nt|mikeirl: message from Open that Patsy (South) has left the table feeling unwell|pg||
nt|kemperg: pity|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sheila a: She was maybe a bit too strong in points to open that at the one level|pg||
nt|sheila a: she's done well|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: pólmetek :) running scores http://kongres.brydz.wlkp.pl/wyniki2011/sb2m.html|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yorkbeach:  Scotland gained the expected 10 on 11 - South went in with the @sA but Wiseman was surely makinh anyway|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  show the sixth spade|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Ingham and Woodruff are finding the form that won them the trials|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  time to switch even if East does not lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have a lot of aces|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2-way checkback, forcing 2@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East does not appear to be worth a game try|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this will fizzle out assuming east leads @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: MIGHT WELL TRY A SPADE|pg||
nt|petepunt: just the 3 losers it seems here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT would be East good as it happens|pg||
nt|petepunt: A good reason NOT to play strong 10s as North is unsure where the a@C is|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: so they have time to get a third club trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: no this contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C hook is needed, but not normal play|pg||
nt|lestergold: Robert Ewen recommends attacking lweads against small suit slams on these tyope of auctions as more likely to give the contract than give an essential trick by leadiing from an ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour in an unbid suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  too unliateral for me - hope Hamman fans will forgive|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: now north is in the pre-balancing seat|pg||
nt|sheila a: Obviously didn't want to call it a balanced hand and open some form of 2NT equivalent|pg||
nt|lestergold: great classic on opening leads|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: and surely must double 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: checkback - 7 loser hand  ?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
nt|simonr: Checkback? They play two-way checkback|pg||
nt|athene: either to play or to make an invitational bid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is not optimal when you are a passed hand facing a weak notrump rebid and hence can't really game force|pg||
nt|sheila a: no value in overtaking - need partner to have 2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: play @dK and N should follow with @d10|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yorkbeach:  totally out of character for North|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess it's easiest to just keep the same methods throughout|pg||
nt|ady: should make 9 tricks   so might be a part score swing for england|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|simonr: We have had a 6 IMP swing on the previosu board but Wales went off in 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: decalrer's only chance is to duck a club and then hope the defence don't work out to cash the @HA after @SA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lizzie might switch now |pg||
nt|athene: then she might make 4 spades, 2 clubs and 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not as easy here wbuty @h is surfely wrong|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: she knows declarer has 5@C|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: ok, difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats is taking passivity to extremes o0n the wrong kind of situation|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  guess which major to play|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mikeirl: another flat bd :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h would be even more unilateral|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders took 3@c 1@d 1@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  W entry gone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no point ducking with 3 tricks lost already|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|petepunt: think she is playing E for A@C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: North will be feeling gloomy at this point|pg||
nt|athene: she has to decide now whether to play the legitimate line (win and hope the @HA is not with the club)|pg||
nt|kemperg: she's back i believe|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: or the sneaky line|pg||
nt|athene: of ducking the club and hoping for no heart shift|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C now and  a @C on the 3rd @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kemperg: other pair might have seen the hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  spelt it right second time :)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  but still a tall order in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|simonr: Three more - 30 - 32|pg||

nt|sheila a: partner's @s values were useless without an entry|pg||
nt|kemperg: ???|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@H in OR much better:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: This is surely a hand in which north needs to pklay partner for a major suit trick probably heart 1a and help in @ds|pg||
nt|lestergold: what otyher hope can there be on the auction?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe some back for Scotland there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 5-4 spade fit and some hcp|pg||
nt|petepunt: we may have jsut seen the hand that wins the LMilne |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  EW bid a very aggressive 4@s at the other table|pg||

nt|sheila a: It seemed the defence should have been able to defeat that|pg||
nt|sheila a: Punch may have been considering a 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is not making even with the @cKJ onside, it is a poor contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: hmmm, looks like W thinks this is puppet?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not 3nt?|pg||
nt|chick: and their CC says puppet|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: fall of the @C10 is nice|pg||
nt|chick: because if puppet, then 3@D shows a 4 card major and 4@D shows both|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2NT forcing   after 2 level response|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer reads the suit|pg||
nt|simonr: 2/1 FG style so 2NT is forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kaye might consider a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there ought to be a law that all English players should play Acol :)|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond lead in 3NT     then better|pg||
nt|simonr: ...and still drive in the slow lane!|pg||
nt|simonr: West must be thinking about a slam|pg||
nt|kemperg: OK|pg||
nt|mikeirl: 3@H is a gross overbid by East - X would seem normal|pg||
nt|mikeirl: as partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is an example when p may have a yarboro|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should X 1@s to show a strong NT hand with no suitable bid?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  ie. no @s stopper|pg||

mb|4H|nt|yorkbeach:  I realise I am a bit of hypocrite|pg||
nt|roswolf: going boldly where angels fear to tread is a recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|roswolf: hnmmmm why didnt north double?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lady heard our former comment:)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do the defence have time to switch to @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  a difference in system results in a different declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  easy for South to lead the @dQ|pg||
nt|athene: a cautious view from west but of course playing a strong notrump, this sequence typically shows a weak notrump from opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: caramba|pg||
nt|chick: I think they have a misunderstanding going here, where E forgot puppet :(|pg||
nt|mikeirl: lucky not to be doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@c checkback, so that Greenwood can invite |pg||
nt|sheila a: I'd rather be in @s than NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: very wise|pg||
nt|simonr: Well judged by Kaye|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I have not played the defence to 1NT that my brother and I invented for a long time|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  could be best    other  leads clould cost|pg||
nt|sheila a: has effectively shown this as  strong NT|pg||
nt|eamongall: I suspect this is doomed for several 50s |pg||
nt|petepunt: as E/w playu a weak NT they dont play support dbls so this hand is tough |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West could have rebid 2NT or 3NT to give her partner the choice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|simonr: You mean Cappaletti!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  tough to find the @s lead unless South doubles|pg||
nt|yo_yo: landy?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes he has taken over the name :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 hearts and a spade should be easy enough i think|pg||
nt|chick: E now thinks they are cuebidding, and W thinks they are trying to choose a major :(|pg||
nt|chick: our operator can tell us afterward what happened :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: heart back and then J@S  |pg||
nt|athene: sure, but you just rise ace and play clubs to keep north out|pg||
nt|sheila a: bidding this way guarantees 5@s|pg||
nt|galadriel: North implying a 5th @S by going through checkback|pg||
nt|galadriel: otherwise she could bid a direct 2NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: Greenwood will probably ruff a @d in dummy and consequently get @s wrong.|pg||
nt|galadriel: This should make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many times it´s better to bid 3nt as well as asking for majors|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT is what I would have bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: well jim this is bridge but not as we know it!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbgood: sjelden rett å selge ut til 1 grand hvis du har en unnskyldning for å melde|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: kløver 6 er Lavinthal i avkast.. Jon tegner og forklarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North would probably have led a trump against 4@s too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this was not the moment for a count signal in @c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sheila a: A@c onside means all well|pg||
nt|galadriel: Or - could make|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has 2 @c entries|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough to predict this one,  should go off|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|kemperg: last board?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ady: maybe go up with A@S    and play the clubs to keep north off lerad|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  would you be playing higher @s as East trying to show the @hK?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|simonr: 18-12 to England in VPs at present|pg||
nt|ady: sorry William   you were first|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the other table has now finished|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: north can see the pitch coming on the long club so gets active|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this can be made by careful play declarer can afford to lose two trump tricks but jmust arrnage to organise two ruffs somehow|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|thedoc: has this table actually played board 26 yet?|pg||
nt|petepunt: still has chances with @D blocked|pg||
nt|petepunt: East needs kH lese making|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: now decalrer's problem is just keeping an entry to the @HJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  West can afford to cash the @d and get a signal|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: tegningen er postlagt - forklaringen: Gjør hva du vil makker - jeg har alt du ikke har:)|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have done better to just lead hearts towards dummy for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: would make 9 that way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks everyone - see you a bit later|pg||
nt|athene: just rely on the @CK onside|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: is there another match tonight?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second half of this match|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 9.55 the next  |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is a 32 board match|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: see you then |pg||
nt|athene: "round 1 of 2" was a clue|pg||
nt|ady: yes   |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mikeirl: no 16|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: communications are a greatproblem but delcarer should try the @ds before playing trumps |pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: couldn't the @H109 be with the @CQ here?|pg||
nt|sheila a: seems to have found a way to go off|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|thedoc: what was result?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: was when the diamonds went 5-1 in 3NT    almost went down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes North made 3Nt despite blocking the clubs|pg||
nt|thedoc: ok thanks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: is this safe?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was made   not sure   10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok it does appear South bid 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lark20: should have taken some discards on her spades|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was making anyway|pg||
nt|petepunt: slight error ny N|pg||
nt|petepunt: no hope if N holds kH,  but it is very late in the day|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  very lazy by East|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|athene: and north could have ducked that trick, killing the entry to the @HJ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  squeeze|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: end play possible|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: simpler would have been to put the @CJ in on the second round of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: not nessaary|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the contract was safe anyway with what had been thrown already|pg||
nt|ady: might have been a squeeze   |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6 minutes for 2 boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely a claim|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: what happened|pg||
nt|simonr: What happened here?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s8|nt|lestergold: mayeb best defence can always defeat it but doesnt cost to try Q@d south has to duck it to beat cobntract|pg||

nt|athene: acol for NS, 5-card majors strong notrump, short club for EW|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very mysterious|pg||
nt|athene: i thought declarer might have played that off but only if north ducked the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Misunderstanding in the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  theer should be a prize for having the rest of the tricks in both hands :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h10 discard makes life so much easier|pg||
nt|petepunt: disaster for Scot on 28 as predicted 4@S made|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we are getting results now from the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  1NT and transfer expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: standard leads and signals for both pairs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I see no reason for West not to show a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very costly not X 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: another way that difference in notrump range produces swings|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h has chances|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Soith is thinking whether to splinter|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Scotland may gain 1 IMP here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: east maybe intending to bid 3@S over 3red|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 9 HCP but controls in every suit and a fifth trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: needed to make sure she got 5@h, 3@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|kemperg: for me too strong for 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: but works well here|pg||
nt|petepunt: eng have max so scot need 18VPs. about 16imps i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: Macdonald seduced by the vulnerability into bidding one more|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  brave bid by Sheila Shea when she knows teh suit is breaking badly|pg||
nt|petepunt: is this a forcing pass situation ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  splinter should make it so|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  England made 90|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so this baord cannot be flat|pg||
nt|petepunt: cam make on @D guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: that typically shows a strong but flexible hand these days rather than just a really big one-suiter|pg||
nt|simonr: Should make 140 if you find the @SJ so a small swing here to Wales|pg||
pc|sK|nt|galadriel: perhaps EW have the agreement that Michaels is weak or strong|pg||
nt|sheila a: Never mind, next door NS have missed game on board 10 and chosen instead to play in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|sheila a: I like 4@s much better than 3NT|pg||
nt|lark20: infinitely better|pg||
nt|lestergold: the defence will get tyhe first 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: vanskelig å vinne imp her og for vertene, er vel bare teori som kan hindre Bergen å reise hjem med seier|pg||
nt|athene: club to ace, trump to king, trump?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might pitch a @s on the @d an avoid the @s guess|pg||
nt|sheila a: It looks as if in the other room McQuaker was trying to re-transfer but Wiseman didn't take the hint|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mikeirl: yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sheila a: shortage of entries means Grant has to play for trumps behaving |pg||
nt|sheila a: defence can socre a ruff now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: this will be tricky - in big danger of losing three trumps and a heart|pg||
nt|petepunt: 5@H a surprise but could be right choice|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4 brds to score|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: could lose 3@H, 2@S and 1@C on a bad day|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yorkbeach:  most play that pass then pull shows a slam try|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sheila a: difficult for declarer - if lead was a singleton, need to go up with A|pg||
pc|c3|nt|simonr: Then where does the @C go?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if that is what North has done, she is an optimist|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|galadriel: so with intermediate hands like this one, just have to overcall|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h7|nt|athene: i think the only winning line was to get some sort of endplay on south in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: but that would mean cashing the top diamonds without playing a second round of trumps|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: and of course you might then run into a ruff just on normal breaks|pg||
nt|sheila a: are you sure?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: so i think no reason to get this one right|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from manchester|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: sure, the pre-empt makes bad breaks more likely but you can't play for 4-1 trumps right from the start|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|nt|athene: hi :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petepunt: 12imps back to Wales |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW did not find the sacrifice in the other room|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  will need to guess @s for 140|pg||
nt|lestergold: nibu still gains on board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sheila a: That should perhaps have warned E that partner might have defence?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Easy for us to say|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, a few much needed imps for Ireland|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: back to the endplay working now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|athene: south had to keep that club as an exit card|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dJ|nt|mikeirl: Interesting on last 4@H hand - play @CQ to make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: now diamond, diamond, spade|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: hand 30 a myster    not possible to be down if the play shown is correct|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  not going to be very exciting|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT or 4@s with overtricks|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|petepunt: 29 30 figure to be good for scot though|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|jbgood: Siste spill nå ved dette bordet, takk til Snorre for fin jobb som organisator, videoprodusent og operatør!  |pg||
nt|simonr: Operator - can you check the players card for the correct score on 30?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sheila a: EW got a little over-excited in the other room but managed to stop in time|pg||
nt|chick: Many thanks to our excellent operator, Joan Baird!|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4@S normal to bid here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 4@S+1, flat board, yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do you treat the four 5@s as 4?|pg||
nt|simonr: Played 26 in 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales have bid and made 4@h in the other room|pg||
nt|galadriel: @H and a minor|pg||
nt|sheila a: 3@s is GF playing lebensohl|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator. Great Job! Our appreciation to the organisers, the NIBU and BGB for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators Germ and Anne for their company and perceptive comments. Also to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: give him a chance, he's doing this board :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: Thanks Julian (Mark for subbing for me )  operator and all the help:) from the specs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: ths geoffry and others, back in 1 hour|pg||
nt|chick: Great job by my fellow commentator, Ralf Willqvist of Sweden. |pg||
nt|chick: And thanks to all the kibs who send us good comments :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes but a lot of cards wrong for declarer|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  yes 4@s better - just testing :)|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead through the queen makes life harder in 4@H now|pg||
nt|simonr: Support double?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s-4@s from here?|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3@S as AQ@C not full value now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  exactly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: support double|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play in 3nt|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N has some chances by S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this may wrong side 4@s|pg||
pc|s7|nt|simonr: Shows three 1h|pg||
nt|athene: from east's side of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes scheduled re-start in approx 1hr and 5 mins from now|pg||
nt|chick: This event was brought to us by Bridge Great Britain (Sandra Claridge) and the NIBU (Robin Burns),  and with the excellent support of Roland Wald, our coordinator :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont know how e/w managed to stay out of game on this board altho it doesnt happen to make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: Takk også til BBO og uoppslitelige Roland Wald (som har holdt på siden 8 i dag tidlig - og som har tatt en pause), og kommentatorer Carl Mathiesen og Baard Olav Aasan!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the other table North did not lead her partner's suit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i suggest because s bid in the open room|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kemperg: 1 off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d belongs to North we assume|pg||
nt|petepunt: plays better by S but still off i suspect|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  29 and 30 are both potentail games for Scotland|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: it might be slightly tricky for declarer to reach dummy twice for this spade finesse|pg||
nt|athene: assuming we get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: she might just finesse once then cash the ace|pg||
nt|chick: I don't see any 23 IMP swing here, so Congratulations to Scotland for winning this match.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbgood: Og takk til tilskuere for interessante innspill - og tålmodighet:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gratulerer til Bergen - og lykke til videre|pg||
nt|athene: she doesn't really want to spend half an hour ducking hearts for a heart ruff to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: that might incur diamond ruffs and all sorts|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok|pg||
nt|athene: well that makes life easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is trick on a @d lead|pg||
nt|athene: it does work well to put the overcaller on lead, which is why many pairs play a lot of transfers after overcalls|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 1@C (1@D) X is hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  correction - South did not overcall at the other table|pg||
nt|sheila a: With a couple of careless efforts there, it's no bad thing that this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and 3@s to South|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: well perhaps not the best game but it makes easily enough here|pg||
nt|sheila a: This should take it off|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: right - that's why north didn't lead her suit :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: 11 tricks |pg||
nt|roswolf: 10|pg||
nt|chick: Full results can be found at   http://www.nibu.co.uk/ladymilne2011.htm|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and 4@s to North|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: a reasonable lead, to be fair - on this auction you expect declarer to have three trumps and quite possibly a ruff in hand|pg||
nt|kemperg: no 10 now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if XX of 2@c would have shown a @c honour, it should be clera to West not to lead a @c|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|simonr: Spade laed here would not be a success. We are all taught to laed partrner's suit!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  poor lead here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: partner why dont you lead my  xxxx suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: east still held 3 buillets opposite an opening bid and made no try|pg||
nt|petepunt: now chances exist|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  @d my choice|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: because it was an xxxxx suit last time!|pg||
nt|chick: Restart tomorrow at 9:00 GMT, 10:00 BST, 11:00 CET, 7:00 pm Sydney|pg||
nt|chick: Hope to see you all here! :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S will make and 4 IMPs to NIBU. Thanks all and good night from Sweden:)|pg||
nt|mikeirl: disastrous bidding by Irish on Board 10 in Open;  playin in 4@S instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h to 9 might well do it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: yes but this time it's a KJ10xx suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  second chance to lead it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players getting tired|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sheila a: Yvonne has scooshed home in 3NT on board 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if there is a tie in Victory Points both teams receive the award for winning.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: another swing for wales|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure it's wise to finesse again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is why you should not overcall on xxxxx|pg||
nt|simonr: Got it right this time|pg||
nt|ady: will take the lead on last hand if the scores are correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: seems that south wants to let this thru|pg||
nt|lestergold: if thats at all possible|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|galadriel: On board 13 Scotland made another "unmakable" 3NT|pg||

nt|kemperg: Thanks Michael, Eamon, Sukalyan, specs and our operator, have to go now|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North has played an honour|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: scotland gain another imp|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jbgood: farvel|pg||

pc|hT|nt|chick: Thanks everyone :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mikeirl: re|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @hA + ruff looks good enough here|pg||
nt|petepunt: as long as Ruff Small|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even a spade to the king first would be OK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: luckily for south east doesn't hold the curse of scotland|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  should be 2 off|pg||
