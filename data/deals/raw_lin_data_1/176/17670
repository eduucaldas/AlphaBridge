nt|copeyj: 4@C is one of these "fit non jumps" - ie it shows @C and @S here|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: may be Lightner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: but difficult for South to lead a low diamond|pg||
nt|copeyj: and this looks like a good position for Sinclair's team|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S and 2@D to lose if declarer plays A one spade I think|pg||
nt|dburn: though even now, declarer will have some problem|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Not sure a low diamond would have made any difference|pg||

nt|dburn: perhaps not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This has been a double elimination format where the one remaining undefeated team, Penfold, have special privileges. They can choose their opponents in the semi-finals, and they ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can elect to play a 40-board match if they are behind after 32 (but they can only do it once). They did not need the 8 in the SF|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: same contract in OR I am told|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|georgia19: yes, but why raise diamonds?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: double shows three hearts i guess|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|mamos: Sinclair team have 590 here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: now Sabine wants to go on bidding forever - but the vulnerability is not conducive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|georgia19: another nice @h contract for N/S|pg||

nt|benjy: Anyone for 3@C with the west hand over the X? seems like the best desciption, if available as a fit jump|pg||
nt|ady: what a close finish|pg||
nt|mamos: last board  may or may not be decisive|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   good by agreement|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|dburn: better not try three rounds of clubs before playing a trump|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|copeyj: defence can prevail here - they have to get @S going when they first get in with @HK i think|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has a more than completely hopeless raise in hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: agree David - not such a pretty hand especially with JX in the suit bid on his left|pg||
nt|dburn: he doesn't have enough to justify his partner's optimism - only the defenders can do that|pg||

mb|1N|nt|dburn: so if the Germans and the Pakistanis can stop lower, we will need the extra boards|pg||
mb|d|nt|copeyj: Weak NT will create different auction before|pg||
nt|copeyj: for sure, rather|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: if Sabine thinks she has double then hearts, i suspect she will end in 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: what's 2@D?|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what 2@D is]|pg||
nt|dburn: any non-minus for North-South will send the match into overtime|pg||
nt|athene: maybe diamonds and a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: one or both majors|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: but looking at south's hand - if partner doubled a notrump and then showed 5+ hearts you would bid game, no?|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if they might play 3N|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that likely I suppose|pg||

nt|benjy: do we know what 2@D showed?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but 3@c isn't forcing, and Sabine hasn't any reason to bid over it that I can see|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1 or both majors I think we were told|pg||
nt|dburn: or indeed that she can see|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|copeyj: the competition is a double elimination format|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|georgia19: hard to see this one getting through|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Penfold team was undefeated in the run to the semi finals|pg||
nt|copeyj: (the only team to be so)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so they have the right to 8 extra boards in the semi or the final to try and get their win|pg||
mc|10|nt|copeyj: Team Penfold didn't use it in the semi (they didnt need it) so they will use it now|pg||
nt|copeyj: if we are going to overtime as seems to be the case, we will have a short scoring break and then a restart I imagine|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Just waiting for scores to be agreed. Then overtime - which will start very soon|pg||
nt|benjy: see you shortly!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: So I'll close and we'll try to find the extra boards|pg||
