nt|rodal f: Re again Sveta and Daiva + specs:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: This should be an easy game N/S, but bad breaks are on|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|roswolf: a suprising push|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: played east for 7 hearts|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: ok, i will|pg||
nt|hawe45: Hello Frank - er dette Vilnius?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Hei Hans. Ja.|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: someone call Larry Cohen.....  two ten card fits and the Total Tricks are only 17 :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: 12 imps swing for I_VVU .. they made 5@Cx on board 18|pg||
nt|andyv:  precision 2@c, 2@d asks|pg||
nt|shevek: I like the overloaded 2@s in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45: We start with a rather easy 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45: Do´nt tell North (Koistinen), that I am here - he will remind me on 1983, where Finland "smashed" us 25-0 at the European Championships in Wiesbaden. Apart from that, he is a nice ...|pg||
nt|hawe45: guy...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  should arrive at 4@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45: Her we have a very long way to 9 tricks, and the defence started well by leading a @H. West will come in - and fire back a "H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: 4 soades made in CR    trump lead best|pg||
nt|hawe45: Maybe I should drop commentating here - North is one of my (few) very good friends|pg||
pc|cK|nt|patricck: 3NT best here, 4@S can be beaten with 2 @H ruffs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|r_tibre: yes.. easy 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: inspired raise by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: it seems clear to me .. a fit and a void and partner is 15+ :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Then it must be a good one. |pg||
nt|hawe45: Risky from North - Ace-King in partners singleton controls the suit - with wasted values|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  fortunately for declarer, a club ruff would not hurt as it would be done with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes andy :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: played by E they would lose first 3 tricks and then no problems|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: System at level 4 ain't my road|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C tell?|pg||
nt|hawe45: East MUST discard a @D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|shevek: yes, he fought the Law, Patrick :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hawe45: @S 3 will be missed later on...!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Daiva and Hand + specs. back|pg||
nt|rodal f: *Hans:)|pg||
nt|hawe45: Double dummy, North should have taken the @C Ace and play the @S Queen|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|hawe45: Must be splinter with unknown singleton|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzbz: Contract sold on lead - Arun is thinking asking Ramavtar some Quest|pg||
nt|kemperg: he found a good line|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hawe45: With the @S 3-discard, North can take 4 @S, 2 @H, 1 @D and 2 @C = 9, game OK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do that at the table is hard. Might a flat one?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: very well done at the other table .. Karaivanov put S in hand with 2 of @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: and imps flying around :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|patricck: An annoying layout for 3NT NS..... 9 tricks but no way to take them|pg||
nt|hawe45: Looks like Ekran-conv = majors and weak|pg||
mb|1N|nt|r_tibre: indeed.. @D 3-3 means 9 tricks at @Cs|pg||
nt|hawe45: Should lead to a part-score in @S N/S|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  N should bid 2@s|pg||
nt|hawe45: 140 should be easy|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: 2 @H non-forcing obviously|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hawe45: For sure, West will bid 3 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: taking the money in 4@C doubled was the best option, 4@H may lose 2@S, 1@D and 1@C, not to mention the @H situation|pg||
nt|patricck: An easy decision for Choti really.... he would feel sure that the chasing team will be bound to try 3NT on his hand, so he wants to do the same thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: - but not now|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: a truly beauty|pg||
nt|shevek: easy to fing the @hJ now....|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45: might make 140|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oho!|pg||
nt|hawe45: This can be one down on an end-play - otherwise 2 down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2 down from the start - with 2 @d ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: hand 13  whwere 620 score in 4@S  CR  seems an error to   watched the movie   play siimilar to here    cant work out how 10 tricks eree claimed|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the mighty deuce :)|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes, wonderful|pg||
nt|hawe45: It seems, that North has  values, showed by bidding 3 @C (Lebensohl)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit cosy. Many love 12-14 at 4th hand here. A nice one. I'm to old by my 17Y 421M and like the 15-17 from N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sarkar_suk: poddar developers open their acount just now :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  play has slowed down to a crawl|pg||
nt|kemperg: 3@S not my choice with a not opening  partner |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, looks like one off|pg||
nt|hawe45: Friendly match - no double|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so. but thes S should try to find 3nt contract, rather - asking partner for @s stopper|pg||
nt|hawe45: Has one player left the table? I mean, this @D-ruff is easy to "see"...|pg||

nt|patricck: next board please :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: they may have taken a break|pg||
nt|r_tibre: possible partial swing on 15, and a grand on a finesse on 20 is all i see as otential gains for PD|pg||
nt|r_tibre: potential*|pg||
nt|patricck: you never know what will happen at this crazy game we play :)|pg||
nt|r_tibre: true :)|pg||

nt|patricck: oh, still not enough anyway|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45: 4 @C is always 3 down, better bid 5 for one down|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even after endplay, 2 down is expected - E will give ruff and discard, but EW take 2 @h tricks all in all|pg||

nt|rodal f: A wice word from a good player from US is: If u need to choose by 3NT and an other (higher) 3NT is to take. And I agree.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|ritong: four handed team?|pg||
nt|rado: for sure we will have again very strong team for Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: the 3rd pair is to be decided|pg||

nt|rado: so preparing our computers for watching Bermuda Vu:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: nice easy game in n0-trumps played by south  as they lay|pg||

pc|s6|nt|hawe45: @H and more @H|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say down 200|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ups.|pg||
nt|hawe45: Now he can escape for one down - North had 300 in his hand, I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: What was the reason that N didn't play more @H?|pg||
nt|hawe45: OK - 200|pg||
nt|hawe45: He did´nt know, the King was high|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|ady: nice end play for 11 th trick if west leads a minor|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: sadly i will not get no pigeon i m sure:)|pg||
nt|cicus: first declarer has to look for his 9th trick|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|hawe45: To defeat this, you must duck with the @C King, I´m sure|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: low spade lead in CR   so 11 tricks off the top as minors are|pg||
nt|cicus: after seeing @Ds 3-3 he may try @CAK then @S finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|rodal f: For the @S kill to kome?|pg||
nt|rodal f: *come|pg||
nt|hawe45: Taking the @C King would also work, but it is (more than) tempting to play a @D!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can duck. Can take it and play @S etc|pg||
nt|hawe45: You must play @S to defeat 4 @H|pg||
nt|hawe45: It seems, that Godun puts his money on trumps 3-2 and @C King by West|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cicus: clearly he does not want E to take a trick|pg||
nt|cicus: hand is not as easy as it seems|pg||

nt|cicus: this is perhaps the best line|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|cicus: I dare say most probably|pg||
nt|hawe45: If West takes the @S-finesse, North´s defence was genious|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|s7|pg||
