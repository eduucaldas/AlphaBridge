mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcd: hello :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Partscore in @S seems best.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: get|pg||
nt|cicus: the start that the trailing team needed|pg||
nt|kemperg: go for the @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: sorry about the technical problems|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 3@D=?|pg||
nt|cicus: some 4441 positive|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 4144 GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: has to find Hx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: If u can explain the alerts it will help specs as well as commentator. Might a CC at the pairs?|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzcd: i can't explain, sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphzcd: i can only see that what they are alerting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: probably key.card response so no slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: mighty simple bidding if it stays here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: tht it might have ended up overboard the way the auction was going|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner wasn't going to raise to 4@S (which they should with 2) then hard to see how 4@S won't have at least 4 losers, whereas 4@D might be making.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|patricck: well this should be a small gain for PD....  they all help|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: as the cards lie, 4@h can be made, but hard to get into the auction|pg||
nt|patricck: singleton Q@S is of course an unusual exception|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: the difference between 7 and 8 tricks is nothing, both are 4 Imps.....need 9 tricks to get an extra Imp|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi rodal|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|patricck: If Partner has KQ@D and a small singleton spade then 4@D would be making and 4@S would have no chance, far more likely than the actual hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|shevek: same auction in OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: I'm sure W is bidding  out his distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems like there should be no trouble making 6 on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  all declarer will have to do is time the @c ruff correctly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h to Q, @d to A and @h to J, then play 3 rounds of @cs and ruff|pg||
nt|patricck: 10 Imps to PD from Board 22, the difference is now 34|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: i wouldnt fancy this as declarer|pg||
nt|cicus: good lead, one entry taken away|pg||
nt|cicus: unless E takes this with the ace|pg||
nt|cicus: which also has its problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: he can play on clubs and still make it ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: if he plays on clubs he has an easy 9 tricks but he has alternatives|pg||
nt|ady: can certainly make knowing the hands    but no clear cut line|pg||
nt|cicus: shall he play @CA small @C?|pg||
nt|ady: how would he play on clubs   ace and another?|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I like A and @C more so that S has Kx and you want him on lead ;) |pg||
nt|cicus: what if S throws @CK under the A?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no small club ducked all round is better i think -he has no entry worries to his hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kemperg: will do that, they play well|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: absolutely correct line andy :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: B1 was as predicted max by @S EW. 50+50 made 3IMP|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: J@C may prove wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is ok since the 9 falls - but didnt need to be|pg||
nt|cicus: small @H now only way|pg||
nt|cicus: to create a problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very interesting hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: very difficult for the declarer for sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: most hands are interesting - getting them right is difficult but instructive|pg||
nt|andyv:  but not done:)|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: lol:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd chance:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: defence will almost certainly assist b|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kemperg: and the 3rd:)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|sarkar_suk: now no chance :)lol|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 10@S lead in CR   won by east  and a heart  south wone with ace and continued spades   east won and played a low diamond   and from there could not be beaten|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will be relieved|pg||
nt|cicus: I think S must know partner has @HQ - why id declarer not play on @Hs?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: you had that typed in advance:(|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|dK|pc|s9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pc|c3|nt|patricck: the ruff with the 10@H has promoted an extra trump trick for East|pg||
nt|patricck: but Q@C ruff and @D exit may get it back|pg||

nt|andyv:  W lucky this didn't go down on his line of play|pg||
nt|andyv:  an easy game missed in the OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite near a slam in @S here. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: last hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|patricck: one day i'll learn to check before I start typing :(|pg||
nt|r_tibre: -1 only|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C=upgraded strong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like Latvian guys use 4-cards major opening |pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: no some kind of two suiter|pg||
mb|r|nt|roswolf: G-DKR need to make a move soon|pg||
nt|patricck: so flat board and still 34 difference|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty, Daiva|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: 4@s might have some chances here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, but you possibly need to guess the Q@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzku: 7 top tricks now ..|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if not such a vulnerability, 5@c could have been the best bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: west is already endplayed :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But if @SK was at E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: only lead to make it|pg||
nt|kemperg: S bid 3@H ment as forcing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cicus: almost|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont help their cause|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm sure South won't like his quacks, but hard not to bid with that shape|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like a push - W has 7 top tricks and 2 more - natural came in majors |pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  I wonder in what system|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can throw a @H after setting up a @D, then the fortunate @C position might be enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Slam:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, they may find 6@s|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, very true|pg||
nt|r_tibre: right.. and can be reasonably sure the contract will be duplicated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here they had problems to read there cards good enough. OR had it easyer.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the play must be very fast here - nothing special|pg||
pc|s5|nt|shevek: entries might be a problem for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: In the other room they failed because they never led a club to the 19 while they were in hand|pg||
nt|patricck: a club to the 10 :)|pg||
nt|shevek: clear cut :)|pg||
nt|patricck: I just made the game a whole lot harder.... 19 cards per suit :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  the 4-1 break should doom it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzku: brave 1NT overcall |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: W has only 13 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 14 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT vul with 14 HCP - and what a success!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes earnt a swing for his team|pg||
nt|ady: can really fault the lead    unforunate|pg||
nt|cicus: on a major suit lead 4 tricks difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: the die seems cast|pg||
nt|cicus: simply incredible, that 1NT - it would not occur to me even after thinking a week|pg||
nt|roswolf: cometh the hour cometh the man|pg||
nt|patricck: North's values being KQ@C and one other card are the worst possible from declarer's point of view|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  and 6@h has no play|pg||
nt|andyv:  flannery people (Roland's favorite opening), would have to problem getting to 6@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kemperg: NS in OR will be pleased with the result|pg||
nt|andyv:  so despite missing game and slam, Poddar will get imps out of this|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|shevek: I think he'll make it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: to bid that at this time takes a lot of courage|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for now, it's hard to imagine NS can do something|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: now, for sure|pg||
nt|shevek: at the other table declarer played @s to K|pg||
nt|shevek: first time|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sarkar_suk: thats a huge bonus for poddar :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|shevek: 11 imps to Shrikant|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and, as a spec points out, 6@s is cold...just have to ruff one club|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cicus: they may have lowered point count to be able to cope with nebulous 1@D more easily|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|shevek: easy to bid (I thought)|pg||
nt|patricck: really should have been enough to bid 7@D in this room as well|pg||

pc|h6|nt|roswolf: yes more imps likely to I-VVU|pg||

nt|andyv:  it's reflexive to duck, the A@h but I can't see where it's beneficial to do that.|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, we never got to that stage because Shrikant have just gained 11 on board 24|pg||

nt|rodal f: Need a @S lead for make EW down at 6|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|sfoxa:  but in practice they will rather land in 3NT, like next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||

nt|cicus: small club, deblock @CJ|pg||
nt|shevek: if the contract was 6@d that is|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov said that it should offer partner a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: but even then @Ds can be played into the safe hand|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D could be made    but  needs luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: 3 finesses ? :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: and @S break :)|pg||
nt|shevek: there are some problems with the comparison|pg||
nt|r_tibre: that should nail it for Shrikant|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  pure guess for declarer - who has the 4th spade|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|shevek: maybe take the @s finesse now|pg||
nt|patricck: very odd @H play in the other room that led to declarer going down|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: they are discussing the board with a @C lead|pg||
nt|shevek: they did well to bid 6@h here|pg||
nt|shevek: very poor slam|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm....that is one way of looking at....I'd prefer to say that they were lucky to make an anti-percentage slam|pg||
nt|shevek: on the @h finesse and 3-2|pg||
nt|patricck: no, it isn't quite as bad as that because the @H pips give you extra chances|pg||
nt|patricck: K@H onside, or J10@H onside|pg||
nt|patricck: run the 9@H to begin with and then finesse the Q@H the second time|pg||

nt|shevek: doesn't look like a good one to me|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|roswolf: time is running out for G-DKR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2 boards to go and then they have to score up|pg||
nt|patricck: I don't think there is any way back for PD now, even if they bid the grand here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, still less than 50%..... but quite a bit better than 34% which is K@H and the 3-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: pass was also alerted|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  pretty decent slam here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E will definitely bid once more|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: How was the def at 3@S in the OR?. NS have 2.7@S on.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the best choice in red, but not forbidden by the Law :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it's might right by E.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: it may be a @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: well might be found|pg||
nt|ady: not a clear cut make|pg||
nt|cicus: @H lead requires less support from partner|pg||
nt|ady: still not a definate make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|cicus: he might as well lead his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tell them that they are off two keycards for spades and that they should stop in 4, then give them 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead only thing that makes it difficult|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'm with him |pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: now Nanev already knows there are no 5-carders against him|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: sorry no alert on pass|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: This is excruciatingly slow|pg||
nt|patricck: 57 to recover now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with such a weak hand, if E opens and opponents will play - the opening makes their life easy |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: even on this lead  might try spade finesse for 9th trick   still not home|pg||
nt|cicus: might duck @H10 first|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: @H ducks seems safe enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP for NS?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has to park his fourth @d or ruff it - lot of work, actually|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  if partner is stronmg enough, E will get his chance to bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: well if defence wins heart   and cash clubs and play spade from south   then what?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Daiva? U are always forgiven. U with the hardest job here.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|shevek: In bd 3, 4 & 5 Shrikant got 37 imps|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: if I-VVU wins, who is going to be the 3rd pair?|pg||
nt|cicus: a valid point, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: how do you cash clubs? no it is safety again to raise with the A|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  and this plan promotes second trump trick for W|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d6|nt|ady: sorry   since south has won heart needs spade now|pg||
nt|patricck: There are vacant spaces issues which complicate the maths, but I'll take a stab at 43%|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: ok, patrick I go with that :)|pg||
nt|shevek: so much for our analysis|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|patricck: after finding that South has only 1 spade and 2 hearts it should be easy to guess to finesse the Q@D that way|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  and here defenders will get one more @d trick|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4IMP now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|patricck: South will be known to have 10 minor suit cards to North's 5 which essentially gives you 2 to 1 odds|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: another push|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  even with this helping hand declarer remains helpless|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sfoxa:  bad trump break|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|patricck: that makes against k@H signleton offside, but it wasn't the best percentage play|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|patricck: don't tell me declarer is talking himself into a losing line ??|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: ah, finally|pg||
nt|shevek: ah well, they can afford it now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|r_tibre: @C discards by N putting additional pressure on S?|pg||
nt|patricck: the more South squirms the more certain it is that declarer will finesse that way|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: yes well played if south has K@S  then can make queen later|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  also thanks to our commentators, Germ, Sukalyan and to all the specs for joining us.|pg||
nt|andyv:  optomistic raise by W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or EW to fight til 4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or @h game for EW?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: 2NT IS PRECISELY?|pg||
nt|cicus: precision players often assign this type of hand to 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|cicus: strong 6-card suit, balanced maximum|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kaubash in the other room was 99% certain that he could beat 5@H because partner had shown diamonds, so he doubled and did indeed defeat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: without 3 cards in spade |pg||
nt|ady: problem is if 3T the contract  may be wrong sided|pg||
nt|kemperg: E could have been much stronger|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now E can be reluctant to introduce his @h|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vuln isn't promising for NS, but N sees double fits in majors by EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: My lungh torpedo allready at work and the helicopter ready for that single on for S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: will east compete as happened in the other room?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|cicus: some pair play that it evenpromises 3-card support as well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and when in with @HA he underled diamonds to the king and got a spade ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this sacrifice may well be made :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even 6@D was ok, but this should be a winner NS.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Well thought out|pg||

nt|kemperg: wait for the 2nd @H have a signal|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: What do pass mean from E after W opened? A small "hum"?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  good point be spectator: if W sells his hand as s two-suiter, EW may well find 5@h  |pg||

mb|d|nt|shevek: 1@s Xfer to @h ? :)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  even pass looks more reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h by W|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|patricck: perhaps East, knowing that hos side has 31 Imps to recover threw in an early psyche to make things happen?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or any kind of crash bids after strong club opening|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. U can balance later as ure pard also will do if needed|pg||

nt|patricck: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. By 14 and could not open 1@C cauce unbananced?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ady: cards lay well for e/w in both games|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT a bit heavy, isn't it?|pg||
nt|ady: some entry problems   not knowing where spade honors are|pg||
nt|patricck: I fso it wouldn't have been clever to psche above your real suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shevek: Shrikant had a 27imp lead after 1st session which they have maintained after the 2nd sesion|pg||
nt|patricck: If N/S bid 3NT it will need a @H lead to beat it|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT i mean|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm..... on 2nd thoughts my maths there is fairly bad :(|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|patricck: A difficult situation to be in 49 behind with 14 to play|pg||
nt|rodal f: This time to strong for 1@C=15-17 again cauce the unbalance. They play a funny system.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: 2/1 for me and finito.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim should be made at trick one|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ritong: he has nine on top|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: but has to play for the hearts to come in|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: 3@D?|pg||
nt|cicus: that would be my bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was tahat if: For make it down u need @HJ. 5@Ds i agree with u.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|kemperg: Oh nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: sry internet connect was lost|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  E probably unable to bid 1N natural here|pg||
nt|patricck: well is that the result that Poddar needs to kickstart their revival, we shall see|pg||
nt|rodal f: 18+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  cruel board - who plays - fails|pg||
nt|rodal f: Whom to stop where? This can cost for some.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does E dare to pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: no problem|pg||
nt|r_tibre: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: nobody wants to declare much on this one|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather no, but will be interesting story|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well, did|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S's turn |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|patricck: both 2@D and 2@S are fairly straightforward|pg||
nt|shevek: respect for partner here?|pg||
nt|patricck: the only real partscore accident comes in 1NT which can be beaten with K@S A@D and 5 club tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome Rajesh :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kemperg: 1@S normal in precision?|pg||
nt|r_tibre: Hi Patrick.. ty|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D loks like it might be manageable tho|pg||
nt|r_tibre: uphill task for PD from here on|pg||
nt|rodal f: P from N tell @D so pass or 1NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if N's pass means @d|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT came. Well done.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that may be the best spot for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes, S alerted that pass after double|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not really|pg||
nt|patricck: Jeetu is only thinking of what to lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|patricck: couldn't possibly have been thinking of bidding|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: or actually it doesnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzku: 2@H and a trump losers I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1st second 1@C=15-17 and at 3rd 4th its 18+|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|patricck: There are 6 possible losers, but declarer should be able to either ruff a club or pitch one on a dimaond|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  even if playing 4 card majors, very little to be gained by bidding 1@s|pg||
nt|kemperg: worked well here, EW were silenced|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no problem with playing here, but DF will opt for 6@d :)|pg||

nt|kemperg: hi Sukalyan|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hi Sukalyan|pg||
nt|rodal f: Even with 5@Ds but prommice minimum 2? Or 3? Unshure. 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: i don't know :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|sarkar_suk: halo andy :)|pg||
nt|shevek: declarer has to guess @d, not play @cs|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: not a successful spot|pg||
nt|patricck: I would have liked to see more pre-emption in @S by NS, but then maybe EW would have played in a minor as they should have done|pg||
nt|patricck: PD's best hope is that in the other room the EW pair reach 6@C which can be beaten with a @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: Choti is thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: yes they throwing cards so quickly |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N has to work hard to win this game|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Sr. Was a bitr quick. E needed to use K for 140 at trick one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  4@s doesn't look like it was making but this should be inexensive insurance|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1C instead of 1@S? |pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: Not confirmed with the system, but might a bit more after the 1NT rebid.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: tempting to play in @cs though|pg||
nt|patricck: but that would seem greatly anti-percentage, natural to play on @C|pg||
nt|shevek: agree|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|sarkar_suk: i think they r playing precession :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. So S failed for +2|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andyv:  they are|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1st - 2nd hand they also have 12-14HP so might 5cards after 1NT.|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was slow by my thinking again, as I use to be normaly|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 12-14 at non vul and 15-17 at vul|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  not so easy to imagine it at first trick - and twice not so easy to shift to @d|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  they might play some type of loser count modification|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: yes :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: why not?|pg||
nt|andyv:  another slam hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no definate entry for 3rd spade|pg||
nt|cicus: could have held it to 7 if not rushing with @DA|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: if partner has @dK he might not switch to a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will be much for difficult to make if bid|pg||

nt|sarkar_suk: yes cards r not lieing friendly :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S should be routine here.... but always dangerous to say something like that :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: On for 1NT at W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@S=@H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: club switch has to come form north     not south|pg||

mb|2N|nt|rodal f: Upgraded til 15???|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rodal f: Better to get the lead from E at def, but still same result?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: partner can't have @DK + @CQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: can be beaten with A@H heart ruff, back to the a@C and another @H ruff|pg||

pc|h3|nt|rodal f: No ask|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: woukd have been inclined to pass the double as East|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5th level is too high already|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|kemperg: @C must be 32, @D 43 and @S 32, I can't calculate the %|pg||
nt|kemperg: but its a bit under 50%|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS again take out insurance|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S has some play here, so although N/S aren't going to make this they will be quite happy with the result|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  must be, but next door W started with @h and, when in by @s A, shifted to @c|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|patricck: so it needed to be the singleton @H lead, another potentially good board for Poddar|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

nt|rodal f: The IMP at the road|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ady: now maybe 2 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks like -2|pg||
nt|ritong: he had 7 on cashing the @d J|pg||
nt|roswolf: small trunp is obvious now|pg||
nt|ritong: he could even make cashing the @d J, ruffing a @d and throwing north in with his trump|pg||
nt|ritong: only @ss left at that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzbz: Anand still thinking|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||

nt|vugraphzcd: they always alert 1 diamond|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: a chance perhaps for the trailing team - although perhaps the red card was in order|pg||
nt|ady: n/s would have some play for 3NT on better minor splits|pg||

nt|roswolf: and as west i would have axed|pg||
nt|cicus: could not have doubled thenbid 3@C?|pg||

nt|vugraphzku: and a bad lead :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: and still may gain a few imps|pg||

nt|ritong: chances are high, if not certain that he has a 4+ minor|pg||
nt|cicus: of course I don't think that double will make the textbooks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A standard to come after the 11-14NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: probably not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Daiva, thank you for your work - keep trying - lot of matches are coming :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like EW playing 2 way NM|pg||
nt|kemperg: no:)|pg||
