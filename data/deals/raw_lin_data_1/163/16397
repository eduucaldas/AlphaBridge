nt|vugraphzxz: Sorry for the delay all we are live at last|pg||
nt|sheila a: I know from experience that it takes a while to get the vugraph running smoothly|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What was the contract and result on 17, guys?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: OK; done|pg||
nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||
nt|greerm: 3C+2 by Norht on 17|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1H|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bt: did north just discard a winner?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like E needed to play a diamond early to set up 7th trick for his side|pg||
nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||
nt|bt: where is it?|pg||
nt|bt: :-)|pg||
nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: for north need to find A in @C in East - then now @D is correct|pg||
nt|bt: close to åmål, of movie fame?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bt: "f.....ing åmål"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|diablo666: Nopr, wrong side of Lake Vänern :) .|pg||
nt|bt: wrong side of sweden also :-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4 imp|pg||
nt|bt: 17 and 18 coming up are exactly what skara wants|pg||

nt|greerm: but when dbl promises 3H, then he had a different decision|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||

nt|paulg:  With more than half the set to play, a test of character for them now|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||

nt|greerm: 5@C is 0/3 I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||
