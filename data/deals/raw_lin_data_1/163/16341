mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|an|F|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You need to guess well in order to make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: birman will invite with 3@s over 2@d|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: problems in both black suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i guess that's his intention|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4S ambitious inCR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: ambitious here as well|pg||
nt|copeyj: Yuval - why wld he only invite? I mean he has a sound opening bid - do they play a light partnership style in terms of openers?|pg||
nt|yuval10: so why not bid 2@c right away?|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think this is ambitious David - a normal game in the modern game|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 4@s, like the CR?|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's normal indeed|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is what i would do - but i can't believe he was ever planning on only inviting|pg||
nt|copeyj: but why he bid 1N not 2@C I don';t know :)|pg||
nt|ady: several ways to go down    have to guess both black suits well as well as the good fortune of the l ay of the diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ophir is kind of endplayed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: that's the question Simon , not whether or not his hand worth 4@s, because it surely does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First hurdle overcome for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: that has resolved the trump position|pg||
nt|copeyj: well that solves the @S suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: @H4 lead in the CR|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer there misguessed the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonably|pg||
nt|copeyj: percentage with the @S suit in isolation is to take 2 finesses|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: smart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: undo?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when it succeeds|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: it is :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: def. now doesn't stand a chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Birman by 1 after this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the double round-robin, Birman defeated Herbst 25-5 and 16.14|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer figure out if will be very tough to E to find the @d switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and had a 14 IMP carryover|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if he has the Q@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: included on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|yuval10: a very smart play|pg||
nt|yuval10: *it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder how declarer found this @C play - i was thking cld be influenced by the trump lead, - ie holdings he didnt want to lead from in @H and @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: but not sure thts true|pg||
nt|ady: not so smart with Q@C onside  |pg||
nt|yuval10: even with Q@c onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When I try that East wins the queen from AQx and switches to a diamond|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: would be tough for E to find the @d switch|pg||
nt|yuval10: as i were saying|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CA is the last trick for the defence. 90-89|pg||
nt|yuval10: from W's hand a @d switch is a clear-cut|pg||
nt|yuval10: that's why declarer played it that way|pg||
nt|yuval10: admittedly it was a brilliant play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or if he doesn't want it now he can get it later while pitching a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did the Queen say something we did not know already, Simon?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or David|pg||
nt|copeyj: not really I am afraid|pg||
nt|copeyj: she is starting to look old :(|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Israel|pg||

nt|djneill:  welcome Ed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: Change of partners for EW|pg||

nt|djneill:  interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk4: David Birman now playing with Fohrer in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|djneill:  ok South jumped to 4@s to show a minimum hand, fast arrival|pg||
nt|djneill:  not many losers, but are there 10 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Things lie pretty well here and the lead doesn't hurt.  Still, declarer has some decisions to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  double finesse in diamonds seems to be the simplest|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|othered1: well you still have some entry considerations|pg||
nt|djneill:  that avoids the need for too many ruffs, or possibly even the @c guess if the @h can be used to pitch one|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all.|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Rashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Hasan A. Zaidi|pg||
nt|famus: hi all--merry merry xmas|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Rashed and Hasan!|pg||
nt|famus: hi Ed|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point Ed, taking two diamond finesses and the @s finesse means 3 entries, but luckily both diamonds are onside which avoids one of those requirements|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're thinking of pitching @C on @H, are you going to win @HA and finesse J?  GIB would, but GIB peeks.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|djneill:  in these types of hands, I usually try to think about plays which have to be done no matter what, like the diamond finesse, rather than think too deep|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: gppd [;au|pg||
nt|othered1: good play|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|famus: planning to pitch @cs now|pg||
nt|djneill:  unfortunately if there is no need to ruff a diamond, it presents a losing option in the way to play spades!  double-finesse against East|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: depends on the @S play. After taking @HAce |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|djneill:  another attraction to the double finesse is that it puts West on lead after one losing finesse, safeguarding the @c|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|othered1: of course, there's no guarantee that west has the @DK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes if East had the @dK, West could always get back to East's hand with it for the @c through|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|djneill:  if kibs believe the @s should have been played Ace and another, then imagine East with KJx (or West with Kxx or Jxx)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink the lines are equivalent ignoring issues like entries and other considerations outside the trump suit|pg||
nt|famus:  Well zack didn't get to hear Dan--tuff choices|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|djneill:  that is a good one, I was not sure about that, always assumed 75% was optimal|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|c6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
mc|9|nt|djneill:  but any other information would sway the odds signficantly, like you said, entries, or distributional information about honors or number of cards in the suits|pg||
nt|othered1: 75 percent is closer if it were A9876 v Q105|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: One of my slams|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Simon can testify|pg||
nt|copeyj: chance here for the Herbst team to get it back - but its not such a good slam - need to bring the @C in and find a @S break|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: and with 8 opposite a strong NT why should they even look for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They won't|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|yuval10: E in the CR bided the stronger 3@s|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 4@S was a sort of "fast arrival = minimum" effort, it wld not be my choice|pg||
nt|copeyj: only 15hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: but over a discouraging 4@s from P of course he had no bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: but KQX and AXX in partner's suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: and AJTXX@C|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

pc|d6|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|djneill:  @sA|pg||

nt|famus: hesitation on @s10 obviously:)|pg||
nt|famus: if there was any|pg||
nt|djneill:  this may be a variant of the Sominex coup|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|drewsky: i looked up ballsy in teh dictionary....it says something about having a lot of cahoonez|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|copeyj: indeed Drew|pg||
nt|ady: problem is if your partner has just enough for you to make 5@C   is likely to raise to 6  |pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks Drew - we all were about to do the same :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like he might escape with -2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did they also explain cahoonez?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then the damage will be limited|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its probably unfair for us to overly critisize overcalls over preeemtive openings. These players are under alot of pressure.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will play 28 after this, then back to 20 in order to get more comparisons|pg||
nt|copeyj: the tempo of the play was the subject of much discussion during the last set|pg||
nt|copeyj: good result for the Herbst team from the closed room - they picked up 800 from 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: May be a boring push|pg||
nt|yuval10: or a handy 7 imps for Herbst|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|copeyj: only a 3@S opener there - and Zeligman doubled, Zack raised to 4@S and Birman bid a "ballsy" (:)) 4NT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|c8|pg||

mb|3S|nt|djneill:  agreed|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|othered1: even at the 3-level, you have to push to get into the auction when short in preemptor's suit.|pg||

nt|djneill:  are we going to see another double-finesse in 5@h|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|mb|5D|nt|othered1: 4N, probably implies two places to play.   so when east converts @C to @D, h e also shows @H|pg||

nt|djneill:  honor location is critical, and all those honors behind the takeout bode well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|famus: dont think he can avoid -2--too much work|pg||
nt|djneill:  shortened @h forces the heart play from that side, rather than @hA and another|pg||

nt|famus: and the sing @d doesnt help|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzxj: dangerous ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 3@hs|pg||
nt|drorp: 3@C puts them in dangerzone, now pass by zack would be best|pg||

nt|djneill:  Zeligman likes 3@s|pg||
nt|famus: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I bet he pass|pg||
nt|drorp: he kinds gave away his hand with the 3@C bid, the question to me is, is 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: good question|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@h cannot be forcing unless 3@c is forcing, no?|pg||
nt|famus: is it?? dont think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: but he knows there is missfit and partner is about 10-13 hcp|pg||
nt|drorp: it's matter of agreement... i think 3@C defentley shows extras and is 90% forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: I think its nf|pg||
nt|djneill:  and is 3@c forcing if 2@h is nonforcing, was 1@s forcing?|pg||
nt|drorp: 1@S and 2@H are defenitley NF :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@d is forcing in my book, on someone |pg||
nt|drorp: Barel will take his time here... i think he'll bid 4@H, that's my feel|pg||
nt|djneill:  what's the worst that could happen|pg||
nt|famus: this is goin the 4@h route-- i think--too much thinking is obviously the forc--non forc thoughts|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: deep thinking|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@H might go undoubeled|pg||
nt|drorp: and it does have 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be a good time for an aggressive Zelig double|pg||
nt|drorp: spade 5 hearts and 2 clubs, and a some possibilities to make a 9th trick through a diamond ruff or some club developing|pg||
nt|famus: he has 9 alright|pg||
nt|djneill:  @hJ itself is a great filler card, problem is of coruse it will be used to ruff, but not so bad if partner AKxxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: he can duck the @C then finesse..but still 4@h will go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxj: I won!|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: great decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzxj: yes well bid|pg||

nt|famus: small from dummy|pg||

nt|drorp: at the other table north passed 3@C, good decision and 3@C made a bit more easily|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: and there is some more on the next boards|pg||

nt|djneill:  maybe thinking North has one more diamond than has, as with actual shape/strength would have passed 3@c|pg||
nt|djneill:  in which case, better not to set up the @dJ|pg||
nt|drorp: this 6 more imps to birman team probably ends the match, 4 boards to go, other table already played 3 of them, and birman team had decent/good scores there aswell|pg||
nt|famus: but to set up @dj is after the 5th trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: what is their 2N range, does anyone knoiw?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Yuval?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4333 and he has probably seen 19 opposite before|pg||
nt|yuval10: 20-22|pg||
nt|yuval10: but indeed some good 19 |pg||
nt|yuval10: that might be the reason S played it safe and invite|pg||
nt|copeyj: if its 20-22 i think you just have to try 6 with the S hand. Yes it is 4333 and yes partner might upgrade some 19s, but if he has upgraded then he shld have a hand worth upgrading?|pg||
nt|ady: ace and king of diamonds first   and then 3rd diamond to the jack will succeed    but may not take that line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then you can be off 2 aces|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though as we can see even without J@d in N, 6NT is a great contract|pg||
nt|copeyj: exactly|pg||
nt|copeyj: and N probably passing 4N|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld say maybe Birman doesn't rate Fohrer's cardplay but having seen the 4@S he played earlier I can't believe that :)|pg||
nt|ady: only losing line is to play on hearts firat and miss guess   |pg||
nt|drewsky: There is no losing line as the cards lay.|pg||
nt|henryb:  By my count North has 22|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes he'll first play for @d's 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not lead anything but @SQ. You?|pg||
nt|copeyj: there is no losing line for a playr of Fohrer's quality - he will surely combine his chances in the red suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It would not take me all that long|pg||
nt|drewsky: jack @S deceptively :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: @C for me Roland|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: You have seen  Hnour 10 in dummy tool many times to lead a spade?|pg||
nt|henryb:  a small club to avoid giving something away -- partner does not rate to have much when you have a six count and the opponents have a power auction to 6N|pg||
nt|drewsky: Even if declarere plays on hearts first and misguesses, he is still cold|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't expect a 13 count to hit dummy, Henry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For an invite opposite 20-22|pg||
nt|copeyj: always H10 in dummy when i fish the Q Roland|pg||
nt|copeyj: unlucky expert|pg||
nt|copeyj: and all that|pg||
nt|ady: in fact cant really go down even playing hearts first  as can later lose a diamond to east and still bring in 12 tricks with diamionds 3-3|pg||
