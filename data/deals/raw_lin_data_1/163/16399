mb|p|mb|3S|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you don´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||

mb|p|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1C|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|2D|an|weak|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||

nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|paulg:  With more than half the set to play, a test of character for them now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  West removing socks to count points|pg||
nt|sheila a: In the other room they're playing strong NT so would open 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: this is the type of slam you want to be in when it makes|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure about declarer's line though -- playing on spades rather than clubs looked better|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|3+ !S|nt|bt: kinda both hands actually|pg||
nt|paulg:  and a weak 5-6 hand with a void in partner's suit is probably not what you were looking for, but things will improve|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|forcing|nt|bt: @C and @D+@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2NT shows 22-23 balanced|pg||

mb|p|pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: must be playing 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: IH suddenly realises he has pulled 1NT by accident|pg||
nt|paulg:  West about to bid an invitational 4NT?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  but you can probably get more from 5@h-X|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think you can if you pick every card, and the strong bid from N helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: losing imps sometimes is well deserved|pg||
nt|bt: sorry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East find the right lead !|pg||
nt|rnc: Running Scores available at: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/league/division.php?action=view&id=3204 , then click on 'Running Scores'.|pg||
nt|xenya: can be made if declarer reads the position correctly|pg||
nt|bt: i think playing 4@D will put some pressure on west|pg||
nt|bt: and why not|pg||
nt|diumraid: For Live In Running Scores at all tables got to http://bridge.silvertexter.eu then "browse results" then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|greerm: Ian Hamilton, also known as maddoc |pg||
mb|2C|an|checkback|mb|p|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
mb|2H|an|can hold 3 !S|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: stretcher please??|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bt: spade|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|toobad: 3h denies a d control|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|paulg:  okay, even better|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: now 4 @D are good for N/S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|bt: i think so too, lol|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because S and C are controlled only by West|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C ...|pg||
nt|xenya: @C10|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but immediatly|pg||
nt|bt: this is where west should have planned 3 tricks ago|pg||
nt|paulg:  no problems for the defence now|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bridge_one: thinking too much isn't usefull !|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|bt: my god|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: he discarded a spade immediatly, but I didnt see it until he showed his hand on the next trick.. :)|pg||
nt|xenya: blind spot -- it cost nothing to play spades first|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bt: if you are going to finesse, does it hurt to cash 2 spades hmm|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless Lindsay ducks this|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugraphzxz: IH double checks his 1S card this time...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|bridge_one: playing for finesse in @C need however to try, first, the @S ... no money for see if @S are 2/2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: yes, that's what i meant -- cash two high spades first|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|greerm: more natural to play first @H from the table which will mean 1 off|pg||
nt|paulg:  i can't see any|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||
nt|sheila a: Best defence is to cash A@s and then exit with a @c, but will S know that?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|c5|nt|bt: meanwhile another board that does not matter, we should congratulate skara to an amazing performance!|pg||

pc|d9|nt|paulg:  Matheson's redouble on board 22 has earned 13 imps for Scotland|pg||
pc|h3|nt|diablo666: Yep, big congrats! Well deserved! The year of Nobbe is here :) .|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|nt|diana1: course 2 rounds of spades could give him a bit of trouble - or 1 even:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|greerm: he done it, vwd|pg||
nt|greerm: Ian MAtheson did well toduck, but declarer has started so I'll finsih :)|pg||
nt|greerm: started to play for this @H holding I mean|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told that Scotland will probably play this in 2@s, as they use 2@c for this type of raise|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Hamilton's play important and will win an imp rather than losing six imps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|diablo666: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|4C|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

mb|2D|nt|bobholl: very nice 6@C but difficult to bid|pg||

mb|d|nt|othered1: How would you assess blame in OR?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzxe: They are in very much of a hurry now|pg||

mb|3N|nt|mikael_w: ett tips :) Räkna de andra korten ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: Hmm, undrar om Malmström ska vakna snart |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why 5@H?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: en balansering med 2 @c kanske ?|pg||
nt|papa hall:  Vid andra bordet rÃ¤knades @C noggrant och man Ã¶ppnade med 4@C. Sdan var NS "fast"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxe: Hur många @C behöver Per-Erik för att kunna bjuda dem? :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hahahaha, PASS !|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: jag gillar att han sa pass fört, det kan vara lite lurigt faktiskt och inte sällan rätt, men över 1 NT får man nog aggera|pg||

pc|hA|nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
