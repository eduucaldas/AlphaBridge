nt|Walddk2: What do you prefer, 4@S or 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laurua-Giubilo play the same system as Lauria-Versace|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would choose 4nt, and after @C change to @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or 4@D if it shows both red suits. Should it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: seems logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the technical problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||

nt|hedyg: thuse f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aggressive 1NT by East but the contract has play|pg||
nt|rmb1: Best line is not to lose to singleton @HQ :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E has to play @sA on side in trick2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's a matter of frequency|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you have a one-suiter (diamonds) and how often a two suiter. Same applies for 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With minors you can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Spade up AND take the club finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is that enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here it is, but he may reject and throw one on @DA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: then he needs 2 ruffs spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and lose 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: because I don´t beleive E can play on @hA on side|pg||

nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2@C is F1|pg||
nt|chick: whatever the bidding meant, they have ended in a very reasonable contract and will likely make it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ady: meant 2@C rebid on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: Now he doesn't need any spade ruffs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||

nt|cuan: two rounds of diamonds for seeing the shape. well done massimo|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|zebutin: again seems to be in slam zone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if West is *the* Lanzarotti. The answer is yes, but I am not inclined to comment further. Please understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h from N|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that'd have been my bid....|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
nt|zebutin: but spades dont play out too well with 5-0 distribution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We assume board 2 was flat too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural system, W opens 1NT and i'm affraid i'd have find myself playing the doomed 6@s. 6@d, however, seem to be much better|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6nt seems decent too|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: wd in other room to get to diamonds instead of 8card major suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you double 6@S not knowing if you have any defence against 6NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 6@d is superior over 6NT, because if @s's are 3-2 you can play AK@h ( discarding @s's ) , AK@s and @s ruff, and discard a @c over the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know if Daniela has time to insert the result manually|pg||
mc|9|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be happy to defend, undoubled|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me doubling 6@S seems bad...your just happy if they land there|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 6@D is surely superior... 6@D > 6nt > 6@S it seems to me|pg||
nt|cuan: Lanzarotti-Manno play "Nightmare. 1@C opening is 15+ with clubs, Bal 15-17 or any GF. 3@C of Manno is diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 3@C show diamonds I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Nightmare, 1@D opening followed by 1NT is 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D either natural unbalanced or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: if not vulnerable E could compete to 3 @H|pg||

nt|tomi2: this @CK false card only works agains pairs who lead low from 96, else the small card would be the better one. South "might" think partner made some inspired lead from Kx. not ...|pg||

nt|pelu: if S bid 5@H then only a small @s can defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades and 1 heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the 3rd spade, why not 3NT?|pg||
nt|bessi2: a 3@d bid there is generally played as a considerably stronger hand than he has|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 3@H|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Good morning to the Big Train from USA, aka Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know much about the EW system (if anything) specs, so your guesses are as good as ours|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|doctorone: Hi Walter|pg||
nt|Walddk3: As you all know, Walter is our expert on the Meckwell Precision system. Not sure about French Standard (SEF) :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he is here to learn|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: even though i like Garozzo 3nt bid, we have to admit 5@C direct would have made things more diffecult for N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess @D were agreed at some stage and 5@H showed 2 A |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could be a chance if enstead of @d j east holds @c J|pg||
nt|april7: not even makable on a @S guess|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps EW plays with some kind of exclusion bids, like earlier Roman club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: North needs to do something odd ("unblock" @HQ10 ?) to let South get squeezed and let this make|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice swing for Zaleski in b5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: b4 sry|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would like to see the auction in the last board|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|mamos: i'd  expect more from West  but without knowing agreements about 4@D hard to decide who was to blame for the poor slam|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Putting the @S9 will keep up West's hope of a miracle|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: as long as it doesn't get too artificial i'll be ok  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No worries mate, a spade is a spade in France|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and a pique is a pique|pg||
nt|othered1: that's an odd looking play|pg||
nt|doctorone: that is a strange move by declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: I agree with you, Magnusson - 5@C instead 3Nt would be more difficult for N/S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry  I meant Id expect more from East  as I  said West had good values|pg||
nt|tomi2: west would open 1@C (16+) with a point more|pg||
nt|tomi2: ah ok|pg||
nt|mamos: inadvertent designation :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty active hands so far|pg||
nt|iceking: 1@H and S cant really enter here unless he overcalls 1@S |pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk3: What is the percentage play for only 2 losers in hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW want to avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: But 3NT is off the @C suit, so @S it is (I guess)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk3: Walter?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@D will buy it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk3: PO?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i know a few players who would open S hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so this is not real Nightmare|pg||
nt|paulg:  south might double now|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D probably limited here, as i assume they play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H = @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Cima will raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: @@HK|pg||
nt|othered1: low to K?|pg||

nt|ady: 2@S  not sure to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just the 1NT rebid after 1@D opening|pg||

nt|bridge_one: now dbl not vuln can be used|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @HKZ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Hi Hedy :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni may try 4@D now if it is splinter in his system|pg||
nt|april7: a game try in @S but will stop in 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S = weak NT (or weak NT with 3 card support)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: so a double on board 5 would have been worth 8 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = max raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: yes, NS at the other table made an excellent stop in 5@S|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm more in need of caffine that i thought|pg||
nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think 2@d can still be a fair 15 points, so West has to do something with a fit|pg||
nt|iceking: if W had a strong @D raise he could have bid 2@S instead of 2nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphztt: 1. Kepri 2. Djarum Black 3. Timah Prima 1 4. Djarum Super 5. Timah prima 2 6. well wise |pg||
nt|ady: east very optimistic to bid on over preference to 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is one of the disadvantages, when 1nt response can be up to 10-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s3|nt|pelu: yes he could - I was just asking about 2NT/3@D - what is the diff|pg||
nt|kerasidis: surprise:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i hate those surprises:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: South tries "black on black" - better to play @C6 - declare know @C3 is not @S3 :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right Magnusson - with interesting raise in @D 2@S was the best auction for W|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a possibility to defeat is to underplay @cA twice and get 2 @h ruffs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: abd 3@D?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 2NT showing @s values was not good news for Fantoni|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: OR played board 5 in 6@C, even less chance of a squeeze with an Ace and a trump to lose (= flat)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like Fantoni is in control here with Nunes describing his hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 2@s confirming @h fit and gf hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||
nt|iceking: but here with so much value in the black suits 2nt seems better then 3@D|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trust your patrner and underplay @cA twice|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mcphee: odd no one tapped dummy with another @H|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but still -1|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: 3@d with 2stop in @C and 2 stop in @S and no sgl value isn't ortodoxe|pg||

pc|h7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psridhar: but i fancy Fantoni would have landed 6@H had he got there|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: i do actually know players who play 4@c like a leaping michaels over 3@d openings|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: West|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: maybe to 3N|pg||

nt|Walddk3: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, by Guermani|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Besides, West is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Buzzoni can't imgaine that partner has this hand when he passed initially|pg||
nt|bessi2: however, 4@s bid was not one I was considering|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S was a bit much after 2@H I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D probably confirm 5@H and ask stop in @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: (oops)  East overcalled 1NT on a worse hand than West's earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks difficult to make|pg||
nt|april7: I think 2NT by E is better but then E would bid 3|pg||
nt|april7: by W|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When no initial in front of the surname we get the same first name in profiles|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me would ask N to bid 3N with a @H stop|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|mcphee: but they may not have this agreement|pg||

nt|ady: Fantonie might try ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|ady: hope for K@H with north   or unlikely ace|pg||

nt|pelu: why not 3@H by West???|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like all routes lead to 4@h, eventually ... even if South open 3@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because 3 cards in @D can id 3@H West|pg||

nt|hedyg: Nunes must have thought Roussel has either 6 @hs or at least AQxxx for his bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: declarer has quite a lot of anxieties though|pg||
nt|bessi2: you can say that again.. if you dont have a convention for this sort of hand then just open 1@c|pg||
nt|rmb1: It allows some players to hide their mistakes by saying it was partner|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting bidding is 3nt - 6@c and E is on the lead....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: West choose to bid pass instead 3@H to give 3 cards in @D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W bids 3@s, East can infer that his pd did not o/c over 3@D and pass may be , but in practise i doubt that will happen|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||

nt|paulg:  West can see that there is little to be gained by declaring the contract himself|pg||
nt|pelu: no but pass sh be  XX in @h not Qx|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: hey Jeff :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 looser in @D are many - if East was with 3@D they are 3 looser for sure - so 3@H by East|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: top players like to show a suit first|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy, naturally|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: my opinion is that is more important to give the information about the looser in @D that Qx in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: disappointing but should be easy regardless, just play winners|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk3: the french were the strongest blue club addicts in the seventies, but that has bleaked out long ago, I am told|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: in fact, some consider a possibility to play big @c at fav|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: and natural rest of the time|pg||
nt|psridhar: other room Levy chose a more aggressive 4 level preempt in dia and was rewarded with +100|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Like Martens-Jassem, playing two different systems depending on vulnerability|pg||
nt|chick: would a first trick duck of the heart have helped?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North would not bid 6@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland but interesting...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @hK instead of @hQJx...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with QJ on @H would be more difficult to choose between pass and 3@H|pg||
nt|rmb1: Such are the tricks of the trade for the wary operator|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: 1. Laffineur 165 2. Cronier 163 3. Zimmermann 157 4. Doussot 153|pg||
nt|ady: will east be tempted here|pg||
nt|bessi2: problem with a 6@c gamble is that east with ace or king of @h will lead there for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not fond of 3NT as a solid minor either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If NT is the spot, it's often wrong-sided|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT  EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ritong: taking into account the fact that interferences will occur less frequently when opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually opened 3NT and bid 4@d over pd's 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Fred Gitelman says, only open 3NT if you do NOT want to play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S is good for that hand type, transfer pre-empt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In other words, use it for something else|pg||
mb|2C|nt|doctorone: a good bad 2N would be welcome here, allowing W to bid a constructive 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam with 2 key cards missing    but could be made seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: defence would have five tricks then  i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh my, 3@D not my cup of tea here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|psridhar: Nunes cannot open 1@d there ; his system requires stronger hand for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: This can now make on a @D guess.|pg||
nt|mcphee: but it sure worked well|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk3: 5@D is fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes top tricks in defense are the most difficult to cash often:)|pg||
nt|chick: so the same|pg||
nt|mamos: difficult for South|pg||
nt|april7: on finding the Q of @H, 4@H or 3NT should make|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, NS avoided their 8 card club fit on board 6 and played in !3D with J9xx op 1087|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes ruff 3 @cs and ace drops for a @D discard|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: wd|pg||
nt|psridhar: and leading pd's suit is no sin|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but isn´t a @d lead natural from N without a @d bid from S?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: can u pl explain the bidding :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: ruff 2 clubs   lose 1   first|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer will likely draw 2 trumps and play on @C, hoping for some clues.|pg||
nt|paulg:  a double of 1@d by South would have led to a more interesting auction|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|chick: it will be momentarily scary though :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: 9 tricks even without the Q of @H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: he could lead the @Cq to give west the chance to cover|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|psridhar: however guessing dia is no easy task|pg||
nt|fann4: Which the defence are unlikely to give him - and so he may well play the overcaller for the @DA.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: never saw Garozzo to play a bridge so linear :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rmb1: 1NT wide ranging, 2@C artificial, 2NT 11-12 balanced (I'm guessing :))|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Tamburrini did not read it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: but more normal is to try @c to the K|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s because 2@h is probably a constructive raise and he is not strong enough for that|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C probably final contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cima should balance after 2@H pass pass|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||

nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||
nt|iceking: and S will defend i would assume with all his values in @C|pg||
nt|april7: is is probably upset, thats why he passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: W hand tempting though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|doctorone: N will support @d |pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S not enough in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 3N with 2 balanced hands and 28pts|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inverted minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @D fit was never shown|pg||
nt|psridhar: opposite 1@D opg that West hand looks tempting to me for slam|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Those black aces look good|pg||

nt|Walddk3: West has great cards|pg||

nt|psridhar: i cant believe Laffineur chose not to support Diamonds !|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would overcall 2@D with Garozzo's cards. I think it's a clear pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
nt|iceking: clear pass agree|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||

nt|kerasidis: he is upset too it seems:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: many here in europe though would respond 1NT with S hand not 1@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psridhar: 3 key cards, 5 card support and 15 hcp ...what more required to show that @d support i wonder|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Also, he led it with his left hand; that's a singleton|pg||

nt|hedyg: i think 2NT here by W meant : we are vulnerable pd, are you sure we dont have game?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Letting 4@H through on 24 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|doctorone: Interesting. E may have a "slight" bidding problem over 1@d 1@s here, as double would show 4 @hs|pg||

nt|hedyg: and maybe Roussel didnt get the right message|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told 2N was showing a strong NT hand with 5@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: E had denied so much as 10 hcps or a good 9 by not bidding drury|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are in slam here you must choose 6@S rather than 6@D|pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugraphztt: kepri|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 3NT either|pg||

nt|bessi2: and why on earth didn't east try to go for the penalty|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes seems 500 was available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a slam on a finess and a @c lead is needed to defeat|pg||

mb|3S|nt|po-s: maybe "should"|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt this shows 5@ss for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has 2 golden cards @c king and @h ace-certainly worth a thought for slam in this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mamos: all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and Q@D protecting form being tapped out as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: but he did well passing 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: as far as he knows they are in a 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|april7: how could Lauria stay out of slam with 20 P???|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: this is an easy 450 for Fantoni |pg||
nt|tomi2: playing south for Hx in @D seems a good chance. you lwad J now and if its covered you win the ace and play towards the 10. if not, you lose to north and you can play the ace later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping to pin the other honor|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|hedyg: the 3@d bid was too much imo, very encouraging|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would lead to 4@D tricks, 1@S 2@h and 2 club tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Like now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a push perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: Clubs alone wasnt going to produce enough tricks  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|april7: y, but after BW showing 1 ace might stop in 5|pg||

nt|jkotor: A:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: flip a coin|pg||
nt|psridhar: guessing a finesse is the right play here-2 small singletons vs 2 honors with N , so play of ace is slightly inferior play|pg||
nt|psridhar: issue is only when N has stiff @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 singletons are possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: two small |pg||
nt|jkotor: and 4-0 is only 1 distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: two honors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: maybe not   can set up spades without using an entry|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

nt|april7: 5@H by NS and a good save by EW in 5@S, S might underlead @H for a @C ruff, but still only 2 down|pg||
mb|5C|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-12 not compared yet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a michael's or a ghestem would be more easy here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in South|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is just barely in my Michaels range.  Still 3@C not easy to find.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: new suit at level 3 must be 5 cards - so pass by north now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ouch, board 10 cost Angelini 13 IMPs|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||

pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could easily go more than 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although he can take 8 tricks with all cards in view|pg||
nt|mcphee: i predict he will |pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|d8|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: boards 10 is typical in bridge competition - 8 cards in a major where the roght contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
mc|11|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right|pg||
