mb|p|nt|Walddk4: South is Matheson|pg||
nt|paulg:  Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Walker is playing in the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|bridge_one: strong @C also for E/W|pg||
nt|toobad: good evening all|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you donÂ´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D is interesting - SUCTION - one suit in @H or two suit @S@C|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Walker is *thinking* in the other room Roland|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, open weak NT :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
pc|sT|nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||
