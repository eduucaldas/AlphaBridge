nt|Walddk2: This auction is perhaps not textbook, but it is correct|pg||
nt|vugraphzxx: I've just noticed that cards A@s is swaped with k@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West would surely pass 1@S with his hand, opposite a partner who has passed |pg||
nt|ady: the auction seems odd  1@S overcall?   then re-opening with the west hand   and the opening1@C?   can anyone explain|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: he has the blacks over dummy; his partner has the diamonds over declarer (he hopes) :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: not completely safe as south could have a very strong hand but still a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps a case for the spade jack?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the jack is possible as it will clear up the suit for west|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess on this bidding north really can't have a spade fit so a small spade is unlikely to be misread|pg||
