mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ewj: Yeh, it was tough|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @C maximum on the hand. Someone, tell David Burn. |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 4@h looks ok on this layout even on a forcing defence|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: I believe 2@c was art GF|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Not sure, what's happening but I can say with confidence - They're not stopping in 4 @C !|pg||
nt|nicksan: 4 @H has chances since East don't get in to often to play spades...|pg||
nt|ewj: looks like they're headed for 5@C to be honest|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: would prefer @dA rather than KQ for 5@c|pg||
nt|ewj: which won't be making...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nicksan: Still, the defence has to cash...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ewj: well assuming espen leads a @S|pg||
nt|golfsquash: need to cash  diamond early to beat it.|pg||
nt|ewj: ah that'll do :)|pg||
nt|nicksan: can't cash it earlier than that!|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and a spade :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|ewj: Bit unfair maybe, but not very impressive to spend 5 minutes on an auction with lots of fancy bids and get to a (basically) no play contract|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mikeirl: Hi Jystin|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|justin c: 4@h is where you want to be|pg||
nt|justin c: but not so easy to figure that out|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@C = 11+ nat|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Sorry 2@C = clubs INV+ or other GF, 2@D relay|pg||
nt|justin c: i should have more faith|pg||
nt|mikeirl: S attack best|pg||
nt|justin c: imagined that N would try harder to play in @C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: knows he is being forced if @H trumps, but the short hand taking the tap in @C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: Seems as a flatty. 120 tr|pg||
nt|rodal f: 10 tr|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but the necessity of making one more trick for game may have influenced his thinking|pg||
nt|rmb1: Trumps 3-3 makes this easy in practice but not before some agonising|pg||

nt|ewj: maybe norman's @D2 at t1 didnt help matters....|pg||
nt|nicksan: Hard to see how a spade could cost though..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: correct|pg||
nt|ewj: Yeh, that's true|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 14-16|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|nicksan: 110 fro E/W is a spendid result in the CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: yes, considering there are 6 top losers in spades|pg||
nt|nicksan: Not least because it has 6 top losers on any defence..|pg||
nt|ewj: yeh that's a pretty good effort...|pg||
nt|ewj: apparently it went low @D switch|pg||
nt|ewj: low queen, K|pg||
nt|ewj: which is fine i guess|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 1@s would be a good make|pg||
mb|r|nt|ewj: bizarre, one of the @C went away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ewj: well this'll be fun|pg||
nt|nicksan: Meanwhile, N/S better find two dianomds here, or they might go minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|nicksan: Minus it is!|pg||
nt|ewj: probably going down|pg||
nt|ewj: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ewj: @DT probably not best|pg||
nt|nicksan: I can see 6 tricks, 3 clubs, 1 spade and two diamonds. |pg||
nt|golfsquash: any side suit lead is too speculative|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Does north's pass show clubs?|pg||
nt|nicksan: Might make 4 trump tricks by playing hearts towards dummys trumps, West should probably lead a trump here. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|nicksan: really?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxv: Being Played by Hanlon :)|pg||
nt|golfsquash: was the redouble for takeout? If so, should north bid 2@d?|pg||
nt|ewj: So, was the first trick, low club to the ten and K?|pg||
nt|ewj: because of a lead out of turn?|pg||
nt|nicksan: There seems to have been a mix-up. I don't know how they play, but if north shows clubs, then surely South must be able to RD to get the maximum score?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I imagine redouble by north shows very good clubs and 2@d immediately shows very good diamonds|pg||
nt|nicksan: I imagine the first trick looked differently than actually shown. |pg||
nt|golfsquash: and pass shows a hand like this or possibly a flat hand with 4 diamonds.|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3 down is now a possibility|pg||
mc|5|nt|ewj: are we actually still at trick 1|pg||
nt|nicksan: N/S have played together for about 100 years. It goes to show that even the most experienced players have mix-ups. |pg||

nt|yo_yo: i guess it's quick run through|pg||
nt|mikeirl: assume there was more to the bidding than recorded :)|pg||
nt|steveray: saves time opening with the best contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: both pairs play strong NT and 5 card majors|pg||
nt|rmb1: Thats one way of retaining trump control :)|pg||
nt|justin c: temporarily, anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: S for a opening? Y|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Have to avoid losing two spades in 4@H but defence may establish @CQJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzxy: sry just catching up|pg||
nt|mikeirl: ok|pg||
nt|steveray: hard to see this making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes.  3NT is harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Feel NS are in trouble|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes. D lead shoul beat |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's the end of 3NT then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would like the see the bidding, i cant understand why they arent in 4@H|pg||
nt|steveray: assuming East opened 1@C South should not take the @S finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@c "natural", ostensibly 5+ clubs and a major or 6+ clubs with enough to open the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but being in third position at favourable is enough to open the bidding nowadays|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: 2@C = nat, limited (6+ or 5C+4M)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: E? Who have the rest of the pints?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:) Could have been a interestin 6@D if opp was 1-3 at @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for North to act with all but one of his points in opponents suits|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for South - best is probably not to shift to spades, but it looks an obvious defence to follow|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Second best|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he followed it - but declarer didn't have any diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn: and this has helped him keep control of the hand|pg||
nt|dburn: to the extent that if he can guess hearts, he will actually make|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have one chance more|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: he might - the cards are fairly well disposed|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@S=force|pg||
nt|insia1: will they go to slam ?|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C allowing partner to judge what to do over 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: can subsequently promote @S10|pg||
pc|s8|nt|steveray: but 5@H is cold on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rmb1: And NS judged to give up quietly ?|pg||
nt|justin c: if dec ducks trick 1, needs @h underlead later|pg||
nt|justin c: bit easier from where we are sitting|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: 6@C to come|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: And the @C blowed away after the invit 3@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Meddy:)|pg||
nt|steveray: North needs partner to play a club before the D@s are set up|pg||
nt|steveray: Diamonds that is|pg||
nt|dburn: one of these days, the English will lead trumps when declarer actually has some diamond losers to ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|dburn: still, no great matter against a part score|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: well done erichsen|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but will south lead @C?|pg||
nt|steveray: might the @D be a singleton?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: odds on to|pg||
nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer would not allow @DK to win if he had the ace|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hopefully selway will work that out|pg||
nt|justin c: is the West hand not worth a strong @C opening?|pg||
nt|justin c: seen worse|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe they dont get to game even then|pg||
pc|cK|nt|insia1: good bid|pg||
nt|rodal f: Make S hand as main and nwxt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Coffe|pg||
nt|steveray: might expect the finesse to win|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he did |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: the strong variety of 1@c has a higher lower bound for Carrot players than for Precision players|pg||
pc|d3|nt|insia1: I think he will drop @C, after finess @D|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Temptation with 2-suiters is to open 1suit nat if possible to get your suits over quickly|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|steveray: well done|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|ewj: Yep, big set from E/W here|pg||
nt|ewj: 31 could easily be a game swing in, and both other matches bid slam on 32, so that might not be good for Ireland either|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ewj: I think on a @S lead you'd have to lead up to the jack of @C at t2?|pg||
