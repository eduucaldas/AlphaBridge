nt|yuval10: already an interesting board right away|pg||
nt|yuval10: par result seem to be 6@s X , down 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dano De Falco (smispi) a familiar face on BBO|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, but getting to 6 level might get difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you prefer, 4@S or 4NT?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would choose 4nt, and after @C change to @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or 4@D if it shows both red suits. Should it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: seems logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that|pg||
mb|5D|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: can somebody help us with information about this event?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the technical problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 0 they must bid|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes decided hand woth a response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not decide, he cannot pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is forcing|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play it?|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room started with x, which to me seems strange|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If 1@h is limites|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||

pc|s3|nt|chick: or about this bidding :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||

nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's a matter of frequency|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|d5|mc|12|nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you have a one-suiter (diamonds) and how often a two suiter. Same applies for 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With minors you can bid 4NT|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||
nt|bessi2: better play to start @s jack|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Paul Gipson, Peter Lund, Magnús E. Magnússon and Girogio Mauri|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 3NT a good spot for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope he speaks English|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My French is not adequate|pg||
nt|hedyg: i sent him a French message|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S makes life difficult|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi all|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you find an opening on E? I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|ady: west facing a passed and has not automatic action|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: if west passes   east might take action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But normal here is 3@c from W and 3@s from E|pg||
nt|ady: west decided to bid|pg||
nt|ady: east may ask for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to the names now|pg||
nt|zebutin: there is also "multi-landy"-stylish, where you would show majors with 4@C, single suiter with 4@D and 4M is major + minor...|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: and finally to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next question. Do you all overcall 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3nt is more easy now for E|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: i would, it takes away some room, but im notoriously eager to overcall on the otherhand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: We will get player names up as soon as our operator gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: they really didn't duck to the Jack|pg||
nt|iceking: This probably did not happen |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last segment of 16 boards in the Round of 16 and Angelini is in trouble as you see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Angelini Team play with 8 players|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BOVE ERCOLE - ANGELINI FRANCESCO -  CIMA LEONARDO  - DATO MASSIMO |pg||
nt|bridge_one: FANTONI FULVIO  -  NUNES CLAUDIO  -  GAROZZO BENITO  -  PRIMAVERA FEDERICO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play in another team this year|pg||
nt|pelu: prob fantoni - Nunes are playing now :)|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see 2@S on @H lead should make |pg||
nt|iceking: lose 3@S 2@C tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The all time great Benito Garozzo at our table, what a treat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Cima is a my friend - i am happy to see Leonardo to play togheter Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The surprise is that Garozzo love to play difficult system, instead Cima love to play natural :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Angelini is playing with Federico Primavera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a passer at these colours I must confess|pg||
nt|zebutin: but what is defalcos x? better than straight 3@H ? or worse?|pg||
nt|zebutin: i dont seem to understand that x, even with open cards|pg||
mb|4C|nt|bridge_one: Buscaglia Team is fron Novara (city near Milan, in the north of Italy)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: There is an excellent article on exactly that problem by Steve Robinson (one of our frequent commentators) here:   http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx|pg||
nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike that 2@d bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on a heart guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: bit of a thin over call it was:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: so that wouldn't suit my style then... :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: 3@D  presumable shows 5 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: the last thing he wants is for pd to sacrifice to 5@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: does not 3NT on that bidding show a spade stopper?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Shows a better hand than 3@H would, which is merely competitive. Normallty both minors, but you can control that by bidding hearts next|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|zebutin: in open room straight 4@H answer with De Falcos cards...which is pushing it a little bit (atleast i think so...)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Lebel had overcalled 2NT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: I think the overcall did the damage, but that is easy for me to ay because I can see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *say|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: but 4@s will be made if declarer can find @hQ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: this could work out very poorly if the @S game fails in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|harmon: Here is link http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: I have already given it to my partner after 2nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the otherhand Kxx in @S seems to be wasted value in bidding|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: In fact, 4@S is cold as West can be endplayed to open up the heart suit, no?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Harmon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they may even lead a @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: although a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact there is a play which can guarantee 4@s - before cleaning trumps play one round of @c|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: So maybe the hand wasn't worth more than 3@H at his first turn|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ady: yes    was thinking or oringinal club overcall shown|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: And I had also played low on @sQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf  for a 2005 version of Nightmare as played by a Canadian top pair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grainger-Lavee|pg||
nt|mcphee: both rooms overcalled in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no D in OR! so only -150|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BUSCAGLIA MARCO - ANTENUCCI EMILIO - BOANO CARLO  - GARGANO RUGGIERO - PENNA ENRICO - TURCO ALESSANDRO |pg||
nt|cuan: two rounds of diamonds for seeing the shape. well done massimo|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|1C|nt|zebutin: again seems to be in slam zone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if West is *the* Lanzarotti. The answer is yes, but I am not inclined to comment further. Please understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h from N|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that'd have been my bid....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
nt|zebutin: but spades dont play out too well with 5-0 distribution|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural system, W opens 1NT and i'm affraid i'd have find myself playing the doomed 6@s. 6@d, however, seem to be much better|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6nt seems decent too|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5H|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: wd in other room to get to diamonds instead of 8card major suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you double 6@S not knowing if you have any defence against 6NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 6@d is superior over 6NT, because if @s's are 3-2 you can play AK@h ( discarding @s's ) , AK@s and @s ruff, and discard a @c over the 4th @s|pg||
mb|6C|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be happy to defend, undoubled|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me doubling 6@S seems bad...your just happy if they land there|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 6@D is surely superior... 6@D > 6nt > 6@S it seems to me|pg||
nt|cuan: Lanzarotti-Manno play "Nightmare. 1@C opening is 15+ with clubs, Bal 15-17 or any GF. 3@C of Manno is diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 3@C show diamonds I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Nightmare, 1@D opening followed by 1NT is 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D either natural unbalanced or 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
mb|6H|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Antonio Cuccorese|pg||
nt|cuan: Manno' bid has showed the threesuiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now best def is duck from S it looks like |pg||
nt|paulg:  frustrating when you hold all of your sides values|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 15+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
nt|yuval10: they seem to land on their feet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is indeed the best slam, very well spotted by Lo Presti-Hugony in the open room|pg||
nt|zebutin: both rooms managed to avoid @S trap|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to play @c towards the QJXX and will make easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is normal play|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
mc|12|nt|mamos: id guess West expected East to do something|pg||
nt|chick: because they have a vul game they expect to make  (or maybe they didn't expect to)|pg||
