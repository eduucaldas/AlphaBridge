nt|figo: gap narrowing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|panja: from West's point of view......there could be a top trump missing.....E could have only 1 Spade..or even void...|pg||
nt|figo: still 3 imps gain for poddar|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: and he needs to find out all beginning at a high level...3@C...so he took a practical decision to bid 5@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|figo: but one more score coming in  so its back to 19 imps difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jtr: I prefer 1@s to double|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: oh yes|pg||
nt|panja: 1Nt bidder usually should not have another bid all by herself..so 3@D here is a bit of a dadagiri|pg||
nt|panja: or didigiri...even|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joemanjo: EW have enough firepower to reach 4@H despite roadblocks by opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|figo: ah ha|pg||
mb|4H|nt|panja: good lead...|pg||
nt|panja: best to lead your long side suit if you have trump length|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Can they avoid the disaster from the closed room?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: open room rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: Rajesh is now considering how high he should aim. Slam is also a possibility from his point of view with no diamond wastage.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: They need the 17 IMPs badly|pg||
nt|figo: J unblock after Q lead |pg||
pc|h6|nt|figo: the winner of this match gets seeding to semis of next India selection trials |pg||
nt|figo: losing team , a direct entry to the trials |pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: 16 now as they play in clubs|pg||
