mb|1N|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||

nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|an|1st round control|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||

nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||

mb|1N|nt|diana1: so it wouldnt surprise me if the other E/W pair find their @s fit on that last hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
pc|c3|nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: very nice 6@C but difficult to bid|pg||

mb|1H|nt|othered1: How would you assess blame in OR?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxe: They are in very much of a hurry now|pg||

mb|p|nt|mikael_w: ett tips :) Räkna de andra korten ;)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: Hmm, undrar om Malmström ska vakna snart |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why 5@H?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: en balansering med 2 @c kanske ?|pg||
nt|papa hall:  Vid andra bordet rÃ¤knades @C noggrant och man Ã¶ppnade med 4@C. Sdan var NS "fast"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxe: Hur många @C behöver Per-Erik för att kunna bjuda dem? :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hahahaha, PASS !|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mikael_w: jag gillar att han sa pass fört, det kan vara lite lurigt faktiskt och inte sällan rätt, men över 1 NT får man nog aggera|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|sheila a: This should be more straightforward|pg||

nt|diana1: looks like an easy enough 4@hs especially as the @ds are breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
