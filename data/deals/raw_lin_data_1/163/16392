mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Walsh principle, major before a longer diamond suit unless you are strong enlough to force to game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@H natural - many players like this approach because players respond on very weak suits|pg||

nt|pelu: against 4@s S has to take the first @D trick with @DK and play @C to set up the 4. trick for defense|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The Scottish North bid 5@H as a 2-way shot - he would be pleased to make it, but not too worried if it failed|pg||

nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sure, that is an error|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Impossible rather|pg||
nt|toobad: I'll take luck every time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 1N is allegedly strong, so South will surely bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C  majors|pg||
nt|toobad: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|pelu: but West has to find @h-lead against 5@C|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@C shows the majors - can't argue with that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would ylou find a heart against 5@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would not I confess|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Probably  right - if N has a strong nT he probably has an honour in each Major and you should lead through the heart...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: more likley source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: but East will find the @hs :(:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see the difference between  xxx  Axx  with North and the hand he has here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 4th best?|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: Sorry for the delay all we are live at last|pg||
nt|sheila a: I know from experience that it takes a while to get the vugraph running smoothly|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
mb|1N|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
mc|10|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@D?|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think 2@S is an all-purpose Game Try|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Surely you can't bid less than game with that hand|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|galadriel: Start of a slam try...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk2: 4@D is much better in my view|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then they would stop in 4@H in a split second|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
