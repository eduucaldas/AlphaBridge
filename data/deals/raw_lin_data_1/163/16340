nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: Zack is a very good declarer, he almost always finds the winning line|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: optimistic bidding by EW in the CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is not as bad as the result from the closed room suggests|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sometimes diamonds come in|pg||
nt|ronpa: Well, if @D's would break 2-2 then they would go +600 instead of -400 a cruel game!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ronpa: Pay attention that both West's decided not to open 3@D's|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: and N in CR opened 1@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: not surprising with all the defensive waist|pg||
mb|2D|nt|reisig: This seems headed to a @d partial|pg||
nt|ronpa: For Herbst, not opening a 10 count 3rd hand nv is out of system|pg||
nt|yuval10: N might X here|pg||
nt|ronpa: I guess alon didnt open 1@H as he didnt really like to get a @H lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: well 1@H by N is not exactly leaddirecting|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ronpa: Birman might bid 2@H now|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: Alon reallyyyy doesnt like his @hs|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ronpa: After he decided not to open 1@H his X is normal with Ax @S, no real reason to bid with 10xxxx now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: small @s lead is intersting :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still only 8 tricks|pg||

nt|reisig: Beating this ...seems easy now|pg||
nt|hedyg: always easier from here|pg||
nt|reisig: I've noticed that :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: noteworthy to mention, that during the round rubin and the playoffs Birman's team beat Herbst's 25:5 and 16:14|pg||
nt|yuval10: hence the carry over of 14 imps , for those who asked|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s seems to have suggested a @c switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are as slow in the other room. On board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the (lack of) pace is the same|pg||
nt|hedyg: surprising|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really with Ophir in that room|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s7|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ronpa: He has to jump or overuff the spade return and switch to @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not difficult when partner wins the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he knows where the queen is|pg||
nt|ronpa: They will defeat the hand 1 down to lose 7 imps|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ronpa: now he has to switch to @H|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: That is why many reversed pass and double|pg||
nt|ronpa: Many pairs using the method of passing opp cuebid to show interest in the lead rather then X (showing no interest)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: 5@C is ok..|pg||
nt|barnets: but 6 is too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ronpa: David will lead spade and this will have no chance|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: And is good for the match|pg||
nt|ronpa: Alon is very happy to see Jxx in dummy|pg||
nt|ronpa: and the A@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: so good board to birman team finally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a textbook example of how 'over-dobling' was costly|pg||

nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|tomi2: did West not have an inverted minor raise available to show a strong hand with more clubs than any other suit?|pg||
mb|r|an|A!s|mb|p|nt|pelu: if RD now is 1 stop they have a chance to place 3NT in West|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double gives EW room to ivestigate and rightside 3nt better|pg||
nt|pelu: but 5@c making |pg||
nt|baardolav: 5 club is a good game... |pg||
nt|tomi2: he will porobably play for the @CK to be offside with norths bidding. else he might lose 2@C tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  West is still struggling to be sure of how to show the 5+@c after the original 1@d, I bet you are right thomas|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: but in 5@C it is not safeplay by taking @CA first - u can lose to KJx in S (a @S-ruff with @Cj)|pg||

nt|pelu: what now? if N take @Ss then safe to play @CA|pg||
nt|pelu: @H9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  good point peter, West, knowing South is out of spades after 2 spades, can just cash the @cA, since if South had Kxx, South has no way to get to North's hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: wd, |pg||
nt|pelu: but even if W rake @HA he can still make|pg||
nt|djneill:  even @hK onside and @d breaking is not 8 tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  er 9|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe the nine would have been better to avoid @H blocking|pg||
nt|pelu: u have to create a wrong picture for decl |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|djneill:  maybe if @hA and 3 diamonds, North showing just 2 diamonds will argue for North not also having just 1 club|pg||

nt|hedyg: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|yuval10: and a big one|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to Ron Schwartz ,our outstanding operator in Ra'anana! great job!to my excellent fellow commentators Ron Pachtmann, Yuval Yener, Barnet Shenkin, Richie Reisig and Roland ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: Wald for donating their time to guide us through these boards!Finally thanks to the Israel Bridge Federation with Ilan Shezifi for their support and assistance in organizing this ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: broadcast. |pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: last board here for this set..we will back soon for the last segment!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you all for joining, we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|yuval10: they're playing 6@c next door|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: after W stretched to 4@h, and E "psyched" with 4NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS will managed to bid to slam afterwards:  X  ( 5@c )  5NT  ( P )  6@c  all pass|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C is tough |pg||
nt|reisig: Very tough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Alon is thinking I hope he will bid something other than pass|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C and 3N and 4@S are ok|pg||
nt|ronpa: Levin opened 4@H other room and Fohrer blackwood and it drove the Herbst brothers to an impossible 6@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although N and E are on the same side of the screen. So South will not know who paused|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Double is dangerous|pg||
nt|reisig: May lead to 6@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Difficult to control later when you don't have spades|pg||
nt|ronpa: David might bid 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: 4@h - 4NT probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H looks right|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: 4@H it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4NT now|pg||
nt|ronpa: Now alon is very sorry he bid Dbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H by N :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would double :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partners often deserve it|pg||
nt|barnets: had east 3 clubs 6@S would make on  heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: dec would have the timing to ruff 1 heart then draw trumps and play clubs|pg||
nt|ronpa: Well, 6@S is not a great spot to say the least :)|pg||
nt|barnets: he ccould pitch 1 heart and 1 d on the clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: BUT|pg||
nt|ronpa: Actually on a @H lead 6@S makes|pg||
nt|barnets: east has only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ronpa: East doesnt have a 3rd @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer overtakes the @s after he ruffs the @h|pg||
nt|ronpa: no need K@H A@H ruff @H play Q@S|pg||
nt|ronpa: K@C and 2 round of spade, then clubs |pg||
nt|ronpa: East can ruff and then concede|pg||
nt|reisig: Will never happen|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @H lead 6@s looks ice|pg||
nt|ronpa: Right, they wont bid 6@S probably, but lets see what Alon does, he is in a bit of trouble now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He told us already when it took him 5 minutes to double|pg||
nt|hedyg: well by now everybody know who is huddling, is that not UI?|pg||
nt|ronpa: He feels bad to bid 4@S and play there on a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|reisig: I'm betting 5@s final contract|pg||
nt|barnets: So it looks like west must led the@DQ to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|ronpa: And I think he will but lets see what the contract will be and from which side|pg||
nt|hedyg: time to call the TD?|pg||
nt|barnets: if n/s go plus they are in the lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|barnets: who here would bid over 3@h ? and would it be 4n ?|pg||
nt|barnets: looks a little light vul|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe we found  10 for our list, Birman A.|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@c can also be made by guessing trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can put him in lead!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: no no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller and PO are tied 1st|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet disappointingly 5th|pg||
nt|hedyg: last time Muller played and bid in tempo!|pg||
nt|reisig: Roland always saves up these hands for last :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alon always takes his time, but he got most things right :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blimey, I forgot Grøtheim|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy vey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So we have to take de Wijs off|pg||
nt|hedyg: that will break his heart|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ronpa: 5@H from David?|pg||
nt|ronpa: There is going to be a director at the table I'm sure|pg||
nt|ronpa: They will have to explain any decision they make, as for sure Dbl and 5@C after such long pause means something|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have called him long ago|pg||
nt|ronpa: I guess they wait for the bidding to be over|pg||
nt|ronpa: Meanwhile Birman took the lead by 1 Imp|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: david is thinking |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have promised to finish in 2010|pg||
nt|ronpa: He will raise to slam at least|pg||
mb|6C|nt|henryb:  The world is full of broken promises|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: they agree on the pause|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|ronpa: This will take TIME :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so when did Alon deny @ss?|pg||
nt|barnets: this is where it getd difficult|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the second pause?|pg||
nt|barnets: if 6@C makes e/w will complain|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Henry|pg||
nt|barnets: and if it doesnt they will be happy|pg||
nt|ronpa: Herbst got the lead back when allowed to play in 4@H while Birman played here 5@Hx-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But why would he make it? And go down if spades were 3-3 all along?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they should call the TD before playing and reserve their rights|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: now barel went to talk with TD|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: TD in the table|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhhh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I can see that this is makeable but it is a double dummy line in my opinion|pg||
nt|henryb:  This can be made: declarer loses a @d, ruffs a @d with the @cK, then finesses the @c10 and squeezes East in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And would you play it like that, Henry?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes thats correct , possible but|pg||
nt|barnets: unlikely|pg||
nt|reisig: Henry will lie|pg||
nt|barnets: should he play it that way why should the contract be put back ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I certainly would start @hA and two rounds of @d|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps south could have bid 5@H giving an alternative contract|pg||
nt|barnets: to clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 5@s, Barnett?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so everybody thinks it is normal that S never bid his @ss?|pg||
nt|drewsky: good morning to all|pg||
nt|barnets: north then would bid 5N showing diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: and south would go back to cubs|pg||
nt|reisig: GM Drew|pg||
nt|drewsky: I am surprised that nobody has critisized north's takeout double of 3@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I appreciate that this is a delicate contract, but generally speaking, this set has been excruciatingly slow, way beyond reason|pg||
nt|barnets: everybody did|pg||
nt|henryb:  They did, long, long ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 minutes ago|pg||
nt|hedyg: geez when was that?|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 12?|pg||
nt|drewsky: I guess people that are late to the party shouldn't complain about the bad food :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: no it was before 4 , now it is 4 20|pg||
nt|barnets: if it took so long to bid i guess the play will not be too speedy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They should subtract 80 IMPs from both teams :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First time a championship has been won on minus points|pg||
nt|ronpa: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: last segment was to start 20 minutes ago|pg||
nt|reisig: Well ..this hand may not end very soon ...so Happy New Year|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|ronpa: LOL|pg||
nt|reisig: Must go|pg||
nt|ronpa: In my first European Championship I played on the last deal 6@C's|pg||
nt|barnets: me too happyn new year to all specs|pg||
nt|ronpa: Had to decide which line to take and took like 20 mnutes|pg||
nt|barnets: and commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have promised to finish before the Queen's speech on Dec 31 at 18:00 |pg||
nt|ronpa: Then trumps turned out to be 5-0 so I went 6 down and lose VP for being late !|pg||
nt|barnets: bye all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i cant wait that long :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Ron|pg||
nt|hedyg: wish i could be there and shake him!|pg||
nt|ronpa: (I went 3 down) I misclicked but understand I had to hear from my teammates "if u go down - do it fast" :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barnet left now, so I guess I can say that he holds the world record regarding the play to a trick, 22 minutes and 17 second. And eventually, he played from the wrong hand. Only ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance to make the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: the sominex coup!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the opponents were, surprisingly, still awake|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|henryb:  Where was he on the list of slowest players?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5th|pg||
nt|ronpa: Roland what would u say about me after I leave? :)|pg||
nt|ronpa: I see u keep all your good stories!|pg||
nt|drewsky: For you specs that are unfamiliar with the SOMINEX COUP.......declarer takes so long to play that he puts he opponents to sleep.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That you are a nice guy, Ron :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So just leave|pg||
nt|ronpa: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: paint drying?|pg||
nt|ronpa: I have to do it soon, but have to stay for this hand!|pg||
nt|henryb:  then he can tell the truth, the whole truth, and ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: amazing that 1460 specs are still here|pg||
nt|ronpa: Well, I hope for him he will remember to play A@H on first trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ronpa: There we go|pg||

nt|drewsky: If the snoring bothers you, turn down your volume control.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: oh, no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he follows Henry's line he would go down if spades were 3-3 all along and @CJ with East|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i dont know about elsewhere but in Switzerland i do not think he would still be playing this board|pg||
nt|henryb:  My line was based inlarge part because I knew all four hands :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: TD would be there since end of bidding telling him he has x minutes to play the hand and thats it|pg||
nt|ronpa: In Israel we try to let the match be decided on the table|pg||
nt|ronpa: And since this is the finals, they let him play|pg||
nt|hedyg: there are limits |pg||
nt|hedyg: or there should be|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: david left the table :)|pg||

mb|4N|nt|djneill:  I'll have what he's having|pg||
nt|baardolav: North bidding 4nt?|pg||

nt|vugraphzxj: it is all for real....|pg||
mb|5C|an|1 key.. (by West)|nt|djneill:  can 6@c make N-S?|pg||
nt|baardolav: East is trying to bluff a slamtray and end in 5@h undoubled|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has been around the block before, doubles 4NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  or maybe it was to test the E-W agreements over a double|pg||
nt|djneill:  North should probably believe partner, yes BO?|pg||
mb|5N|an|any two suits...|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok board 10, 3NT also other room, from wrong side, down, closing the match|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: 5nt for minors think 6@c is down, but with a heart lead and a diamond ruff with @c clubfinesse, East will be squeezed in @s @d?|pg||
nt|djneill:  a lot of work to do in 6@c|pg||
nt|baardolav: ruff with @ck|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: yes a lot...|pg||

nt|djneill:  I bet North would have gone for the ruff @d then squeeze or 3-3 @s if North's clubs were all solid, but the missing @cJ made that tenuous|pg||

nt|ronpa: Barel might try 1NT|pg||
nt|ronpa: and he might also pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough? looks like no bid to me|pg||
nt|ronpa: partner is passed hand, likely to have 3@H's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ronpa: He cant X of course (because of 2@S's)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would say he *has* 3 hearts, would raise with 4|pg||
nt|ronpa: Zack will lead trump|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: @s lead can limit declarer to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A followed by K to show a doubleton I bet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to get a ruff later|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|hedyg: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So that cost a trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be my choice|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|hedyg: your quick choice?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: against the making 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: will be interesting to see if W bids it|pg||
nt|ronpa: Barel will bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure at these colours|pg||
nt|ronpa: From his hand sometimes both contracts make|pg||
nt|ronpa: If partner has AKJxxx spade both can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: K@D could be worthless as well as Q@C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ronpa: All true, but as Bob hamman once said, When in doubt - bid :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David will double|pg||
nt|hedyg: could be pushing opps into making slam|pg||
nt|ronpa: Right, but not likely holding KQ@C and K@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alon already showed his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure why he is thinking|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ronpa: Alon will take some time before passing this (if at all)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|ronpa: He's looking at no defence at all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not shock for partner that he has this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H showed this hand|pg||
nt|ronpa: 4@H could be a better hand (not only for offence)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt promise any defense|pg||
nt|ronpa: He could have some values outside as well|pg||
nt|ronpa: As I expected, he's taking his time, thinking what are the chances that he can make 11 trix|pg||
nt|hedyg: all he promised was @hs, thats what he has|pg||
nt|ronpa: I think he will eventually pass but not gladly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alon's worry is that he may not have a single heart trick against 4@S|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ronpa: so this will be 1 down as 4@S would be 1 down as well|pg||
