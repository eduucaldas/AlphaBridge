mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: not alerted 1@C = polish, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: yes, in Poland you have to alert non forcing 1@C openings that show clubs|pg||

pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: ah, pairs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 9 rounds of 2 boards tonight|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is the final event of the "Grand Prix of Poland" more than 1000 players paricipated in about a dozend qualification tournamets all over poland all over the year|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|tomi2: your best 7 results in those 50-board qualifiacations count to an overall ranking|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: East might have taken that and led a spade back - East won't want West to start discarding spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is there rule that allows the players to discard some of the results?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tomi2: first 24 players are invited to play with their partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and then select specific partners?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now a chance to cash 4@C for -3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm does East know he has two aces?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 9 rounds of 2 boards tonight|pg||
nt|mdgraham: -50 was woth 90% to NS on board 1|pg||
nt|tomi2: -4 would have been a shared top|pg||
nt|tomi2: since most lead @SQ that gave a way a trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: so i guess 3@c by N would not be gf anymore|pg||
nt|stc: here they may make 6@d with normal play in trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you call normal Constantin?|pg||
nt|hedyg: with 9 cards you might try a @d to the king?|pg||
nt|stc: I think that the % play is to finesse the Q|pg||
nt|hedyg: so with Ax and Qx you lose 2 @ds and with stiff Q behind the king as well|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: but..........i will look it up :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|tomi2: seems as we will follow the NS pair here. I have been informad that they dont play "WJ". Their 1@C opening includes wean nt bal. hands and natural ones, but no artifical strong ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: ones, so its even non forcing|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: since south opened the bidding declarer shouldnt have a problem finessing @d for the overtrick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: unless he does not finesse spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: however, it is certainly an option for declarer trying to drop the Q of @s|pg||
nt|tomi2: the carryover is worth about one session, ifI called correctly. But most pairs have a similar carry over, around 58-60%|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tomi2: only a couple of players who joined their qualified partner, who have played less than 7 tourneys over the year have significantly less C/O|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: i didnt like the "no carryover" from Philly - allows for not playing seriously at the end when you are already in the final|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|tomi2: this whole final event and the carry over makes the players play more of those nice one day tournaments|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this correct?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: trying to create an extra entry to the @D I guess|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: that makes it one of the biggest prizes around|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a MP bid I would say|pg||
nt|Gerben42: is 2@D forcing in PL?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|tomi2: depends on agreements, but for most not|pg||
nt|bessi2: I would bid 2@d either way|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: last 2 boards are swiched|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|tomi2: I know my father and his partner play nearly everything as non forcing. This one for sure|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bessi2: based on that 2@s bid i'm guessing they play it forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: still might simply have bid 3@D|pg||
nt|bessi2: in which case i think 2@s is a good bid as he has a good hand for 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Impossible to know that 3NT is on a finesesse through opener and hence making|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bessi2: indeed,  unbiddable 3N,  3@d is the normal sensible contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: forcing might be a bit of red herring here - you'd want to be able to bid 2@d with that South hand whatever. You don't want to put it down as dummy in 2@C  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you pass 2@C will probably be the end of it|pg||
nt|tomi2: but you need singleton or doubleton king onside, yes?|pg||
nt|bessi2: now only question whether declarer can squeeze an 11th trick.. looks like he needs a dbl ruffing finesse in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes Tomi, you can't cope with Kxx onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the web site with the board-by-board results is very fast  |pg||
nt|Gerben42: no one leaves the room|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|tomi2: its directly connected to the bridgemates the players use|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Bridgemate was first introduced at the European Open Championships in Tenerife in 2005|pg||

nt|Gerben42: some get 200 in @S|pg||
nt|tomi2: some EW pairs tried 2@S for -200|pg||
nt|Gerben42: then 150 wont help |pg||
nt|tomi2: 150 is 55%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still in world pairs finals there are always lots of polish pairs - so you can expect a tough game here :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Poland is a pool of MP sharks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Tonight's last round coming up shortly|pg||
nt|tomi2: Jassem likes to adjuist his NT ranges a bit, maybe his partners 1NT here was a bit weaker than in standard polish club (18-20)|pg||

nt|Gerben42: last round of the day coming up - much more top bridge action this weekend|pg||
nt|tomi2: now the first EW pairs revieved some presents (600) so 120 is no longer a full top|pg||
nt|tomi2: tomorrow they will finish a compleate "round robin so each pair has played against all other pairs then. Then there will be a cut and the best pairs go on|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats tough , the rest can go home again?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think 16 pairs will remain in this event and 8 will drop out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's correct as sessions 2 and 3 will consist of 15 rounds each|pg||
nt|tomi2: pairs who started with a bad carry over and had a bad session might be not concentrated anymore and produce random results|pg||
nt|tomi2: but if I remember correctly even the last players in the ranking will get prize money :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well they are 24th from 2000 |pg||

nt|tomi2: gets money :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: so his partner must find another partner if he qualifies?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: good decision to not play 3NT - but funny the weakness is openers suit|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2: I think its like after the qualifications, top 16 in individual ranking play with their partner, if two players from a partnership are top 16, then 17th will play etc.|pg||
nt|tomi2: the 9 is either single or from Q9x, south might go for aditional discards here|pg||
nt|tomi2: making two overtricks would be important if some score 10 tricks in 3nt|pg||
nt|bessi2: difficult to determine +420... many will be playing 3N and probably on a non heart lead.. and most declarers will probably finesse the diamonds for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tomi2: hearts also might be blocking|pg||
nt|bessi2: however.. on this lead.. declarer might get +440|pg||
nt|bessi2: either he has singleton 9 or Q9x.. given they play 2/4th leads |pg||
nt|tomi2: north will know that some of the players in the field, having his hand, might not open 2@H so a @Hlead vs 3nd can be likely|pg||

nt|tomi2: he entered 110 into the bridge mate. always hard to follow the end playes and the claims at the table for an operator. often the players also dont know how many tricks they scored|pg||
nt|tomi2: its quite common in Poland that players are unsure about the final result after trick 13 has been played, many players don't really count their tricks in MP when they play fast|pg||
