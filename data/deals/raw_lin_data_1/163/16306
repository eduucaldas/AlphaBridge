nt|mcphee: not sure who is leading|pg||
nt|sommer: very soon now|pg||
nt|mcphee: any idea sommer?|pg||
nt|sommer: EW leads 57-47|pg||
nt|mcphee: they lead event?|pg||
nt|sommer: only this quarterfinal|pg||
nt|mcphee: obviously you are suggesting I should know more about what I am doing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: isnt there 4 winners in a quarterfinal?:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Someone should and we voted on you.|pg||
nt|mcphee: people often vote for the wrong dude|pg||
nt|sommer: lol|pg||
nt|sommer: new cards|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and let's rock'n roll|pg||
nt|mcphee: or samba for those with different dance steps|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, whatever|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc kibz, we hope, you get something for your entry fee:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: indeed, see sommer for refunds if not happy|pg||
nt|sommer: you'll get  comments in English (or almost:)) - in OR you can get them in Italian|pg||
nt|sommer: ...at least, I THINK you will get some comments VERY soon:)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, but getting to 6 level might get difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you prefer, 4@S or 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laurua-Giubilo play the same system as Lauria-Versace|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would choose 4nt, and after @C change to @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or 4@D if it shows both red suits. Should it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: seems logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah ha!  |pg||
nt|mcphee: this is the pair that plays nightmare|pg||
nt|sommer: no redeal... 3@H -1 is max on this, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: can somebody help us with information about this event?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the technical problems|pg||
nt|sommer: NS can make 3@D with carefull play|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone consider pass as W?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..will S bid that?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
nt|mcphee: not such a bad hand to defend 1NT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 0 they must bid|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes decided hand woth a response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not decide, he cannot pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is forcing|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play it?|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room started with x, which to me seems strange|pg||
nt|mcphee: and frankly game was not in the photo for e/w I don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: No limit raise in @ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to bid 3@D ..and to make..especially if you dont know your partners @D-length|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: 14+  no limit, could have 29|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@h is limites|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't, but i think it's a good agreement|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: or about this bidding :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: and then 2@C forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont know both pairs / their systems / carding, so if you can help, feel free to msg us|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 natural OR 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: thuse f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N has clear action over 2@H...  he knows the opponents have at least an 8fit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aggressive 1NT by East but the contract has play|pg||
nt|rmb1: Best line is not to lose to singleton @HQ :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E has to play @sA on side in trick2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's a matter of frequency|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: personally i like 2@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you have a one-suiter (diamonds) and how often a two suiter. Same applies for 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With minors you can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Spade up AND take the club finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is that enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here it is, but he may reject and throw one on @DA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: then he needs 2 ruffs spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and lose 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: because I don´t beleive E can play on @hA on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lauria asking the @C question early doors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|kerasidis: wlc!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Avram|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: 1@h all pass in OR|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: should manage the game |pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|sommer: a t/o double would work too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S might well show enough diamonds to interest S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2@C is F1|pg||
nt|chick: whatever the bidding meant, they have ended in a very reasonable contract and will likely make it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|ady: meant 2@C rebid on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bigtrain: S will then know they have 8+@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rmb1: Now he doesn't need any spade ruffs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice play here|pg||
nt|sommer: I prefer a t/o, but maybe they play it differently|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s might suggest a weakins 5/6 in @ss/@DS.  X might be more just competing.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: so we have a wide range of views this hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not sure X would be TO...  why can't N be dealt 4@H in an "over-double" situation|pg||

nt|rcerreto: mi pare la prosecuzione più probabile|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||
nt|bessi2: better play to start @s jack|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Paul Gipson, Peter Lund, Magnús E. Magnússon and Girogio Mauri|pg||
nt|rmb1: Was able to draw trumps with @H10 so, remained in dummy to cash winners|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume that n/s are playing some sort of big club (thus 1@D opener)|pg||
nt|santyclz: What is clear is that there are several ways to play these auctions.  What's essential is that you have discussed this type of auction with your pd.|pg||
nt|sommer: a little more action now|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: 3NT a good spot for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope he speaks English|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My French is not adequate|pg||
nt|hedyg: i sent him a French message|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S makes life difficult|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi all|pg||
nt|april7: again a 4@H contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes so I was advised|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you find an opening on E? I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|ady: west facing a passed and has not automatic action|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if west passes   east might take action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But normal here is 3@c from W and 3@s from E|pg||
nt|ady: west decided to bid|pg||
nt|ady: east may ask for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to the names now|pg||
nt|zebutin: there is also "multi-landy"-stylish, where you would show majors with 4@C, single suiter with 4@D and 4M is major + minor...|pg||
nt|sommer: E better not insist to play his minor(s)|pg||
nt|mcphee: nor S his @H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: and finally to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next question. Do you all overcall 2@H?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: and 3nt is more easy now for E|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i would, it takes away some room, but im notoriously eager to overcall on the otherhand...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now easy to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners bid 2@C after 1NT :(|pg||
nt|april7: losing 1@C,1@D and 1 H|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N response a bit strong isn't it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not an overbid...|pg||
nt|sommer: 2N now?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N now would make up for it |pg||
nt|sommer: 3N makes on a good day|pg||
nt|mcphee: think I would have tried 2N|pg||
nt|sommer: he should know, there's potential now for at least 2N..maybe jump even to 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: popular to play 2NT as a raise in this situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will get player names up as soon as our operator gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: they really didn't duck to the Jack|pg||
nt|iceking: This probably did not happen |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last segment of 16 boards in the Round of 16 and Angelini is in trouble as you see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Angelini Team play with 8 players|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BOVE ERCOLE - ANGELINI FRANCESCO -  CIMA LEONARDO  - DATO MASSIMO |pg||
nt|bridge_one: FANTONI FULVIO  -  NUNES CLAUDIO  -  GAROZZO BENITO  -  PRIMAVERA FEDERICO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play in another team this year|pg||
nt|pelu: prob fantoni - Nunes are playing now :)|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see 2@S on @H lead should make |pg||
nt|iceking: lose 3@S 2@C tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The all time great Benito Garozzo at our table, what a treat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Cima is a my friend - i am happy to see Leonardo to play togheter Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The surprise is that Garozzo love to play difficult system, instead Cima love to play natural :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Angelini is playing with Federico Primavera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a passer at these colours I must confess|pg||
nt|zebutin: but what is defalcos x? better than straight 3@H ? or worse?|pg||
nt|zebutin: i dont seem to understand that x, even with open cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: ahh that would account for 1N then|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: Buscaglia Team is fron Novara (city near Milan, in the north of Italy)|pg||
nt|rmb1: I am sure they only bid 2@C so you can declare the @H contracts Roland|pg||
nt|sommer: that was very pessimistic|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: There is an excellent article on exactly that problem by Steve Robinson (one of our frequent commentators) here:   http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx|pg||
nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike that 2@d bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on a heart guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: bit of a thin over call it was:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: so that wouldn't suit my style then... :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u will be decl in 2@H, Roland :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 3@D  presumable shows 5 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: the last thing he wants is for pd to sacrifice to 5@d|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: does not 3NT on that bidding show a spade stopper?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks I suppopse. as well an after a @c lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Shows a better hand than 3@H would, which is merely competitive. Normallty both minors, but you can control that by bidding hearts next|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room straight 4@H answer with De Falcos cards...which is pushing it a little bit (atleast i think so...)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ady: sorry     Lebel had overcalled 2NT|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like 9 tricks with any plan|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sommer: exept this:)|pg||
nt|sommer: may get it back, tho|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: I think the overcall did the damage, but that is easy for me to ay because I can see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *say|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: but 4@s will be made if declarer can find @hQ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: this could work out very poorly if the @S game fails in the other room|pg||
nt|sommer: got it back|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thjere you go  :)|pg||
nt|sommer: told you:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|harmon: Here is link http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I have already given it to my partner after 2nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the otherhand Kxx in @S seems to be wasted value in bidding|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: my spelling.....|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ralf? after a non-@C lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: In fact, 4@S is cold as West can be endplayed to open up the heart suit, no?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: Yes!|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Harmon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they may even lead a @H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: although a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact there is a play which can guarantee 4@s - before cleaning trumps play one round of @c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So maybe the hand wasn't worth more than 3@H at his first turn|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: What return from N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf    Lauria-Giubilo play the exact same system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry! shouldn´t take @dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace also made 4@H on board 1|pg||
nt|april7: actually W could claim now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He lost to @HAQ and @SA. Rest on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not take a club finesse|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: yes    was thinking or oringinal club overcall shown|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: And I had also played low on @sQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|zebutin: atleast straight 4@H escaped penalty x, so nice pickup for Manno - Lanzarotti|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whoops.|pg||
nt|sommer: realy?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: so I was wrong in the end|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Grainger-Lavee|pg||
nt|mcphee: both rooms overcalled in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no D in OR! so only -150|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BUSCAGLIA MARCO - ANTENUCCI EMILIO - BOANO CARLO  - GARGANO RUGGIERO - PENNA ENRICO - TURCO ALESSANDRO |pg||
nt|cuan: two rounds of diamonds for seeing the shape. well done massimo|pg||
nt|santyclz: We may be seeing logy play.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: again seems to be in slam zone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if West is *the* Lanzarotti. The answer is yes, but I am not inclined to comment further. Please understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h from N|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that'd have been my bid....|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
nt|zebutin: but spades dont play out too well with 5-0 distribution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We assume board 2 was flat too|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural system, W opens 1NT and i'm affraid i'd have find myself playing the doomed 6@s. 6@d, however, seem to be much better|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6nt seems decent too|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
nt|sommer: soon|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: wd in other room to get to diamonds instead of 8card major suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you double 6@S not knowing if you have any defence against 6NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 6@d is superior over 6NT, because if @s's are 3-2 you can play AK@h ( discarding @s's ) , AK@s and @s ruff, and discard a @c over the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know if Daniela has time to insert the result manually|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be happy to defend, undoubled|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me doubling 6@S seems bad...your just happy if they land there|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 6@D is surely superior... 6@D > 6nt > 6@S it seems to me|pg||
nt|cuan: Lanzarotti-Manno play "Nightmare. 1@C opening is 15+ with clubs, Bal 15-17 or any GF. 3@C of Manno is diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 3@C show diamonds I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Nightmare, 1@D opening followed by 1NT is 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D either natural unbalanced or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: if not vulnerable E could compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@ds on a finesse and a break.  Neither is on.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D is 30%..not much:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: T|pg||
pc|cA|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Antonio Cuccorese|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sommer: far!!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now best def is duck from S it looks like |pg||
nt|paulg:  frustrating when you hold all of your sides values|pg||

pc|hA|nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
nt|yuval10: they seem to land on their feet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is indeed the best slam, very well spotted by Lo Presti-Hugony in the open room|pg||
nt|zebutin: both rooms managed to avoid @S trap|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to play @c towards the QJXX and will make easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is normal play|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuan: very good choice, after very good bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Garozzo has won more than any of us ever will |pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
nt|chick: even knowing of the double fit, neither of them has a hand that might consider a slam try|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hurrah, we are linked|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now our operator needs to enter scores on 1, 2 and 3 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, take it back then. maybe a fake cuebid?|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if that is a reverse 2@d bid, then west is surely heading for slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  less pedestrian if West leads the @dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S 10 tricks with @D lead - but probably J@H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: (2@d x)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mcphee: or not:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@d cant have been a reverse then|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: why no @H lead here is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||
nt|iceking: more chance w leads @D then east|pg||
nt|iceking: probably should lead @D king after this bidding|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||
nt|tomi2: any reasonable lead will make this go down now. clubs => ruff, @H =>open a trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C no (no dbl by East) - @S no, of course - J@H with 4 @H in North can be dangerous|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bessi2: did he really lead a spade|pg||

nt|sommer: so .. maybe W should have kept his mouth shut on 4@D?|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry  I meant Id expect more from East  as I  said West had good values|pg||
nt|tomi2: west would open 1@C (16+) with a point more|pg||
nt|tomi2: ah ok|pg||
nt|mamos: inadvertent designation :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty active hands so far|pg||
nt|iceking: 1@H and S cant really enter here unless he overcalls 1@S |pg||
nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@hsx'd is less than 4@ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@H may cost 500:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: What is the percentage play for only 2 losers in hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW want to avoid 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: But 3NT is off the @C suit, so @S it is (I guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Walter?|pg||
nt|ady: unless 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: I must have missed something.  I thought he had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the doodle bug 2@S|pg||
nt|sommer: almost..|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@D will buy it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: PO?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i know a few players who would open S hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so this is not real Nightmare|pg||
nt|paulg:  south might double now|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D probably limited here, as i assume they play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|sommer: he MIGHT have had, but possible to set 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like these 2 bids , but never with 2 aces|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as done in OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah yes, I missed the black xruff.|pg||
nt|chick: he got the ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: sry..300 for 2 down|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|bigtrain: @@HK|pg||
nt|othered1: low to K?|pg||

nt|ady: 2@S  not sure to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just the 1NT rebid after 1@D opening|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bigtrain: @HKZ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi Hedy :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni may try 4@D now if it is splinter in his system|pg||
nt|april7: a game try in @S but will stop in 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S = weak NT (or weak NT with 3 card support)|pg||
nt|sommer: very close, but in danger, right?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: so a double on board 5 would have been worth 8 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = max raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
nt|sommer: he may be able to endplay W somehow|pg||
nt|santyclz: This auction could have started 1@s, 2@h for a disaster.|pg||
nt|sommer: in aggressive sayc or similar, yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Worse in aggressive 2/1.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|chick: yes, NS at the other table made an excellent stop in 5@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: i'm more in need of caffine that i thought|pg||
nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think 2@d can still be a fair 15 points, so West has to do something with a fit|pg||
nt|iceking: if W had a strong @D raise he could have bid 2@S instead of 2nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphztt: 1. Kepri 2. Djarum Black 3. Timah Prima 1 4. Djarum Super 5. Timah prima 2 6. well wise |pg||
nt|ady: east very optimistic to bid on over preference to 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is one of the disadvantages, when 1nt response can be up to 10-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: yes he could - I was just asking about 2NT/3@D - what is the diff|pg||
nt|kerasidis: surprise:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i hate those surprises:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: South tries "black on black" - better to play @C6 - declare know @C3 is not @S3 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
nt|sommer: this may still be both a boy or a girl:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bridge_one: right Magnusson - with interesting raise in @D 2@S was the best auction for W|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a possibility to defeat is to underplay @cA twice and get 2 @h ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: abd 3@D?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT showing @s values was not good news for Fantoni|pg||
nt|mcphee: looked a little better to get out a trump|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rmb1: OR played board 5 in 6@C, even less chance of a squeeze with an Ace and a trump to lose (= flat)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like Fantoni is in control here with Nunes describing his hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 2@s confirming @h fit and gf hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
nt|sommer: still a "boy":)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||
nt|iceking: but here with so much value in the black suits 2nt seems better then 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not an easy defense at this point.  Maybe a @d honor will still beat it.|pg||
nt|sommer: again NS get a + on "passive" bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: +2 or +5... the small one is the girl:)|pg||
nt|sommer: did W go to smoke..or p?|pg||
nt|mcphee: is west regeretting his decision to not with the first @S?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: trust your patrner and underplay @cA twice|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sommer: the boy..again:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he makes if he plays trumps.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: not a lot of eexcitement here|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@D and back to the "girl"..I'm glad now, I introduced this Danish saying:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: odd no one tapped dummy with another @H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: nice @c switch|pg||
nt|ady: 3 down is seems|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are may be they are better off in 5@h than slam|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: sorry, EW stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still -1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d with 2stop in @C and 2 stop in @S and no sgl value isn't ortodoxe|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|nt|mcphee: 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 3 was flat, same defence in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: oh they alreadyhad 4:(|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s8|nt|psridhar: but i fancy Fantoni would have landed 6@H had he got there|pg||
nt|hedyg: when i have say 11 hcps , 4 @cs or @ds 3 3 3 and no @s stopper i will bid X and then 2@s asking for a stopper|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pg||

nt|doctorone: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Quentin is catching up with entering the scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed he is, only board 2 missing|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What would 2@S show, Peter, if not a great fit for diamonds?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: promise because max 2@h max 3@s, so 8 cards in minors :) |pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt if not 4@D then only few shapes 2-2-3-6, 3-2-3-5, exs not many more |pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d or 3@d or Pass as South now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: As declarer, you do not want a player like Lauria to be the one holding five trumps - he will do the right thing|pg||
nt|april7: looks like 3NT by W|pg||
nt|sommer: at least close with some funny "ups and downs"|pg||
nt|santyclz: More ill fitting hands...|pg||
nt|mcphee: this looks to be a fun hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: for those who cannot get through to the FFB, Laffineur has an advance of 14 VPs over Zimmermann who is in 3rd position|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT seems likely|pg||
nt|chick: and very makeable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think by East|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 3@H any one?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psridhar: this may get too high for EW|pg||

nt|april7: now by E ofcourse|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: EW will have this to themselves|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm still taking notes on sef|pg||
nt|mcphee: the other room might open 3N as S|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would have|pg||
nt|bessi2: very uncomfortable bidding problem for north here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would open 3@D with 2/1 in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must play 4@H on 5-2 here|pg||
nt|iceking: and they will |pg||
nt|pelu: pass from W = 2 card @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can make despite the 5-1 trump break|pg||
nt|sommer: again this 1@D denying MA mainly|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "nebulous" @d which cost earlier when s didn't raise on 5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i do actually know players who play 4@c like a leaping michaels over 3@d openings|pg||
nt|iceking: east will bid 3@D now w 4@C or 3@H and east 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: West|pg||
nt|mcphee: wonder what 2@C opening shows|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: maybe to 3N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: do they play forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, by Guermani|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk3: Besides, West is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Buzzoni can't imgaine that partner has this hand when he passed initially|pg||
nt|bessi2: however, 4@s bid was not one I was considering|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S was a bit much after 2@H I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D probably confirm 5@H and ask stop in @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: (oops)  East overcalled 1NT on a worse hand than West's earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks difficult to make|pg||
nt|april7: I think 2NT by E is better but then E would bid 3|pg||
nt|april7: by W|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When no initial in front of the surname we get the same first name in profiles|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me would ask N to bid 3N with a @H stop|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: with hearts 3-2   should not be problems|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they may not have this agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how the software works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So one of them should have  P GUERMANI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then you can give them different first names in their profiles|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk3: OK, so West had to respond 1NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ranking after round 9: http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletAffSPPASClassement|pg||
nt|ady: Fantonie might try ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|ady: hope for K@H with north   or unlikely ace|pg||
nt|ady: should lead to 11 tricks  as Lebel wont risk heart finesse and drop queen doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D is to play 4!|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it's a good idea to pass the South hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bridge_one: xfer|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by West???|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like all routes lead to 4@h, eventually ... even if South open 3@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because 3 cards in @D can id 3@H West|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphztt: correction, 1. kepri 2. Djarum black 3. Timah prima 1 4. djarum super 5. international 6. timah prima 2 7. well wise 8. wind runner|pg||
nt|sommer: -1 here too for a flat?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk3: Walter taking notes still|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did you translate SEF for a start?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes must have thought Roussel has either 6 @hs or at least AQxxx for his bid|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has quite a lot of anxieties though|pg||
nt|bessi2: you can say that again.. if you dont have a convention for this sort of hand then just open 1@c|pg||
nt|rmb1: It allows some players to hide their mistakes by saying it was partner|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: interesting bidding is 3nt - 6@c and E is on the lead....|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: West choose to bid pass instead 3@H to give 3 cards in @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W bids 3@s, East can infer that his pd did not o/c over 3@D and pass may be , but in practise i doubt that will happen|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: though even then i am not sure one should cover|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|mamos: and is going off now|pg||
nt|paulg:  West can see that there is little to be gained by declaring the contract himself|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|hedyg: hey Jeff :)|pg||

nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT  EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: taking into account the fact that interferences will occur less frequently when opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually opened 3NT and bid 4@d over pd's 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Fred Gitelman says, only open 3NT if you do NOT want to play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S is good for that hand type, transfer pre-empt|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: In other words, use it for something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: a good bad 2N would be welcome here, allowing W to bid a constructive 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam with 2 key cards missing    but could be made seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: defence would have five tricks then  i think|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@C must be intermediate|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcphee: oh my, 3@D not my cup of tea here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: Nunes cannot open 1@d there ; his system requires stronger hand for that|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s because 2@h is probably a constructive raise and he is not strong enough for that|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C probably final contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cima should balance after 2@H pass pass|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||

nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
nt|iceking: clear pass agree|pg||
nt|sommer: wrong singleton in W:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||

mb|2N|nt|po-s: not by East though|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then the 1S opg didnt succeed spectacularly either here|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too, but the French style, more than others, I've noticed, is not to open 1NT with a 5 card major in many instances.|pg||
nt|fann4: I don't get the 2N bid here at all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes Jeff, W got to bid as well there showing hcps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Paul Gipson|pg||

nt|april7: thats true too|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4333 5 count with no controls.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Right Hedy, thanks, I overlooked the bidding sequence.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT is a general gametry|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u open 1@s with a good 15 hcp and get raised to 2@s, i suppose u will bid more|pg||
nt|april7: but E has 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: he has 16, not 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this looks destined for down 1 on competent defense|pg||
nt|sommer: @S10 in S is gold as @D10 in N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: and 2 10s|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: with this lead, there is nothing else |pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: the opening 1@S bid kept NS out of a very unpleasant 4@S contract they might have reached|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|fann4: So what was the raise to 2@S/? About 5-9 I guess. Something wrong if these 2 hands get to game.|pg||

nt|psridhar: 2@s was the limit of the hand-tough to pass after 1s-2s|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you - Multon opened 1NT in the OR.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2NT here by W meant : we are vulnerable pd, are you sure we dont have game?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Letting 4@H through on 24 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Interesting. E may have a "slight" bidding problem over 1@d 1@s here, as double would show 4 @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14+ f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: and maybe Roussel didnt get the right message|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told 2N was showing a strong NT hand with 5@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: E had denied so much as 10 hcps or a good 9 by not bidding drury|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are in slam here you must choose 6@S rather than 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: reasonable 6@S, not clear they will find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is there any way to make 6@s? cannot see it|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks cold to me Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is with @S10 singleton|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fann4: The irony is that the 1NT contract in the OR is going to go more than 1 down. There's no justice:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: timah prima 2|pg||
nt|mcphee: I like the 1NT opening:)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have no idea re 2NT but I don't like it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  unlucky  should be down 1    likely to be bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ natural, or 15+ balanced |pg||
nt|fann4: Does this 4@S show 5 of them, or just a good hand with maybe 4@S? Tough for N.|pg||
nt|april7: slam try!!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will they reach slam here?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphztt: kepri|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 3NT either|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose it was for @C|pg||
nt|bessi2: and why on earth didn't east try to go for the penalty|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes seems 500 was available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a slam on a finess and a @c lead is needed to defeat|pg||
nt|april7: not only try, N will be inn 6 going 1 dfown unfortunately|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: maybe "should"|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt this shows 5@ss for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has 2 golden cards @c king and @h ace-certainly worth a thought for slam in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 15-17?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: if so, S MIGHT invite with two 5-carder|pg||
nt|santyclz: K&R was with me last hand, they valued that at 3.45|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: and Q@D protecting form being tapped out as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: but he did well passing 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: as far as he knows they are in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: and yes J9X in trumps |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think that 1D-X showed @h ..dont they play trf there?|pg||
nt|fann4: Hedy, how many boards in this set?|pg||

nt|kerasidis: no way now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: another tricky hand|pg||
nt|mamos: bad breaks in both minors |pg||
nt|tomi2: and in hearts too. only spades could split worse|pg||
nt|mamos: which minor to start with?|pg||
nt|mamos: nothing will work as it happens|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk3: Chemla will be disappointed to see partner follow to two rounds of hearts at some point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can you make 3NT on a heart lead?|pg||
nt|april7: how could Lauria stay out of slam with 20 P???|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: this is an easy 450 for Fantoni |pg||
nt|tomi2: playing south for Hx in @D seems a good chance. you lwad J now and if its covered you win the ace and play towards the 10. if not, you lose to north and you can play the ace later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping to pin the other honor|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: the 3@d bid was too much imo, very encouraging|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would lead to 4@D tricks, 1@S 2@h and 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk3: Like now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a push perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: Clubs alone wasnt going to produce enough tricks  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||

nt|kerasidis: will count in @h finnese|pg||

nt|april7: Blqackwood|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: But West will likely lead @DK, so ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would have bid 2@C as E|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Maybe declarer should have guessed (in spite of no cover). West opened 1 diamond, had shown four hearts and 3 spades - If East has four diamonds he might have bid 3 diamonds - or ...|pg||
nt|po-s: not doubled to start with|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no choice, since 2@d would probably show @hs|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will lose a trick each to 3 key cards |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: uh oh,,,,,,,,,,,,someone thought a transfer|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: without a club lead   could make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: and someone thought stayman:)|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose he could have hoped for a singleton honor in E|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fann4: It's extremely unlikely N would underlead an ace in this position, but what can it cost declarer to try the K?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd10 Multon managed down 1 for a push|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S also on bd 11 in the OR.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|othered1: Anyone for passing 2@C?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ritong: moi|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: except Multon went -1 on 1NT while Laffineur went -1 on 4 @S :p|pg||
nt|fann4: so what's the best play here for 1 loser in trumps?|pg||
nt|jkotor: A:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: flip a coin|pg||
nt|psridhar: guessing a finesse is the right play here-2 small singletons vs 2 honors with N , so play of ace is slightly inferior play|pg||
nt|psridhar: issue is only when N has stiff @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 singletons are possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: two small |pg||
nt|jkotor: and 4-0 is only 1 distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: two honors|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: maybe not   can set up spades without using an entry|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|pelu: better - then @sJ is an entry|pg||
nt|april7: for double finesse in @H|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|doctorone: me 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: one small card already appeared|pg||
nt|pelu: or a discard on @cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fann4: According to Suitplay, the 10 is best. I'm having a look at it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|po-s: 2clubs might have been artificial (some kind of Gazilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not so interested any more|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|ritong: i strongly doubt it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: as spec says could do it double dummy   spade finesse on the way|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: If 2@C conventional, all bets are off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: several people are telling me that the risk-reward ratio favors going down rather than take the finesse and risk a bigger loss|pg||

nt|ralfwil: nice distribution on S1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly against the "make vul games at imps" meme.|pg||
nt|chick: The formula is ... settle for -1 scores -100 ... take the finesse for 75% x -400 +25% x +600 = -175  |pg||
nt|sommer: thats what I meant by my very first remarc, but stiff honor is only 2,4% and even with 5-6 @S, it only adds to maybe 4%. IF the finesse loses to @DJ, he's 4 down ..thats what you ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|othered1: how  many @S with north?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 16 is the last board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i tried the real time connection with federbridge, but don't work|pg||

nt|sommer: 2 x 1,2|pg||
nt|chick: ah right, 2 honors|pg||
nt|sommer: guess both Q and J works:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: zero|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: hmmm would not have thought of 1N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But still 5 comparisons missing, so maybe the match is closer than we think|pg||
nt|othered1: @C is the NS spot but not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-ruff will defeat 4@S - and on a @D-lead: @C to ruff, DQ and @D ruffed in N = down 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: So it's the fact that losing the finesse means -4 rather than -2 which makes the difference.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H by NS and a good save by EW in 5@S, S might underlead @H for a @C ruff, but still only 2 down|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-12 not compared yet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a michael's or a ghestem would be more easy here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in South|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is just barely in my Michaels range.  Still 3@C not easy to find.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: new suit at level 3 must be 5 cards - so pass by north now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ouch, board 10 cost Angelini 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: -100  against  -175 is small imps.   making the contract is big imps.  that matters, too|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He could easily go more than 1 down|pg||

nt|mcphee: i predict he will |pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: boards 10 is typical in bridge competition - 8 cards in a major where the roght contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||

nt|ady: Nunes playing for 3-3 club or doubleton honor    but not joy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz: So it would be an average of losing 7 3 times vs winning 12 once.  A -9 imp long-term position.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy i am sure ...and usually Fantoni plays double dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: still uptrick on a spade return|pg||

nt|santyclz: Never mind.  Now that I think of it, that's a non sequitor.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: but they are there....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many in Italy use dbl with 17 hcp, but with only 2@C and K sgl in @S 2@H is more correct|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if South could bid a natural 2NT?|pg||
nt|reisig: S couldn't try 2N?|pg||
nt|pelu: ??? dis East open 1@C???|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: its a transfer system probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a normal bidding for NS - not for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: makeable with open cards|pg||
nt|april7: best contract by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: the problem here is, you cant say "50% either or, he will go for the 25% fin"...I THINK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bigtrain: 5@S asks   of kings; 5N would be the first specific suit ask (the order changes depending upon the bidding -- bid suits have higher priority than unbid suits)|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mamos: the tempo has been quick    this auction probably already the slowest of the match   not sure quite why|pg||

pc|dA|nt|mcphee: good shift|pg||
