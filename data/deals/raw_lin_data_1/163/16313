nt|mcphee: fast first round:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure who is leading|pg||
nt|sommer: very soon now|pg||
nt|mcphee: any idea sommer?|pg||
nt|sommer: EW leads 57-47|pg||
nt|mcphee: they lead event?|pg||
nt|sommer: only this quarterfinal|pg||
nt|mcphee: obviously you are suggesting I should know more about what I am doing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: isnt there 4 winners in a quarterfinal?:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Someone should and we voted on you.|pg||
nt|mcphee: people often vote for the wrong dude|pg||
nt|sommer: lol|pg||
nt|sommer: new cards|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and let's rock'n roll|pg||
nt|mcphee: or samba for those with different dance steps|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, whatever|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc kibz, we hope, you get something for your entry fee:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: indeed, see sommer for refunds if not happy|pg||
nt|sommer: you'll get  comments in English (or almost:)) - in OR you can get them in Italian|pg||
nt|sommer: ...at least, I THINK you will get some comments VERY soon:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|ady: start with 20-20 split|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For me, Lauria-Versace as a pair are among the top 3 in the world|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: PACAULT-LEFLON|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, but getting to 6 level might get difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you prefer, 4@S or 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laurua-Giubilo play the same system as Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Massimo Papis Ticci is a little more weak of his father , of course|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@h making|pg||
nt|stoffers: Indeed Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any other views?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have play for 4@H   especially diffiult lead for south|pg||
nt|athene: the auction might well end in 4@SX|pg||
nt|athene: @S vs @H auctions have a tendency to do that|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would choose 4nt, and after @C change to @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or 4@D if it shows both red suits. Should it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: seems logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah ha!  |pg||
nt|mcphee: this is the pair that plays nightmare|pg||
nt|sommer: no redeal... 3@H -1 is max on this, I think|pg||
nt|athene: double shows 4+ spades? or specifically 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fossi is a the younghest player in the Pauncs team, and he play very well|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: OURSEL-LISE|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: can somebody help us with information about this event?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the technical problems|pg||
nt|sommer: NS can make 3@D with carefull play|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone consider pass as W?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..will S bid that?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by South show 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S limit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably pass now in South|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
nt|mcphee: not such a bad hand to defend 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: NAELS-CHARLETOUX|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: HIRCHWALD-ZIMMERMANN|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 0 they must bid|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes decided hand woth a response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not decide, he cannot pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is forcing|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play it?|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room started with x, which to me seems strange|pg||
nt|mcphee: and frankly game was not in the photo for e/w I don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: No limit raise in @ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to bid 3@D ..and to make..especially if you dont know your partners @D-length|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Mauri - and 1@s bid =?|pg||
nt|ady: south has an extra sspade   but a poor hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: their results speak for them :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 14+  no limit, could have 29|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@h is limites|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't, but i think it's a good agreement|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i amn't sure - probably they use a system similar at rubinshol|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: or about this bidding :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: and then 2@C forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont know both pairs / their systems / carding, so if you can help, feel free to msg us|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make a lot of tricks in the rounded suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to see ... i don't have the CC|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play the same system as Lauria plays with Versace|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s   even going down a trick or so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: SIMEONI-FREZOULS|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 natural OR 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: thuse f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N has clear action over 2@H...  he knows the opponents have at least an 8fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aggressive 1NT by East but the contract has play|pg||
nt|rmb1: Best line is not to lose to singleton @HQ :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E has to play @sA on side in trick2|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's a matter of frequency|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: la 1ere équipe qualifiée est CLEMENT en raison du forfait de l'équipe ALBON|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bonjour à  Guillaume Fauconnier|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: personally i like 2@S|pg||
nt|athos: Bonjour Yoram et à tous|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you have a one-suiter (diamonds) and how often a two suiter. Same applies for 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With minors you can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Spade up AND take the club finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is that enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here it is, but he may reject and throw one on @DA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: then he needs 2 ruffs spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and lose 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: because I don´t beleive E can play on @hA on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lauria asking the @C question early doors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|kerasidis: wlc!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Avram|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@h all pass in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: bonjour Roland, bjr Guillaume :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: hi Mike|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: should manage the game |pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|sommer: a t/o double would work too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S might well show enough diamonds to interest S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2@C is F1|pg||
nt|chick: whatever the bidding meant, they have ended in a very reasonable contract and will likely make it|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: et bonjour à Michel Bessis|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: meant 2@C rebid on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bigtrain: S will then know they have 8+@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: also played by North worth a trick at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
nt|besbes: bonjour a tous|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: Bonjour Michel :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rmb1: Now he doesn't need any spade ruffs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice play here|pg||
nt|sommer: I prefer a t/o, but maybe they play it differently|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s might suggest a weakins 5/6 in @ss/@DS.  X might be more just competing.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: so we have a wide range of views this hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not sure X would be TO...  why can't N be dealt 4@H in an "over-double" situation|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d2|nt|kerasidis: nicely played|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Do we have any Nightmare experts in the audience?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|ady: look like down 2|pg||
nt|tomi2: those 4 joined the NBO of Monaco together with another sponsor to represend Monaco in future European and World Championships|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was this a correct play with so few entries to dummy?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or does anyone have a link to the system?|pg||
nt|besbes: est ce que fantunes sont la?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ici pas de probleme pour faire 11 levées|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: non|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: or 1|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||
nt|bessi2: better play to start @s jack|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Paul Gipson, Peter Lund, Magnús E. Magnússon and Girogio Mauri|pg||
nt|rmb1: Was able to draw trumps with @H10 so, remained in dummy to cash winners|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume that n/s are playing some sort of big club (thus 1@D opener)|pg||
nt|santyclz: What is clear is that there are several ways to play these auctions.  What's essential is that you have discussed this type of auction with your pd.|pg||
nt|sommer: a little more action now|pg||
nt|pelu: EW can make 6@c but problems in 4@h on @h-lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ils n ont pas eu le temps de venir!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT a good spot for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope he speaks English|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My French is not adequate|pg||
nt|hedyg: i sent him a French message|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S makes life difficult|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi all|pg||
nt|april7: again a 4@H contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes so I was advised|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you find an opening on E? I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|ady: west facing a passed and has not automatic action|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: a disciplined pass from south - many would be tempted to bid 2@S as they have a 1@S opening bid, just about|pg||
nt|daman: very perilopus to enter vulnerable with that trash|pg||
nt|athene: but you need more than "just about" an opening bid for a 2@S overcall there really - you only push if you have the heart shortage|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: if west passes   east might take action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But normal here is 3@c from W and 3@s from E|pg||
nt|ady: west decided to bid|pg||
nt|ady: east may ask for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to the names now|pg||
nt|zebutin: there is also "multi-landy"-stylish, where you would show majors with 4@C, single suiter with 4@D and 4M is major + minor...|pg||
nt|sommer: E better not insist to play his minor(s)|pg||
nt|mcphee: nor S his @H|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: and finally to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next question. Do you all overcall 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H=@H+minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3nt is more easy now for E|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D might show a minimum or else just the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: i would, it takes away some room, but im notoriously eager to overcall on the otherhand...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now easy to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners bid 2@C after 1NT :(|pg||
nt|april7: losing 1@C,1@D and 1 H|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N response a bit strong isn't it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not an overbid...|pg||
nt|sommer: 2N now?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N now would make up for it |pg||
nt|sommer: 3N makes on a good day|pg||
nt|mcphee: think I would have tried 2N|pg||
nt|sommer: he should know, there's potential now for at least 2N..maybe jump even to 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: popular to play 2NT as a raise in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxg: Chaque match se joue en 32 donnes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: We will get player names up as soon as our operator gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: they really didn't duck to the Jack|pg||
nt|iceking: This probably did not happen |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last segment of 16 boards in the Round of 16 and Angelini is in trouble as you see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Angelini Team play with 8 players|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BOVE ERCOLE - ANGELINI FRANCESCO -  CIMA LEONARDO  - DATO MASSIMO |pg||
nt|bridge_one: FANTONI FULVIO  -  NUNES CLAUDIO  -  GAROZZO BENITO  -  PRIMAVERA FEDERICO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play in another team this year|pg||
nt|pelu: prob fantoni - Nunes are playing now :)|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see 2@S on @H lead should make |pg||
nt|iceking: lose 3@S 2@C tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The all time great Benito Garozzo at our table, what a treat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Cima is a my friend - i am happy to see Leonardo to play togheter Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The surprise is that Garozzo love to play difficult system, instead Cima love to play natural :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Angelini is playing with Federico Primavera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a passer at these colours I must confess|pg||
nt|zebutin: but what is defalcos x? better than straight 3@H ? or worse?|pg||
nt|zebutin: i dont seem to understand that x, even with open cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: ahh that would account for 1N then|pg||
nt|ady: poor example of hearts and a minor    |pg||
nt|athene: over 2nt, it's common to play 3@C/@D = natural minimum and 3@H/@S = max with @C/@D|pg||
nt|athene: spades won't be good for NS despite the 5-4 fit; probably lose to the @SQ as well as everything else|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On board 1, Zaleski weas able to show is club suit as well (at the 3-level after 2@S), so EW got to 5@C and made it with an overtrick. 9 IMPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: XX = Ace of @h probably|pg||
nt|stoffers: Pass over double a bit strange maybe? xx quite standard no matter what methods you play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 24 combined hcp, but EW can't make a game. Can they stop short?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ce sont des matchs par K.O|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: Buscaglia Team is fron Novara (city near Milan, in the north of Italy)|pg||
nt|rmb1: I am sure they only bid 2@C so you can declare the @H contracts Roland|pg||
nt|sommer: that was very pessimistic|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: There is an excellent article on exactly that problem by Steve Robinson (one of our frequent commentators) here:   http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx|pg||
nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike that 2@d bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on a heart guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: bit of a thin over call it was:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: so that wouldn't suit my style then... :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u will be decl in 2@H, Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C would be a fine spot|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2@c rebid on 3-5 seems somewhat strange to me -even in precision does it not show 4-5 ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bonjour à Jean-Luc Aroix|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  presumable shows 5 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: the last thing he wants is for pd to sacrifice to 5@d|pg||
nt|juan lukas: bonjour  a tous :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: does not 3NT on that bidding show a spade stopper?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks I suppopse. as well an after a @c lead|pg||
nt|athos: salut JL|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cuan: good morning |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Shows a better hand than 3@H would, which is merely competitive. Normallty both minors, but you can control that by bidding hearts next|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: bjr Jean-Luc|pg||
nt|besbes: je pense que c est mieux de passer ou surcontrer avec lamain de delfour|pg||
nt|athos: XX n'est pas forcément disponible |pg||
nt|besbes: on peut peut vetre penaliser ils sont vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: bah la ct disponible :)|pg||
nt|athos: l'enchère peut etre conventionnelle (Rx@s ou Ax@s par exemple)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: longue hésitation chez Hervé ici|pg||
nt|athos: (on peut trouver ce lien par exemple : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenkranz_redouble)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ou plutot longue réflexion :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|zebutin: in open room straight 4@H answer with De Falcos cards...which is pushing it a little bit (atleast i think so...)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stoffers: Hi Antonio|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needs to guess trumps to make 3@c|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Lebel had overcalled 2NT|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like 9 tricks with any plan|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer: exept this:)|pg||
nt|sommer: may get it back, tho|pg||
nt|ady: might get sspade wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: I think the overcall did the damage, but that is easy for me to ay because I can see all cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *say|pg||
nt|athene: well, if west shows all his points maybe declarer will find the spade|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: but 4@s will be made if declarer can find @hQ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: this could work out very poorly if the @S game fails in the other room|pg||
nt|sommer: got it back|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thjere you go  :)|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: I have already given it to my partner after 2nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the otherhand Kxx in @S seems to be wasted value in bidding|pg||
nt|aceg: hi again - i am bridge:one - i lose the connection and also my password :) so i would take a new nick ...|pg||
nt|pelu: euff a @D 2x@s and discard a @h on @Dj|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: my spelling.....|pg||
nt|rmb1: Ralf? after a non-@C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: @DK was a mistake|pg||
nt|psridhar: he may be able to limit his losses to 2@c + 1@d ( pittching one on @s) +1@H may be |pg||
nt|psridhar: yes making eeven now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: In fact, 4@S is cold as West can be endplayed to open up the heart suit, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao Giorgio|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stoffers: Hi|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Harmon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they may even lead a @H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|juan lukas: plus de probleme pour le declarant a ce stade |pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: although a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact there is a play which can guarantee 4@s - before cleaning trumps play one round of @c|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: So maybe the hand wasn't worth more than 3@H at his first turn|pg||
nt|ady: had the heart been ducked   had a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: What return from N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf    Lauria-Giubilo play the exact same system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry! shouldn´t take @dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace also made 4@H on board 1|pg||
nt|april7: actually W could claim now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He lost to @HAQ and @SA. Rest on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did not take a club finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: really?|pg||
nt|stoffers: 4 not high enouth this time..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not the 7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: yes    was thinking or oringinal club overcall shown|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|psridhar: that was a bit careless ruffing low|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: And I had also played low on @sQ|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Walddk3: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and not  cashing @cA first|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|zebutin: atleast straight 4@H escaped penalty x, so nice pickup for Manno - Lanzarotti|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: Whoops.|pg||
nt|sommer: realy?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: so I was wrong in the end|pg||

nt|sommer: very lucky |pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf  for a 2005 version of Nightmare as played by a Canadian top pair|pg||

nt|mcphee: both rooms overcalled in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no D in OR! so only -150|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BUSCAGLIA MARCO - ANTENUCCI EMILIO - BOANO CARLO  - GARGANO RUGGIERO - PENNA ENRICO - TURCO ALESSANDRO |pg||
nt|cuan: two rounds of diamonds for seeing the shape. well done massimo|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You mean Pauncz|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: sorry yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me @cA should be played before ruffing a @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: the presence of world champions has an effect on every player , quite natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S the limit for EW when @SQ is off|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: avec une leve supplémentaire en remettant en main Sud|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: Voici les 5 premiers points pour l'équipe Stretz|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|zebutin: again seems to be in slam zone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if West is *the* Lanzarotti. The answer is yes, but I am not inclined to comment further. Please understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h from N|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that'd have been my bid....|pg||
nt|pelu: and in trick 3 S could make 3@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a strange multi?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
nt|zebutin: but spades dont play out too well with 5-0 distribution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We assume board 2 was flat too|pg||
mb|2C!|an|landik|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||
nt|iceking: north should respond here i think|pg||
nt|pelu: can u defeat 4@H by East?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: why make it easy on oops passing |pg||
nt|athos: landik = les majeures |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural system, W opens 1NT and i'm affraid i'd have find myself playing the doomed 6@s. 6@d, however, seem to be much better|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6nt seems decent too|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H|pg||
nt|aceg: 1@D can be balanced minimum |pg||
nt|aceg: 2@D, of course, is long new suit|pg||
nt|cuan: very strange, really|pg||
nt|besbes: il vaut mieux etre declarant|pg||
nt|besbes: a 1 sa|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D Multi, weak with 1 major. Unusual with 6-4 in the majors I would say|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
nt|sommer: soon|pg||
nt|ady: low part score hand    2@H n/s  about the maxmum|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Today i see the best formation by Zaleski team: Lauria-Versace Intonti-D'Avossa|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a void to boot|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and to that add a void!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Intonti is from Rome - he won many italian juniors champion|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
nt|stoffers: Who is the last pair on the team?|pg||
nt|psridhar: but they are on their par spot finally|pg||
nt|bridge_one: D'Avossa live in north italy, played many years in Lavazza team|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: 1@D must be short if east thinks he has a 3@D bid there|pg||
nt|athene: strong club for EW?|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@d need to give the raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zaleski and Giubilo but they don't play together|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria with Giubilo and Versace with Zaleski|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: wd in other room to get to diamonds instead of 8card major suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you double 6@S not knowing if you have any defence against 6NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 6@d is superior over 6NT, because if @s's are 3-2 you can play AK@h ( discarding @s's ) , AK@s and @s ruff, and discard a @c over the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know if Daniela has time to insert the result manually|pg||
nt|aceg: i amn't sure about strong club|pg||
nt|aceg: we will see in the next hands|pg||
nt|daman: they should find the winning defense easily|pg||
nt|athene: surprising decision from lauria not to take the pushto the 3-level|pg||
nt|pelu: west has promised 5 card @D so 3@D is the normal bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club ruff to set this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be happy to defend, undoubled|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me doubling 6@S seems bad...your just happy if they land there|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 6@D is surely superior... 6@D > 6nt > 6@S it seems to me|pg||
nt|cuan: Lanzarotti-Manno play "Nightmare. 1@C opening is 15+ with clubs, Bal 15-17 or any GF. 3@C of Manno is diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 3@C show diamonds I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Nightmare, 1@D opening followed by 1NT is 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D either natural unbalanced or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: if not vulnerable E could compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@ds on a finesse and a break.  Neither is on.|pg||
nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|athene: spade or diamond looks like the normal lead to me|pg||
nt|daman: not I said the Walrus|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D is 30%..not much:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: T|pg||
nt|stoffers: ok|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Zaliski team play with many options - 6 players, but not 3 pairs|pg||
nt|psridhar: not bidding a Vul game on a finesse has only one justification - the result :) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Antonio Cuccorese|pg||
nt|cuan: Manno' bid has showed the threesuiter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too good for Roland.|pg||
nt|aceg: Lauria poor of hight cards, and 2@H say your force|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sommer: far!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||
nt|chick: but I think it is a very close call|pg||
nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||
nt|chick: oh, good point :)|pg||
nt|iceking: now best def is duck from S it looks like |pg||
nt|paulg:  frustrating when you hold all of your sides values|pg||
nt|psridhar: you better be right on result when u do such things|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks with best defence  = a @c ruff on S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 15+ any|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
nt|yuval10: they seem to land on their feet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is indeed the best slam, very well spotted by Lo Presti-Hugony in the open room|pg||
nt|zebutin: both rooms managed to avoid @S trap|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to play @c towards the QJXX and will make easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is normal play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cuan: very good choice, after very good bid|pg||
nt|aceg: his force (sry)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Garozzo has won more than any of us ever will |pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there it is!|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|stoffers: Big 400 from Open last board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
nt|chick: even knowing of the double fit, neither of them has a hand that might consider a slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: d'Avossa made 3NT on board 18!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||
nt|daman: I see nothing wrong with leading a suit where we are known to have potential tricks|pg||

nt|stoffers: It wasnt only the declearer in this room being sloppy with the @c suit on that board..|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ralfwil: they can in fact take also a @d ruff for -3, but 5@c is better|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of competition this hand too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when declarer led a club towards dummy Mariani followed small and d'Avossa inserted the 7!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: probally not |pg||

nt|mcphee: 2@D a move I did not expect|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@ds may be a raise to 2@s with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some artificial raise|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|sommer: strong/weak raise in @S|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm told it's called a "zanzibar"|pg||
nt|mcphee: could be called a Jr bergen|pg||
nt|ady: n/s might make 4@H wothout the club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that south doesn't pre-balance there|pg||
nt|pelu: NS cold for 3@h|pg||
nt|aceg: note no bergen raise |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Here is a typical OBAR situation. The player with shape must get in|pg||
nt|athene: maybe their style is that it always has to be the guy in the actual passout seat|pg||
nt|stoffers: so he couldnt have it|pg||
nt|psridhar: he came to that situation after pitching a club off tbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: note pass by north - in Italy many pairs not use weak open with 5/5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: any guesses what 4@H shows|pg||
nt|mcphee: only you Roland:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble is that the players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian 4@S coming up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Did n thing 2@s x was t/o or was he just feeling suicidal?|pg||
nt|sommer: shouldnt be difficult to get to 4@S, whatever line you chose|pg||

nt|athene: let's see this time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: or it's Lauri who has to fight :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also correct if S has Jx or 10x|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Hurrah, we are linked|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|aceg: need to find the ruff in @C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Now our operator needs to enter scores on 1, 2 and 3 manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, take it back then. maybe a fake cuebid?|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. if that is a reverse 2@d bid, then west is surely heading for slam|pg||
nt|paulg:  less pedestrian if West leads the @dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S 10 tricks with @D lead - but probably J@H lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It does not necessarily show a strong hand to double with South's cards, just shape|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: (2@d x)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lauria did what Giubilo should have done|pg||

nt|athene: Pauncz does what Giubilo should have done too :)|pg||

nt|pelu: 10-12 - an the lead - @dK = 10|pg||
nt|psridhar: optimisitc 3@h by Lauria pressing for a Vul game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H is invitational with 5-5|pg||
nt|stoffers: exactly what he's got|pg||
nt|psridhar: many play 1@d- 2@h s majors 5-4 +|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not in Europe|pg||
nt|stoffers: 5@d needs A@d lead dont it?|pg||
nt|stoffers: to beat i mean|pg||
nt|stoffers: no,@s also|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt was on - seem to can make losing 2@h 1@s A @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: or not:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should bid 4@C over 3NT|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@d cant have been a reverse then|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 6@c is farbetter than 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes agree|pg||
nt|athene: but the previous hand|pg||
nt|juan lukas: il a eu peut etre peur de tomber sur le 4441 court a @s non ? |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: why no @H lead here is a surprise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||
nt|iceking: more chance w leads @D then east|pg||
nt|iceking: probably should lead @D king after this bidding|pg||
nt|aceg: 4@H is a honest contract|pg||
nt|stoffers: great bid|pg||
nt|cuan: D'Avossa did a mistake in 3NT. He discards a club from dummy on third round of heart. With 3 clubs, Ace and small club is always winner |pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Lauria value his J@C and J@D|pg||
nt|psridhar: to visualise 3N with a stiff club u need gr8 imagination !|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||
nt|tomi2: any reasonable lead will make this go down now. clubs => ruff, @H =>open a trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @C no (no dbl by East) - @S no, of course - J@H with 4 @H in North can be dangerous|pg||
nt|mcphee: why did he cover?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bessi2: did he really lead a spade|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable .|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: But the entry to the diamonds is gone now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make 6@D 2@C 1@S losing AK@H K@S A@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must play for the majors to yield enough tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sJ is an entry as the cards lie|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh right|pg||
nt|cuan: best lead, but normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, need J in @S up the K|pg||
nt|psridhar: you dont get to see what  class players do on every deal-it is in such rare gem moves they r visible|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|ady: skipped threw|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's better now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes @DA is stiff and then your worries are over|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria is thinking to play the finesse in @C, because he can make 9 tricks also with 3@C 1@D 3@H 2@s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bridge_one: so K@D seam to be the better lead (technically)|pg||
nt|aceg: a misunderstand for E/W (:|pg||
nt|daman: I would have played the @C 8   unless playing udca|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: @C4 misunderstood?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: slipped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks easy for us. Play @cA and then on @d|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: not that many players lead low from Ax|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: West had good cards|pg||
nt|iceking: north never bid @C so east cant dbl it|pg||
nt|daman: probably saved 2 !MPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|iceking: just looking at w hand knows @S will break and has no values should lead agressive|pg||
nt|athene: @C4 has to be wrong whatever their carding|pg||
nt|athene: you either play a big one or a small one|pg||
nt|daman: he petered :)|pg||
nt|athene: don't mess about|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play odd/even I suspect and East did not have any odd card|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Happens|pg||
nt|ady: expensive|pg||
nt|aceg: 8 in @C better, however|pg||
nt|athene: playing odd/even, right was a slow 4|pg||
nt|besbes: peureux|pg||
nt|juan lukas: a la donné 2 , dans l'autre salle , Tignel a dit 2@d sur le landik mais ils ne se sont pas pour autant arreter à ce contrat : 2@d sur le landik n'est il pas naturel ? auquel cas , ...|pg||
nt|juan lukas: Est aurait pu passer |pg||
pc|sK|nt|doctorone: EW had some "significant" @h contract though...|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Now it's no fun|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He plays for @SK to be onside|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - but not easy to choose this at first round|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is no other chance on my opinion|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could make also making 3@C 1@D 3@H 2@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but would need Q@C in East - and this isn't sure|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not enough of entries to set up @h|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure seems right to cash @D A first|pg||
nt|besbes: oupsss|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: malgré ce mariage une de chute tout d meme|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sommer: 4@S went down in OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: np - not entry ? then make 9 trick playing on @D|pg||
nt|cuan: now he can make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: if east had 98x in trumps iam sure he would continue @D hope pd had JT stiff for upper-cut|pg||
nt|stoffers: In the mean time, 7 back on 19 when they bid the doomed 4@s in OR|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: East shifted to third best from 6.  Wonder if that is their agreement|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the lead @C from 1084 is very rare better that lead K@D - there are few layout to work|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|iceking: but as he has 97x JT doesnt really help him unless declerar misguesses @S|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but EW have a profitable save in 5@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C 2 down by E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 3nt from E a real underbid? on last board?|pg||
nt|tomi2: this @CK false card only works agains pairs who lead low from 96, else the small card would be the better one. South "might" think partner made some inspired lead from Kx. not ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: likely but the king made it easier for south to play for that ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, had to be @D overruff...|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Previous board, surprisingly, EW entered the bidding and did not locate their @h fit|pg||
nt|aceg: to choose the clear card is typical of great player|pg||
mb|1N|nt|doctorone: in other room I meant|pg||
nt|chick: in that room, they didn't have the advantage of having heard red suit bids|pg||
nt|sommer: @H+mi (@D?)|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe E knows it's @H/@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria will investigate slam but Versace is not interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if West doubles and North raises to the three-level, may lose the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garozzo will bid them|pg||
nt|daman: of course|pg||
nt|iceking: might stick in 3nt here or|pg||
nt|iceking: depends little what 3@H means |pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: they play a limited system, he could not have more than this. maximum points, no wasted KQJ in @D and a 6th trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is strange|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't buy it there anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boana will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt perfect|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|bridge_one: easy 4@H now|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H and 5@D are both good|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|athene: most would go with 1@H |pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: it sure was, 6@D in OR|pg||
nt|ady: already 1 too high|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H can go down, correct|pg||
nt|aceg: about the system i suppose they play similar at precision (the version of Papis Ticci)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i like 3nt but needs to take the save now i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then perhaps 5@C next|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but dangerous for E/W, |pg||
nt|april7: whats 1@S from W?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1@s trf to 1 nt?|pg||
nt|aceg: they are E/W|pg||
nt|pelu: yes not my bid - would u D or bid 1@H??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H for sure|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@H after dbl is, in italian style, a strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: the usual rule is that if you double, partner makes a free bid that would have been a jump, and you bid a new suit, it's game forcing|pg||
nt|aceg: all world overcall 1@H i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but that sort of is based on a stronger double-then-bid style|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridge_one: good Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great evaluation of hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: May be transfer to @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@D down on trump lead I think|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe not|pg||
nt|mcphee: can set up @S|pg||
nt|athene: double then 3@H is a real mosnster for most US and English pairs|pg||
nt|psridhar: short suit trial bid(3c) or long one (3d)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He doesn't midjudge many auctions|pg||
nt|athene: monster|pg||
nt|daman: I think 1@H is pretty standard|pg||
nt|aceg: sufficient 16+ unbalanced to bid dbl and after the suit|pg||
nt|cuan: long suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now can make|pg||
nt|iceking: no he doesnt still has it:)|pg||
nt|pelu: if S bid 5@H then only a small @s can defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades and 1 heart|pg||
nt|pelu: D and bid 3@H : I my book forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: even if it was forcing, east might have passed it, since he hasn't got anything :)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the 3rd spade, why not 3NT?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bridge_one: however the players are in the best contract for the hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good morning to the Big Train from USA, aka Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know much about the EW system (if anything) specs, so your guesses are as good as ours|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: entame @d facilite ici|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcphee: i suppose Gullotta hand to dble 5@D|pg||
nt|sommer: so .. maybe W should have kept his mouth shut on 4@D?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if pard bids 3@H freely I think you have to raise don't you?|pg||
nt|sommer: N MAY raise anyway, but would E double?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will make, wasn´t a trump lead best for the defence? I think so|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|doctorone: Hi Walter|pg||
nt|Walddk3: As you all know, Walter is our expert on the Meckwell Precision system. Not sure about French Standard (SEF) :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he is here to learn|pg||
nt|besbes: l entame normale facilite le coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: oui je sais pas ce qui s est passé a l autre table|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: a 5 cartes de la fin il a fait son de 10 de @s en "passant"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: yes 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: even though i like Garozzo 3nt bid, we have to admit 5@C direct would have made things more diffecult for N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess @D were agreed at some stage and 5@H showed 2 A |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could be a chance if enstead of @d j east holds @c J|pg||
nt|april7: not even makable on a @S guess|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps EW plays with some kind of exclusion bids, like earlier Roman club?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rmb1: North needs to do something odd ("unblock" @HQ10 ?) to let South get squeezed and let this make|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice swing for Zaleski in b5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: b4 sry|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would like to see the auction in the last board|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mamos: i'd  expect more from West  but without knowing agreements about 4@D hard to decide who was to blame for the poor slam|pg||
nt|ady: this will be ducked   or taken and spade back|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: probaly they not use 2@S relais to introduce a sgl or void|pg||
nt|cuan: 12 heavy imps for zaleski, when Mariani falls in 3@S on b.20|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hi|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: Putting the @S9 will keep up West's hope of a miracle|pg||
nt|aceg: J@S reverse count probably|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: as long as it doesn't get too artificial i'll be ok  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No worries mate, a spade is a spade in France|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and a pique is a pique|pg||
nt|othered1: that's an odd looking play|pg||
nt|doctorone: that is a strange move by declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: I agree with you, Magnusson - 5@C instead 3Nt would be more difficult for N/S|pg||
nt|athene: lauria might have been going to double 4@H perhaps but certainly never three|pg||
nt|ady: sorry must suck|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psridhar: that sets up the 2nd OT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: hand 4  I tht west might have considered an invite of 4NY    decent 16 with 6 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: duck|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: Board 3 was flat 5@d-3 both tables|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: good day all :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: not a very testing defense|pg||

pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: And we were talking about slam|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry  I meant Id expect more from East  as I  said West had good values|pg||
nt|tomi2: west would open 1@C (16+) with a point more|pg||
nt|tomi2: ah ok|pg||
nt|mamos: inadvertent designation :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty active hands so far|pg||
nt|iceking: 1@H and S cant really enter here unless he overcalls 1@S |pg||
nt|sommer: sure|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@hsx'd is less than 4@ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@H may cost 500:)|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S would have been a tougher contract to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: petie pause ici|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk3: What is the percentage play for only 2 losers in hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW want to avoid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H on for n/s|pg||
nt|aceg: the overcall of 1@H was more easy to process|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: But 3NT is off the @C suit, so @S it is (I guess)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk3: Walter?|pg||
nt|ady: unless 1NT response forcing|pg||
nt|santyclz: I must have missed something.  I thought he had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the doodle bug 2@S|pg||
nt|sommer: almost..|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|athene: some bid 1@S on hands like that south, if they can't bear to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT helps, a slight overbid|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a bit light but i suppose he likes the @D10|pg||
nt|ady: should be easy to reaxh now|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@D will buy it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk3: PO?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i know a few players who would open S hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so this is not real Nightmare|pg||
nt|paulg:  south might double now|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D probably limited here, as i assume they play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|sommer: he MIGHT have had, but possible to set 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like these 2 bids , but never with 2 aces|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as done in OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah yes, I missed the black xruff.|pg||
nt|chick: he got the ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: sry..300 for 2 down|pg||
nt|cuan: X = 4 major + 5 minor or strong in a major|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Cima will raise|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bigtrain: @@HK|pg||
nt|othered1: low to K?|pg||
nt|ady: yes true    east likely to show 2nd suit    so 2@S|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  not sure to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just the 1NT rebid after 1@D opening|pg||
nt|mcphee: dream mare?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl not vuln can be used|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|aceg: good layout in South - agree with 1Nt overcall|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@C = i play in the minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: 6@d c est 3 de chutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @HKZ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Hi Hedy :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni may try 4@D now if it is splinter in his system|pg||
nt|april7: a game try in @S but will stop in 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S = weak NT (or weak NT with 3 card support)|pg||
nt|sommer: very close, but in danger, right?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@D = spades|pg||
nt|aceg: probably the use 4@c for >@h, but, more interesting, 4@h for ... @C ! and 4@s for @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C prefere the minor suit (when minor+4maj)|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@S = strong with 5+@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 2@S was the only contract makable ...|pg||
nt|psridhar: that delayed 2N showing minors helps them locate 3@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: enchere difficile pour Hervé|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: so a double on board 5 would have been worth 8 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = max raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
nt|sommer: he may be able to endplay W somehow|pg||
nt|santyclz: This auction could have started 1@s, 2@h for a disaster.|pg||
nt|sommer: in aggressive sayc or similar, yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Worse in aggressive 2/1.|pg||
nt|athos: si on dit 6@d pour 3 de chute, on tente de gagner 150 contre de temps en temps les decaisser avec 5@h -1|pg||
nt|athos: ça contraste 7@d X :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: d'ailleurs 6@h peut gagner il me semble|pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: yes, NS at the other table made an excellent stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 6@h gagne sur l'impasse au V@s je crois|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm more in need of caffine that i thought|pg||
nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think 2@d can still be a fair 15 points, so West has to do something with a fit|pg||
nt|iceking: if W had a strong @D raise he could have bid 2@S instead of 2nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: oui c ca|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphztt: 1. Kepri 2. Djarum Black 3. Timah Prima 1 4. Djarum Super 5. Timah prima 2 6. well wise |pg||
nt|ady: east very optimistic to bid on over preference to 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is one of the disadvantages, when 1nt response can be up to 10-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Seems like he did the right thing to pass|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: yes he could - I was just asking about 2NT/3@D - what is the diff|pg||
nt|kerasidis: surprise:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i hate those surprises:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: South tries "black on black" - better to play @C6 - declare know @C3 is not @S3 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
nt|sommer: this may still be both a boy or a girl:)|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 2n was not natural or was it?|pg||
nt|cuan: !3 = reverse count|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is for minors|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right Magnusson - with interesting raise in @D 2@S was the best auction for W|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a possibility to defeat is to underplay @cA twice and get 2 @h ruffs|pg||
nt|cuan: @S3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: abd 3@D?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: 2NT showing @s values was not good news for Fantoni|pg||
nt|mcphee: looked a little better to get out a trump|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rmb1: OR played board 5 in 6@C, even less chance of a squeeze with an Ace and a trump to lose (= flat)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like Fantoni is in control here with Nunes describing his hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
nt|athene: he really did that?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
nt|psridhar: Pauncz seems to hv taken a bold but succesful decision then !|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 2@s confirming @h fit and gf hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
nt|sommer: still a "boy":)|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is going down now|pg||
nt|aceg: not the best line to play (:|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He gets 8 before N-S can get 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Why the rush with the clubs??|pg||
nt|athene: win the club in hand and play trumps has to be right|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||
nt|iceking: but here with so much value in the black suits 2nt seems better then 3@D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no point in the minors, so pass at 2Nt seem the right decision by West|pg||
nt|psridhar: that @c 10 is with ace doubleton - give it to versace and 2nt has no play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing in @D can lose also ruff in @S (west don't see all cards)|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3@d is certainly a normal cont that your teammates wont object to - but if u fail in 2N passing pd's attempt at miinors, teammates will be furious :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|santyclz: Not an easy defense at this point.  Maybe a @d honor will still beat it.|pg||
nt|sommer: again NS get a + on "passive" bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: +2 or +5... the small one is the girl:)|pg||
nt|sommer: did W go to smoke..or p?|pg||
nt|mcphee: is west regeretting his decision to not with the first @S?|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw a spade on a club, no rush to pitch diamonds|pg||
nt|psridhar: isnt that the IMP teaam philosophy?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: trust your patrner and underplay @cA twice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: even if the @DAK isn't right|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s3|nt|sommer: the boy..again:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he makes if he plays trumps.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos: not a lot of eexcitement here|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@D and back to the "girl"..I'm glad now, I introduced this Danish saying:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: odd no one tapped dummy with another @H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: nice @c switch|pg||
nt|ady: 3 down is seems|pg||
nt|aceg: distraction, for sure - sufficient to play @H and discard the loser in @S|pg||
nt|psridhar: as different from Match points |pg||
nt|juan lukas: 650 et 4 imps pour l'equipe queran |pg||
pc|s5|nt|psridhar: as cards are may be they are better off in 5@h than slam|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: sorry, EW stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but still -1|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|nt|cuan: lucky diamonds position, for 8 tricks|pg||

nt|bridge_one: i would open 3@D with 2/1 in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must play 4@H on 5-2 here|pg||
nt|iceking: and they will |pg||
nt|pelu: pass from W = 2 card @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can make despite the 5-1 trump break|pg||
nt|sommer: again this 1@D denying MA mainly|pg||
nt|sommer: this may be 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "nebulous" @d which cost earlier when s didn't raise on 5.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: i do actually know players who play 4@c like a leaping michaels over 3@d openings|pg||
nt|iceking: east will bid 3@D now w 4@C or 3@H and east 4@H|pg||
nt|cuan: never with 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: West|pg||
nt|mcphee: wonder what 2@C opening shows|pg||
nt|bridge_one: when choose to open 1@h is know to use gazzilli, so i agree with roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: tout le monde aurait dit 3@s?|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 3@s plein d'allant!|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: maybe to 3N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: do they play forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, by Guermani|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Besides, West is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Buzzoni can't imgaine that partner has this hand when he passed initially|pg||
nt|bessi2: however, 4@s bid was not one I was considering|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S was a bit much after 2@H I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D probably confirm 5@H and ask stop in @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: (oops)  East overcalled 1NT on a worse hand than West's earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks difficult to make|pg||
nt|april7: I think 2NT by E is better but then E would bid 3|pg||
nt|april7: by W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they set hearts they may not get to slam as they will find out that they are off 1 keycard and @HQ|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@s was a good pre-balancing act -but NS progress undeterred|pg||
nt|besbes: il a de mauvaises cartes herve|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When no initial in front of the surname we get the same first name in profiles|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me would ask N to bid 3N with a @H stop|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Any suit quality is overcallable (is that a legitimate word?) in Italy|pg||
nt|athene: since west hasn't promised diamond length|pg||
nt|cuan: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Decision time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 or 6|pg||
nt|psridhar: was 4N key card blackwood for @h or @d ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: one logic is @d was the last agreed suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: with hearts 3-2   should not be problems|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they may not have this agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how the software works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So one of them should have  P GUERMANI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then you can give them different first names in their profiles|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: go for the lead they aren't expecting|pg||
nt|ady: better played by west   but K@D right |pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally KBW in this sequence is for first suit - so @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: doesnt make any diff here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: These guys tend to get more guesses right than the rest of us|pg||
nt|psridhar: but worthwhile discussing with your pd -such 2 suit situation arise often|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S by west was more effective|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk3: OK, so West had to respond 1NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ranking after round 9: http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletAffSPPASClassement|pg||
nt|ady: Fantonie might try ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|ady: hope for K@H with north   or unlikely ace|pg||
nt|ady: should lead to 11 tricks  as Lebel wont risk heart finesse and drop queen doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D is to play 4!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or did I invent a new word?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it's a good idea to pass the South hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No real clues for Versace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is longer in spades than West but shorter in diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: xfer|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by West???|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like all routes lead to 4@h, eventually ... even if South open 3@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because 3 cards in @D can id 3@H West|pg||
nt|psridhar: one clue is E who bid all the way to 4@s is likely to be short in @h...if at all |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: correction, 1. kepri 2. Djarum black 3. Timah prima 1 4. djarum super 5. international 6. timah prima 2 7. well wise 8. wind runner|pg||
nt|sommer: -1 here too for a flat?|pg||
nt|cuan: in 6@H the queen is played in east, in 6@D is the same|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will Versace play E with @hQ or with the hand with longest @h?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk3: Walter taking notes still|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did you translate SEF for a start?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes must have thought Roussel has either 6 @hs or at least AQxxx for his bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ce 10 de @c va poser des pb au déclarant|pg||
nt|juan lukas: la D @c seconde est une bonne nouvelle pour le declarant qui devra cependant ne pas se tromper à @d |pg||
nt|besbes: jeanneteau a surestime ce roi de @d qui pourrait etre inutile|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: declarer has quite a lot of anxieties though|pg||
nt|bessi2: you can say that again.. if you dont have a convention for this sort of hand then just open 1@c|pg||
nt|rmb1: It allows some players to hide their mistakes by saying it was partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he will turn up with a singleton diamond|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: interesting bidding is 3nt - 6@c and E is on the lead....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West choose to bid pass instead 3@H to give 3 cards in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably Versace will choose to play the finesse at Q@h vs East|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W bids 3@s, East can infer that his pd did not o/c over 3@D and pass may be , but in practise i doubt that will happen|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: though even then i am not sure one should cover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: how many short suits will you play him for?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|mamos: and is going off now|pg||
nt|paulg:  West can see that there is little to be gained by declaring the contract himself|pg||
nt|pelu: no but pass sh be  XX in @h not Qx|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|juan lukas: on peut penser que Ouest avec un fit 4eme @h et un singleton @c ne se serait pas contenté de 2@h |pg||
nt|athos: une non entame du singleton @c semble justifiée lorsque les @s sont 41, mais tirer le R@s pour le savoir coure un risque de bcp de levées de chute si tout va mal |pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: hey Jeff :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3 looser in @D are many - if East was with 3@D they are 3 looser for sure - so 3@H by East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: can make overtricks with more in hearts|pg||
nt|juan lukas: bien joué |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: prendre l as de @d permet au declarant de faire l impasse @c (piege!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: le déclarant ne va surement pas se tromper |pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: specs say they get an error message , maybe too many log-ins at once|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: works for me |pg||
nt|paulg:  Garozzo said that there was little to be gained by him declaring it too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rmb1: Even with an initial "J Hackett" is ambiguous|pg||
nt|psridhar: he might hv @s count on lead |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will get it wrong after East's 4@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fann4: Hullo Hedy:)|pg||
nt|sommer: I dont hope, we offend anyone to remind you, these players are not Fantunes, Versace or similar!!|pg||
nt|athos: Ouest n a pas joué le 10 dans 10x (le declarant n a pas de raison de faire le buffalo), et lorsqu on decouvre les @s 32, pourquoi l'entame @h si 10@c sec ?|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Oui et surtout pourquoi pas de surenchère à 3@h en Ouest s'il a effectivement une distribution 3451|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Bonjour à tous :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: Hervé demande à Stretz la signification de 3@h|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Like Martens-Jassem, playing two different systems depending on vulnerability|pg||
nt|chick: would a first trick duck of the heart have helped?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North would not bid 6@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Roland but interesting...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but with @hK instead of @hQJx...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with QJ on @H would be more difficult to choose between pass and 3@H|pg||

nt|harmon: he makes either way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like overcallable better than worth an overcall|pg||

nt|ady: will east be tempted here|pg||
nt|bessi2: problem with a 6@c gamble is that east with ace or king of @h will lead there for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not fond of 3NT as a solid minor either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If NT is the spot, it's often wrong-sided|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to 3NT  EW|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H here or 3NT? west might prefer notrumps with 4333|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Around 68%|pg||
nt|bigtrain: just doesn't make|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ritong: taking into account the fact that interferences will occur less frequently when opps are vulnerable|pg||
nt|hedyg: he actually opened 3NT and bid 4@d over pd's 4@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or as Fred Gitelman says, only open 3NT if you do NOT want to play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S is good for that hand type, transfer pre-empt|pg||
nt|cuan: gazzilli now ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: In other words, use it for something else|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I'd like to get it into Webster's|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@H misplayed here? - in OR 4@H also down 1 - @C-lead and decl played @H in trick 2 - ducked and @H to A - @C again and decl has used @cA in trick 1 - so now endplayed ...|pg||
nt|pelu: in dummy :(:(|pg||
mb|1S|nt|doctorone: a good bad 2N would be welcome here, allowing W to bid a constructive 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: poor slam with 2 key cards missing    but could be made seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|mamos: defence would have five tricks then  i think|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@C must be intermediate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a little more that 68%, there are also the figure of KQJ in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: oh my, 3@D not my cup of tea here|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@C = natural or any 15+, not 5-5 or 6-4 with a minor|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: Nunes cannot open 1@d there ; his system requires stronger hand for that|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table s bid 2@c and finding the @ds was simple.  |pg||
nt|chick: why intermediate?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: This can now make on a @D guess.|pg||
nt|mcphee: but it sure worked well|pg||
nt|ady: hand 6  4@H also down 1    wom first club in wrong hand   1st round of trumps ducked  and ended a trick short|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thats what David said|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: 5@D is fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes top tricks in defense are the most difficult to cash often:)|pg||
nt|chick: so the same|pg||
nt|mamos: difficult for South|pg||
nt|april7: on finding the Q of @H, 4@H or 3NT should make|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, NS avoided their 8 card club fit on board 6 and played in !3D with J9xx op 1087|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it surely is not pre-emptive is it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
nt|chick: I would stay strong|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@D = 8+ hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: yes ruff 3 @cs and ace drops for a @D discard|pg||

nt|psridhar: and leading pd's suit is no sin|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but isn´t a @d lead natural from N without a @d bid from S?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The first club must be won by South|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: can u pl explain the bidding :)|pg||
nt|athene: that's what i said way back when|pg||
nt|athene: ok, i guess once east shows majors, west is too worried about clubs to contemplate notrumps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sometimes there is a squeeze if @sA is together with the long @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@c relais|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: ruff 2 clubs   lose 1   first|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT = onesuiter not 3@H|pg||
nt|athos: 3 communications dispo pour Nord pour jouer atout |pg||
nt|malpaluche: Le déclarant doit, avec l'As de Trèfle mal placé, parvenir à faire 5 levée d'atout et 3 levées de @h.. pas clair ce coup-là|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|fann4: Declarer will likely draw 2 trumps and play on @C, hoping for some clues.|pg||

nt|vugraphzxg: ou un @c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: 9 tricks even without the Q of @H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tomi2: he could lead the @Cq to give west the chance to cover|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|malpaluche: oui|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psridhar: however guessing dia is no easy task|pg||
nt|fann4: Which the defence are unlikely to give him - and so he may well play the overcaller for the @DA.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: never saw Garozzo to play a bridge so linear :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: but different strokes I guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: 1NT wide ranging, 2@C artificial, 2NT 11-12 balanced (I'm guessing :))|pg||
nt|sommer: I find the 3@c bid "strange", at least|pg||
nt|psridhar: well slam can make if @c ace is led :)|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: 4@s by South with A@H is a little conservative|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Or  J97|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he 300 on board 5 cost Angelini 5 IMPs. 5@C undoubled in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We are back!|pg||

nt|sommer: wouldnt some be afraid of missing a lay-down 3N with the 3@C bid?|pg||
nt|mcphee: west has the goodies|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now that's a good 11-count  :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing spades rather than a second trump will gain on some layouts and lose on others|pg||
nt|po-s: remarkable stop - couldn´t South hold C ace and D king?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria drew trumps, tested diamonds and led a club up. 11 tricks|pg||
nt|cuan: lucky choice this time|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mamos: not much for anyone here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easier for us|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h or 4?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: according to KNR 20.30  :)|pg||
nt|sommer: wonder what KR mean about that:)|pg||
nt|athene: of course 3-2 trumps more likely than 3-3 spades but that's not the whole story|pg||
nt|athene: because you are ok if someone ruffs from the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|malpaluche: L'équipe Quéran a tout de même pris 16 points d'avance avec ces "petits" coups|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lamongie might try 2NT at his next turn|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I assume Lamongie will do something spectacular soon|pg||
nt|doctorone: indeed, or 2@d|pg||
nt|ritong: highly unusual after an initial pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @c honour...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3.5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s because 2@h is probably a constructive raise and he is not strong enough for that|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C probably final contract here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||
nt|sommer: hmmm..I got 20 only|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@D = 5+@D GF|pg||
nt|athos: si le systeme le permet le reveil  2@d est il possible ? |pg||
nt|juan lukas: 3SA gagne .................en EO :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cima should balance after 2@H pass pass|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|pelu: do NS play 4 card @H-opening? - the normal bid in S would be 2@H not 1@s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: make sure you put in all the spots|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: pretty soft minimum for forcing to game|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||
nt|iceking: and S will defend i would assume with all his values in @C|pg||
nt|april7: is is probably upset, thats why he passed|pg||
nt|sommer: good!|pg||
nt|chick: overboard now in either suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South won't save but North??|pg||
nt|mcphee: S finally has them where he wants them|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psridhar: W hand tempting though|pg||
nt|ady: also if spades 4-2   likely to lose 3 trump tricks and a spade even with trumps breaking|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|doctorone: N will support @d |pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S not enough in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 3N with 2 balanced hands and 28pts|pg||
nt|cuan: 2NT = asks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inverted minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @D fit was never shown|pg||
nt|psridhar: opposite 1@D opg that West hand looks tempting to me for slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have tried 4@D here on the way to 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well you are ok if you can draw precisely 2 rounds of trumps then leave someone with a boss trump and go for spade ruff|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: Those black aces look good|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Partner came in vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: West has great cards|pg||
nt|fann4: At least 11 tricks on the expected @S lead.|pg||
nt|fann4: In fact, declarer will make 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i cant believe Laffineur chose not to support Diamonds !|pg||
nt|mcphee: why would E bid again?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl means to choose between @h and @S|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@D = 3 cards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|april7: no problems here, all ways lead to success|pg||
nt|pelu: why not ducj trick 1 here?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would overcall 2@D with Garozzo's cards. I think it's a clear pass|pg||
nt|athene: but letting them draw a third trump might indeed be a bit bad |pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    9 |pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
nt|iceking: clear pass agree|pg||
nt|sommer: wrong singleton in W:)|pg||
nt|athene: couldn't east double 2@H?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H natural 3th suit - so stop|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|doctorone: would you try a 2@s (@s & a minor) opening as E if available in your system?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: they are not|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh reading it the wrong way|pg||
nt|kerasidis: he is upset too it seems:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky diamond position|pg||
nt|psridhar: with no entry in E this can make-@d king is doubleton inside as well|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iceking: many here in europe though would respond 1NT with S hand not 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lucky 3nt with no entry on E|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: 3 key cards, 5 card support and 15 hcp ...what more required to show that @d support i wonder|pg||
nt|cuan: 3@H is rel for 5 or 6 spades. 3NT = 5@S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also, he led it with his left hand; that's a singleton|pg||
nt|chick: there is only one play for this hand (and it doesn't work) .... lead the @DJ and hope that S covers with Hxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very lucky on two consecutive boards|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: ??? another @s from S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|othered1: I like east's actions|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|chick: yes, Hx, thanks everyone :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: ah you play that too? :)|pg||
nt|april7: y, but if W ducks a @H to N, then its ok|pg||
nt|pelu: Paolo will be more upset now :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wish i could see him now!:)|pg||
nt|athene: near-max for passed hand; both minors; spade tolerance|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bridge_one: agree Roland with pass, but few pair would overcall at 2@d|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot commit his side to the 3 level with that collection|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good idea to use 3@h not natural but a time to know the number of @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: That goes with being good I suppose|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: no desire to let opps have it in 2@H :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like 4@s is a better cont seeing only NS cards -but here @s are 5-1 and 3nt in real life is the winner|pg||
nt|athos: s'il trouve l'As @h en, Nord alors AR@h A@s et A@c => R@d en Ouest |pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: his partner merely overcalled|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|psridhar: perhaps 2@s is the popular cont as far as values are concerned :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|iceking: reason there plan is to show week @H raise as 2@H  direct shows some values like 8-10hcp|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT+1 on board 8 in OR (no "throw-in" ?)|pg||
nt|athene: well, you don't always have to go to the 3-level; you might be ok in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it's a bit pushy|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: no details to bd 8 OR in movie so we will never know how or why|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: weak |pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: if 2@S allows for 5 mediocre @S and 6 fine @C, 2@S would be a consideration, but does it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club continuation and 2 down|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, D from East would give a perfect picture of his hand|pg||

mb|2D|an|FM|nt|tomi2: if south had covered the first one, they could play two more rounds of trumps, when they gained the lead back. this way they played only 2 rounds of spades in the defense|pg||
nt|athene: the italian style is that these show good hands, in my experience|pg||

nt|ritong: more a matter of players than system|pg||
nt|po-s: if not else so for the lead - bet he regrets his pass now|pg||
nt|ady: light 3rd hand opening form west|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3@c for EW|pg||
nt|april7: 3@D by S|pg||
nt|ady: north may sac in 4@S   and find himself making it|pg||

mb|p|nt|po-s: not by East though|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then the 1S opg didnt succeed spectacularly either here|pg||
nt|fann4: Me too, but the French style, more than others, I've noticed, is not to open 1NT with a 5 card major in many instances.|pg||

nt|daman: whack|pg||

nt|athene: he is as balanced as he could be|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fann4: Right Hedy, thanks, I overlooked the bidding sequence.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT is a general gametry|pg||
nt|psridhar: if u open 1@s with a good 15 hcp and get raised to 2@s, i suppose u will bid more|pg||
nt|april7: but E has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 16, not 15|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: this looks destined for down 1 on competent defense|pg||
nt|sommer: @S10 in S is gold as @D10 in N|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@D = transfer with 4+@H. 3@H = 9 cards in @S and @H (4-5 or 5-4). 3@S = 3@S, perhaps 3@H. 3NT = 5@H+4@S|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@H is either no major with a maximum, or 4 hearts with min|pg||
nt|psridhar: the red suits lying well for 3N tho Fossi may insert the @h queen when Lauria pplays a @h to dummy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: the opening 1@S bid kept NS out of a very unpleasant 4@S contract they might have reached|pg||

nt|vugraphztt: oh, lawan timah prima|pg||
nt|ady: must have been heart to the king|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2@s was the limit of the hand-tough to pass after 1s-2s|pg||
nt|fann4: Shows you - Multon opened 1NT in the OR.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2NT here by W meant : we are vulnerable pd, are you sure we dont have game?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Letting 4@H through on 24 cost 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|athene: that's why west bid on, i would imagine|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and in the ghestem always the exclusion os suit bid|pg||
nt|athene: the double fit syndrome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally some cards for E-W|pg||
mb|1N|nt|doctorone: Interesting. E may have a "slight" bidding problem over 1@d 1@s here, as double would show 4 @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well wait|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you make it if you guess which finesse to take|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14+ f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: and maybe Roussel didnt get the right message|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am told 2N was showing a strong NT hand with 5@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: E had denied so much as 10 hcps or a good 9 by not bidding drury|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are in slam here you must choose 6@S rather than 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: reasonable 6@S, not clear they will find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is there any way to make 6@s? cannot see it|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks cold to me Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is with @S10 singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 6@S is on|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fann4: The irony is that the 1NT contract in the OR is going to go more than 1 down. There's no justice:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still OK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: timah prima 2|pg||
nt|mcphee: I like the 1NT opening:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well I supposed a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no idea re 2NT but I don't like it|pg||
nt|athene: nice 3nt for north when his partner opens 2@H? :)|pg||
nt|daman: a full blooded 17 HCP|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H not nearly as good|pg||
nt|daman: South should bailout in 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: Borth can make 9 tricks in no-trumps    but wont play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club the ace and a diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  unlucky  should be down 1    likely to be bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ natural, or 15+ balanced |pg||
nt|fann4: Does this 4@S show 5 of them, or just a good hand with maybe 4@S? Tough for N.|pg||
nt|april7: slam try!!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will they reach slam here?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet if north had opened 2@H Lauria would have bid 3nt|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @C lead need to play the finesse in @D and play for @D 3/3 or 2@D without K in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: un 3sa de tout repos :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphztt: kepri|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 3NT either|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose it was for @C|pg||
nt|bessi2: and why on earth didn't east try to go for the penalty|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes seems 500 was available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a slam on a finess and a @c lead is needed to defeat|pg||
nt|april7: not only try, N will be inn 6 going 1 dfown unfortunately|pg||
nt|athene: if south had sorry|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they want a better suit than A108xxx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you can unblock the hearts and come back with a diamond ruff to pitch a losing club. Only losing to @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: maybe "should"|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt this shows 5@ss for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has 2 golden cards @c king and @h ace-certainly worth a thought for slam in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 15-17?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: if so, S MIGHT invite with two 5-carder|pg||
nt|santyclz: K&R was with me last hand, they valued that at 3.45|pg||
nt|juan lukas: bonne entame mais DV de @d secs ne permettront pas d'en profiter |pg||
nt|malpaluche: pour toi peut-être mais le déclarant lui ne voit pas DV de @d secs placés :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: oui , le coup va s améliorer, pour l instant que 7 levées|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and Q@D protecting form being tapped out as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: but he did well passing 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: as far as he knows they are in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: and yes J9X in trumps |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think that 1D-X showed @h ..dont they play trf there?|pg||
nt|fann4: Hedy, how many boards in this set?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13|pg||
nt|fann4: Thanks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 13 more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use 2@h more strong|pg||
nt|daman: reach for the stars|pg||
nt|ady: yes  game would be reached if south elects to open|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S any invitation i would guess|pg||
nt|pelu: and then he can sit and wait a long time :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d conventional - i use this with 4+@s|pg||
nt|malpaluche: le jeu naturel du déclarant est sans doute de commencer par jouer @h pour le valet, pour gagner déjà avec AD placés|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: board 8 was the first positive NS score for Garozzo in this match. Lots of players dreamt of playing (maybe even rubber) against Garozzo and scoring 7 positive scores in a row for ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 40 years ;)|pg||
nt|april7: now S will be afraid to bid 4@S, otherwise N might go on|pg||
nt|kerasidis: no way now|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt and upwards wld be transfers, forcing to game|pg||
nt|athene: if they are playing lauria-versace|pg||
nt|athene: come on Lauria bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S ask - 2Nt 4333 max|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so now pass|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|pelu: so Lauria dont know that pd has a 6 card suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: well, if he has shown his hand, logically, he should pass|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: surprised south made another bid after 2@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mamos: another tricky hand|pg||
nt|mamos: bad breaks in both minors |pg||
nt|tomi2: and in hearts too. only spades could split worse|pg||
nt|mamos: which minor to start with?|pg||
nt|mamos: nothing will work as it happens|pg||
nt|athene: but still if south has followed an invitational sequence...he does have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can try the game ... |pg||
nt|pelu: by passing S just placed himself between 2 chairs :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk3: Chemla will be disappointed to see partner follow to two rounds of hearts at some point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can you make 3NT on a heart lead?|pg||
nt|april7: how could Lauria stay out of slam with 20 P???|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psridhar: this is an easy 450 for Fantoni |pg||
nt|tomi2: playing south for Hx in @D seems a good chance. you lwad J now and if its covered you win the ace and play towards the 10. if not, you lose to north and you can play the ace later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping to pin the other honor|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: around 25 percent|pg||
nt|athene: well he did get lauria to play it, which never hurt anyone|pg||
nt|juan lukas: oui mais par la suite il n'aura pas d'autre choix que jouer @d tot ou tard |pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: the 3@d bid was too much imo, very encouraging|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would lead to 4@D tricks, 1@S 2@h and 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk3: Like now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a push perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: Clubs alone wasnt going to produce enough tricks  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|april7: y, but after BW showing 1 ace might stop in 5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will count in @h finnese|pg||
nt|ralfwil: want to hear 5@h - or?|pg||
nt|april7: Blqackwood|pg||
nt|april7: I mean after all its  more than 50%, because of the lead|pg||
nt|sommer: N went down in 3NT in OR before|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can block the @H suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A10xx  is enough|pg||
nt|april7: I mean even with the @C lead its 50%|pg||
nt|sommer: good duck!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is not a magician|pg||
nt|athene: but still 3nt was where it's at|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: yes, he didn't take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|chick: I was thinking his coach will have to have a word with him :)|pg||
nt|athene: as usual with 4333 hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: last chance to stay out|pg||
nt|daman: a pinball wizard|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malpaluche: bon déjà 9 levées au chaud|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: ca y est il l a vu :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: very difficult decision, but should bid 6 in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very poor game. There was no reason to go beyond the 2-level with South's cards|pg||
nt|daman: I would have been happy to play it in 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: no, i would say the usual action over 1nt with south is to bid 2@D and then if partner super-accepts, you have a think|pg||
nt|daman: South was trying to get something from nothing|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you see if he makes 2@H|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|ady: laria trying for an end play   wont work|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malpaluche: Je me demande comment Jean-Gilles Hervé avait l'intention de continuer si rien n'était venu sur la première levée de @d|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|april7: now 2 down|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: he will take his best shot and hope for @D ace to be onside|pg||
pc|h5|nt|malpaluche: Il a compris, d'après les 2 premières levées, que la longue à @s était en Est à mon avis. Dès lors il semble logique de jouer @h pour enlever à Est sa reprise éventuelle|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: he sh know that @CA and @hK out - but pd could have @CA - then a slam on finess after 2 Kings|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|po-s: sleepy East not covering the club|pg||
nt|daman: unl;ess there is a misdefense|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|doctorone: which may explain declarer's play of the Q :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C is the key|pg||
nt|ady: tht he would ruff outt spades and exit with a club in xase of some miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @C in West|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but also the 9 of @S is good, if unblock the 10 by East|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3 rounds of spades now, after that pitch from east|pg||
nt|pelu: if now @SJ to Q and K East has to unblock @s10 |pg||
nt|ady: surely at this point  just play for A@D right|pg||
nt|daman: 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he might have some weird tell on the @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unless East has kept Q109|pg||
nt|athene: either a discard or just a feel :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: interesting deals ,,the French sure have a good program in their dealing m/c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: one off may gain imps|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - no @CA - then a RD after the D of 4@c - so for sure Lauria sh know that the slam is max 50%|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playoing also a big mistake by East - it was easy to unblock the Q@S|pg||
nt|athene: well, "easy" is a mild overbid|pg||
nt|athene: findable, maybe :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: Declarer may have figured out though that E held 4@c as he held only 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sommer: so a little bit of my prediction came true:)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: agree peter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 11 tricks for E/W - no swing here|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Surprenant que les NS de la salle ouverte n'aient pas surenchéri sur 3@h|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: 4@H likely to be reached|pg||
nt|ady: hard to explain to team mates however if A@D is right and you go down|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphztt: ur wlc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can make 4@S without a diamond guess|pg||
nt|pelu: on the 5-5 in black - S in OR bid 5@s over 5@H = 7 IMP fpr Zaleski|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW must avoid 3NT here. It goes down on a diamond lead. 4@S is OK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt raise inviting|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A flat hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course this is a rapid playback|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: But West will likely lead @DK, so ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would have bid 2@C as E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S after 2@C isn't strong hand, of course|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But the odds is with a @d finess, because you cannot afford a 3-1 split in @s and still have entries for a @c discard|pg||
mb|d|nt|po-s: Maybe declarer should have guessed (in spite of no cover). West opened 1 diamond, had shown four hearts and 3 spades - If East has four diamonds he might have bid 3 diamonds - or ...|pg||
nt|po-s: not doubled to start with|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no choice, since 2@d would probably show @hs|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will lose a trick each to 3 key cards |pg||
nt|malpaluche: Un bon cas pour la convention de la collante, qui permet de découvrir facilement le fit 5-3 à @s ici|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no, just pattern-showing for most people|pg||
nt|athos: 2@s est il expliqué (4@h et des @d moches p-ê ?....) ??|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Décision très délicate pour Yves Jeanneteau ici|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: uh oh,,,,,,,,,,,,someone thought a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: without a club lead   could make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: and someone thought stayman:)|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose he could have hoped for a singleton honor in E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt forcing (in 2/1 style)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about that, Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on board 27!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: It's extremely unlikely N would underlead an ace in this position, but what can it cost declarer to try the K?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd10 Multon managed down 1 for a push|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S also on bd 11 in the OR.|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria was told @DA in East - first discard @D3|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best     but not much problem in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: minor lead possible; leading 4-card suit when dummy has 4 is rarely going to set up that many tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but his spades do have good texture so i suppose maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: S know that @Cs are very well placed for decl - so he has to find a activ attack|pg||
nt|athene: certainly this lead gives declarer a nasty moment|pg||
nt|athos: comment jouez vous 2@s dans votre partenariat ? |pg||
nt|malpaluche: eh oui, c'est logique de nommer 3SA avec son jeu.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  by an operator with a good memory!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nothing to loose if cover|pg||
nt|april7: now S will make 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT in OR: @cJ to King and @C back - easy make|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Le partenaire pourrait bien demander l'arrêt Coeur dans cette séquence|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|othered1: Anyone for passing 2@C?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so much for K@D lead:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd like to see the play after a top club and a trump switch|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: moi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know. There is a risk that the 3rd diamond will be overruffed as pointed out by more specs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: except Multon went -1 on 1NT while Laffineur went -1 on 4 @S :p|pg||
nt|fann4: so what's the best play here for 1 loser in trumps?|pg||
nt|jkotor: A:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: flip a coin|pg||
nt|psridhar: guessing a finesse is the right play here-2 small singletons vs 2 honors with N , so play of ace is slightly inferior play|pg||
nt|psridhar: issue is only when N has stiff @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 singletons are possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: two small |pg||
nt|jkotor: and 4-0 is only 1 distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: two honors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: maybe not   can set up spades without using an entry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing minimum 3@S and 1@c need to play for @C 3/3|pg||
nt|ady: I said no problem    but may have to play for clubs 3-3  other wise in danger of going down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: it might be right to rise the ace there trying to block them if lauria has Kx or Qx or something?|pg||
nt|besbes: 4@s etait plus dur a battre|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: better - then @sJ is an entry|pg||
nt|april7: for double finesse in @H|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just going against the odds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|doctorone: me 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: one small card already appeared|pg||
nt|pelu: or a discard on @cQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fann4: According to Suitplay, the 10 is best. I'm having a look at it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think the spade finesse is percentage|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|po-s: 2clubs might have been artificial (some kind of Gazilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not so interested any more|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably only 10 tricks, bec North duck A@C|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|ritong: i strongly doubt it|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: as spec says could do it double dummy   spade finesse on the way|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: If 2@C conventional, all bets are off|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only wit 2-2 in @s and on side|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: several people are telling me that the risk-reward ratio favors going down rather than take the finesse and risk a bigger loss|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: gazzilli is even more unpopular than big @c overhere:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is imps, why take the risk?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't try the finesse in @H otherwise risk to lose 3@S 1@h aqnd A@C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|po-s: yes, EW might be immigrants|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Then he makes 13|pg||

nt|capercliff: 2@c|pg||
nt|Walddk3: This is not an auction you will find in many textbooks|pg||

nt|capercliff: not forcing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzxf: no|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Then change the system!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk3: Do not redouble with hands where you know that you will have to bid a 7-5 hand much later |pg||

nt|baardolav: No standard system is designed for hands like that:) |pg||
nt|sybarra: I have suggestions that perhaps, you just bid 6 @C |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: and agree Baard, no system is designed for the "freak" hands |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Start by ignoring the double and bid as if there had been a pass is what I suggest |pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|mc|13|nt|Walddk3: Thankfully, many agree with me|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree just bid its a simple method|pg||

nt|doctorone: There are cases for a 2@c rebid in SEF with 3 only, where u have @s in a balanced hand 15-17|pg||

nt|Walddk3: But it will probably be banned before it's introduced|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this segment now|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thanks to our excellent operator in Paris, Quentin! To my talented co-commentators David Edwin, Ralf Willquist and of course Roland Wald for donating their time to guide us through ...|pg||
nt|hedyg: these boards !Finally thanks to the Federation Francaise de Bridge for their support, especially to Claude Dadoun  who was instrumental in organising these broadcasts |pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT  contract for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 42 minutes|pg||
nt|jkotor: to avoid guess when 3-1, normal play is A@s first :)|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Voilà d'la donne|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: 1@D by east|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Garozzo on his way out of the Italian Cup in the Round of 16?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: wow nice hands unfortunatly with no aces|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice distribution on S1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly against the "make vul games at imps" meme.|pg||
nt|chick: The formula is ... settle for -1 scores -100 ... take the finesse for 75% x -400 +25% x +600 = -175  |pg||
nt|sommer: thats what I meant by my very first remarc, but stiff honor is only 2,4% and even with 5-6 @S, it only adds to maybe 4%. IF the finesse loses to @DJ, he's 4 down ..thats what you ...|pg||
nt|sommer: must consider in a short thinking period|pg||
nt|sommer: ..per H|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Le 2@s de Stretz sur la main précédente Guillaume était plutot naturel pour moi dans cette séquence|pg||
nt|juan lukas: 6@c gagne sur une hereuse repartition des @c |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: e/w have 2 4-4 fits in majors   but no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how  many @S with north?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: they have 25 HCP here , but what game can they make? 4@h?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not many boards left to recover|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 16 is the last board|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i tried the real time connection with federbridge, but don't work|pg||
nt|chick: stiff honor in a specific hand is only 1.2%|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 x 1,2|pg||
nt|chick: ah right, 2 honors|pg||
nt|sommer: guess both Q and J works:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: zero|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||
nt|mcphee: hmmm would not have thought of 1N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But still 5 comparisons missing, so maybe the match is closer than we think|pg||
nt|othered1: @C is the NS spot but not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-ruff will defeat 4@S - and on a @D-lead: @C to ruff, DQ and @D ruffed in N = down 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: So it's the fact that losing the finesse means -4 rather than -2 which makes the difference.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H by NS and a good save by EW in 5@S, S might underlead @H for a @C ruff, but still only 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now, with 14, pass (instead before choose 1Nt) - this depending on layout of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-12 not compared yet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a michael's or a ghestem would be more easy here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in South|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is just barely in my Michaels range.  Still 3@C not easy to find.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: new suit at level 3 must be 5 cards - so pass by north now|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Le choix n'était pas gai pour JG Hervé pour sa première enchère : 1@s ou XX, come 2@c ne serait pas forcing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: yes, K97 not nearly as good as a stopper as Q10xx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ouch, board 10 cost Angelini 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: -100  against  -175 is small imps.   making the contract is big imps.  that matters, too|pg||
nt|athene: and @SJx is bad too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The difference now is that partner is a passed hand and LHO is not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT would be suicidal|pg||
nt|besbes: peut etre que la couleur ne sera nommee qu une fois|pg||
nt|malpaluche: franchement je n'aurai pas commencé par nommer une autre couleur que les @c quand j'en ai 7 par ARD.. mais 1@s a  ses avantages aussi|pg||
nt|juan lukas: ds l'autre salle , les @c n'ont meme pas été nommés une seule fois :)|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Remarque, dans l'autre salle, JP Meyer n'a pas nommé la couleur une seule fois|pg||
nt|malpaluche: pardon JL :)|pg||
nt|besbes: surcontre bizarre est surement mieux|pg||
nt|athos: je préfère 2@h à 3@h au deuxieme tour d'enchere de Nord, les @d me semblent des levée utiles quel que soit l atout...non ? |pg||
nt|malpaluche: Après une ouverture majeure, les Texas sont de plus en plus à la mode derrière le X adverse, car ils permettent de nommer naturellement sa couleur, que l'on soit faible ou fort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: l arbitre est appelé par Stretz|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: pour la longue éflexion de Hervé|pg||
mb|4C|nt|juan lukas: personnellement je ne dispose pas de l'enchère de 3@h a la premiere redemande de l'ouvreur : ce serait pour moi un super forcing fitté @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
nt|sommer: ... maybe you should see it as losing 7 to your "safe-playing" opp but winning 12!|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||
nt|ady: this should just make|pg||
nt|ady: couuld do one better in spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: no plus score here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, for E-W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: suicide....|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR S also passed the 2@H opening - but after 1NT 2@D - 2@H he passed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|ritong: pham plays weird today  maybe the spotlights are in cause|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Has to guess which suit breaks 3-3 for his 7th trick|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could easily go more than 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although he can take 8 tricks with all cards in view|pg||
nt|mcphee: i predict he will |pg||
nt|juan lukas: hum ...... c pas le meilleur des contrats que ce 5@d |pg||
nt|malpaluche: C'est devenu impossible pour Sud, après cette réponse d'1@s, de faire comprendre à son partenaire qu'il voulait jouer à @c coute que coute|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
nt|ady: stopped in 2@H in OR on hand 11   woth 5 imps|pg||
nt|malpaluche: A@s et @s le mort est mort |pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: boards 10 is typical in bridge competition - 8 cards in a major where the roght contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bridge_one: not roght|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not moi|pg||
nt|othered1: No, since game possbilities are still live|pg||
nt|doctorone: ouff :)|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes playing for 3-3 club or doubleton honor    but not joy|pg||
nt|besbes: !p etait mieux|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: So it would be an average of losing 7 3 times vs winning 12 once.  A -9 imp long-term position.|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Jeanneteau pense qu'il va tabler..|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy i am sure ...and usually Fantoni plays double dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: still uptrick on a spade return|pg||
pc|s6|nt|doctorone: maybe a second double over 2@s now ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: Last board|pg||
nt|chick: I agree if you are up 30 in the match, better to play safe|pg||
nt|athos: le problème de XX c'est qu'on laisse à EO de l'espace pour nommer des @h, même après 1@d X XX 1@h p 2@h, on a pas encore decrit grand chose |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jkotor: W squeezed?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: cash clubs and diamond switch  and down 1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d-@s|pg||
nt|malpaluche: mais les @d 5-1 et les @c 4-2 vont avoir raison de lui|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

nt|psridhar: OT no more , squeeze broken|pg||
nt|hedyg: well now he does|pg||
nt|pelu: the @C-ruff just cost decl a trick - but if @S also 4-1 then could be correct|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Could play for K10x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is not a good contract but it may make. However, I doubt they will get that high|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@H = 5@H+4/5minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Pass?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Garozzo not wishing to encourage his partner or the opposition, I know many who would bid 2@s|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@s deny game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but they are there....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many in Italy use dbl with 17 hcp, but with only 2@C and K sgl in @S 2@H is more correct|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if South could bid a natural 2NT?|pg||
nt|reisig: S couldn't try 2N?|pg||
nt|pelu: ??? dis East open 1@C???|pg||
nt|juan lukas: tres bon resultat en salle ouverte : Tignel n'a pas ouvert de 1SA et la paire s'est arrétée à bon port |pg||
pc|d6|nt|april7: its a transfer system probably|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not likely after the 3@D call|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: a normal bidding for NS - not for EW|pg||
nt|ady: now to the test|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: makeable with open cards|pg||
nt|april7: best contract by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: the problem here is, you cant say "50% either or, he will go for the 25% fin"...I THINK|pg||
nt|cuan: X = heart raise and game try|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S asks   of kings; 5N would be the first specific suit ask (the order changes depending upon the bidding -- bid suits have higher priority than unbid suits)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps E can find it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We shal see now|pg||
nt|athene: it might come down to getting a count on south|pg||
nt|athene: do you play clubs to try to count his hand, assuming diamonds are 7-3?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but West has pretty good cards now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: the tempo has been quick    this auction probably already the slowest of the match   not sure quite why|pg||
nt|pelu: more IMPs comming for Pauncz - stopped in 3@H on the 3NT hand (@Cs 3-3)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 3@d by south, because need to no lose @S, more easy to find 2 @S in South that in North ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: opposite spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|malpaluche: oui le bon jugement de Jérémie va rapporter 5 points à son équipe|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: And two bullets outside|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcphee: good shift|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry -- was private|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, many player bid 2@S in East - the police for East must be: if i bid 2@S i think to beat 4@H - so pass it is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends if he can get count in clubs'|pg||
nt|ady: there looks and end play for down 2 in 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: well if you find south with 1 trump and only 2 hearts, then u play him for 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South could have 3 spades and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 1 trump and only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but even then you have the choice of pinning the @S10 or double finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you know spades are 3-2, then you put the king with south and you are left with 2-2 so it's even, isn't it?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AJxxxx and Kxx in @D , north would bid 4@D or 4@c ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course none of that will apply since south does have the two spades :)|pg||
nt|po-s: down one I guess|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: You can make 10 tricks with all cards in view but I doubt that you will|pg||

pc|s8|nt|athene: would be a shame to run into a club ruff though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chick: I guess the other table play makes some sense, because he goes for the smaller set and still has that additional small chance of singleton honor or doubleton QJ|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: I can not see any defence errors that can make 3nt here... It will go down. Even hearts are blocked |pg||

nt|mamos: 13 on a finesse |pg||
nt|mamos: ive been wrong before but I'll be amazed if they dont bid slam here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like 3nt is the only game here on NS|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is 4@H the final spot|pg||
nt|paulg:  that will probably be 6 or 7 imps for Angelini, but they need more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt in South, i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He still has 2 entries to dummy if South does not follow to the 3rd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh well, the play was not as indicated|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 140 scored|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 10 in @d and not A|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I NEVER believe anyone :)|pg||
nt|athene: a wise policy :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: I think the only question is whether they will risk the grand, normally should not when on a finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes - @sAK is well placed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but may be , playing with Lauria, to give the right count ...|pg||
nt|athene: not even when they show out in a suit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuan: ah, ok now. @D Ace is a mistake|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kerasidis: @h trf to @s?|pg||
nt|harmon: Thats all fine but when you take it 3 hands later and 50 kibs complain to me I thot I shd say somethg cuase you losing them|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: on verry small values there are 10 tricks in @s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: 2@C may be some sort of artificial game force|pg||
nt|reisig: well - I hate 1NT ...but who am I?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D no majors - probably no stop in @C, otherwise pass|pg||
nt|sommer: ahh..not the last 1300:)|pg||
nt|chick: Hmm, judging by the kib comments I was getting, a lot of them are as fascinated as I am by it|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 4@S was a walk in the park anyway|pg||
nt|juan lukas: tout va mal pour EO sur cette donne mais ils auront bien du mal a eviter le contrat de 4@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: cards on place:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@S prob = 3 card support|pg||
nt|reisig: well ..maybe then :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now we are sure about the precision by E/W|pg||
nt|athene: south has a good hand in a way|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ralfwil: and you are right!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: convinient @s 2-2 and @c under AQ|pg||
nt|sommer: I got a lot too|pg||
nt|psridhar: with both Red queens in..Versace may escape for d1 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: best lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|Walddk4: Yes, 1827:1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The Yarborough|pg||
nt|athene: right, good for getting that £1000|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No card higher than a 9 spot|pg||
nt|ady: game was missed on hand 12 in OR  where 2NT made on spade lead so 5 imps Paunc     very close now|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT was made|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: dont push your luck Paolo :) - pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: This ..has a play |pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead looks more natural, since surely declarer will have four spades on this auction?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: presumably North is relaying and South showing|pg||
nt|athos: la decision de jéremie me semble applicable uniquement lorsque on sait que les defenses lachent une levée par an|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i'm not a huge fan either as you have lots of tricks, but they've ended up in the best spot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|malpaluche: est-ce que Jérémie a jugé de ne pas ouvrir sa main en Ouest dans l'autre salle ? Ce garçon a l'air d'avoir plein de bonnes idées..|pg||
nt|athos: vous ne viendrez pas chez lui par hasard)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|harmon: oh good then lets have a kib fight:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'll hold the coats...|pg||
nt|harmon: Chick will ref|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: 6@H  COMING i GUESS|pg||
nt|april7: Now EW escaped a heavy loss, first its vnot X and second NS have even 5@S|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he thought that with a good hand and five diamonds, lauria might have overcalled|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2 down at least isnt it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can go 3 down now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: ok|pg||
nt|chick: 6N is a better contract, no risk of ruffs|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: this iswhere he goees down:)|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Non la main d'avant c'est assez raisonnable de ne pas ouvrir d'1SA : on est NV donc le coût de l'empaillage est moindre, et on a 15 4333 sans As, vraiment les pires 15 possibles..|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: without losing anything I mean:)|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn't really matter|pg||
nt|psridhar: he needs to run the @h jack now|pg||
nt|cuan: @HJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|harmon: I was just responding from the msgs I got no offense to anyone|pg||
nt|nagini: so as moch tricks  as given:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: He could have led his left glove and still not beat it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: but if lauria HASN'T got a good hand and five diamonds, how are you beating it?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@D is the right timing|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kerasidis: club now and -3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Left glove is often a good lead|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|harmon: Ill go back to being just a sex symbol|pg||
nt|psridhar: wd|pg||
nt|juan lukas: la sequence ne m'emballe cependant pas : le 10@h en Ouest et 3SA serait un meilleur contrat non ? |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: so 1 in the glue|pg||

nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|chick: this is last of the quarterfinal, I believe|pg||
nt|harmon: whats happening in other qfinals??|pg||
nt|ady: thx Giusy|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H for north?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Sridhar, Ralf, Antonio, Giorgio and Christer for commentary|pg||
nt|psridhar: that was rather accurately played by Versace -it was easy to go for 500 there|pg||
nt|athos: raisonnable je discute pas, mais je me permets de penser que si jeremie se sentait bcp plus forts que ses adversaires il pourrait etre plus prosaïque|pg||
nt|vugraphzxg: la derniere donne de ce 1er segment, je vous retrouve dici 20 mns pour la suite de ce match|pg||
mb|1D|nt|reisig: Prob 1NT |pg||
nt|paulg:  final board of the round of 16, could be quite close at the moment|pg||
nt|kerasidis: he didnt count in @cQ i think just 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: big recovery for team Pauncz|pg||
nt|athene: gee whizz|pg||
mb|2H!|an|5+!h ,4+!s |nt|bridge_one: this competion is at direct elimination - difficult with this hand produce a swing for Angelini|pg||
nt|sommer: same as here..they try to win|pg||
nt|harmon: oyy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they don't like opening weak-twos|pg||
nt|juan lukas: voila une convention qui tombe mal |pg||
mb|2S|nt|april7: 1NT by E|pg||
nt|athos: par pour Sud...|pg||
nt|athos: pas|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: This is the first of 3 rounds, so it's far from over|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: but Buscaglia has certainly played very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl|pg||
nt|reisig: Could happen|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd have bid 1@h with Garozzo's hand, perhaps it shows five hearts for them|pg||
nt|sommer: N is allowed to pass this..and did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our gratitude to the FIGB for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. As always, Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: appreciated by brkidge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|pelu: they never open 2@H :) some hand too strong - some hands too weak :):)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@d with balanced weak is a opener that you will use 50% of hands !|pg||
nt|athene: yes, many forms of precision club basically mean "we open 1@D unless we have some freak hand"|pg||
nt|pelu: why do they have 2@h and 2@S openings on their card??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Look Peter, now 2@h a perfect overcall ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to all spectators for joining tonight. Hope to see you back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: when we will be adding France and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is bidders game - even when they play that @d-opening u sh try yo bid first|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards    can make 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: come on giubilo raise your partner|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 opp a passed hand?|pg||
nt|ady: dont think north will accept an invite|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here pass in south at 1@H isn't easy to find :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|malpaluche: je ne la connaissais pas celle là|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kerasidis: last board ty all guys :) commentators and specs!|pg||
nt|sommer: ..not best decission|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One line missing on óur vugraph schedule web page. Next set in 2 hours and 55 minutes after a break for lunch|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcphee: some might have o/c 1NT as E|pg||
nt|athene: sure, just bid notrumps :) we saw earlier... 4333 facing a weak-2@H...always 3nt :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: though the defence to 4@S was poor and loks a swing back|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be they bid 1@H with 4 cards - in this case garozzo choose to pass to try to penalty opps|pg||
nt|reisig: Cima was hoping S had @d King|pg||
nt|ady: pass was  cautious|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15.00 CET, 2 pm UK, 9 am New York|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is costructive|pg||
nt|cuan: 1NT is a constructive bid, so 3NT by alfredo|pg||
nt|besbes: tant mieux lol|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer: -3 or 4?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|mamos: on 14|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not 4 @H or 4@S in South, so @H lead is possible|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will go down if W switches to @s|pg||
nt|cuan: switch in spades can beat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is on - so better not pass at 1@H:)|pg||
nt|malpaluche: Avec 5@s et 4@h, ça se comprend de jouer une convention, mais avec 5@h et 4@s, on retrouve facilement le fit @s en répondant 1@h|pg||
nt|juan lukas: je ne suis pas certain que la donne presente t'incite a mieux la connaitre :)|pg||
nt|athos: stretz a pas de bol : s'ils l avaient jouée 1@d 2@d, il aurait pu passer, comme lors de la donne 3 :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcphee: 1 in the glue again|pg||
nt|april7: should make 8 tricks!!|pg||
nt|pelu: also 4@D in OR - Versace pushed over 3@S - but no @H-lead|pg||
nt|chick: good thing, would be very hard to play in 2@C, and everything else is worse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: 5 @H return means 3 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: beacause can't be sgl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 @D now|pg||
nt|cuan: so Lorenzo must win now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sommer: IF he bids 2@C, dont they play there?|pg||
nt|chick: depends on agreements, but with S's clubs, he might well raise|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|mcphee: yes 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere 9@D - after AQJ are free|pg||
nt|cuan: great Lorenzo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the FIGB for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. As always, Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but not easy to find|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Yes - last board!|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Thanks all and good night|pg||

nt|april7: if E makes @C finesse, then S plays @S again and E makes only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the force of A A and Q up the declarer - 2@s giving a inviting raise could be used - but pass can work the same - not a sure auction by South|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi|pg||
mc|6|nt|ady: there was a sac in 5D  on hand 14    down 2 was woth 4 imps|pg||
