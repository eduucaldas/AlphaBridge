nt|vugraphzwh: Allan Cohen asks about "When do we have to decide if we want to appeal the decision" |pg||
nt|jron: Fortunately the TD was sane in his ruling :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  need to avoid 4@H    3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H looks promising - trouble with @C lead|pg||
nt|ady: even without a club lead  seems 1 heart 1 spade and 2 clubs Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may inject 1@S which may lead to 3 NT David|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: and welcome Vladimir|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS playing Precision, giusy?|pg||
nt|sommer: strong @C opening, it seems|pg||
nt|aceg: Hi Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is 0-7(8)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Jeff :) nice to meet you !|pg||
nt|udo: ah, lauria and versace play together today,,,,yesterday they played with different partners|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: and AC got so distracted that he endplayed his pd - so only down 1 and not down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and the answar from the TD is: "After this session it is possible"|pg||
nt|ady: mind you a thin overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of the world's finest pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely in my Top 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Thanks, hi Giorgio|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: Ciao Giorgio :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H is good point|pg||
nt|aceg: here 2 players are always in BBO - Garbosi and Lo Presti|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao Giusy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Jn sh call TD: bad defense by my pd - can u help me? :):)|pg||
nt|ady: was in|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: they will get there now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is in bergen style|pg||
nt|fann4: That 3@S jump took away East's 2NT for the minors.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: N bid 1@S - S playing 1 NT X OR|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: 5@Dx is 300|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: ns playing Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D only 300|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sommer: ..and 5@H no chance|pg||
nt|oliverc: North doesn't have enough controls to go on|pg||
nt|sommer: no, agree|pg||
nt|aceg: in this situation is impossible to find the defence, because East with 4333 , so can't raise, and West with A A AKQ can beat if opps are with 2/2 in @d|pg||
nt|sommer: pass as invite is max..and S must X|pg||
nt|aceg: 5@D alone it is a little risk|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|udo: i see only 6 tricks for defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just made with best defence|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D , 2@S 1 @C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|aceg: North could have Kx@S and xx@D instead Kxx@S and sgl @d|pg||
nt|sommer: I think I would have invited with a pass|pg||
nt|ady: as you suggested Carl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi david :)|pg||
nt|fann4: This is going 2 down, but EW probably make 9 or 10 tricks in @C|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sharkey: ciao Giorgio|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzwh: I was also distracted on the last board :) --- 5@d dbl -2|pg||
nt|jron: As 4@h is a make it seems Iversen has 10-15 IMPs waiting for them in 15+16|pg||
nt|aceg: probably better 4@D that 3@D|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf  for the NS convention card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|xenya: admittedly 5@D was a risk, but a very small one|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|aceg: in the auction - giving the idea to defende also with only 3 cards, also with 4333|pg||

nt|bessi2: no.. he wasnt.. 4th spade.. discard club Q.. now north has top diamond and 5th spade to cash|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 4 imp for Uggeri|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: also 3Nt immediatly over 1@d - opps don't know nothing about thay hands, and if opps dbl bid 4@d|pg||
nt|ady: yes that is right  |pg||
nt|bessi2: that's why he had to unlock the @d jack earlier|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Bill !|pg||
nt|udo: slam NS ?|pg||
nt|udo: hi bill|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they will call this slam|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: ace of @D lead at other table |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: some hands we have got here for the final boards |pg||
nt|sybarra: a real challenge |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: a forcing pass -- a dbl and then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 2@d -- and ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: and N mislead by leading 6th highest!! unfair|pg||
nt|aceg: 2@d in italy is michael's (they not use 2@c normally)|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - but East took what they offered|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limited raise in @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|udo: not a perfect one, but with @H and @C friendly,,this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: inviting|pg||
nt|udo: other room in 4 @H here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is always Raise inviting or more|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: no I dont exp that East will D he will bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like Michaels with intermediate hands, because you don't know if you have a fit when partner responds|pg||
nt|sommer: X?|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@C |pg||
nt|oliverc: agree|pg||
nt|sommer: why not X?|pg||
nt|oliverc: 5-9 or 16+|pg||
nt|aceg: because i have @c ...|pg||
nt|sommer: "only" 3 small @D, but good def|pg||
nt|aceg: with only 3@d no chance to play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something like that, Oliver. Either weak or very strong|pg||
nt|sommer: did p promise more than 3c @C?|pg||
nt|aceg: also pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jron: Lots of exciting boards to come, sp dont go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I was just in my mind thinking about "Drama and fun" :):)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s means a not minimum open|pg||
nt|udo: doublefit makes it playable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Checkback coming I suppose|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: @C lead would be better...|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe only -1 now|pg||
nt|aceg: dbl must support the penalty, so it is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 4 immediate losers, but Declarer will struggle here, I suspect|pg||
nt|sommer: @C lead would have exhausted N in @S, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@h show raise in @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C off ! looks like|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now Kx in @s became very strong|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|oliverc: that will still happen, I think|pg||
nt|udo: 1 more move from North ?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AK in @D Lauria must reopen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi William|pg||
nt|udo: lauria s problem are the bad @H s|pg||
nt|udo: @h lead will kill NT contracts|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 4@s down with the ruff in @H, but a risk to play|pg||
nt|udo: wd,,,,|pg||
nt|fann4: Now South can drive to slam.|pg||
nt|udo: now they should bit it|pg||
nt|athene: well north's hearts are a lot better than three small...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose they use 4Nt RKSB now, and not cue bid generic|pg||
nt|udo: 4 keycards and partner makes another move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bessi2: this may go for 500 since declarer will surely try to make it via @c finesse|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  no chance      4@S  down on obvious heart ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: phantom sac - also played in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 2NT is invitational with spades and clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: good decision|pg||
nt|aceg: need to play @H from dummy|pg||
nt|sommer: but 7 tricks possible|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@D then 6@H ?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 5@d sure - i don't know if 6 or 5 @H - suppose 6 with AQ|pg||
nt|athene: when neither partner is prepared to just take control, despite all the controls being there, that suggests there is a bit of a question-mark over the trump suit...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What's the percentage play in hearts for 1 loser?|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 6@H now|pg||
nt|athene: south wondering if his @HQ is an extra value at this point|pg||
nt|udo: from my point of view,south has to bid it now,,,north cuebidded 3 times,,,|pg||
nt|fann4: N has made 3 tries.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: about 50% because need @H 3/2|pg||
nt|udo: getting to high ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria showing doubt about hearts is my guess|pg||
nt|udo: i would also drive to game with that North hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 5@c looks makeable|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: this should go quickly now |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: so say us which is the percentage Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what about   K   J873|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't love the percentage, like Fantoni |pg||
nt|udo: 6 to the ace,,,,,later 10 from table ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asking, I am not sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 75 of 68 % ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Suitplay anyone?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hve a feeling that ace is best|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|udo: small to ace,, later 10 from table,,,forme|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Roberto|pg||
nt|fann4: Suitplay says small to the Q first, interestingly enough.|pg||
nt|udo: hmm,|pg||
nt|ybob: I like A@H first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me no|pg||
nt|athene: suitplay might just be giving the line which gives the maximum expectation|pg||
nt|athene: not the line which is best for 1 loser|pg||
nt|fann4: No William, that is what Suitplay says for 4 tricks. For 5 tricks, run the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But there is more to it here as declarer does not know if he must ruff a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuan: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction, I am very impressed|pg||
nt|udo: yes, i see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao Antonio, welcome|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: decl will try to gard against @C 4-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even right-sided|pg||
nt|udo: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ady: now get out for down 1|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: but he's off the hook...|pg||
nt|athene: well it's pretty good odds the clubs are coming in for two spade pitches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's face it, we would not get to 5@C, at least I wouldn't|pg||
nt|cuan: Lauria has showed, with 2NT and then 3@S, 5@S+5@C GF|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: so this is anti-percentage we now know|pg||
nt|athene: although perhaps not so good if you use up one of the side entries to play trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ady: 7 imps for n/s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|aceg: small @C instead A@C would work better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|korszurku: hi all|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Balazs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuan: the lead don't help the defense|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I will get it right eventually|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: A@S @S ruff and @D from dummy may be more safe ?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: at that point 7 tricks were safe|pg||

nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays this likely to go down if in game|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see east going to the 5th level at this vulnerability, therefore it looks like a 4@s contract going off|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: and even with @Cs 4-2 a lot of play|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually that barely matters,  need to guess the @D |pg||
nt|pelu: u can lose 2@Ds and make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: some specs suggesting 6 @D,  (with the diamond guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: remember -- we will finish with board 14 in this room -- and I will bet a coke or anything that the other room will be finished before we get to that board|pg||
nt|jron: 5@D is laydown with @c + @h dividing 5-2 or 4-3|pg||
nt|pelu: that how specht's see the board - all DD :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H lead puts paid to 6 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: 3@C explained as: "Natural or just forcing"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a false rever|pg||
nt|bessi2: would have been convenient for east to have a 2@c cuebid available showing the red suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: North 1 heart transfer response showing spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be also 1@H xfer|pg||
nt|bessi2: now I'm confuses.. that 2@s bid.. what system are n-s playing|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|sharkey: the transfer sequences at the 1 level so common now we fail to mention it at times|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: 3 @D should be the good hand now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 1@H = 4+@s, so my commment abot the rever is a mistake|pg||

pc|c5|nt|jron: This sequence should show doubt about 3N but E will prob pass anyway bec of good hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 6 imps to Iversen on board 15 -- 3@s making 10 in the closed room|pg||
nt|aceg: now the chance to no have the lead @H for E/W|pg||
nt|sommer: will N lead his "lousy" @H's?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|oliverc: well North might lead something else as he has no entires for his hearts|pg||
nt|aceg: not so automatic the lead @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with "no entrance"|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ..find p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|aceg: the problem is that the lead Q@S is however not nice to make|pg||
nt|sommer: of course|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jron: If he is worried about one spadestopper he might find the winning bid|pg||
nt|pelu: AC taking a pause - in the afterplay he can say: I was close to bid on :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bessi2: looked like a normal transfer response,  but I can't bid 2@s there with only 3card support|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sommer: MANY experts would do the same..imo|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: lots of cu bids    but lots of good spades missing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 3 caqrds support and a sgl out can raise |pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: i think a spade lead is more logical from N's perespective|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|aceg: i would lead @h because i hate to lose the chance to beat the contract with xxx in @H in my partner, and opps with AQ for KJ !|pg||
nt|oliverc: for sure. Hearts look like a pretty poor prospect|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: west pleased to see A@S with south|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes i know that.. but when playing transfer responses 1c-1h- you dont bid 2@s with 3.. especially not when overcall and you have a convenient support dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they don't use support dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl means strong hand|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a doubleswing,,,this should make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fann4: I think 1 down|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|udo: spades are "frozen" for defence|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: first 4 after 9 in @H - prefere @C |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|korszurku: @S now for -1|pg||

pc|dK|nt|fann4: Still 1 imp to UGG|pg||
nt|bridge_one: very precise the signals in this hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bessi2: ok.. then I understand.. but that is very rare I should think|pg||

nt|vugraphzwh: now this finale is down to a 3 board finale -- |pg||
nt|sommer: these 2 N's did the same stupid thing...as I "suggested":)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1@H 5@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: i was actually wondering about that.|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a good stopping place for e/w|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i predict 3@h|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: he needs to find partner only with 1 spade honour, whereas a heart lead requires 2|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  any other guess as to final contract?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|udo: what about 4 @H EW ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: EW did very well to stop in 3@D in the OR. After W opens many East's would be in game (4@h in the 5-3 fit)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzwh: you are all lucky to be able to watch this :):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: and remember -- if the match ends All square -- then it is decided by Total Point|pg||
nt|pelu: and lot of small swing - here IMP and total are close - so the swing of 15 can decide in favoor of Dahl|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Remember yesterday when Ole Berg told us that Henrik Iversen was an expert in close matches |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I have been told yesterday that he has lost one and won two against Lars Blaksets team|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And that Iversen has won more than a few very close Cup-matches before |pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand EW was in 4@Hx off 2 for -500|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: and Jakob Røjel from the Iversen team has once lost by a ½imp in the World Championship for Juniors in 1993|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12 IMPs to Uggeri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt raise in @S inviting or more|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C Giorgio?|pg||
nt|udo: yes,looks quite normal to reach 4 @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuan: 2@D is GF with @D or weak in hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ybob: @C lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: I confess I'd be in 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie 4@h is makeable, but  difficult to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|udo: normal bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@C have many possibility :) i suppose interest slam, but i amn't sure they use this option|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggests ask singleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, today is more used this use: asking for shortness|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on a @c lead?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Spade is the best lead but declarer can prevail on this layout|pg||
nt|oliverc: needs to attack Diamonds before drawing trumps, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: sorry, scrap that|pg||
nt|bessi2: relly.. I haven't seen that yet... so isolated here you know|pg||
nt|sharkey: best lead I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending how you use 2Nt - if 2nt can be unbalanced hand is usefull can ask about the distribution|pg||
nt|sharkey: Commin in Norway to use mini splinter on East's hand - 3@H = min inv values in @S and stiff @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: *common|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oliverc: I had the NS hands intermingled :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade ruffed, heart to dummy, diamond finesse. Another spade. Still home|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need some luck in the red suits now that you are getting tapped|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, you can just play diamonds from hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fabio Lo Presti had many big ingternational results when he was a junior but we have not seen much of him for quite a few years now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the team with the di Stelio brothers|pg||
nt|aceg: Roland, in Italy isn't easy to play in national team :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can say that again|pg||
nt|aceg: also for great players |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Di Bello brothers rather, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stelio was one of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Furio the other one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lo Presti's partner was Francesco Mazzadi|pg||
nt|oliverc: might well opt to play @D's from hand here given the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is normal auction|pg||
nt|korszurku: needs a club to beat it|pg||
nt|fann4: Needs a @C lead to beat it, but should be forthcoming.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|aceg: isn't a east hand to play !|pg||
nt|udo: @H also possible ?|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|fann4: woops|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however is a game that must to play this 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|aceg: easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|ady: should manage 10 tricks one way or another|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder what line declarer will take here.. @s ace.. ruff diamond.. club up.. then Q holds go for crossruff maybe|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: @h7 is an entry|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: I think Stelio Di Bello lives in London now|pg||
nt|fann4: Agreed. So 10 much needed imps for UGG|pg||
nt|udo: tempting to lead a @H,,,dummy could be easily 5431,,,,but Q10 in @D is another point|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the kibitz told me that 2Nt means 8/11 fit with a sgl - 3@C medium+ hand ask the suit sgl|pg||
nt|bessi2: but he preferred the other line I was considering.. finessing @h immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2nt can be also with 3 cards support - but need a sgl|pg||
nt|ady: trumps best   but can get home with J@C coming down  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: similar at minisplinter in norway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But too late, no?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  don't you lose 4 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|jron: dont remind me :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Closed room has finished |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Iversen in the lead with 5 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: the 5IMP from board 16 5@Dx -3 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: sr Jacob :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry miscounted!|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt can be also inviting without sgl ! so 3@S after 3@c ask|pg||
nt|ady: north playing partner for KX clubs?|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud be - West hasn't divulged his hand so difficult return|pg||
nt|sharkey: W still has to watch his steps here|pg||
nt|ady: 1nd trump would have been more of a test|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: 5@S OR - Versace probing slam|pg||
nt|udo: when dummy has really 5 @D , they will be high quickly|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jron: last hand a grand slam for NS bid at the other table so stay put :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: A grand slam as the last board :) --- thats entertainment :)|pg||

nt|cuan: yes, always|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|ady: 2nd|pg||

pc|h3|nt|jron: thats entertainment, folks :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|fann4: Criticising opening leads is a touchy subject - but here @D may have had a bigger @D threat, AND @C were unbid.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  notice south ducked opening lead so partner could win 2nd @d and play @c though if needed|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Now 10 on cross ruff|pg||
nt|aceg: would win also with @D 4/2 in this line|pg||
nt|sommer: not with @H from EW|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oliverc: nicely done|pg||
nt|udo: agree Jeff|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fann4: ...dummy may have had a bigger @D threat|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: i think that in this auction with a shortness in @C in North, the lead @C is preferable - very difficult to make a present, more easy to make a present leading trump|pg||

nt|aceg: without gadget 3@h seem the best auction|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@C looks ok|pg||
nt|pitiful:  to make 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: 120 here will be 6 imps, and a lead of 11 before the last hand. missing the grand will then result in all square|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 IMP for Iversen = +11 - so a gamesving  or(slam-swing) in last board = even again|pg||

pc|h3|nt|thorvald: and there will not be extra boards, but a calculation of most scored points - makin Dahl my favorite as they have the biggest swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S play a system similar at polish - 1@C can be also weak balanced - a lot of relais|pg||
nt|fann4: And 3@D shows one or two 4 card majors.|pg||

nt|vugraphzwh: and what about a preempt to start with|pg||
nt|aceg: weaker pass or 3@s - this is the reason beacause i don't like to use 3@C with 5/5 medium force|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer had ducked @h trick 2..  then another spade, then in a position to strip west out of his Major cards and tucking him in with a @d honour  for an endplay I think|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR, South faced the dilemma of what to do over a t/o dbl with a very weak hand - bid the 4 card @C suit at the 2 level, or keep it low by bidding 1@S on a 3 card suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told Iversen in the quarterfinale was down by 16 imps with 2 boards to go -- and WON |pg||
nt|thorvald: What about a practical 3 NT on the south hand ?|pg||
nt|jron: Cohen probably thinks they have a bad round so he decided he needed a swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told by the TD -- who was captain for the team Iversen beat|pg||
nt|jron: Right he was|pg||
nt|fann4: What's the panel's opinion here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jron: difficult now to bid it w precision|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS will belive they are ahead - and dont need to gamble on grand, or..??|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now the cant miss the slam, but still some work to do to get to the grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I can hear that Iversen is thinking :) -- he is at the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|pelu: 6NT is only 10 IMP!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: e/w 26 pts   no game likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked to bid my longest suit, so I will|pg||
nt|fann4: Always a good idea:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: agree|pg||
nt|korszurku: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: also because 5/5 30 is very different from a 55 03   - and 55 KX  x  completly different from 55 x  Kx|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to think EW had a systemic misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N assumed @C broke - could still have ducked @H second time |pg||
nt|fann4: I'm a 2@C bidder too - don't like the idea of faking bids in a major.|pg||
nt|udo: with 4 small @C s and Qxx in @S i like 1@S; here i prefer 2 @C|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: 2@C because they use 1Nt constructive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why must I invent a suit I don't have? It's different if I am 3433|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but many times it´s correct to duck from the aces.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some would view west as too strong for 1NT despite the poor shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads also against NT|pg||
nt|udo: normal contract here|pg||
nt|cuan: many times is so, Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many 3rd/5th leaders switch to 4th against NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzwh: Incredible !!!|pg||
nt|pelu: so Iversen will win by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|thorvald: That missing imp can be found many places|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: a cup-finale decided in the last board -- by 1 imp|pg||
nt|jron: No, you think so :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|aceg: 3@s now i suppose|pg||
nt|sommer: then I think, 3@H was a bad bid...4@C should be obvious|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sommer: ..not this board:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: ok sorry need to take 13 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with this lead can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: I wonder what 2NT by Lauria would have shown?|pg||
nt|korszurku: after wests pass, what are the odds that partner doubled because he was too strong for a direct overcall?|pg||
nt|korszurku: easts pass, sry|pg||
nt|korszurku: I would expect the odds are quite good for that|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: declarer in with a chance now.. but must time it perfectly.. |pg||
nt|korszurku: so why give him false ideas?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thorvald: 13 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I just have to count --- says Bjørg |pg||
nt|fl j: send wishes to Bjørg, Henrik & jonas, my training of him was good Any flag !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jron: Right she is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and then explains a plan -- and EW accepts -- 13 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Jeff, 2NT is anough with a 4333|pg||
nt|fann4: Most people play dbl then bid NT is about 19-21|pg||
nt|udo: 2NT enough for me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jron: Congrats to Iversen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to all the commentators along the way |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I dont know if EW are going to appeal the TD decision -- but I will let the room be open|pg||
nt|thorvald: keep the table open until we get the official result|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And then we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And I will tell you what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: so the call on TD in board 15 and the misdefend on board 16 was the key-board|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: The Dahl team is starting to count the score just ½m from me|pg||
nt|sybarra: we certainly can not  complain about the exciting boards|pg||
nt|fl j: nice "ugle" game when it go for 1 up/down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: There will be no appeal -- it seems -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: so result is: Iversen team won with 1imp !|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: bye for now|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu Jan :)|pg||
nt|jron: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: see you later here from Denmark :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: bye|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what's best. Any views?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|aceg: 3Nt isn't a good music for South - the points in @S arn't interesting to play slam|pg||
nt|udo: i play 3 /5 th also ag. NT,,,,buth high from 3 small|pg||
nt|udo: i am happy with that|pg||
nt|cuan: no Roland, Alfredo e Lorendo leads 3rd and 5th against trumps contract. Against no trumps they lead in attitude |pg||
nt|udo: but not sure whats better |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|ady: avoided heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: I am also NV, no need to chase thin games. With this said, I don't play as well as Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so maybe he added a point or two for his declarer play|pg||
nt|udo: interesting @D lead, btw|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 3Nt over @C of my p - impossible he can understand, with anything like Kxxxx in C and nothig out to call game|pg||
nt|fann4: That's true - Kxxxx would miss a game, but what about all the other holdings?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult with pass pass by opps my p with zero|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: last @C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Then the 2 from J9xxx was a little much one could argue|pg||
pc|s3|nt|korszurku: In any case, I would rather play 3NT than 2@S :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: another trump|pg||
nt|ady: still should be a trick short|pg||
nt|bessi2: well... now it seems to make.. if north had discarded a heart and let south play another spade.. declarer had to decline the @d finesse. play Ace then Q of @d and later take the ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: ruffing finesse against n's @d jack.. not enough entries for both|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West win playing A@D and Q@D against the best counterplay|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now the best for defence is to play @H and @S|pg||
nt|ady: much easier for us to find winning line|pg||
nt|bessi2: why would north ruff south's trick there I wonder|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Riccardo is thinking ?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: may have missed something here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can have also xxxxxx @C and akxx in ! to make the contract|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|aceg: East is helping the declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fann4: 2NT would probably have made on a @D lead.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d7|nt|udo: would make now with the finesse in @S rite|pg||
nt|udo: but actually no way|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now Lauria know ... to be down :)|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,,,can work out @H 6-1 because no @H lead|pg||

nt|ady: yes    just seen   1NT  would be odd|pg||
nt|udo: this 3 Nt looks better:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bessi2: looks right to me.. always makes after that ruff of souths club trick.. if not ruffed.. declarer can make by a very inspired though unlikely play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: 2@D   forcing stayman?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@S by S I think?|pg||
nt|udo: grand slam time|pg||

mb|4D|nt|jron: 2@h WJS 4-8 and 6c @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello Jan and hello all |pg||
nt|udo: does 3 @D say something about strenght ?  Antonio ?|pg||
nt|cuan: not minimum hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bessi2: I like playing 3@s now as Hx in @s and 5card @d fit|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzwh: Hi Sheryl|pg||
nt|jron: 4@s seems iiadvised; probably bid to sacrifice but as 3@h was NF I see no reason|pg||
nt|jron: iladvised|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: slow auction here|pg||
nt|udo: standard puppet ,,now 3 @H ( showing 4 @S )|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bessi2: they do as well apparently :)|pg||
nt|ady: this looks doomed|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|jron: N could play @DQ so S can underlead AK next time to get a heart back|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: If the match ends ALL SQUARE - then totalpoints will be counted|pg||
nt|jron: doesnt matter if S continues @Ds but no reason to give partner a chance to make mistakes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and the team with most total points wins the Vinoble Cup 2010|pg||
mb|p|nt|jron: decided to go passive|pg||
nt|fann4: Interesting on a @C lead.|pg||
nt|udo: u have to find the @D s|pg||
nt|udo: hm|pg||
nt|cuan: too fast 6@D|pg||
nt|udo: can north bid 7 ?|pg||
mb|7N|nt|jron: nothning wrong with that|pg||
nt|udo: AK of @H s first, to see if the queen comes down ? than u can afford to loose a @D to East|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|cuan: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: I guess S can see that Declarer cant run tricks in any suits -- and she is in control |pg||
nt|aceg: dbl means point but less of 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: difficult puzzle here|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I agree with south sitting in 3@s if 3@s showed Hx and 5@D|pg||
nt|fann4: As West is the danger hand, there's a case to play a @D to the K and back to the 8. If it loses and they switch a @S, play for the @HQ to fall.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now K@D and finesse at the Q in West|pg||
nt|udo: if no @H queenwhy not @H s first , jeff?|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm thinking about it Udo:)|pg||
nt|udo: why not @H  s first?|pg||
nt|udo: when the queen doesnt appear, play @D s from top|pg||
nt|udo: if it falls,  play @D finesse in the safe hand ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can lose all @C if west take the trick|pg||
nt|fann4: @HAK first looks better, agreed.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: They must know more than we do|pg||

nt|jron: yes on the actual hand it doesnt matter|pg||

nt|aceg: the only chance, knowing K@D in North, is for 10 8 doubleton in South|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 841 ! very rare|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seem a gulash|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: In the OR, declarer played a @D to the K and finessed on the way back, going 1 down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|aceg: a classical dbl by east|pg||

nt|bessi2: the cards arent lying very friendly for n-s this set|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S down with K@C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead, Garbosi avoided a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: the have now played close to 9o boards - all are tired|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - this may go down due to the @D break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: 5@S down with C lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|aceg: 8 hcp, so probably 2Nt or 3@C work better|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: correct to duck the K|pg||
nt|ady: west may quietly exit with a trump|pg||
nt|fann4: The dbl is Lightner, calling for an unusual lead, or showing a void. EW may run to 7NT now.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: and tempers probably frayed |pg||
nt|jron: trying TD to get S to play a heart is poor sportmansship, in my opinion. What do you say about this, Shirley?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Spades breaking, nothing the defence can do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But heart tap would be more challenging, I agree|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sommer: agree R... 3@H+1 is good bridge|pg||
nt|athene: only chance to make - maybe play for clubs 8-1 is better, so west has no club to cash after the @DA|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: if west learns of a singleton heart opposite, that is not good news|pg||

mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Previous hand was cold for 6@S on a @S finesse and @S and @D behaving|pg||

nt|athene: if he heard a singleton diamond, he might wake up a bit|pg||
nt|cuan: but that is an opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Not much of a battle...|pg||
nt|athene: or club|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: S refrained form introducing his @D...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 3Nt balanced maximum|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: a slam at 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but N-S can make 3@D'|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk3: so 1 down in 3@S is OK|pg||

nt|athene: hmmm if EW know what they are doing, they are overbidding...if they don't, they may be getting lucky|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: nobody would stop E/W to call slam now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 5@H by West might end it|pg||
nt|fann4: Exactly|pg||
nt|cuan: @S6 is 3/5 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: West's inability to show any Club Control will worry East|pg||
nt|sommer: 50% slam.. but no squeeze to make up for the losing @D fin|pg||
nt|athene: but a heart lead might take the contract down as declarer may refuse the finesse then find he needs it when trumps are 4-0?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|fann4: what was 5@H?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess @D lead is much more likely with that very weak south hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: East have the best possible hand - also over 5@h must call slam, i think - otherwise 4@D was a mistake|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: although actually that does need specifically @DA oppposite|pg||
nt|athene: normally when u lead a singlton, the trump ace opposite is OK too|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: but here south knows his partner can't have the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: (he hasn't got any spades)|pg||
nt|athene: so that basically halves the target you are aiming for|pg||
nt|fann4: Giorgio, any idea about the 5@H response?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: of course, it's bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|udo: he doesnt need the @H finesse with @C King and @D queen wellplaced|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: 2key + Q of @S|pg||
nt|athene: he has a problem with the 4th @D, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@H is 2 and the trump Q?|pg||
nt|athene: with trumps 4-0?|pg||
nt|fann4: What is 5@S then?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he must play all finesse after this lead|pg||
nt|athene: he needs @HJ too after the 4-0 break is revealed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2keycards + Q of trump|pg||
nt|athene: unless he is going to play for a red-suit squeeze on north|pg||
nt|fann4: Right. But he bid 5@H!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: N passed OR 4th seat??|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: but when he finds the layout in spades and diamonds, it's better odds to play for south to have the @HQ i would have thought|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a crossruff now for 12 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: like natural|pg||
nt|fann4: Not likely with 19pts|pg||
nt|fann4: Though we don't know their methods.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: tricky hand to play on that lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, this is true|pg||
nt|athene: if the lead is a singleton i don't think you have that much chance|pg||
nt|athene: you are going to lose two clubs and one in each red suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is destined to fail by a few tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|bridge_one: for beginner, now 4@d would be control in @S !|pg||
nt|sommer: right|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: same contract as OR|pg||
nt|athene: rising ace will be right if it's J10x, but is that really likely?|pg||
nt|fann4: If you put up the Ace|pg||
nt|udo: dont see his plan now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuan: perhaps, 2@D here, is GF with diamonds or weak in hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: very tricky indeed now|pg||
nt|reisig: For me ..Ace is strange|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: if he draws trumps, no heart ruff...if he doesn't, there is a club ruff|pg||
nt|fann4: Say he had finessed the Q. Still not sure how he gets 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|udo: after finesse is easy|pg||
nt|udo: draw @S and duck a @C|pg||
nt|athene: finesse @CQ and you draw trumps then just duck a club|pg||
nt|fann4: Of course, right.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They always seem to find the best leads. They are much too good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although you may argue that Versace should have switched to a club|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 2@d can be Gf in @d, weak in @h or weak with a fit in spades|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: in MP i hate to play in this way, because it give the right leads at opps|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d9|nt|athene: lauria might find it hard to believe the actual club layout|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: since declarer must have misplayed it|pg||
nt|udo: i guess even Lauria has problems to work out the actual @C holding|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sharkey: S will lead @CJ next time|pg||
nt|bessi2: strange switch from Barding assuming 1@h showed spades|pg||
nt|udo: ahh|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: he will perhaps have a clue now|pg||
nt|udo: he has not:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fann4: Meantime, ZAL went down in 6@S - playing a 2nd @D before drawing trumps, so a big swing to UGG. |pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe -- not the best played hand of the event|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|rcerreto: potesse giocare il 10@c dal morto, forse,,, ma forse no|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|ady: is this the final board of the session?|pg||
nt|udo: credit it to laurias lead|pg||
nt|fann4: A good recovery by UGG, picking up 24 imps the last 3 boards.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A @C was the worst choise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, tha FAKE SPLINTER is the bets invention in bridge of last years :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: best|pg||
nt|udo: against me lauria lead a @H in my AQ10xxx to the jack and queen,,later i finessed and lost to the now singleton King,, so he has ideas in his leads:))|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sommer: 4@S looks best here NS|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|athene: west couldn't bid 1nt or 2@C over 1@S?|pg||
nt|udo: 1NT looks nornal for me|pg||
nt|udo: normal|pg||
nt|fann4: I was thinking - can't one raise to 2@C with that hand also?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose 4441 with side singleton is a bit of a defensive shape, but if you pass that hand over 1@S, you might find it harder later on|pg||
nt|udo: or would it be transfer?|pg||
nt|fann4: How bad can 2@C be with 8pts and a singleton?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Giusy, Antonio, Ralf, Udo and Peter|pg||
pc|d7|nt|reisig: Now 2@c|pg||
nt|fann4: His partner could have a 6 card @C suit, for all he knows.|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sommer: I know 4@H makes:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..thats why 4@S, -1 is best:):)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Thanks Daniela, David, Giorgio, Sigurbjörn and Carl|pg||
nt|udo: depends on how many @C s 1 @C promises|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: ty all|pg||
nt|athene: well it can be mildly bad when partner has @Cxx, but these fearrs are exaggerated in my experience|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Last board now. Thanks Giusy, Povl, Giorgio, Vladimir and Oliver|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to Gianluca Frola from the FIGB|pg||
nt|fann4: Does it really matter?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: tnx all, especially all the nice kibz, who keep us on the toes|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|reisig: 1@c maybe 2 cards ..I guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk3: Next set in 2 hours and a wee bit after a break for dinner|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 21.45 CET|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo pls|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 8:45 pm UK, 3:45 pm New York, 12:45 pm Los Angeles|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: yes - 1@C 2+@C|pg||
nt|udo: against 1 @C 2+  i would bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if you pass over 1@S because "2@C is risky" you end up having to risk 3@C|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: which is riskier?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|cuan: tx Roland, and bye all|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bessi2: I don't see declarer divining the @h position|pg||
nt|udo: i would never pass|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last set in 1 hour and 20 minutes after a break for lunch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: Ty for watching at all :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|udo: south stole their 4-4 fit:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more safe to entry with 1Nt over 1@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bessi2: though the imminent @c ruff may give him a better chance to do so|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|reisig: seems -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk3: He must be fearing a club ruff sooner or later so perhaps he should have cashed @HA first|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bessi2: nahh.. Q now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sommer: Denmark-Norway now..women handball, that is:)|pg||
nt|udo: this is last bord of the set ?|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT with a singleton doesn't look right to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @S lead in the previous hand an easy 4@s + 1 in OR|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|athene: it is a singleton ace - that makes a bit of difference, i think|pg||
nt|fann4: true|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is the less worst bid for West|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|nt|Walddk3: still down|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|udo: this is bord 16,,,,thank you guys,,,was fun as usual|pg||
nt|fann4: Not necessarily|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bessi2: ehh. what happened|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Making?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not the way the play went|pg||
nt|ady: seems an error|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: OK; we shall see when we come back in 2 hours|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Bye for now|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: sry, my connection today is completly crazy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fann4: N opened 1@H here in the OR|pg||
nt|bridge_one: THX all for watching !|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bessi2: cashing ace of @h first often helps the opponents get their ruff.. not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching|pg||
mc|9|nt|bridge_one: federbridge.it to see the result of other match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: France and Poland in progress, see you there maybe|pg||
