nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|mcphee: fast first round:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure who is leading|pg||
nt|sommer: very soon now|pg||
nt|mcphee: any idea sommer?|pg||
nt|sommer: EW leads 57-47|pg||
nt|mcphee: they lead event?|pg||
nt|sommer: only this quarterfinal|pg||
nt|mcphee: obviously you are suggesting I should know more about what I am doing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: isnt there 4 winners in a quarterfinal?:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Someone should and we voted on you.|pg||
nt|mcphee: people often vote for the wrong dude|pg||
nt|sommer: lol|pg||
nt|sommer: new cards|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and let's rock'n roll|pg||
nt|mcphee: or samba for those with different dance steps|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, whatever|pg||
nt|sommer: wlc kibz, we hope, you get something for your entry fee:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: indeed, see sommer for refunds if not happy|pg||
nt|sommer: you'll get  comments in English (or almost:)) - in OR you can get them in Italian|pg||
nt|sommer: ...at least, I THINK you will get some comments VERY soon:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|ady: start with 20-20 split|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sigurbjörn Haraldsson|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, but getting to 6 level might get difficult|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you prefer, 4@S or 4NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laurua-Giubilo play the same system as Lauria-Versace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Massimo Papis Ticci is a little more weak of his father , of course|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@h making|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone and welcome back to Salsomaggiore|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have play for 4@H   especially diffiult lead for south|pg||
nt|athene: the auction might well end in 4@SX|pg||
nt|athene: @S vs @H auctions have a tendency to do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H  may get passed out|pg||
nt|zebutin: i would choose 4nt, and after @C change to @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or 4@D if it shows both red suits. Should it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: seems logical|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some play that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah ha!  |pg||
nt|mcphee: this is the pair that plays nightmare|pg||
nt|sommer: no redeal... 3@H -1 is max on this, I think|pg||
nt|athene: double shows 4+ spades? or specifically 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fossi is a the younghest player in the Pauncs team, and he play very well|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 1@H= 14 + f1|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: can somebody help us with information about this event?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry for the technical problems|pg||
nt|sommer: NS can make 3@D with carefull play|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone consider pass as W?|pg||
nt|sommer: ..will S bid that?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by South show 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S limit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably pass now in South|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: never passed out|pg||
nt|mcphee: not such a bad hand to defend 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree! I prefer pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: even with 0 they must bid|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes decided hand woth a response|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not decide, he cannot pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: systemic|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H is forcing|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Non-leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you play it?|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room started with x, which to me seems strange|pg||
nt|mcphee: and frankly game was not in the photo for e/w I don't think|pg||
nt|santyclz: No limit raise in @ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: hard to bid 3@D ..and to make..especially if you dont know your partners @D-length|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Mauri - and 1@s bid =?|pg||
nt|ady: south has an extra sspade   but a poor hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: 14+  no limit, could have 29|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If 1@h is limites|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't, but i think it's a good agreement|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i amn't sure - probably they use a system similar at rubinshol|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: or about this bidding :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: and then 2@C forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont know both pairs / their systems / carding, so if you can help, feel free to msg us|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make a lot of tricks in the rounded suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but need to see ... i don't have the CC|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play the same system as Lauria plays with Versace|pg||
nt|ady: good spot for n/s   even going down a trick or so|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 natural OR 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: thuse f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: thus|pg||
nt|bigtrain: N has clear action over 2@H...  he knows the opponents have at least an 8fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: system not good for this hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: Aggressive 1NT by East but the contract has play|pg||
nt|rmb1: Best line is not to lose to singleton @HQ :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E has to play @sA on side in trick2|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|tomi2: ok, I have been told, that 16 teams qualified in loca selections and play a KO now, this reminds me exactly of the German Cup, its 100% the same here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it's a matter of frequency|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Looks like N-S play Nightmare|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: will we see Angelinis "star" players in the later rounds (if they win this match of course)?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where 1@D can be 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shown by the rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bigtrain: personally i like 2@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I thought David meant 2@C opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How often do you have a one-suiter (diamonds) and how often a two suiter. Same applies for 4@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With minors you can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or take a club finesse|pg||
nt|rmb1: Spade up AND take the club finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is that enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here it is, but he may reject and throw one on @DA|pg||
nt|kerasidis: then he needs 2 ruffs spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and lose 3 @h tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: because I don´t beleive E can play on @hA on side|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lauria asking the @C question early doors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Peter Lund|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Avram Kreisberger|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|kerasidis: wlc!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Avram|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 1@h all pass in OR|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: should manage the game |pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|sommer: a t/o double would work too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S might well show enough diamonds to interest S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, 2@C is F1|pg||
nt|chick: whatever the bidding meant, they have ended in a very reasonable contract and will likely make it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|nt|ady: meant 2@C rebid on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sorry, I misunderstood|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: S will then know they have 8+@D|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: also played by North worth a trick at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2: E-W play a strong club system, so 2@C was likely 5+@C 4M or 6+@C and opening strength, 2@D relay, rest natural|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: Now he doesn't need any spade ruffs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: Angelini has hired players from Norway, or better say Monaco, for other events. Helness-Helgemo and Nunes-Fantoni is his strongest squad|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice play here|pg||
nt|sommer: I prefer a t/o, but maybe they play it differently|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@s might suggest a weakins 5/6 in @ss/@DS.  X might be more just competing.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: so we have a wide range of views this hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not sure X would be TO...  why can't N be dealt 4@H in an "over-double" situation|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|kerasidis: nicely played|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have any Nightmare experts in the audience?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|ady: look like down 2|pg||
nt|tomi2: those 4 joined the NBO of Monaco together with another sponsor to represend Monaco in future European and World Championships|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was this a correct play with so few entries to dummy?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Or does anyone have a link to the system?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: or 1|pg||
nt|ady: cant be down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh sry i was playing 2@c|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator needs to shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|tomi2: (3-1)45 is difficult to bid in all systems, you often have to lie in one card if you dont have reverse strength. you may open 1@D but that indicates more @D than @C, you may hide ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: your diamonds like here or treat the hand as a balanced one|pg||
nt|bessi2: better play to start @s jack|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Paul Gipson, Peter Lund, Magnús E. Magnússon and Girogio Mauri|pg||
nt|rmb1: Was able to draw trumps with @H10 so, remained in dummy to cash winners|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i assume that n/s are playing some sort of big club (thus 1@D opener)|pg||
nt|santyclz: What is clear is that there are several ways to play these auctions.  What's essential is that you have discussed this type of auction with your pd.|pg||
nt|sommer: a little more action now|pg||
nt|pelu: EW can make 6@c but problems in 4@h on @h-lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 3NT a good spot for e/w|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hope he speaks English|pg||
nt|Walddk4: My French is not adequate|pg||
nt|hedyg: i sent him a French message|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S makes life difficult|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi all|pg||
nt|april7: again a 4@H contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes so I was advised|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you find an opening on E? I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|ady: west facing a passed and has not automatic action|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|athene: a disciplined pass from south - many would be tempted to bid 2@S as they have a 1@S opening bid, just about|pg||
nt|daman: very perilopus to enter vulnerable with that trash|pg||
nt|athene: but you need more than "just about" an opening bid for a 2@S overcall there really - you only push if you have the heart shortage|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: if west passes   east might take action|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But normal here is 3@c from W and 3@s from E|pg||
nt|ady: west decided to bid|pg||
nt|ady: east may ask for a spade stopper|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what happened to the names now|pg||
nt|zebutin: there is also "multi-landy"-stylish, where you would show majors with 4@C, single suiter with 4@D and 4M is major + minor...|pg||
nt|sommer: E better not insist to play his minor(s)|pg||
nt|mcphee: nor S his @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: and finally to George Holland|pg||
nt|daman: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next question. Do you all overcall 2@H?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H=@H+minor?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and 3nt is more easy now for E|pg||
nt|athene: now 3@D might show a minimum or else just the diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|zebutin: i would, it takes away some room, but im notoriously eager to overcall on the otherhand...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now easy to 4@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My partners bid 2@C after 1NT :(|pg||
nt|april7: losing 1@C,1@D and 1 H|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1N response a bit strong isn't it|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not an overbid...|pg||
nt|sommer: 2N now?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N now would make up for it |pg||
nt|sommer: 3N makes on a good day|pg||
nt|mcphee: think I would have tried 2N|pg||
nt|sommer: he should know, there's potential now for at least 2N..maybe jump even to 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: popular to play 2NT as a raise in this situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will get player names up as soon as our operator gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: they really didn't duck to the Jack|pg||
nt|iceking: This probably did not happen |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last segment of 16 boards in the Round of 16 and Angelini is in trouble as you see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Angelini Team play with 8 players|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BOVE ERCOLE - ANGELINI FRANCESCO -  CIMA LEONARDO  - DATO MASSIMO |pg||
nt|bridge_one: FANTONI FULVIO  -  NUNES CLAUDIO  -  GAROZZO BENITO  -  PRIMAVERA FEDERICO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Lauria Versace play in another team this year|pg||
nt|pelu: prob fantoni - Nunes are playing now :)|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see 2@S on @H lead should make |pg||
nt|iceking: lose 3@S 2@C tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The all time great Benito Garozzo at our table, what a treat|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Cima is a my friend - i am happy to see Leonardo to play togheter Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: The surprise is that Garozzo love to play difficult system, instead Cima love to play natural :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room Angelini is playing with Federico Primavera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am a passer at these colours I must confess|pg||
nt|zebutin: but what is defalcos x? better than straight 3@H ? or worse?|pg||
nt|zebutin: i dont seem to understand that x, even with open cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: ahh that would account for 1N then|pg||
nt|ady: poor example of hearts and a minor    |pg||
nt|athene: over 2nt, it's common to play 3@C/@D = natural minimum and 3@H/@S = max with @C/@D|pg||
nt|athene: spades won't be good for NS despite the 5-4 fit; probably lose to the @SQ as well as everything else|pg||
nt|Walddk4: On board 1, Zaleski weas able to show is club suit as well (at the 3-level after 2@S), so EW got to 5@C and made it with an overtrick. 9 IMPs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bridge_one: Buscaglia Team is fron Novara (city near Milan, in the north of Italy)|pg||
nt|rmb1: I am sure they only bid 2@C so you can declare the @H contracts Roland|pg||
nt|sommer: that was very pessimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: There is an excellent article on exactly that problem by Steve Robinson (one of our frequent commentators) here:   http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx|pg||
nt|tomi2: North misdefended the first one, he gave his opps a heart trick they would not make, if he had exited passively|pg||
nt|bessi2: I seriously dislike that 2@d bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on a heart guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: bit of a thin over call it was:)|pg||
nt|zebutin: so that wouldn't suit my style then... :)|pg||
nt|pelu: but then u will be decl in 2@H, Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@D  presumable shows 5 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bessi2: the last thing he wants is for pd to sacrifice to 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: does not 3NT on that bidding show a spade stopper?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: 11 tricks I suppopse. as well an after a @c lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Shows a better hand than 3@H would, which is merely competitive. Normallty both minors, but you can control that by bidding hearts next|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|zebutin: in open room straight 4@H answer with De Falcos cards...which is pushing it a little bit (atleast i think so...)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: *say|pg||
nt|athene: well, if west shows all his points maybe declarer will find the spade|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: but 4@s will be made if declarer can find @hQ...|pg||

nt|rmb1: Ralf? after a non-@C lead|pg||
nt|pelu: @DK was a mistake|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: In fact, 4@S is cold as West can be endplayed to open up the heart suit, no?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: Yes!|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Thanks Harmon|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they may even lead a @H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcphee: although a trump lead looks best|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact there is a play which can guarantee 4@s - before cleaning trumps play one round of @c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: True|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So maybe the hand wasn't worth more than 3@H at his first turn|pg||
nt|ady: had the heart been ducked   had a chance|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: What return from N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf    Lauria-Giubilo play the exact same system|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry! shouldn´t take @dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace also made 4@H on board 1|pg||
nt|april7: actually W could claim now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He lost to @HAQ and @SA. Rest on cross-ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: EW have a chance to play 3NT perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: again seems to be in slam zone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if West is *the* Lanzarotti. The answer is yes, but I am not inclined to comment further. Please understand|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h from N|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least that'd have been my bid....|pg||
nt|pelu: and in trick 3 S could make 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H EW has a play|pg||
nt|zebutin: but spades dont play out too well with 5-0 distribution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We assume board 2 was flat too|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk4: You must shut down|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ady: 5@S    down 2  3 or 4 depending on how many diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|yuval10: in natural system, W opens 1NT and i'm affraid i'd have find myself playing the doomed 6@s. 6@d, however, seem to be much better|pg||
nt|zebutin: 6nt seems decent too|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H|pg||
nt|aceg: 1@D can be balanced minimum |pg||
nt|aceg: 2@D, of course, is long new suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|chick: 4@C transfer to 4@H, similar to Texas but called South African transfer|pg||
nt|tomi2: system test for EW here, seems they are on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing 4m as transfers to the suit 2 above allows east to decide who becomes declarer in 4M. he can either transfer or bid 4M himself|pg||
nt|sommer: soon|pg||
nt|ady: low part score hand    2@H n/s  about the maxmum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not going to keep out east|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry i was delayed|pg||
nt|tomi2: would be interesting to know what 2@C was. seems it promised diamonds, else south cant bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D must be short if east thinks he has a 3@D bid there|pg||
nt|athene: strong club for EW?|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@d need to give the raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: that is more valuable over weak NTs than it is over strong ones|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Mike :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|zebutin: wd in other room to get to diamonds instead of 8card major suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would you double 6@S not knowing if you have any defence against 6NT?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 6@d is superior over 6NT, because if @s's are 3-2 you can play AK@h ( discarding @s's ) , AK@s and @s ruff, and discard a @c over the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know if Daniela has time to insert the result manually|pg||
nt|aceg: i amn't sure about strong club|pg||
nt|aceg: we will see in the next hands|pg||
nt|daman: they should find the winning defense easily|pg||
nt|athene: surprising decision from lauria not to take the pushto the 3-level|pg||
nt|pelu: west has promised 5 card @D so 3@D is the normal bid|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club ruff to set this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|po-s: Paul no dobt was hoping to get chance to show hearts later|pg||
nt|april7: only on @H lead possible but if Q is not covered then only 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D in Nightmare is either 11-21 unbalanced with diamonds or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: both minor Q's lie well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be happy to defend, undoubled|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me doubling 6@S seems bad...your just happy if they land there|pg||
nt|zebutin: and 6@D is surely superior... 6@D > 6nt > 6@S it seems to me|pg||
nt|cuan: Lanzarotti-Manno play "Nightmare. 1@C opening is 15+ with clubs, Bal 15-17 or any GF. 3@C of Manno is diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did 3@C show diamonds I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In Nightmare, 1@D opening followed by 1NT is 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D either natural unbalanced or 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|april7: if not vulnerable E could compete to 3 @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@ds on a finesse and a break.  Neither is on.|pg||
nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|athene: spade or diamond looks like the normal lead to me|pg||
nt|daman: not I said the Walrus|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: hi level decisions here  I hate the Five Level!  I always seem to do the wrong thing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both minor queens are on side as well as @hKQ, so an easy 3nt|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D is 30%..not much:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: T|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: and after @C lead only 1 down possible!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Antonio Cuccorese|pg||

nt|sommer: far!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iceking: Garozzo will win this and play @C |pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: they will probably be ok here, down 3 is only 500 vs a vul game|pg||

nt|tomi2: nobodydoubled|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|mamos: was 4@h making  |pg||
nt|yuval10: they seem to land on their feet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is indeed the best slam, very well spotted by Lo Presti-Hugony in the open room|pg||
nt|zebutin: both rooms managed to avoid @S trap|pg||
nt|yuval10: have to play @c towards the QJXX and will make easily|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is normal play|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuan: very good choice, after very good bid|pg||
nt|aceg: his force (sry)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Garozzo has won more than any of us ever will |pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: didn't even look, a double was so obvious :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|ady: A@D  lead   2 from Lebel   surely club switch     then Q@H      that would be down 2|pg||
nt|chick: even knowing of the double fit, neither of them has a hand that might consider a slam try|pg||
mc|9|nt|tomi2: why was it?|pg||
nt|daman: I see nothing wrong with leading a suit where we are known to have potential tricks|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he isn't bidding 3@H expecting to make it, necessarily, but you just think 3@D or 3@H will make|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Mind you, you could easily go down in 6|pg||

nt|iceking: probably should lead @D king after this bidding|pg||
nt|aceg: 4@H is a honest contract|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk3: 2@S the limit on a diamond lead and a club switch, and even then declarer has to guess @SQ when the next diamond comes through|pg||
nt|tomi2: any reasonable lead will make this go down now. clubs => ruff, @H =>open a trick|pg||

nt|iceking: would be silly though if decl had something like ATxx Txx 9xx AQx then only def to give it|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|chick: declarer ruffed a diamond too low and got overruffed|pg||
nt|pelu: I have seen better bidding and better defense from italian pairs|pg||
nt|aceg: both: like couint, like call|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but EW have a profitable save in 5@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C 2 down by E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 3nt from E a real underbid? on last board?|pg||
nt|tomi2: this @CK false card only works agains pairs who lead low from 96, else the small card would be the better one. South "might" think partner made some inspired lead from Kx. not ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: likely but the king made it easier for south to play for that ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, had to be @D overruff...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|doctorone: Previous board, surprisingly, EW entered the bidding and did not locate their @h fit|pg||
nt|aceg: to choose the clear card is typical of great player|pg||
mb|d|nt|doctorone: in other room I meant|pg||
nt|chick: in that room, they didn't have the advantage of having heard red suit bids|pg||
nt|sommer: @H+mi (@D?)|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe E knows it's @H/@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulg:  if West doubles and North raises to the three-level, may lose the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Garozzo will bid them|pg||
nt|daman: of course|pg||
nt|iceking: might stick in 3nt here or|pg||
nt|iceking: depends little what 3@H means |pg||
mb|2S|nt|tomi2: they play a limited system, he could not have more than this. maximum points, no wasted KQJ in @D and a 6th trump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H is strange|pg||
nt|daman: good stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He won't buy it there anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Boana will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt perfect|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|bridge_one: easy 4@H now|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H and 5@D are both good|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|athene: most would go with 1@H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: it sure was, 6@D in OR|pg||
nt|ady: already 1 too high|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H can go down, correct|pg||
nt|aceg: about the system i suppose they play similar at precision (the version of Papis Ticci)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i like 3nt but needs to take the save now i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then perhaps 5@C next|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but dangerous for E/W, |pg||
nt|april7: whats 1@S from W?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 1@s trf to 1 nt?|pg||
nt|aceg: they are E/W|pg||
nt|pelu: yes not my bid - would u D or bid 1@H??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H for sure|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@H after dbl is, in italian style, a strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: the usual rule is that if you double, partner makes a free bid that would have been a jump, and you bid a new suit, it's game forcing|pg||
nt|aceg: all world overcall 1@H i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but that sort of is based on a stronger double-then-bid style|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: good Garozzo !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: great evaluation of hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: May be transfer to @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: 5@D down on trump lead I think|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe not|pg||
nt|mcphee: can set up @S|pg||
nt|athene: double then 3@H is a real mosnster for most US and English pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He doesn't midjudge many auctions|pg||
nt|athene: monster|pg||
nt|daman: I think 1@H is pretty standard|pg||
nt|aceg: sufficient 16+ unbalanced to bid dbl and after the suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: now can make|pg||
nt|iceking: no he doesnt still has it:)|pg||
nt|pelu: if S bid 5@H then only a small @s can defeat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades and 1 heart|pg||
nt|pelu: D and bid 3@H : I my book forcing|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: even if it was forcing, east might have passed it, since he hasn't got anything :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: only has to ruff 2 cards in dummy, so spades not needed?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the 3rd spade, why not 3NT?|pg||
nt|bessi2: a 3@d bid there is generally played as a considerably stronger hand than he has|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: this should be down 2   do east took a good view not to bid on|pg||
nt|aceg: Yes Peter, in all world is forcing - not in Italy |pg||
nt|ady: sorry    down 1 |pg||
nt|athene: trump return now, to stop diamond ruffs?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: running scores at   http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirama.html|pg||
nt|bessi2: no way to go wrong in 4@s|pg||

nt|pelu: sorry 2@S+ a@H - coffee :):)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|iceking: well done everyone |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Avoiding slam is the issue|pg||
nt|april7: looking for 6 @D, but unseccessful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D next door|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  when I do this partner has two small clubs and @dAK|pg||
nt|iceking: not much in this one 300 no matter what|pg||
nt|sommer: right|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|april7: now they will be in 6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: however the players are in the best contract for the hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk3: Good morning to the Big Train from USA, aka Walter Johnson|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know much about the EW system (if anything) specs, so your guesses are as good as ours|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcphee: i suppose Gullotta hand to dble 5@D|pg||
nt|sommer: so .. maybe W should have kept his mouth shut on 4@D?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if pard bids 3@H freely I think you have to raise don't you?|pg||
nt|sommer: N MAY raise anyway, but would E double?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|doctorone: Hi Walter|pg||
nt|Walddk3: As you all know, Walter is our expert on the Meckwell Precision system. Not sure about French Standard (SEF) :)|pg||
nt|doctorone: LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Maybe he is here to learn|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: yes 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iceking: even though i like Garozzo 3nt bid, we have to admit 5@C direct would have made things more diffecult for N/S|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess @D were agreed at some stage and 5@H showed 2 A |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could be a chance if enstead of @d j east holds @c J|pg||
nt|april7: not even makable on a @S guess|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps EW plays with some kind of exclusion bids, like earlier Roman club?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: North needs to do something odd ("unblock" @HQ10 ?) to let South get squeezed and let this make|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice swing for Zaleski in b5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: b4 sry|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would like to see the auction in the last board|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|mamos: i'd  expect more from West  but without knowing agreements about 4@D hard to decide who was to blame for the poor slam|pg||
nt|ady: this will be ducked   or taken and spade back|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rmb1: Putting the @S9 will keep up West's hope of a miracle|pg||
nt|aceg: J@S reverse count probably|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|bigtrain: as long as it doesn't get too artificial i'll be ok  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No worries mate, a spade is a spade in France|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and a pique is a pique|pg||
nt|othered1: that's an odd looking play|pg||
nt|doctorone: that is a strange move by declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: I agree with you, Magnusson - 5@C instead 3Nt would be more difficult for N/S|pg||
nt|athene: lauria might have been going to double 4@H perhaps but certainly never three|pg||
nt|ady: sorry must suck|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ady: hand 4  I tht west might have considered an invite of 4NY    decent 16 with 6 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: duck|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: Board 3 was flat 5@d-3 both tables|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|hedyg: good day all :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcphee: not a very testing defense|pg||

nt|tomi2: ah ok|pg||
nt|mamos: inadvertent designation :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty active hands so far|pg||
nt|iceking: 1@H and S cant really enter here unless he overcalls 1@S |pg||

nt|santyclz: 5@hsx'd is less than 4@ds.|pg||
nt|sommer: 5@H may cost 500:)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk3: What is the percentage play for only 2 losers in hearts?|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW want to avoid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H on for n/s|pg||
nt|aceg: the overcall of 1@H was more easy to process|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rmb1: But 3NT is off the @C suit, so @S it is (I guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Walter?|pg||

nt|santyclz: I must have missed something.  I thought he had 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the doodle bug 2@S|pg||
nt|sommer: almost..|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|athene: some bid 1@S on hands like that south, if they can't bear to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT helps, a slight overbid|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt is a bit light but i suppose he likes the @D10|pg||
nt|ady: should be easy to reaxh now|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: I think 2@D will buy it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: PO?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i know a few players who would open S hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, so this is not real Nightmare|pg||
nt|paulg:  south might double now|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@D probably limited here, as i assume they play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|sommer: he MIGHT have had, but possible to set 4@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like these 2 bids , but never with 2 aces|pg||
nt|sommer: ..as done in OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah yes, I missed the black xruff.|pg||

nt|sommer: sry..300 for 2 down|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Cima will raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @@HK|pg||
nt|othered1: low to K?|pg||

nt|ady: 2@S  not sure to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sridhar|pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all thx Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just the 1NT rebid after 1@D opening|pg||

nt|bridge_one: now dbl not vuln can be used|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C South African Texas = hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @HKZ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Hi Hedy :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni may try 4@D now if it is splinter in his system|pg||
nt|april7: a game try in @S but will stop in 2|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S = weak NT (or weak NT with 3 card support)|pg||
nt|sommer: very close, but in danger, right?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@D = spades|pg||
nt|aceg: probably the use 4@c for >@h, but, more interesting, 4@h for ... @C ! and 4@s for @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: so a double on board 5 would have been worth 8 imps|pg||
nt|mamos: and 6@S-1 led to a swing|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = max raise to 3@D?|pg||
nt|iceking: probably just natural |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt with 2 stop in @S is OK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cards very well placed for a NT contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@H 1NT, West must give 2 stop in @S bidding 2Nt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: @HK|pg||
nt|sommer: he may be able to endplay W somehow|pg||
nt|santyclz: This auction could have started 1@s, 2@h for a disaster.|pg||
nt|sommer: in aggressive sayc or similar, yes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Worse in aggressive 2/1.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: yes 2@S and one each for just makeing|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: yes, NS at the other table made an excellent stop in 5@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bigtrain: i'm more in need of caffine that i thought|pg||
nt|ady: east tht worth a game try    |pg||
nt|ady: this should be way overboard|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think 2@d can still be a fair 15 points, so West has to do something with a fit|pg||
nt|iceking: if W had a strong @D raise he could have bid 2@S instead of 2nt |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 2@D is limkited to 15|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphztt: 1. Kepri 2. Djarum Black 3. Timah Prima 1 4. Djarum Super 5. Timah prima 2 6. well wise |pg||
nt|ady: east very optimistic to bid on over preference to 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this is one of the disadvantages, when 1nt response can be up to 10-11|pg||
nt|psridhar: decent slam ; i am sure they will get there, their slam bidding gr8 !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 16 or more, Garozzo would have bid 2@C, Gazzilli|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: yes he could - I was just asking about 2NT/3@D - what is the diff|pg||
nt|kerasidis: surprise:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i hate those surprises:)|pg||
nt|rmb1: South tries "black on black" - better to play @C6 - declare know @C3 is not @S3 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table.|pg||
nt|sommer: this may still be both a boy or a girl:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: right Magnusson - with interesting raise in @D 2@S was the best auction for W|pg||
nt|iceking: 2nt just correct on values |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a possibility to defeat is to underplay @cA twice and get 2 @h ruffs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcphee: had S opened @H would never get mentioned and 3N a likely landing spot|pg||
nt|iceking: would bid 2@S on hand like Axx x KJxxx Kxxx maybe|pg||
nt|pelu: abd 3@D?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: surely should not be 11 with the simple preference to 3@S?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT showing @s values was not good news for Fantoni|pg||
nt|mcphee: looked a little better to get out a trump|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: OR played board 5 in 6@C, even less chance of a squeeze with an Ace and a trump to lose (= flat)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: looks like Fantoni is in control here with Nunes describing his hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: QJ10x in @C and KQx in @S - 2Nt need ...|pg||
nt|athene: he really did that?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulg:  with West's soft values and (hopefully) double spade stop, 2NT looks right|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has so far shown ( i guess ) gf hand, @h, some clubs, and a slam try hand with his 3@s-unless some of those are artificial hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: artificial bids ( not hand sry)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that he has set @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: surely that 1@s X=hearts Hedy? |pg||
nt|hedyg: you always have @H when you double 1@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont|pg||
nt|psridhar: and 2@s confirming @h fit and gf hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sometimes i just dont have a natural call|pg||
nt|sommer: still a "boy":)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk3: The trouble is that it doesn't matter what he does as they can take a club ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is going down now|pg||
nt|aceg: not the best line to play (:|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Why the rush with the clubs??|pg||
nt|athene: win the club in hand and play trumps has to be right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: maybe upto 3@c Nunes did not confirm @h fit but later the partnership has estblished H fit and tried for slam|pg||
nt|iceking: but here with so much value in the black suits 2nt seems better then 3@D|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not an easy defense at this point.  Maybe a @d honor will still beat it.|pg||
nt|sommer: again NS get a + on "passive" bidding|pg||
nt|sommer: +2 or +5... the small one is the girl:)|pg||
nt|sommer: did W go to smoke..or p?|pg||
nt|mcphee: is west regeretting his decision to not with the first @S?|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw a spade on a club, no rush to pitch diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: trust your patrner and underplay @cA twice|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: even if the @DAK isn't right|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sommer: the boy..again:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now he makes if he plays trumps.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: not a lot of eexcitement here|pg||
nt|sommer: ..@D and back to the "girl"..I'm glad now, I introduced this Danish saying:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: odd no one tapped dummy with another @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: nice @c switch|pg||
nt|ady: 3 down is seems|pg||
nt|aceg: distraction, for sure - sufficient to play @H and discard the loser in @S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psridhar: as cards are may be they are better off in 5@h than slam|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: sorry, EW stop in 5@S|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mcphee: 3@H any one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: this may get too high for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: a 100% 3@D for me|pg||

nt|bessi2: very uncomfortable bidding problem for north here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would open 3@D with 2/1 in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must play 4@H on 5-2 here|pg||
nt|iceking: and they will |pg||
nt|pelu: pass from W = 2 card @h|pg||

mb|3N|nt|rmb1: West|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: maybe to 3N|pg||
nt|bigtrain: do they play forcing notrump?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|Walddk3: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, by Guermani|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Besides, West is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Buzzoni can't imgaine that partner has this hand when he passed initially|pg||
nt|bessi2: however, 4@s bid was not one I was considering|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@S was a bit much after 2@H I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D probably confirm 5@H and ask stop in @D|pg||
nt|rmb1: (oops)  East overcalled 1NT on a worse hand than West's earlier in the set|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks difficult to make|pg||
nt|april7: I think 2NT by E is better but then E would bid 3|pg||
nt|april7: by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: seems like then passing 1@S wasn't so off the charts then|pg||
nt|psridhar: intra -finesse Position in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: for one loser, play low club from hand to 6 spot in dummy and then later run the Queen pinning the 10 for one loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4 leading teams will play the semifinals at a later date|pg||
nt|psridhar: the intra finesse studied first by Chagas i believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: but then 3@H is hopeless, 3@s works -how to get there after 3@d opg?|pg||
nt|iceking: ok this second dbl is no need for just gives them extra round for info|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H makes because North has no more than 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: good pass by CIMA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When no initial in front of the surname we get the same first name in profiles|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: East's auction is controlled by the lack of a weak 2, so sound.  In that context west is backing off because of the misfit.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Do they play Drury?|pg||
nt|doctorone: yes but with fit |pg||
nt|ritong: very probably|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me would ask N to bid 3N with a @H stop|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Any suit quality is overcallable (is that a legitimate word?) in Italy|pg||
nt|athene: since west hasn't promised diamond length|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: with hearts 3-2   should not be problems|pg||
nt|mcphee: but they may not have this agreement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how the software works|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So one of them should have  P GUERMANI|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then you can give them different first names in their profiles|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: go for the lead they aren't expecting|pg||
nt|ady: better played by west   but K@D right |pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|hedyg: ranking after round 9: http://www.ffb-competitions.net/servlet/FFBAffichageSitePublic.ServletAffSPPASClassement|pg||
nt|ady: Fantonie might try ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|ady: hope for K@H with north   or unlikely ace|pg||
nt|ady: should lead to 11 tricks  as Lebel wont risk heart finesse and drop queen doubleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D is to play 4!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or did I invent a new word?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it's a good idea to pass the South hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: xfer|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by West???|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like all routes lead to 4@h, eventually ... even if South open 3@d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because 3 cards in @D can id 3@H West|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphztt: correction, 1. kepri 2. Djarum black 3. Timah prima 1 4. djarum super 5. international 6. timah prima 2 7. well wise 8. wind runner|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Walter taking notes still|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Did you translate SEF for a start?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes must have thought Roussel has either 6 @hs or at least AQxxx for his bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mamos: declarer has quite a lot of anxieties though|pg||
nt|bessi2: you can say that again.. if you dont have a convention for this sort of hand then just open 1@c|pg||
nt|rmb1: It allows some players to hide their mistakes by saying it was partner|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: interesting bidding is 3nt - 6@c and E is on the lead....|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: West choose to bid pass instead 3@H to give 3 cards in @D|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: so far i'm not in danger of giving up a big club :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: if W bids 3@s, East can infer that his pd did not o/c over 3@D and pass may be , but in practise i doubt that will happen|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: though even then i am not sure one should cover|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|mamos: and is going off now|pg||

pc|cA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Jeff :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.google.is/search?q=overcallable&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:is:official&client=firefox-a   overcallable is something completely different it seems   lol|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bridge_one: my opinion is that is more important to give the information about the looser in @D that Qx in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: disappointing but should be easy regardless, just play winners|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We are back!|pg||

nt|ralfwil: N cannot have 4441 - why! Had discarded the ! honour in that case|pg||
nt|sommer: wouldnt some be afraid of missing a lay-down 3N with the 3@C bid?|pg||
nt|mcphee: west has the goodies|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now that's a good 11-count  :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing spades rather than a second trump will gain on some layouts and lose on others|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: not much for anyone here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easier for us|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3@h or 4?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: according to KNR 20.30  :)|pg||
nt|sommer: wonder what KR mean about that:)|pg||
nt|athene: of course 3-2 trumps more likely than 3-3 spades but that's not the whole story|pg||
nt|athene: because you are ok if someone ruffs from the 3 trumps|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: lamongie might try 2NT at his next turn|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I assume Lamongie will do something spectacular soon|pg||
nt|doctorone: indeed, or 2@d|pg||
nt|ritong: highly unusual after an initial pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @c honour...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3.5@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: if e/w bid game  4@H should fail    3NT  looks to have some chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will they get that high?|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   played by east   likely to fail to a club lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy 6@d can make here, but EW may be better off playing 3N here|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes.. but constructing a hand where declarer needs that @d discard is not easy given a normal 4@h bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s because 2@h is probably a constructive raise and he is not strong enough for that|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@C probably final contract here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mcphee: even so Roland there is zero chance the N layer had any cards and @D continuation is pretty clear I think|pg||
nt|sommer: hmmm..I got 20 only|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Italians are allowed to bid 1@s with the S hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cima should balance after 2@H pass pass|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|pelu: do NS play 4 card @H-opening? - the normal bid in S would be 2@H not 1@s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: make sure you put in all the spots|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphztt: 1. kepri 109 2. djarum black 98 3. timah prima 1 96 4. djarum super 91 5. international 90 6. timah prima 2 82 7. well wise 81 8. wind runner 72|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 level overcalls can be very light|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially opposite a ph pd|pg||
nt|ady: on how e/w bid to 3NT earlier    may well bid game here|pg||
nt|tomi2: south had no bid here but 10 ppints... some play here  1@S as "TO with no 4 spades", this hand would fit perfectly fot this method|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes in partners suit but with no @d bid from S it´s easier to read|pg||
nt|iceking: and S will defend i would assume with all his values in @C|pg||
nt|april7: is is probably upset, thats why he passed|pg||
nt|sommer: good!|pg||
nt|chick: overboard now in either suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South won't save but North??|pg||
nt|mcphee: S finally has them where he wants them|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: W hand tempting though|pg||
nt|ady: also if spades 4-2   likely to lose 3 trump tricks and a spade even with trumps breaking|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|2S|nt|doctorone: N will support @d |pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S not enough in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 3N with 2 balanced hands and 28pts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: so would depîct the hand more accurately imho|pg||
nt|hedyg: no inverted minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: so @D fit was never shown|pg||
nt|psridhar: opposite 1@D opg that West hand looks tempting to me for slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: might have tried 4@D here on the way to 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: well you are ok if you can draw precisely 2 rounds of trumps then leave someone with a boss trump and go for spade ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Those black aces look good|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Partner came in vulnerable against not|pg||
nt|Walddk3: West has great cards|pg||
nt|fann4: At least 11 tricks on the expected @S lead.|pg||
nt|fann4: In fact, declarer will make 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|psridhar: i cant believe Laffineur chose not to support Diamonds !|pg||
nt|mcphee: why would E bid again?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl means to choose between @h and @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: no problems here, all ways lead to success|pg||
nt|pelu: why not ducj trick 1 here?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: this looks down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you dont lead it, you dont have it!|pg||
nt|mcphee: redble perhaps, but 1N lets them off the hook when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would overcall 2@D with Garozzo's cards. I think it's a clear pass|pg||
nt|athene: but letting them draw a third trump might indeed be a bit bad |pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    9 |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztt: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he did stop the @C lead......|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S made in the OR on bd 8, so a new leader.|pg||
nt|tomi2: this double now is dangerous, it should mean that he had no bid because of his good hearts the round before. North can see this can't be true with KQJ7 in his own hand|pg||
nt|mamos: yep South  just had to bid over 2@S  couldnt bear to pass|pg||
nt|iceking: clear pass agree|pg||
nt|sommer: wrong singleton in W:)|pg||
nt|athene: couldn't east double 2@H?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|othered1: East must be really aggressive at other times if west sells to 3@D|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|doctorone: would you try a 2@s (@s & a minor) opening as E if available in your system?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: they are not|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh reading it the wrong way|pg||
nt|kerasidis: he is upset too it seems:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iceking: many here in europe though would respond 1NT with S hand not 1@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: 3 key cards, 5 card support and 15 hcp ...what more required to show that @d support i wonder|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Also, he led it with his left hand; that's a singleton|pg||
nt|chick: there is only one play for this hand (and it doesn't work) .... lead the @DJ and hope that S covers with Hxx|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ??? another @s from S|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|othered1: I like east's actions|pg||

nt|chick: yes, Hx, thanks everyone :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah you play that too? :)|pg||
nt|april7: y, but if W ducks a @H to N, then its ok|pg||
nt|pelu: Paolo will be more upset now :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i wish i could see him now!:)|pg||
nt|athene: near-max for passed hand; both minors; spade tolerance|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: agree Roland with pass, but few pair would overcall at 2@d|pg||
nt|daman: he cannot commit his side to the 3 level with that collection|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|athene: no desire to let opps have it in 2@H :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|daman: his partner merely overcalled|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|iceking: reason there plan is to show week @H raise as 2@H  direct shows some values like 8-10hcp|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3NT+1 on board 8 in OR (no "throw-in" ?)|pg||
nt|athene: well, you don't always have to go to the 3-level; you might be ok in 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe it's a bit pushy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|hedyg: no details to bd 8 OR in movie so we will never know how or why|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|iceking: weak |pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: if 2@S allows for 5 mediocre @S and 6 fine @C, 2@S would be a consideration, but does it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club continuation and 2 down|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, D from East would give a perfect picture of his hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: not the cardplay we used to see in italian topmatch|pg||

nt|athene: will south make a 2-suited overcall?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tomi2: if south had covered the first one, they could play two more rounds of trumps, when they gained the lead back. this way they played only 2 rounds of spades in the defense|pg||
nt|athene: the italian style is that these show good hands, in my experience|pg||

nt|hedyg: E had denied so much as 10 hcps or a good 9 by not bidding drury|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you are in slam here you must choose 6@S rather than 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: reasonable 6@S, not clear they will find it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is there any way to make 6@s? cannot see it|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks cold to me Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is with @S10 singleton|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fann4: The irony is that the 1NT contract in the OR is going to go more than 1 down. There's no justice:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztt: timah prima 2|pg||
nt|mcphee: I like the 1NT opening:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well I supposed a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have no idea re 2NT but I don't like it|pg||
nt|athene: nice 3nt for north when his partner opens 2@H? :)|pg||
nt|daman: a full blooded 17 HCP|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H not nearly as good|pg||
nt|daman: South should bailout in 2@H|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: Borth can make 9 tricks in no-trumps    but wont play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S  unlucky  should be down 1    likely to be bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ natural, or 15+ balanced |pg||
nt|fann4: Does this 4@S show 5 of them, or just a good hand with maybe 4@S? Tough for N.|pg||
nt|april7: slam try!!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will they reach slam here?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet if north had opened 2@H Lauria would have bid 3nt|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphztt: kepri|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 3NT either|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose it was for @C|pg||
nt|bessi2: and why on earth didn't east try to go for the penalty|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes seems 500 was available|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a slam on a finess and a @c lead is needed to defeat|pg||
nt|april7: not only try, N will be inn 6 going 1 dfown unfortunately|pg||
nt|athene: if south had sorry|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they want a better suit than A108xxx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|po-s: maybe "should"|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt this shows 5@ss for sure|pg||
nt|psridhar: Nunes has 2 golden cards @c king and @h ace-certainly worth a thought for slam in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 15-17?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mamos: all roads lead to 3NT|pg||
nt|sommer: if so, S MIGHT invite with two 5-carder|pg||
nt|santyclz: K&R was with me last hand, they valued that at 3.45|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and Q@D protecting form being tapped out as well|pg||
nt|psridhar: but he did well passing 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: as far as he knows they are in a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|psridhar: and yes J9X in trumps |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think that 1D-X showed @h ..dont they play trf there?|pg||
nt|fann4: Hedy, how many boards in this set?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13|pg||
nt|fann4: Thanks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then 13 more|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use 2@h more strong|pg||
nt|daman: reach for the stars|pg||
nt|ady: yes  game would be reached if south elects to open|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S any invitation i would guess|pg||
nt|pelu: and then he can sit and wait a long time :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|tomi2: board 8 was the first positive NS score for Garozzo in this match. Lots of players dreamt of playing (maybe even rubber) against Garozzo and scoring 7 positive scores in a row for ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: 40 years ;)|pg||
nt|april7: now S will be afraid to bid 4@S, otherwise N might go on|pg||
nt|kerasidis: no way now|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt and upwards wld be transfers, forcing to game|pg||
nt|athene: if they are playing lauria-versace|pg||
nt|athene: come on Lauria bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S ask - 2Nt 4333 max|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so now pass|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pelu: so Lauria dont know that pd has a 6 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, if he has shown his hand, logically, he should pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: surprised south made another bid after 2@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: another tricky hand|pg||
nt|mamos: bad breaks in both minors |pg||
nt|tomi2: and in hearts too. only spades could split worse|pg||
nt|mamos: which minor to start with?|pg||
nt|mamos: nothing will work as it happens|pg||
nt|athene: but still if south has followed an invitational sequence...he does have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can try the game ... |pg||
nt|pelu: by passing S just placed himself between 2 chairs :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Chemla will be disappointed to see partner follow to two rounds of hearts at some point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can you make 3NT on a heart lead?|pg||
nt|april7: how could Lauria stay out of slam with 20 P???|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psridhar: this is an easy 450 for Fantoni |pg||
nt|tomi2: playing south for Hx in @D seems a good chance. you lwad J now and if its covered you win the ace and play towards the 10. if not, you lose to north and you can play the ace later ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: hoping to pin the other honor|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: around 25 percent|pg||
nt|athene: well he did get lauria to play it, which never hurt anyone|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: the 3@d bid was too much imo, very encouraging|pg||
nt|tomi2: this would lead to 4@D tricks, 1@S 2@h and 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk3: Like now|pg||
nt|psridhar: and a push perhaps|pg||
nt|mamos: Clubs alone wasnt going to produce enough tricks  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|april7: y, but after BW showing 1 ace might stop in 5|pg||
nt|kerasidis: will count in @h finnese|pg||
nt|ralfwil: want to hear 5@h - or?|pg||
nt|april7: Blqackwood|pg||
nt|april7: I mean after all its  more than 50%, because of the lead|pg||
nt|sommer: N went down in 3NT in OR before|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can block the @H suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A10xx  is enough|pg||
nt|april7: I mean even with the @C lead its 50%|pg||
nt|sommer: good duck!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He is not a magician|pg||
nt|athene: but still 3nt was where it's at|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chick: yes, he didn't take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|chick: I was thinking his coach will have to have a word with him :)|pg||
nt|athene: as usual with 4333 hands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: last chance to stay out|pg||
nt|daman: a pinball wizard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: very difficult decision, but should bid 6 in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very poor game. There was no reason to go beyond the 2-level with South's cards|pg||
nt|daman: I would have been happy to play it in 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: no, i would say the usual action over 1nt with south is to bid 2@D and then if partner super-accepts, you have a think|pg||
nt|daman: South was trying to get something from nothing|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you see if he makes 2@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|nt|ady: laria trying for an end play   wont work|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|april7: now 2 down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: he will take his best shot and hope for @D ace to be onside|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|nt|pelu: he sh know that @CA and @hK out - but pd could have @CA - then a slam on finess after 2 Kings|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|po-s: sleepy East not covering the club|pg||
nt|daman: unl;ess there is a misdefense|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|doctorone: which may explain declarer's play of the Q :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: 10 @C is the key|pg||
nt|ady: tht he would ruff outt spades and exit with a club in xase of some miracle|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 10 @C in West|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but also the 9 of @S is good, if unblock the 10 by East|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3 rounds of spades now, after that pitch from east|pg||
nt|pelu: if now @SJ to Q and K East has to unblock @s10 |pg||
nt|ady: surely at this point  just play for A@D right|pg||
nt|daman: 50%|pg||
nt|athene: he might have some weird tell on the @DA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Unless East has kept Q109|pg||
nt|athene: either a discard or just a feel :)|pg||

nt|psridhar: interesting deals ,,the French sure have a good program in their dealing m/c :)|pg||
nt|mamos: one off may gain imps|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - no @CA - then a RD after the D of 4@c - so for sure Lauria sh know that the slam is max 50%|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playoing also a big mistake by East - it was easy to unblock the Q@S|pg||
nt|athene: well, "easy" is a mild overbid|pg||

mb|1H|nt|doctorone: Declarer may have figured out though that E held 4@c as he held only 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: so a little bit of my prediction came true:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ralfwil: agree peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H likely to be reached|pg||
nt|ady: hard to explain to team mates however if A@D is right and you go down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphztt: ur wlc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can make 4@S without a diamond guess|pg||
nt|pelu: on the 5-5 in black - S in OR bid 5@s over 5@H = 7 IMP fpr Zaleski|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: A flat hand.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course this is a rapid playback|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: But West will likely lead @DK, so ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: I would have bid 2@C as E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S after 2@C isn't strong hand, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: Maybe declarer should have guessed (in spite of no cover). West opened 1 diamond, had shown four hearts and 3 spades - If East has four diamonds he might have bid 3 diamonds - or ...|pg||
nt|po-s: not doubled to start with|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no choice, since 2@d would probably show @hs|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will lose a trick each to 3 key cards |pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: no, just pattern-showing for most people|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: uh oh,,,,,,,,,,,,someone thought a transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: without a club lead   could make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: and someone thought stayman:)|pg||
nt|chick: I suppose he could have hoped for a singleton honor in E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt forcing (in 2/1 style)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: It's extremely unlikely N would underlead an ace in this position, but what can it cost declarer to try the K?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd10 Multon managed down 1 for a push|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S also on bd 11 in the OR.|pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|pelu: Lauria was told @DA in East - first discard @D3|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best     but not much problem in 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: minor lead possible; leading 4-card suit when dummy has 4 is rarely going to set up that many tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but his spades do have good texture so i suppose maybe|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: S know that @Cs are very well placed for decl - so he has to find a activ attack|pg||
nt|athene: certainly this lead gives declarer a nasty moment|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  by an operator with a good memory!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nothing to loose if cover|pg||
nt|april7: now S will make 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT in OR: @cJ to King and @C back - easy make|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone for passing 2@C?|pg||
nt|mcphee: so much for K@D lead:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd like to see the play after a top club and a trump switch|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: moi|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: except Multon went -1 on 1NT while Laffineur went -1 on 4 @S :p|pg||
nt|fann4: so what's the best play here for 1 loser in trumps?|pg||
nt|jkotor: A:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: flip a coin|pg||
nt|psridhar: guessing a finesse is the right play here-2 small singletons vs 2 honors with N , so play of ace is slightly inferior play|pg||
nt|psridhar: issue is only when N has stiff @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 singletons are possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: two small |pg||
nt|jkotor: and 4-0 is only 1 distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: two honors|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: maybe not   can set up spades without using an entry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: losing minimum 3@S and 1@c need to play for @C 3/3|pg||
nt|ady: I said no problem    but may have to play for clubs 3-3  other wise in danger of going down|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: it might be right to rise the ace there trying to block them if lauria has Kx or Qx or something?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: better - then @sJ is an entry|pg||
nt|april7: for double finesse in @H|pg||
nt|athene: maybe that is just going against the odds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|doctorone: me 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: one small card already appeared|pg||
nt|pelu: or a discard on @cQ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fann4: According to Suitplay, the 10 is best. I'm having a look at it.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|po-s: 2clubs might have been artificial (some kind of Gazilli|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not so interested any more|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ritong: i strongly doubt it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: as spec says could do it double dummy   spade finesse on the way|pg||
pc|cT|nt|othered1: If 2@C conventional, all bets are off|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: several people are telling me that the risk-reward ratio favors going down rather than take the finesse and risk a bigger loss|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ritong: gazzilli is even more unpopular than big @c overhere:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is imps, why take the risk?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: can't try the finesse in @H otherwise risk to lose 3@S 1@h aqnd A@C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|po-s: yes, EW might be immigrants|pg||

nt|ralfwil: nice distribution on S1|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly against the "make vul games at imps" meme.|pg||
nt|chick: The formula is ... settle for -1 scores -100 ... take the finesse for 75% x -400 +25% x +600 = -175  |pg||
nt|sommer: thats what I meant by my very first remarc, but stiff honor is only 2,4% and even with 5-6 @S, it only adds to maybe 4%. IF the finesse loses to @DJ, he's 4 down ..thats what you ...|pg||
nt|sommer: must consider in a short thinking period|pg||
nt|sommer: ..per H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have 2 4-4 fits in majors   but no game|pg||

nt|sommer: guess both Q and J works:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: zero|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But still 5 comparisons missing, so maybe the match is closer than we think|pg||
nt|othered1: @C is the NS spot but not easy to find|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-ruff will defeat 4@S - and on a @D-lead: @C to ruff, DQ and @D ruffed in N = down 2|pg||
nt|santyclz: So it's the fact that losing the finesse means -4 rather than -2 which makes the difference.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H by NS and a good save by EW in 5@S, S might underlead @H for a @C ruff, but still only 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now, with 14, pass (instead before choose 1Nt) - this depending on layout of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
nt|tomi2: 2@C seems to be drury, east has a great hand now after finding the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8-12 not compared yet|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a michael's or a ghestem would be more easy here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in South|pg||
nt|othered1: south's hand is just barely in my Michaels range.  Still 3@C not easy to find.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: new suit at level 3 must be 5 cards - so pass by north now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, K97 not nearly as good as a stopper as Q10xx|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: I am a bit lost, I would have thought 3@D shows that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ouch, board 10 cost Angelini 13 IMPs|pg||
nt|chick: -100  against  -175 is small imps.   making the contract is big imps.  that matters, too|pg||
nt|athene: and @SJx is bad too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The difference now is that partner is a passed hand and LHO is not|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT would be suicidal|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
nt|sommer: ... maybe you should see it as losing 7 to your "safe-playing" opp but winning 12!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||
nt|ady: this should just make|pg||
nt|ady: couuld do one better in spades|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|mcphee: no plus score here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, for E-W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: suicide....|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR S also passed the 2@H opening - but after 1NT 2@D - 2@H he passed|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: pham plays weird today  maybe the spotlights are in cause|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Has to guess which suit breaks 3-3 for his 7th trick|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could easily go more than 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although he can take 8 tricks with all cards in view|pg||
nt|mcphee: i predict he will |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
nt|ady: stopped in 2@H in OR on hand 11   woth 5 imps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
nt|mamos: good contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
nt|mcphee: 7@D a little confusing lead for me|pg||
pc|s9|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: boards 10 is typical in bridge competition - 8 cards in a major where the roght contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridge_one: not roght|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk3: Not moi|pg||
nt|othered1: No, since game possbilities are still live|pg||
nt|doctorone: ouff :)|pg||
nt|ady: Nunes playing for 3-3 club or doubleton honor    but not joy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: So it would be an average of losing 7 3 times vs winning 12 once.  A -9 imp long-term position.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|sommer: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
nt|psridhar: double dummy i am sure ...and usually Fantoni plays double dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: still uptrick on a spade return|pg||
pc|d4|nt|doctorone: maybe a second double over 2@s now ?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztt: Last board|pg||
nt|chick: I agree if you are up 30 in the match, better to play safe|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jkotor: W squeezed?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: cash clubs and diamond switch  and down 1|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d-@s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|psridhar: remember Fantoni KNOWS about the @d void|pg||

nt|psridhar: OT no more , squeeze broken|pg||
nt|hedyg: well now he does|pg||

nt|mamos: half right|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Could play for K10x|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|reisig: Pass?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Garozzo not wishing to encourage his partner or the opposition, I know many who would bid 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz: Never mind.  Now that I think of it, that's a non sequitor.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but they are there....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many in Italy use dbl with 17 hcp, but with only 2@C and K sgl in @S 2@H is more correct|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if South could bid a natural 2NT?|pg||
nt|reisig: S couldn't try 2N?|pg||
nt|pelu: ??? dis East open 1@C???|pg||
mb|5H|nt|april7: its a transfer system probably|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But not likely after the 3@D call|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a normal bidding for NS - not for EW|pg||
nt|ady: now to the test|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: makeable with open cards|pg||
nt|april7: best contract by EW|pg||
nt|sommer: the problem here is, you cant say "50% either or, he will go for the 25% fin"...I THINK|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 5@S asks   of kings; 5N would be the first specific suit ask (the order changes depending upon the bidding -- bid suits have higher priority than unbid suits)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps E can find it|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We shal see now|pg||
nt|athene: it might come down to getting a count on south|pg||
nt|athene: do you play clubs to try to count his hand, assuming diamonds are 7-3?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: the tempo has been quick    this auction probably already the slowest of the match   not sure quite why|pg||
nt|pelu: more IMPs comming for Pauncz - stopped in 3@H on the 3NT hand (@Cs 3-3)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 3@d by south, because need to no lose @S, more easy to find 2 @S in South that in North ...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  the natural 2NT bid in competition is on the endangered species list|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcphee: good shift|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry -- was private|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, many player bid 2@S in East - the police for East must be: if i bid 2@S i think to beat 4@H - so pass it is correct|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends if he can get count in clubs'|pg||
nt|ady: there looks and end play for down 2 in 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: well if you find south with 1 trump and only 2 hearts, then u play him for 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South could have 3 spades and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 1 trump and only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but even then you have the choice of pinning the @S10 or double finesse|pg||
nt|athene: if you know spades are 3-2, then you put the king with south and you are left with 2-2 so it's even, isn't it?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AJxxxx and Kxx in @D , north would bid 4@D or 4@c ?|pg||
nt|athene: of course none of that will apply since south does have the two spades :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|mamos: defence can still find Club ruff|pg||

pc|c2|nt|athene: would be a shame to run into a club ruff though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: I guess the other table play makes some sense, because he goes for the smaller set and still has that additional small chance of singleton honor or doubleton QJ|pg||

nt|harmon: enuff already!!|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now it's easy|pg||

nt|athene: 2@H for north?|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Prob 1NT |pg||
nt|paulg:  final board of the round of 16, could be quite close at the moment|pg||
nt|kerasidis: he didnt count in @cQ i think just 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: big recovery for team Pauncz|pg||
nt|athene: gee whizz|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: this competion is at direct elimination - difficult with this hand produce a swing for Angelini|pg||
nt|sommer: same as here..they try to win|pg||
nt|harmon: oyy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they don't like opening weak-twos|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: 1NT by E|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: This is the first of 3 rounds, so it's far from over|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: but Buscaglia has certainly played very well|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl|pg||
nt|reisig: Could happen|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd have bid 1@h with Garozzo's hand, perhaps it shows five hearts for them|pg||
nt|sommer: N is allowed to pass this..and did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Finally, our gratitude to the FIGB for allowing us to broadcast from this prestigious event. As always, Gianluca Frola has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: appreciated by brkidge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|pelu: they never open 2@H :) some hand too strong - some hands too weak :):)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@d with balanced weak is a opener that you will use 50% of hands !|pg||
nt|athene: yes, many forms of precision club basically mean "we open 1@D unless we have some freak hand"|pg||
nt|pelu: why do they have 2@h and 2@S openings on their card??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Look Peter, now 2@h a perfect overcall ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to all spectators for joining tonight. Hope to see you back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: when we will be adding France and Poland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|pelu: bridge is bidders game - even when they play that @d-opening u sh try yo bid first|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards    can make 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: come on giubilo raise your partner|pg||
nt|reisig: 4-3-3-3 opp a passed hand?|pg||
nt|ady: dont think north will accept an invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: last board ty all guys :) commentators and specs!|pg||
nt|sommer: ..not best decission|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: some might have o/c 1NT as E|pg||
nt|athene: sure, just bid notrumps :) we saw earlier... 4333 facing a weak-2@H...always 3nt :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: though the defence to 4@S was poor and loks a swing back|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be they bid 1@H with 4 cards - in this case garozzo choose to pass to try to penalty opps|pg||
nt|reisig: Cima was hoping S had @d King|pg||
nt|ady: pass was  cautious|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sommer: -3 or 4?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|mamos: on 14|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: not 4 @H or 4@S in South, so @H lead is possible|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1 in the glue again|pg||
nt|april7: should make 8 tricks!!|pg||
nt|pelu: also 4@D in OR - Versace pushed over 3@S - but no @H-lead|pg||
nt|chick: good thing, would be very hard to play in 2@C, and everything else is worse|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bridge_one: 5 @H return means 3 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: beacause can't be sgl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 9 @D now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sommer: IF he bids 2@C, dont they play there?|pg||
nt|chick: depends on agreements, but with S's clubs, he might well raise|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|mcphee: yes 2 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere 9@D - after AQJ are free|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|sommer: wich of the 6 hcp do you love that much?:)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|mamos: ty all especially vugraph op  :)|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe they play Gazzili|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe more:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: S put a lot of faith in N holding 4 card @S for the dble|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcphee: that was the last I belive|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes - last board!|pg||
nt|mcphee: tkx all, |pg||
nt|ralfwil: thanks all and bye!|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|athene: oh well they just want to make the match nice and close|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all and good night|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: if E makes @C finesse, then S plays @S again and E makes only 7 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|dT|nt|bridge_one: the force of A A and Q up the declarer - 2@s giving a inviting raise could be used - but pass can work the same - not a sure auction by South|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: there was a sac in 5D  on hand 14    down 2 was woth 4 imps|pg||
