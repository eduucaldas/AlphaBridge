mb|1D!|nt|nicksan: game|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|golfsquash: looks like all games may fail|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|golfsquash: 4@h can be made by starting spades from the north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|nicksan: i don't think he's considering passing, think he's considering bidding 4 H|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Could be a close finish in 3@c|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Is it 100 minutes for 16 boards?|pg||
nt|dburn: slightly surprising that McGann didn't bid 3@h over 3@c - maybe not sure how strong Hanlon is supposed to be|pg||
nt|dburn: 125 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|nicksan: Clearly he has a good hand for hearts now...|pg||
nt|dburn: or possibly for six boards at this pace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|dburn: surprising, that - I didn't think he'd pass with this much heart support|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nicksan: mcGann will go white in the face when declarer ruffs the first trick, but he will get a hundred, will he not?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: and I'm not sure he can beat the contract, if declarer plays on diamonds which looks normal|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|dburn: if he'd led a spade he'd have got 100 - as it is, I think he's on course for -470|pg||

nt|rmb1: North can afford to be passive, but this is the most direct approach.  Hopefully 4@C bid will reap its rewards now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he might take his partner for a singleton @D?|pg||
