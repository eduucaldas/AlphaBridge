nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|3S|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||

mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||

nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||

nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||

nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
nt|trotto: (because if 2 suits are equal priority goes to major suit), 4@d - as explained above, 4@h rkcb @h, 4@s rkcb @d |pg||
