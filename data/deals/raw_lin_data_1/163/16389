nt|othered1: Hi, Gerben|pg||
nt|Gerben42: friendly @c break sees this home|pg||
nt|othered1: with everything very friendly from this point, GIB (who peeks) would likely make an overtrick.  Here, though, declarer is looking for the safest line for 4. |pg||
nt|bridge_one: now easy to make 10 tricks, because A in @C must be in West, so small @C from dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table South tried for game and 3@h failed by a trick|pg||

pc|h8|mc|9|nt|nigel_k:  But East has a 1@d overcall and West has a pass regardless of who has the king so you would normally play for it to be with the long spades|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D|an| |mb|d|nt|Gerben42: when @HK wins your problem is gone: @DA draw @H and run @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @HA @HQ even better|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|Gerben42: you have all intermediates|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 33 points on EW but no slam as far as I can see|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably rdbl have another means (not A @D)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but made in CR|pg||
nt|tomi2: again some "Hamman" 3NT try, this time stopped by west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a moja corka - koshykowke|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tomi2: difficult lead for S. If he hindes his partners spades, 2nt is down, of not it makes (probably with an overtrick) this shows how seldom stoping in 2nt is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  6NT did make at the other table but I agree it doesn't look promising|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: as smart as pepsi?:)|pg||
nt|nagini: nice lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: rdbl means fit in both majors|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: perhaps can S be squeezed in the red suits if W let opps win a @c trick|pg||
nt|tomi2: this lead gives you chances to find @CK|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||
nt|tomi2: @CT then again in normal polish carding would promise the king. agressive lead from Kt9xx|pg||
nt|nagini: just duck|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tomi2: don't know, maybe this pair has special carding agreements vs. slams, but the T seems like a falsecad by kalita|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|nagini: then squeeze in reds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Then South is under pressure already|pg||
nt|nagini: but may be wrong:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H showed the 18+ with @H hand, after that going to slam was clear but which one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: this to give the possibility to defend knowing a minimum of 3 cards |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|tez: is it real or need undo|pg||

nt|ralfwil: -2??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Don't really understand that line at all|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: first trick and the two last|pg||
nt|tomi2: could it cost to unblock @CA in between? even if it does not bring you a trick it can work as a vienna coup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Niegel. Play @cA first and see what happens|pg||
nt|Gerben42: tough hands this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Kowalski played the hearts low-hig and discarded a small @D. maybe north took this as "encouraging"|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: g'day all - no cricket digs pls|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: are they playing with screen?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Olech's overcall was very light|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = max 3 cards support|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|bridge_one: very aggressive|pg||

nt|vugraphp2: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently 1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@H is the normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Funny looking auction, but it was systemic and got to the normal spot.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT was strong bal. 2@D = transfer to @H 2NT superaccept :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play hearts first and they don't break your entries are destroyed even if the diamonds were 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: south showed a stiong hand with spades till now, north is just starting to show what he has. now its some medium hand with @Ds and @Cs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D = repeat xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic light in his favior |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like 3 rounds of spades will get it 2 down|pg||
nt|nagini: boring finrsse|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means = choise the game|pg||

nt|Gerben42: retransfer, thanks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
nt|tez: ty Monika|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 420|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer may not read the lead as short, but it shouldn't matter as cards lie|pg||

nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bridge_one: here 4@S ON also with A@C and @C lead because opener will play A@S and @S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt = 3 cards raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 3@H with 4cards raise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limit +|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tez: @c leads beat 3@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: but we are sure he will lead @d ace or @s ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: normal lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a kinitz told me 2NT is GF|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||

mb|4H|nt|nigel_k:  Need to find a tenth trick though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S must be careful in this contract|pg||
nt|nagini: then wht to win?:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  A low heart from North works because you hold heart losers to one and can still ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But that is looking at all four hands of course|pg||
nt|tez: pls lead partners suit:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: close to open this , i wouldnt but I am a big non-fan of QJ doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Now he made up for it, but .....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: @DQ and @C KQ ill not be such gr8 assets|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Olech still has to guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as they lead low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
mb|p|nt|nagini: think he is too:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so I'm with Klimacki |pg||
nt|Gerben42: p 1m 4@H sounds perfect :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@d probably only with 5 cards|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: this 4@S cuebid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Since West has short diamonds there is a serious risk of going down with trumps 2-2 if you don't play them immediately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Warren :)|pg||
nt|juror1: welcome Warren again :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4nt rkbw|pg||
mb|5H|nt|tez: nice start for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: @DJ should do the trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North know A or Ax in S in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H ask the Q in @D|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|nagini: nice|pg||
nt|nagini: - 1 only:)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bridge_one: many bid 5@S = no Q, 5Nt = Q, 6@C = Q + 1K etc.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Walddk2: When declarer follows with the queen, the jack is a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now seven with K in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Good defence to continue trumps|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with declarers line though it didn't work - this is usually the case only when I am declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me it looks like as S should have played a @s in trick2|pg||
nt|warrens:  trying for 7, but I don't think he'll make 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: we will see endplay soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: maybe with good intermediates I would open it anyway - depends on mood |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: yes, hard also 6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|nagini: dead  man:)|pg||
nt|tez: no need endplay sry|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|warrens:  if declarer plays spades by trying to cash the Ace, he's down for sure, but I think he's down even if he plays towards dummy (assuming East ruffs)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  if he plays a spade, East ruffs and plays another trump.  now declarer has 5@D, 2@S, 2@H and 1@C.  can't even ruff one spade since East can ruff again|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: no way in all lines to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, win first trump, play a club toward dummy, take 3@S, 2@H, 5@D and 2@C|pg||

nt|nagini: = just made|pg||
nt|trotto: because kibs are still asking for Kowaski-Tuszynski's system, I'll explain: after several relays when the distribution is known, 3nt is to play, 4@d is artificial, forcing to ...|pg||
nt|trotto: mandatory 4@h (and then pass on any bid of P) , while 4@c/4@h/4@s / 4nt are preferential blackwoods|pg||
nt|tez: other table bid 3 nt..brave @h|pg||
mb|d|nt|bridge_one: passing a easy 3Nt (lead @H...)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Next set at 12.00 local time, in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|frankaus: what sort of polish name is that  - it even has a vowel or 2|pg||
nt|trotto: bd   10|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like E/W will scramble to 4@S or 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: good choice 4@D|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: ext set at 15.00 local time, in 1 hour and 40 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Just made now. Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He will try to get a club away on the hearts probably|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In case West has the @cA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now remove the @HQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - this is typical playing with 4/3 |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|trotto:  4 @d as  let's says "  signal of End"  . better knowed at polish " wywolanie koncowe"|pg||
nt|nagini: so have some food:):) ty:)|pg||
nt|trotto: e.g. if the opener has distrubution like 3-3-1-6 and the last answer to relay was 3@h, then 3@s = rkcb on @c fixed (because @c are the longest) 3nt to play, 4@c - rkcb on @s fixed ...|pg||
nt|trotto: (because if 2 suits are equal priority goes to major suit), 4@d - as explained above, 4@h rkcb @h, 4@s rkcb @d |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I think declarer will get endplayed in dummy at the end and be forced to give a trump promotion.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally 2 trick in the trump, and after all the goood cards - when opps ruff remain with one trump - now you play last trump and make the rest of tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh well, dead now|pg||
mc|8|nt|bridge_one: no possibility here because no communication to play the last trump after the ruff of @D|pg||
