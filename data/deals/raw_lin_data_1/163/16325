nt|vugraphzwh: TDs ruling: I see no case -- just play on|pg||
nt|sybarra: good for TD |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Allan Cohen asks about "When do we have to decide if we want to appeal the decision" |pg||
nt|jron: Fortunately the TD was sane in his ruling :)|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  need to avoid 4@H    3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H looks promising - trouble with @C lead|pg||
nt|ady: even without a club lead  seems 1 heart 1 spade and 2 clubs Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may inject 1@S which may lead to 3 NT David|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Garbosi Bardin is a experienced pair specialist in MP competition|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Jeff Sapire|pg||
nt|fann4: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and welcome Vladimir|pg||
nt|oliverc: NS playing Precision, giusy?|pg||
nt|sommer: strong @C opening, it seems|pg||
nt|aceg: Hi Vladimir :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 1@D is 0-7(8)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Jeff :) nice to meet you !|pg||
nt|udo: ah, lauria and versace play together today,,,,yesterday they played with different partners|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator Giusy|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Povl and Girorgio |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: and AC got so distracted that he endplayed his pd - so only down 1 and not down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and the answar from the TD is: "After this session it is possible"|pg||
nt|ady: mind you a thin overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One of the world's finest pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Definitely in my Top 3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this match is between two of best formations|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: Thanks, hi Giorgio|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: Ciao Giorgio :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H is good point|pg||
nt|aceg: here 2 players are always in BBO - Garbosi and Lo Presti|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao Giusy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pelu: Jn sh call TD: bad defense by my pd - can u help me? :):)|pg||
nt|ady: was in|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: they will get there now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S is in bergen style|pg||
nt|fann4: That 3@S jump took away East's 2NT for the minors.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Olivieri Arrigoni is a pair that play in national team from 30 years|pg||
nt|sybarra: and have probably played agst each other many times |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Olivieri (ollina) is a familiar face on BBO|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fusari and Marina Causa are a strong and experienced pair that normally play at international level|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: N bid 1@S - S playing 1 NT X OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: 5@Dx is 300|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: ns playing Precision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@D only 300|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Olivieri play always in BO - but also Emanuela Fusari and Arrigoni (GORILLA in BBO) play frequently in BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..and 5@H no chance|pg||
nt|oliverc: North doesn't have enough controls to go on|pg||
nt|sommer: no, agree|pg||
nt|aceg: in this situation is impossible to find the defence, because East with 4333 , so can't raise, and West with A A AKQ can beat if opps are with 2/2 in @d|pg||
nt|sommer: pass as invite is max..and S must X|pg||
nt|aceg: 5@D alone it is a little risk|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the trainer of Arrigoni Olivieri is De Falco|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: i see only 6 tricks for defence|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just made with best defence|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D , 2@S 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hej Povl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Povl :) Welcome !|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Povl |pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: Also Shirley today ! great day :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am trying hard to find the best we have :)|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: we heard the screech of brakes  here stopping at 3 |pg||
pc|cK|nt|aceg: North could have Kx@S and xx@D instead Kxx@S and sgl @d|pg||
nt|sommer: I think I would have invited with a pass|pg||
nt|ady: as you suggested Carl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi david :)|pg||
nt|fann4: This is going 2 down, but EW probably make 9 or 10 tricks in @C|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: ciao Giorgio|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the result of this match is unpredictable|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzwh: I was also distracted on the last board :) --- 5@d dbl -2|pg||
nt|jron: As 4@h is a make it seems Iversen has 10-15 IMPs waiting for them in 15+16|pg||
nt|aceg: probably better 4@D that 3@D|pg||
nt|sommer: lucky game with @HK at RHO and good @S guess|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also in OR great pair, many components of italian team|pg||
nt|sommer: now @s7?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf  for the NS convention card|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|xenya: admittedly 5@D was a risk, but a very small one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and also they play frequently in BBO (Debc is Campagnano)|pg||
nt|sommer: no guess:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|aceg: in the auction - giving the idea to defende also with only 3 cards, also with 4333|pg||
nt|ady: diamond good lead    this may go down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|ady: Hi Giorgio|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the problem in this hand is that E/W don't have game to play - 5@C less 1|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jron: then maybe only 7-12 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: did they go down one or 2 on last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Yes -- I will correct soon :) -- sr -- got distracted by the TD and :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Jan |pg||
nt|ady: declarer relying on hearts    will be dissappointed|pg||
nt|ady: this was better played from west hand|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome Giorgio and Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Roland :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: if north takes this and continues @d then south must unblock @d jack, |pg||
nt|sharkey: S had problems next @S and may make.  E doesn't know S has both @C honors - may think with overcaller |pg||
nt|sybarra: now easy game,  but in 4 would defense be the same? |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the formations of team are: MARTELLINI - MARTELLINI CHIARA - CAMPAGNANO DEBORA - CAUSA MARINA - FUSARI EMANUELA - MARTELLINI SILVIA - PISCITELLI FRANCESCA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzwh: The score in board 16 is now corrected to 5@d - 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 5@d DBL -2|pg||
nt|jron: 2 down so 3 IMPs to Team Dahl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Udo Kasimir|pg||
nt|sommer: there is still a small test in @D, but she should doublefinesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|udo: good evening|pg||
nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|bridge_one: BR.LAVENO MOMBELLO - BERNASCONI GIANCARLO (cng) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Peter :) welcome |pg||
nt|bridge_one: ARRIGONI GIANNA - OLIVIERI GABRIELLA ; FERLAZZO CATERINA LUMIA - MANARA GABRIELLA|pg||

nt|bessi2: no.. he wasnt.. 4th spade.. discard club Q.. now north has top diamond and 5th spade to cash|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and good evening to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 4 imp for Uggeri|pg||
mb|1N|nt|aceg: also 3Nt immediatly over 1@d - opps don't know nothing about thay hands, and if opps dbl bid 4@d|pg||
nt|ady: yes that is right  |pg||
nt|bessi2: that's why he had to unlock the @d jack earlier|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Bill !|pg||
nt|udo: slam NS ?|pg||
nt|udo: hi bill|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably they will call this slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and we had a concession|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ace of @D lead at other table |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: some hands we have got here for the final boards |pg||
nt|sybarra: a real challenge |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: a forcing pass -- a dbl and then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 2@d -- and ...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sommer: and N mislead by leading 6th highest!! unfair|pg||
nt|aceg: 2@d in italy is michael's (they not use 2@c normally)|pg||
nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - but East took what they offered|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is limited raise in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: not a perfect one, but with @H and @C friendly,,this will make|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridge_one: inviting|pg||
nt|udo: other room in 4 @H here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt is always Raise inviting or more|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: no I dont exp that East will D he will bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like Michaels with intermediate hands, because you don't know if you have a fit when partner responds|pg||
nt|sommer: X?|pg||
nt|aceg: 3@C |pg||
nt|oliverc: agree|pg||
nt|sommer: why not X?|pg||
nt|oliverc: 5-9 or 16+|pg||
nt|aceg: because i have @c ...|pg||
nt|sommer: "only" 3 small @D, but good def|pg||
nt|aceg: with only 3@d no chance to play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something like that, Oliver. Either weak or very strong|pg||
nt|sommer: did p promise more than 3c @C?|pg||
nt|aceg: also pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|jron: Lots of exciting boards to come, sp dont go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I was just in my mind thinking about "Drama and fun" :):)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s means a not minimum open|pg||
nt|udo: doublefit makes it playable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Checkback coming I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: @C lead would be better...|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe only -1 now|pg||
nt|aceg: dbl must support the penalty, so it is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: only 4 immediate losers, but Declarer will struggle here, I suspect|pg||
nt|sommer: @C lead would have exhausted N in @S, I think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: 3@h show raise in @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C off ! looks like|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now Kx in @s became very strong|pg||
nt|pitiful:  place your bets....|pg||
nt|sommer: this is very close to make|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: 60-40 for 8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  8 tricks for me :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|oliverc: that will still happen, I think|pg||
nt|udo: 1 more move from North ?|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with AK in @D Lauria must reopen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi William|pg||
nt|udo: lauria s problem are the bad @H s|pg||
nt|udo: @h lead will kill NT contracts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can make this 2@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: 4@s down with the ruff in @H, but a risk to play|pg||
nt|udo: wd,,,,|pg||
nt|fann4: Now South can drive to slam.|pg||
nt|udo: now they should bit it|pg||
nt|athene: well north's hearts are a lot better than three small...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose they use 4Nt RKSB now, and not cue bid generic|pg||
nt|udo: 4 keycards and partner makes another move|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C forces 2@D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bessi2: this may go for 500 since declarer will surely try to make it via @c finesse|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  no chance      4@S  down on obvious heart ruff|pg||
nt|sharkey: phantom sac - also played in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now 2NT is invitational with spades and clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|aceg: good decision|pg||
nt|aceg: need to play @H from dummy|pg||
nt|sommer: but 7 tricks possible|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@D then 6@H ?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bridge_one: 5@d sure - i don't know if 6 or 5 @H - suppose 6 with AQ|pg||
nt|athene: when neither partner is prepared to just take control, despite all the controls being there, that suggests there is a bit of a question-mark over the trump suit...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What's the percentage play in hearts for 1 loser?|pg||
nt|fann4: Surely 6@H now|pg||
nt|athene: south wondering if his @HQ is an extra value at this point|pg||
nt|udo: from my point of view,south has to bid it now,,,north cuebidded 3 times,,,|pg||
nt|fann4: N has made 3 tries.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: about 50% because need @H 3/2|pg||
nt|udo: getting to high ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria showing doubt about hearts is my guess|pg||
nt|udo: i would also drive to game with that North hand|pg||
nt|sommer: the @S suit is "frozen", so E may rise the @C|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: 5@c looks makeable|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should go quickly now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: perhaps better don't move the @S |pg||
nt|sommer: agree..that was fatal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes looks normal to play a @c back?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: A@C and @c with weak trumps could work better|pg||
nt|sommer: @D to J wouldnt be bad play either|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: so say us which is the percentage Roland :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what about   K   J873|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't love the percentage, like Fantoni |pg||
nt|udo: 6 to the ace,,,,,later 10 from table ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asking, I am not sure|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 75 of 68 % ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Suitplay anyone?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I hve a feeling that ace is best|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|udo: small to ace,, later 10 from table,,,forme|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Roberto|pg||
nt|fann4: Suitplay says small to the Q first, interestingly enough.|pg||
nt|udo: hmm,|pg||
nt|ybob: I like A@H first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me no|pg||
nt|athene: suitplay might just be giving the line which gives the maximum expectation|pg||
nt|athene: not the line which is best for 1 loser|pg||
nt|fann4: No William, that is what Suitplay says for 4 tricks. For 5 tricks, run the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But there is more to it here as declarer does not know if he must ruff a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuan: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction, I am very impressed|pg||
nt|udo: yes, i see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ciao Antonio, welcome|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: decl will try to gard against @C 4-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even right-sided|pg||
nt|udo: and the lead helps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|ady: now get out for down 1|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: but he's off the hook...|pg||
nt|athene: well it's pretty good odds the clubs are coming in for two spade pitches|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's face it, we would not get to 5@C, at least I wouldn't|pg||
nt|cuan: Lauria has showed, with 2NT and then 3@S, 5@S+5@C GF|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: so this is anti-percentage we now know|pg||
nt|athene: although perhaps not so good if you use up one of the side entries to play trumps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|nt|ady: 7 imps for n/s|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|aceg: small @C instead A@C would work better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|korszurku: hi all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: in this hand it is possible also to pass at 1NT |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi Balasz|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Blazs  sorry|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|aceg: J@C the best|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Balazs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuan: the lead don't help the defense|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: I will get it right eventually|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good technique, follow with a card you are known to hold (@SK)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|korszurku: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  my partner tends to pass 1NT with these hands, I don't|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fann4: I'm going to check the new updated Suitplay which came out recently.|pg||
nt|sommer: I would trans too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jron: S honest @D the 2nd round gives away the club dist (5@S, 1@h, 4@D alas 3@C|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: A@S @S ruff and @D from dummy may be more safe ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sommer: at that point 7 tricks were safe|pg||

nt|sommer: -2 with @Clead only, I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: Versace shifted to @DK after winning @CK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and was a correct idea|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think odds @DA with pd pretty high|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but i continue to think the ruff of one @S superior|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You never know when it's right to pass so better to transfer all the time|pg||
nt|pitiful:  oh dear, she let me down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the quality of @H is medium, having 7 hcp 1Nt would be a solid contract|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i think playing @s at trick2 was error|pg||
nt|pitiful:  otherwise make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may not be solid at all if opener has a small doubleton in spades and 3-4 hearts|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however the way to lose 1Nt very difficult to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How are you supposed to know that?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes - maybe S COULD have set it at first place, but that needed underleading @SA! ..if I see it rgiht|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oliverc: well now. can EW find 5@D rather than 3NT?|pg||
nt|korszurku: should really be a passout 30 years ago|pg||
nt|korszurku: now even 1st seat might open|pg||
nt|udo: good job to make 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3NT on @DQ - and as I see the finess is with oods|pg||
nt|pelu: but 5@D interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what about 6?|pg||
nt|fann4: Note South's take out dbl of 1@D in the OR (Open Room)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter|pg||
nt|udo: routine 3 NT now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anybody overcall 2@d|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: with clubs 3/3  very |pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays this likely to go down if in game|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see east going to the 5th level at this vulnerability, therefore it looks like a 4@s contract going off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Peter Crouch|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: and even with @Cs 4-2 a lot of play|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually that barely matters,  need to guess the @D |pg||
nt|pelu: u can lose 2@Ds and make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: some specs suggesting 6 @D,  (with the diamond guess) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: remember -- we will finish with board 14 in this room -- and I will bet a coke or anything that the other room will be finished before we get to that board|pg||
nt|jron: 5@D is laydown with @c + @h dividing 5-2 or 4-3|pg||
nt|pelu: that how specht's see the board - all DD :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: @H lead puts paid to 6 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do too, by the way|pg||
nt|sybarra: now bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: vulnerable, so pass is ok|pg||
nt|bridge_one: overall with partner not passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: you werent in the first time however |pg||
nt|sommer: I would risk the 2@D too|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzwh: 3@C explained as: "Natural or just forcing"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a false rever|pg||
nt|bessi2: would have been convenient for east to have a 2@c cuebid available showing the red suits|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give a strong hand|pg||
nt|ady: North 1 heart transfer response showing spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be also 1@H xfer|pg||
nt|bessi2: now I'm confuses.. that 2@s bid.. what system are n-s playing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i hate bidding now|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sharkey: the transfer sequences at the 1 level so common now we fail to mention it at times|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, it isn't safer now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is just asking to be carted out|pg||
nt|sommer: agree..1st time or not|pg||
nt|sybarra: just hope you dont go for 800 |pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: 3 @D should be the good hand now |pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think 1@H = 4+@s, so my commment abot the rever is a mistake|pg||
nt|bridge_one: in this way tell the hand better - interesting but not 2honors in the suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|sommer: ....|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jron: This sequence should show doubt about 3N but E will prob pass anyway bec of good hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: 6 imps to Iversen on board 15 -- 3@s making 10 in the closed room|pg||
nt|aceg: now the chance to no have the lead @H for E/W|pg||
nt|sommer: will N lead his "lousy" @H's?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 3NT|pg||
nt|oliverc: well North might lead something else as he has no entires for his hearts|pg||
nt|aceg: not so automatic the lead @H here|pg||
nt|sommer: ..with "no entrance"|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ..find p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|aceg: the problem is that the lead Q@S is however not nice to make|pg||
nt|sommer: of course|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 3@D seem too much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: DOUBLE|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jron: If he is worried about one spadestopper he might find the winning bid|pg||
nt|pelu: AC taking a pause - in the afterplay he can say: I was close to bid on :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: good grief |pg||
nt|sommer: Christmastime is coming to town........|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet that is S bidding 3 @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: looked like a normal transfer response,  but I can't bid 2@s there with only 3card support|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely north bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: MANY experts would do the same..imo|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: may be a operator error|pg||
nt|sybarra: we missed a pass for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giusy?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i suppose 3@H by North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We need a few UNDOs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@d by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@h by south|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h by north|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8 UNDOs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then pass by West|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: yes, sry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Amazing that North did not double 3@D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: lots of cu bids    but lots of good spades missing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with 3 caqrds support and a sgl out can raise |pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are vul, we are not|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if you ever play with Roland the undo button is the most useful |pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: i think a spade lead is more logical from N's perespective|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|aceg: i would lead @h because i hate to lose the chance to beat the contract with xxx in @H in my partner, and opps with AQ for KJ !|pg||
nt|oliverc: for sure. Hearts look like a pretty poor prospect|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|ady: west pleased to see A@S with south|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes i know that.. but when playing transfer responses 1c-1h- you dont bid 2@s with 3.. especially not when overcall and you have a convenient support dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they don't use support dbl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl means strong hand|pg||
nt|udo: looks like a doubleswing,,,this should make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fann4: I think 1 down|pg||

nt|pitiful:  anyone for 3@c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be interference I think |pg||

mb|p|nt|pitiful:  any other guess as to final contract?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|udo: what about 4 @H EW ?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many @h now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C artificial game force|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fann4: EW did very well to stop in 3@D in the OR. After W opens many East's would be in game (4@h in the 5-3 fit)|pg||
nt|sommer: 4!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 I suspect|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: free 3@S?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzwh: you are all lucky to be able to watch this :):)|pg||
nt|sommer: y|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwh: and remember -- if the match ends All square -- then it is decided by Total Point|pg||
nt|pelu: and lot of small swing - here IMP and total are close - so the swing of 15 can decide in favoor of Dahl|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Remember yesterday when Ole Berg told us that Henrik Iversen was an expert in close matches |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I have been told yesterday that he has lost one and won two against Lars Blaksets team|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And that Iversen has won more than a few very close Cup-matches before |pg||
nt|sharkey: previous hand EW was in 4@Hx off 2 for -500|pg||
nt|sybarra: E has to like her hand now |pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzwh: and Jakob Røjel from the Iversen team has once lost by a ½imp in the World Championship for Juniors in 1993|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12 IMPs to Uggeri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt raise in @S inviting or more|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@C Giorgio?|pg||
nt|udo: yes,looks quite normal to reach 4 @H|pg||
nt|sommer: maybe not @HK much...yet!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuan: 2@D is GF with @D or weak in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ybob: @C lead defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|fann4: I confess I'd be in 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie 4@h is makeable, but  difficult to bid|pg||
nt|sommer: W saves E's neck|pg||
nt|sybarra: protecting k of @H |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@C denotes a diamond fit already, we don't know|pg||
mb|5D|nt|udo: normal bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 3@C have many possibility :) i suppose interest slam, but i amn't sure they use this option|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib suggests ask singleton|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, today is more used this use: asking for shortness|pg||
nt|pitiful:  on a @c lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spade is the best lead but declarer can prevail on this layout|pg||
nt|oliverc: needs to attack Diamonds before drawing trumps, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: sorry, scrap that|pg||
nt|bessi2: relly.. I haven't seen that yet... so isolated here you know|pg||
nt|sharkey: best lead I think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: depending how you use 2Nt - if 2nt can be unbalanced hand is usefull can ask about the distribution|pg||
nt|sharkey: Commin in Norway to use mini splinter on East's hand - 3@H = min inv values in @S and stiff @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: *common|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: I had the NS hands intermingled :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade ruffed, heart to dummy, diamond finesse. Another spade. Still home|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But you need some luck in the red suits now that you are getting tapped|pg||
nt|xenya: alternatively, you can just play diamonds from hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fabio Lo Presti had many big ingternational results when he was a junior but we have not seen much of him for quite a few years now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the team with the di Stelio brothers|pg||
nt|aceg: Roland, in Italy isn't easy to play in national team :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can say that again|pg||
nt|aceg: also for great players |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Di Bello brothers rather, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stelio was one of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Furio the other one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lo Presti's partner was Francesco Mazzadi|pg||
nt|oliverc: might well opt to play @D's from hand here given the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this is normal auction|pg||
nt|korszurku: needs a club to beat it|pg||
nt|fann4: Needs a @C lead to beat it, but should be forthcoming.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes!|pg||
nt|pitiful:  reluctant @d support by east|pg||
pc|h4|nt|aceg: isn't a east hand to play !|pg||
nt|udo: @H also possible ?|pg||
nt|udo: :)|pg||
nt|fann4: woops|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however is a game that must to play this 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand that she does not want to cue bid @HK, but why not 4@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: kx of hts doenst feel like great holding   |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3NT is too much conservative|pg||
mc|13|nt|aceg: easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
nt|ady: should manage 10 tricks one way or another|pg||
nt|bessi2: wonder what line declarer will take here.. @s ace.. ruff diamond.. club up.. then Q holds go for crossruff maybe|pg||

nt|sybarra: unless u have not agreed 2@C is GF with @D fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: no, but W has made a strong slamtry..without @DAK + @SK|pg||
mb|2C|nt|thorvald: +5 ekstra, and this looks like a straightforward hand. 3NT one down - or even 2 NT making, but still the last hand will be decisive|pg||

nt|pitiful:  to make 11|pg||
nt|sommer: these 3 keycards are enough for E|pg||
mb|3C|nt|thorvald: 120 here will be 6 imps, and a lead of 11 before the last hand. missing the grand will then result in all square|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 IMP for Iversen = +11 - so a gamesving  or(slam-swing) in last board = even again|pg||

nt|fann4: Looks like Lauria is using Puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, for sure|pg||
nt|fann4: Looking for a 5 card major.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|aceg: not forcing only pass (of course:) and 3@S in this aution|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a feeling that 3@S shows a doubleton, so Olivieri was reluctant to play this in NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|thorvald: and there will not be extra boards, but a calculation of most scored points - makin Dahl my favorite as they have the biggest swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S play a system similar at polish - 1@C can be also weak balanced - a lot of relais|pg||
nt|fann4: And 3@D shows one or two 4 card majors.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with xx in @C is right to search a fit in a major|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, 3@s doubleton|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|jron: 750 is 12 IMPs isnt it?|pg||
nt|thorvald: green so it 500 and 11 imps|pg||
nt|jron: ok|pg||
nt|bessi2: n-s come to a rest in their best contract.. but with clubs breaking badly.. missing a 9th trick it seems|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|thorvald: and 750 is 13 imps as far as I recall|pg||
nt|sommer: realy?|pg||
nt|oliverc: needs another @H here to stop a Diamond ruff with the Ace|pg||
nt|bridge_one: push board = wash board = no swing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: private|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: however push board here :)|pg||
nt|udo: safest line ?|pg||
nt|udo: @D now|pg||
nt|udo: and when ducked, give up a @S ?|pg||
nt|ybob: @D to Q and @C later|pg||
nt|udo: or high @S now ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: first need to make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|cuan: 12 imps to zaleski when Uggeri-Astore in open room go down in 3NT, where Lauria did 5@C+1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: EW invite leads?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no end game with 3@h in West|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless W shifts to @H...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: if west should switch to a @h now and declarer ducks then may make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: West thinking not a good sign for E|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't make the same - he lose 1@H and 2@s - in the final sufficient 1@D for E/W|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sommer: 12 fast tricks |pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: All kibs wud return @SK - but different at table...|pg||
nt|udo: @C now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D is safe line|pg||
nt|ybob: cold 9 if @C are 4/2 too|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|ady: on hand 10 there was a diamond lead against 5@S     delarer ruffed and played a club towards the queen before cross ruffing for 11 tricks     trump lead may have left it one short|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 deserved IMPs one has to say. Superior bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|fl j: they bid it also, just see|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: sorry   hand 20|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would prefere @S and not @D now|pg||
nt|sommer: not soo fast anymore:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - as as you mentioned trump in 3rd trick may have left 4@S one short|pg||
pc|s5|nt|udo: safest is @D and tha give a @S ,, for me|pg||
nt|udo: than|pg||
nt|udo: 3@C,3@S,1@D,2@H|pg||
nt|udo: or time for @C|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|bridge_one: fast ... need a squeeze|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jron: that would be heartbreaking; losing losing on total scores after you miss a grand slam|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to make 3@s 1@D 2@h 3@C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|thorvald: 6NT with 13 tricks will only loose 10 imps and win the match |pg||
pc|c8|pc|hT|nt|sharkey: N playing this carelessly I think - shud have played @C honor 3rd trick to verify 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: before looking for overtricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|udo: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|fann4: As we can see, playing a @D was not safe at all - the contract could be in jeapordy.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|udo: now needs clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|udo: yes, the bidding to 5@C was great|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|udo: 1@D ok, but not the econd|pg||
nt|fann4: Now he needs @C 3-3 or the @SQ to fall (everything works)|pg||
nt|udo: second|pg||
nt|sommer: expected an automatic endplay|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuan: the aces in the minors are in a good position, for the declarer , and the trumps are 3-2. But 4@S is the normal spot |pg||
pc|d6|nt|fl j: now they dont have too. just take 13|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: to get back to the bidding, what should W bid with fewer points but longer hearts?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|korszurku: far from best play, but will win 2 imps|pg||
nt|korszurku: bridge is like life :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: But NS in 6@C OR so............|pg||

nt|thorvald: the extra trick here gained nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Last board of this finale|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Jan,  great job as always! |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: after 47 boards then the last board decides it all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and what about a preempt to start with|pg||
nt|aceg: weaker pass or 3@s - this is the reason beacause i don't like to use 3@C with 5/5 medium force|pg||
nt|bessi2: if declarer had ducked @h trick 2..  then another spade, then in a position to strip west out of his Major cards and tucking him in with a @d honour  for an endplay I think|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR, South faced the dilemma of what to do over a t/o dbl with a very weak hand - bid the 4 card @C suit at the 2 level, or keep it low by bidding 1@S on a 3 card suit.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can play 4 trump, A@d and @d|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so no ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here we go|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told Iversen in the quarterfinale was down by 16 imps with 2 boards to go -- and WON |pg||
nt|thorvald: What about a practical 3 NT on the south hand ?|pg||
nt|jron: Cohen probably thinks they have a bad round so he decided he needed a swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I am told by the TD -- who was captain for the team Iversen beat|pg||
nt|jron: Right he was|pg||
nt|fann4: What's the panel's opinion here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jron: difficult now to bid it w precision|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS will belive they are ahead - and dont need to gamble on grand, or..??|pg||
nt|thorvald: Now the cant miss the slam, but still some work to do to get to the grand|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I can hear that Iversen is thinking :) -- he is at the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|pelu: 6NT is only 10 IMP!|pg||
nt|sommer: not after 3rd @H to table...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w 26 pts   no game likely to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked to bid my longest suit, so I will|pg||
nt|fann4: Always a good idea:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|oliverc: agree|pg||
nt|korszurku: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: also because 5/5 30 is very different from a 55 03   - and 55 KX  x  completly different from 55 x  Kx|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to think EW had a systemic misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - N assumed @C broke - could still have ducked @H second time |pg||
nt|fann4: I'm a 2@C bidder too - don't like the idea of faking bids in a major.|pg||
nt|udo: with 4 small @C s and Qxx in @S i like 1@S; here i prefer 2 @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, at second trick J@H not K from hand|pg||
nt|sommer: ... that is a new option:)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2@C because they use 1Nt constructive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why must I invent a suit I don't have? It's different if I am 3433|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but many times it´s correct to duck from the aces.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some would view west as too strong for 1NT despite the poor shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads also against NT|pg||
nt|udo: normal contract here|pg||
nt|cuan: many times is so, Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many 3rd/5th leaders switch to 4th against NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)|pg||
nt|sommer: there was 12 already from the beginng|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@h is 5+5+ strong|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzwh: Incredible !!!|pg||
nt|pelu: so Iversen will win by 1 IMP|pg||
nt|thorvald: That missing imp can be found many places|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: a cup-finale decided in the last board -- by 1 imp|pg||
nt|jron: No, you think so :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: 3@s now i suppose|pg||
nt|sommer: then I think, 3@H was a bad bid...4@C should be obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S fix with slam interest|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sommer: slampotential!!..but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..not this board:)|pg||
nt|sommer: no @C stop|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: ok sorry need to take 13 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with this lead can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fann4: I wonder what 2NT by Lauria would have shown?|pg||
nt|korszurku: after wests pass, what are the odds that partner doubled because he was too strong for a direct overcall?|pg||
nt|korszurku: easts pass, sry|pg||
nt|korszurku: I would expect the odds are quite good for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: declarer in with a chance now.. but must time it perfectly.. |pg||
nt|korszurku: so why give him false ideas?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now a easy stop|pg||
nt|sommer: think a bit and pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: 13 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I just have to count --- says Bjørg |pg||
nt|fl j: send wishes to Bjørg, Henrik & jonas, my training of him was good Any flag !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jron: Right she is :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: and then explains a plan -- and EW accepts -- 13 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Jeff, 2NT is anough with a 4333|pg||
nt|fann4: Most people play dbl then bid NT is about 19-21|pg||
nt|udo: 2NT enough for me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Yes, typical of women :)|pg||
nt|sommer: lol|pg||
nt|sommer: good you didn't correct me to: "Wait a bit and pass":)|pg||
nt|sybarra: STOP IT,   more typical of man since he suggested it |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you'll get 87 messages from specs|pg||
nt|bridge_one: :)))))))))))|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giorgio|pg||
nt|sommer: I was nice!!!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jron: Congrats to Iversen :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to all the commentators along the way |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: I dont know if EW are going to appeal the TD decision -- but I will let the room be open|pg||
nt|thorvald: keep the table open until we get the official result|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And then we will see|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: And I will tell you what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: so the call on TD in board 15 and the misdefend on board 16 was the key-board|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: The Dahl team is starting to count the score just ½m from me|pg||
nt|sybarra: we certainly can not  complain about the exciting boards|pg||
nt|fl j: nice "ugle" game when it go for 1 up/down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: There will be no appeal -- it seems -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: so result is: Iversen team won with 1imp !|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Not sure what's best. Any views?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: one now :) from Italy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|aceg: 3Nt isn't a good music for South - the points in @S arn't interesting to play slam|pg||
nt|udo: i play 3 /5 th also ag. NT,,,,buth high from 3 small|pg||
nt|udo: i am happy with that|pg||
nt|cuan: no Roland, Alfredo e Lorendo leads 3rd and 5th against trumps contract. Against no trumps they lead in attitude |pg||
nt|udo: but not sure whats better |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: avoided heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: thats why we call you guys "boys"  you never change |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: I am also NV, no need to chase thin games. With this said, I don't play as well as Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so maybe he added a point or two for his declarer play|pg||
nt|udo: interesting @D lead, btw|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i agree with 3Nt over @C of my p - impossible he can understand, with anything like Kxxxx in C and nothig out to call game|pg||
nt|fann4: That's true - Kxxxx would miss a game, but what about all the other holdings?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: difficult with pass pass by opps my p with zero|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: 2, 22, 42, 62, etc,  always the same  :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: last @C|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Then the 2 from J9xxx was a little much one could argue|pg||
pc|s4|nt|korszurku: In any case, I would rather play 3NT than 2@S :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to know to be without one control in a suit before game is important, because there are the possibility to lose A K and one ruff, so important to stop at level 4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: another trump|pg||
nt|ady: still should be a trick short|pg||
nt|bessi2: well... now it seems to make.. if north had discarded a heart and let south play another spade.. declarer had to decline the @d finesse. play Ace then Q of @d and later take the ...|pg||
nt|bessi2: ruffing finesse against n's @d jack.. not enough entries for both|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West win playing A@D and Q@D against the best counterplay|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now the best for defence is to play @H and @S|pg||
nt|ady: much easier for us to find winning line|pg||
nt|bessi2: why would north ruff south's trick there I wonder|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Riccardo is thinking ?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sharkey: may have missed something here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can have also xxxxxx @C and akxx in ! to make the contract|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: age 2, age 22,  etc |pg||
pc|sT|nt|aceg: East is helping the declarer|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@S in North probably 4@s+long in a minor|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|cuan: wow|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|aceg: dbl means point but less of 10|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me, east is way off the graph|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sommer: difficult puzzle here|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure I agree with south sitting in 3@s if 3@s showed Hx and 5@D|pg||
nt|fann4: As West is the danger hand, there's a case to play a @D to the K and back to the 8. If it loses and they switch a @S, play for the @HQ to fall.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now K@D and finesse at the Q in West|pg||
nt|udo: if no @H queenwhy not @H s first , jeff?|pg||
nt|fann4: I'm thinking about it Udo:)|pg||
nt|udo: why not @H  s first?|pg||
nt|udo: when the queen doesnt appear, play @D s from top|pg||
nt|udo: if it falls,  play @D finesse in the safe hand ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: declarer can lose all @C if west take the trick|pg||
nt|fann4: @HAK first looks better, agreed.|pg||

nt|bessi2: reason|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|vugraphzwh: Now the TD has decided that the play has to continue -- and he will return with a decision later|pg||
nt|jron: yes on the actual hand it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Allan Cohen means that a @h from S at trick 2 might have been a possibility|pg||
nt|jron: A heart is never right when partner encourages diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: Now Iversen asks Cohen what he was thinking about after 4@s from his partner ---- and I think there seems to be a lot of "bad" things discussed|pg||
nt|vugraphzwh: hmmm|pg||
nt|aceg: the only chance, knowing K@D in North, is for 10 8 doubleton in South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't like 3@S - using a system with weak open need to introduce any relais to give this kind of raise|pg||

nt|bridge_one: may be pulled the worg card from bidding box, i HOPE|pg||
nt|vugraphzxm: 5@d cue|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fann4: In the OR, declarer played a @D to the K and finessed on the way back, going 1 down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|aceg: a classical dbl by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I agree Giorgio - sounds like 3@S was 2/1 style showing 10-11 HCP and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c by South ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cuan: i ask then to Alfredo & Lorenzo something about this bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: what a shame that 6@S goes down |pg||
nt|Walddk2: apparently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@D cue is a invention|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could be only @D +@H raise - East would bid 5@H however|pg||

nt|ady: taken by the king|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: I like 1@H - 2@C takes up too much space|pg||
nt|sommer: 2@D = MA|pg||
mb|p|nt|aceg: and natural 2@C ! very rare this auction at our days|pg||
nt|aceg: i don't see what bid out 2@D here|pg||
nt|udo: what about 7 @D s ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 'can' go down rather|pg||
nt|korszurku: even 5 goes down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  regardless of the merits of 5@d east cannot pass it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@d was not timid|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@H is a good option - but 2@c give all: points, raise, and possibility to play in a major|pg||
nt|bessi2: the cards arent lying very friendly for n-s this set|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@S down with K@C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good lead, Garbosi avoided a spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the have now played close to 9o boards - all are tired|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - this may go down due to the @D break|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: 5@S down with C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have a better diamond fit now than on 7|pg||
nt|sommer: true|pg||
pc|h2|nt|aceg: 8 hcp, so probably 2Nt or 3@C work better|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: correct to duck the K|pg||
nt|ady: west may quietly exit with a trump|pg||
nt|fann4: The dbl is Lightner, calling for an unusual lead, or showing a void. EW may run to 7NT now.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: and tempers probably frayed |pg||
nt|jron: trying TD to get S to play a heart is poor sportmansship, in my opinion. What do you say about this, Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was wonder what count attitude they played,   but agree,  why would S play a @H?  looking at K |pg||
nt|xenya: EW have certainly got their wires crossed... |pg||
nt|udo: bidding challenge hand|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D from East:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|fann4: Not often you see someone keeping quiet not vul with a 8 card fair suit, as did South here.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South can't make 7@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not West either for that matter|pg||

nt|sommer: ..and keeps @SK as entry!|pg||
nt|sommer: = more @H or @C and @H from table|pg||
nt|aceg: if play @D, North duck, and after south can ruff a @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bridge_one: could try 7Nt after dbl|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nothing to think about|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jron: card|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with no signal in @Ds (for example the q)  the spade looked obvious |pg||

nt|vugraphzwh: Bjørg explained that she was thinking about continue @d -- not continue @hs|pg||
nt|fann4: can't be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When Lauria leads @C3 you play a diamond back immediately|pg||
nt|udo: only -1 ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strange - return @D ruff again |pg||
nt|bridge_one: after K@C,,,|pg||

nt|bridge_one: and also 5@c down|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|fann4: There's still way to go, so the match is far from over, but seems to me that the UGG team are just giving away too much.|pg||

nt|bridge_one: i am afraid about the operator|pg||

nt|sharkey: Shud be a part score battle here |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6@D is not a bad contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, better small @H at end|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: On bd 13 NS stopped in 4@D, so another 6imps to UGG|pg||
nt|cuan: 2@H ?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: slam makes here but i can't see anyone bidding it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Probably a two-suiter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|udo: not a good slam here,,but a making one:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: if west learns of a singleton heart opposite, that is not good news|pg||
nt|cuan: opening, probably, not weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The question is if it promises 5-5|pg||
nt|cuan: i think so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told it shows 5-5 but denies an opening hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a fine opener for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Previous hand was cold for 6@S on a @S finesse and @S and @D behaving|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 too high|pg||
nt|athene: if he heard a singleton diamond, he might wake up a bit|pg||
nt|cuan: but that is an opening hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Not much of a battle...|pg||
nt|athene: or club|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|sharkey: S refrained form introducing his @D...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: probably 3Nt balanced maximum|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@s probably until 19 - so forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: a slam at 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Yes, but N-S can make 3@D'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 2?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt rever at Nt 18/19|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally people bit 2Nt over 1@d|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk3: so 1 down in 3@S is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: The momentum is taking them to slam - a very poor one that makes.|pg||
nt|udo: will bit it now,,|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm if EW know what they are doing, they are overbidding...if they don't, they may be getting lucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: does seem pusilanimous |pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: nobody would stop E/W to call slam now|pg||
nt|oliverc: 5@H by West might end it|pg||
nt|fann4: Exactly|pg||
nt|cuan: @S6 is 3/5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: West's inability to show any Club Control will worry East|pg||
nt|sommer: 50% slam.. but no squeeze to make up for the losing @D fin|pg||
nt|athene: but a heart lead might take the contract down as declarer may refuse the finesse then find he needs it when trumps are 4-0?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: what was 5@H?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess @D lead is much more likely with that very weak south hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Took a low spade to beat it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bridge_one: East have the best possible hand - also over 5@h must call slam, i think - otherwise 4@D was a mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be beat with South as declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it's making by N too|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: although actually that does need specifically @DA oppposite|pg||
nt|athene: normally when u lead a singlton, the trump ace opposite is OK too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes - low @s would beat making 4@S and A@c|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: but here south knows his partner can't have the @SA|pg||
nt|athene: (he hasn't got any spades)|pg||
nt|athene: so that basically halves the target you are aiming for|pg||
nt|fann4: Giorgio, any idea about the 5@H response?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|sommer: of course, it's bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|udo: he doesnt need the @H finesse with @C King and @D queen wellplaced|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: 2key + Q of @S|pg||
nt|athene: he has a problem with the 4th @D, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@H is 2 and the trump Q?|pg||
nt|athene: with trumps 4-0?|pg||
nt|fann4: What is 5@S then?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he must play all finesse after this lead|pg||
nt|athene: he needs @HJ too after the 4-0 break is revealed|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2keycards + Q of trump|pg||
nt|athene: unless he is going to play for a red-suit squeeze on north|pg||
nt|fann4: Right. But he bid 5@H!|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|sharkey: N passed OR 4th seat??|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|athene: but when he finds the layout in spades and diamonds, it's better odds to play for south to have the @HQ i would have thought|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: ok, this really didn't happen :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: a crossruff now for 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bridge_one: with sgl in @D in South probably long in @H in South, so the squeeze is inferior at the finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: strange...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: I think 6@D is biddable in a natural system after 1@H|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I cannot let board 30 go. I think 4@s will go down with repeated @h from the defence. @s9 will get a trick|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 1@c 2+, so 2@C forcing game|pg||
nt|sybarra: inverted |pg||
nt|bridge_one: no, a real new suit|pg||

nt|sybarra: but a good hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: hence "inverted" |pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, like 1Maj pass 2@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes :) similar at inverted|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bridge_one: but without fixing the suit of @C|pg||

nt|ady: 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kib say me that 3Nt is 3 suited hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: 2NT some sort of game forcing relay|pg||
nt|bridge_one: strong|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 4@d cue|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Time to cue spades then|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: north very minimum   2 aces   but little back up|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: )could be also RKBW with this gadget used frequently oin the world|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would make sense as 5@C shows 2 keycards with @CQ|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt for @H - 2@h probably relais balanced hand|pg||
nt|xenya: aha|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@c cue|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@H without control in @s|pg||
nt|sommer: S missed his fake splinter in @S:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: like natural|pg||
nt|fann4: Not likely with 19pts|pg||
nt|fann4: Though we don't know their methods.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: tricky hand to play on that lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, this is true|pg||
nt|athene: if the lead is a singleton i don't think you have that much chance|pg||
nt|athene: you are going to lose two clubs and one in each red suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is destined to fail by a few tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice done |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: cue @S only with A - probably 3Nt means sgl @s ...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: for beginner, now 4@d would be control in @S !|pg||
nt|sommer: right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: same contract as OR|pg||
nt|athene: rising ace will be right if it's J10x, but is that really likely?|pg||
nt|fann4: If you put up the Ace|pg||
nt|udo: dont see his plan now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, West could have @HK instead of QJ and then you want to be in 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuan: perhaps, 2@D here, is GF with diamonds or weak in hearts|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: very tricky indeed now|pg||
nt|reisig: For me ..Ace is strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was room to ask for it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: if he draws trumps, no heart ruff...if he doesn't, there is a club ruff|pg||
nt|fann4: Say he had finessed the Q. Still not sure how he gets 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|udo: after finesse is easy|pg||
nt|udo: draw @S and duck a @C|pg||
nt|athene: finesse @CQ and you draw trumps then just duck a club|pg||
nt|fann4: Of course, right.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They always seem to find the best leads. They are much too good for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although you may argue that Versace should have switched to a club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: 2@d can be Gf in @d, weak in @h or weak with a fit in spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: if 1@c artificial could be long in a minor, also @C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a hand suited for it in my opinion. Too much outside, too little suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: EW have 5 top tricks against 3NT but they may not take them|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 1@c maybe 2 cards ..I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Next set in 2 hours and a wee bit after a break for dinner|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 21.45 CET|pg||
nt|sharkey: undo pls|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 8:45 pm UK, 3:45 pm New York, 12:45 pm Los Angeles|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes - 1@C 2+@C|pg||
nt|udo: against 1 @C 2+  i would bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: if you pass over 1@S because "2@C is risky" you end up having to risk 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: better 4@h that 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not pretty|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they "own" the spade suit |pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: which is riskier?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|cuan: tx Roland, and bye all|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bessi2: I don't see declarer divining the @h position|pg||
nt|udo: i would never pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may never see declarer play the trump suit |pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: They can just play another diamond|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Last set in 1 hour and 20 minutes after a break for lunch|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: Ty for watching at all :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|udo: south stole their 4-4 fit:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more safe to entry with 1Nt over 1@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bessi2: though the imminent @c ruff may give him a better chance to do so|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|reisig: seems -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk3: He must be fearing a club ruff sooner or later so perhaps he should have cashed @HA first|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bessi2: nahh.. Q now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: Denmark-Norway now..women handball, that is:)|pg||
nt|udo: this is last bord of the set ?|pg||
nt|fann4: 1NT with a singleton doesn't look right to me|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with @S lead in the previous hand an easy 4@s + 1 in OR|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
nt|athene: it is a singleton ace - that makes a bit of difference, i think|pg||
nt|fann4: true|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|bridge_one: 1Nt is the less worst bid for West|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk3: still down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lost, nothing new|pg||
pc|s3|nt|udo: this is bord 16,,,,thank you guys,,,was fun as usual|pg||

nt|bridge_one: THX all for watching !|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|bessi2: cashing ace of @h first often helps the opponents get their ruff.. not easy|pg||
