nt|nigel_k:  Getting clubs right does give declarer 11 tricks and South is squeezed in the red suits|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Even after guessing clubs it is not over because other squeezes could work and you can't play for all of them|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  You may as well cash three spades because the suit is blocked so not useful as a two card menace|pg||

nt|ralfwil: -2??|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Don't really understand that line at all|pg||
nt|vugraphp2: first trick and the two last|pg||
nt|tomi2: could it cost to unblock @CA in between? even if it does not bring you a trick it can work as a vienna coup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Niegel. Play @cA first and see what happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: Kowalski played the hearts low-hig and discarded a small @D. maybe north took this as "encouraging"|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and welcome to Frank Budai|pg||
mb|1C|nt|frankaus: g'day all - no cricket digs pls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H = spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: but with @D ace he could affort to discard some club, even the queen|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Deep Finess will insist of grand slam here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Olech's overcall was very light|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nigel_k:  If you play diamonds first and they break you now have 11 tricks and can play for a squeeze|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  real view wll lead to @s game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: No-one can double so he will get away with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Low from a doubleton in Poland|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If you play hearts first and they don't break your entries are destroyed even if the diamonds were 3-3|pg||
nt|tomi2: south showed a stiong hand with spades till now, north is just starting to show what he has. now its some medium hand with @Ds and @Cs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: traffic light in his favior |pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/liga/liga2010-11/pierwsza/LIrunda10.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: since they are GF now 3@D shows some interest, north has two aces, maye he will try for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: if south had a better @H stopper and not such great fit, he would bid 3nt over 3@C directly|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: then South will also score his @H10|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: what if South doesn´t have the club king?|pg||
nt|nagini: claim 7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tomi2: then he has 17 points and opens 1@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Oh well, he gets a small heart anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can score @H10 as well|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No ideal bid for Kalita here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess one has double although that would indicate four spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: he could cash @S before to have 9 tricks for sure and finesse later or catch the singleton queen and play @S10 and then the other spades|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that was the way, yes|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|nigel_k:  Some pairs play that double shows spades and 1@s denies them|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No game makes for N-S but that's because South has no opener (in my view)|pg||
nt|nagini: sped for to be down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise hands like North have no good bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: agree - only 25 zars - do u like zars  - i'm a fan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like popcorn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: zars the same as smarties?|pg||
nt|frankaus: zar's hand evalution system  - link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, I stick to the 4321 scale but I am no fan. It is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|tomi2: Let me try to introduce the format they are playing here. This is the Polish Premiere League. 16 Teams play a compleate round robin on thwo weekends, so they will finish sunday but ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: then the "fun" will start. The field will be torn into groups of 4 - basicly its most important to be top 8 after sunday|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|tomi2: then the teams will play one "K-O" against teams from their group, the first 8 may still become Champions, the last 8 try to avoid getting relegated|pg||
nt|tomi2: south just shows a balanced hand with 6 clubs and probably 3@S and not a good heart stop. interesting what north makes with those information havin 2 hearts only too|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|trotto:  2@d = ask , 2nt 6 clubs , 3 @d relay ,  3@s= 3226 = , 4 @d - end signal( call P for bid 4 @h) 4 @s  = game @s sign off|pg||
nt|trotto:  tuszynski after  3 @s  bid knew about risky  to play  3 N    doubletons @h mirror|pg||
