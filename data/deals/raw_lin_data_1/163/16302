nt|sanjib:  Kiran has appealed for one of brds ... Appeal Committee is looking into |pg||

nt|rv: delcarer had to guess whether South is 5-1-5-2 or 5-1-4-3 with latter option Venky would have doubled 2@h|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  unblock of@c dangerous... wasn't it best to return @Cj ?|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|rv: in my opinion both Venky and Agarwal erred though it is easy to see it all from here|pg||
nt|rv: that is why many say, if you want to best declarer play, defense etc you will invariably witness those in first 3-4 days of tourney|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  4@h seems to hv kept in the other room|pg||
nt|panja: with 5431..and just 15 HCP, 2Nt all by himself....is a little too risky for South..so it had to be 5521|pg||
