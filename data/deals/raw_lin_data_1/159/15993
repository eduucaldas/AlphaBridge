nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Robin :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play a rather peculiar system. Opening bids of 1@H and 1@s show the other major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi all|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi Ribin...|pg||
nt|viren169: Rosen has a little work to do in this set!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Crouch needs to win by 38 to overtake Rosen, but then they could both be overtaken Teltscher.  20 boards to go|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S by E/W here unless N/S gets in the way.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good evening everyone |pg||
nt|viren169: Hi David|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Provisional position before the last stanza: Crouch 126, Teltscher 124, Rosen 123|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi David|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Battle about to commence|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Pretty excisiting|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Good morning. Welcome to the final round of the English Premier League.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: exciting  even|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: They might get lucky if they overbid--but the odds favour a club finesse if they get to 6@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Rosen Leaders, Crouch in 3rd|pg||
nt|iain sime: It is now very close.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Ralf.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: With North be forced to 4@H?|pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking same |pg||
nt|sybarra: or does he just bid it now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: "forced" is perhaps not the right word|pg||
nt|mdgraham: imaginative 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to London for the English Premier League. Seven matches of 60 boards. This is the second segment (20 boards) of a match from the last round|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@S or 1N here?|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: not sure where e/w play this hand a above the 3 level |pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Rashed!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is John Vos|pg||
nt|henryb:  I like excisiting better. Its more exciting|pg||
mb|1N|an|s!|nt|rmb1: If he bids less than 4@H he won't bid over 4m|pg||
nt|viren169: w/out the dble!|pg||
nt|viren169: now an extra option of support redbl available|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: Garvey is quite fond of bids like that - disrupt the oppo's bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: is is that a euphemisim Mike |pg||
nt|viren169: A bit good to just bid 2@S if 1N shows spades?!?!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rmb1: Or 1NT showing @S apparently :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well 2@S is in my view a much better bid than 1NT |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 1N = S!|pg||
nt|viren169: depends which side of the pond you are on...|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: you are far too polite |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it makes life interesting|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: true, had one shot at it |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmm |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: Will Willie Whittaker find the diamond lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Unlikely I think.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|viren169: ah... much better!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: an easy 4@S to start with.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not in my view--2@S is a no brainer and if my partner cannot handled the odd Moysian fit--then find me another one --but if it shows three card support then good idea |pg||
nt|garnetts: Soony Moyse was a very good bridge player from yesteryear in the USA with a penchant for bidding three card majors |pg||
nt|garnetts: Sonny|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: reminds me of a Marc Smith opening four bid on Jxxxxx|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgewebs.com/eburesultspages/PLcrosstable.htm  for standings after round 6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think it´s better to play low on @h8. What will N think? play @h10?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|nt|ybob: hi all|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||

nt|ybob: hello|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Roberto|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree to that.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|garnetts: I agree to some extent--but he might have got more from them by keeping quiet--I am sure Norman would finesse the club in 6@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3NT is on because there is no entry to West's diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|viren169: 3N anyone with N/S cards!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: actually take a closer look  dont think they make 4 @H's on a club lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: trump promotion for E |pg||
nt|rmb1: This room plays the boards in order, the Open Room starts with the last boards and then starts at board 1 for comparison|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@S should show five hearts|pg||
nt|iain sime: Another 4@S for North South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|viren169: a lucky one... N/S not wasting any time getting there|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: sry, that's in 1st and 2nd seat. 1@S shows 4+@s in 3rd/4th seat.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: Do you bid 1@s as E or Dbl after 1@h. Many players show a 5-card suit in this sequence|pg||
nt|ybob: good spot 3@S|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ybob: i like bid with 4+|pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect this will be a swing to Rosen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rectified position before the last stanza: Crouch 126, Rosen 125, Teltscher 124. We can't get it much closer than that!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: similarly for 1@h. Natural in 3rd/4th.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Specs are asking me why Garvey's partner did not support hearts on the last hand--and the answer is simple he has been there before |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Yes, shows 5+, x fine with me.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can't play any more hearts or East's suit will be set up.  Must play @C now|pg||
nt|viren169: strange to play a heart here in the 1st place|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might bea swing --but everyone overbids these days --and actually this almsot plays itself|pg||
nt|garnetts: typos hitting me again|pg||
nt|garnetts: North is tempted to play west for th J@C |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|viren169: hope not!|pg||
nt|garnetts: well I would be to|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: He trusted the opps a lot more than his partner :) |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe before playing a heart!|pg||
nt|garnetts: the triumph of hope over experience has prevailed |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: HE GAVE IT A HOUGHT|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Expect to lose two trumps and a club.  Should not be any timing issues, but we will see.|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ybob: K@H drop @D and @D ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with @hK and a@d discard but another small @s from dummy|pg||
nt|viren169: West might have bid 2@D (nf) if it were in his kit-bag|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|viren169: not so easy for N/S to reach 3N then|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|nt|rmb1: Spade to J next so can ruff club low.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now has entry to @SA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ybob: now need run the @C ´s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1. Rosen 115 - 2. Teltscher 110 - 3. Crouch 106 VP. Teltscher playing against Senior (last), but Senior is 16 ahead after the first 20 boards|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: Has to decide how to get to hand to draw trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: First stanza scores: Teltscher 47 Hinden 37 ... Senior 21 de Botton 56 ... Hackett 48 Crouch 40 ... Small 64 Rosen 41|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Standings before this round: 1. Rosen 101 - 2. Teltscher 93 - 3. Crouch 88 - 4. Hackett 75 - 5. Hinden 65 - 6. de Botton 63 - 7. Small 53 - 8. Senior 50|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rmb1: Declarer know about 5 @H with West so can play to ruff a heart, over ruffing if East has @S 10|pg||
nt|viren169: now for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: think we have a claim |pg||
nt|viren169: back to 9!|pg||

nt|viren169: a bit shaky in the play!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Solid start for the leaders.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ybob: 4@D surely ...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: depending upon style,  as passed hand with some pards. I can bid 2 @H here |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: only promises 3 @H's  not much more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this will work for them  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|garnetts: A tad agressive by South but justified in my view |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Hi all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: I have some regard for 2@D too--a bid I often make especially as partner is likely to have something|pg||
nt|viren169: penalty try by Liggins!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: welcome |pg||
nt|oliverc: Hi Shirley @H|pg||
nt|ybob: the defense need change to @C at trick 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iain sime: This time the defence will beat 4@S. A club lead is automatic. |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: Robin Barker, with us also|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rnmalik: No @C lead or shift, 5@D would make|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Scores 1st Crouch 127VPs 2nd Rosen 124VPs 3rd Teltscher 123 VPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 1st Vettel 8th Alonso|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Everton 0 Arsenal 0|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Espen in deep thought|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ybob: only is bad @C if W have AKQ and  N have Q @H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: looks like no weak 2@D available to West|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: Hi Oliver|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D must have been "I have a bit of something" |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|oliverc: Allerton and Hinden have done well here|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|viren169: all routes lead to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|iain sime: Nothing looks very attractive at this stage.|pg||
pc|s4|mc|10|nt|rnmalik: I thought S would work out. Lucky make.|pg||

nt|rmb1: Looks like Hinden managed to show @H support and something (in spades?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Actually not sure it beats it. The defence cannot get a Diamond trick AND the @H|pg||
nt|oliverc: ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can anyone of you understand the @h shift?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not me please-sorry.|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H makes here |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|iain sime: Spades break 3/2 but hearts are 5/0.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: I was relooking also   |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure they do beat it |pg||
nt|rmb1: Lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|sybarra: can they find 6 ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other matches after the first stanza: Small +22 vs de Botton, Hinden +20 vs Hackett, Senior +15 vs Teltscher|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult for South over 4@H, I suspect|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not fond of 4 @H but then not sure what to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: the problem is the Jxx of @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: you could be off 2 or 3  quick @D?|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|oliverc: truth is you can't bid every perfect-fit 27-point slam that comes along|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the S hand is pretty good....do you move again?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Bidding 6@H may be better than 50%,  They might lead the wrong minor, and there may not be a right minor to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec suggesting gazilli |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Espen doesn't look like he understands it :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Good old Haggis sandwich applies here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: the lack of entries here will hurt west if he bids game --but North might lead a heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: although I doubt it |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: Not sure I would. I would over 3@H (which I would play suggesting a partial @S fit)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi|pg||
nt|ybob: N need  to guess J @D |pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: Isn't the auction a bid high for gazilli now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N will be sick when he sees dummy |pg||
nt|rmb1: y.  15 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec suggested, I do not know enough about it |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: I don't know how weak a 1@H overcall can be in this partnership, but 4@H seems excessive.|pg||
nt|iain sime: And there is no reason why partner could not have spade support.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Martin "sorry this may be wrong"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|viren169: no need to invite|pg||
nt|rmb1: op.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|ybob: 4@S was better here|pg||
nt|rmb1: op: the movie does not show results from open room, will we get comparisons?|pg||
nt|viren169: both the minors sitting well for Declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... when they have played them I guess|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ybob: bad luck 5/0@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: need to find @dJ in both contracts|pg||
nt|ybob: if @S 3/2 or 4/1 not need it in 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But 3nt is more down than 4@s if he doesn´t find @dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: both Norman and Espen have their heads in hands|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Espen winning Simon's best pullover of the table award|pg||
nt|viren169: The closed room started with bd 18|pg||
nt|viren169: Open Room!|pg||
nt|rmb1: I know they started at 18 and have played 19 but I don't see the results on the MOVIE|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Hmm will try to find out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no chance any more, even if defence fails|pg||
