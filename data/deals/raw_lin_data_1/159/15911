nt|vugraphA2: a few mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: game here ns|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||

nt|davidstern: What suit is blue|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: Hi all   welcome  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i hate to ask what SNOT stands for :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: .|pg||
mb|1S|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||

nt|exerdar: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi all for the final set|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|lml: but one minor problem|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+@D|pg||
nt|lml: looks like 6NT would make east-west if you can get there|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid suggest the right line of play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-16 HCP, 5+@H, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||
nt|djneill:  West ducked the @d as the only chance to set, but also to stop a squeeze from operating sometimes|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|tejjyid: nothing can tell u how much i hate opening 1@d n rthe West ards|pg||
nt|lml: do you like 3NT?|pg||
nt|super nova: Djurovic is a bit top heavy for 3nt.|pg||
nt|lml: way|pg||
nt|super nova: I would start with X to see which way things are going.|pg||
nt|lml: but Evans may not pass |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a very makeable but thin 4@S NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|2N|an|alert|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: l in 2 spadesBruce transferred and Pau;|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that description actually covers 1@D, 1@H & 1@S opener's  filling in the correct suit for the 5+|pg||
nt|djneill:  astuted of the caped crusader|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||
nt|djneill:  right, if minors were reversed might get a lead-directing double of stayman (@cxx)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cannot approve 1NT|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C relay. 2NT 6@S, max|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||
nt|jkotor: declarers misplay here, could have won if guess distribution|pg||

nt|super nova: I would be happy to be in 6c.|pg||
nt|lml: until they ruffed the first two tricks :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: had to play for A@s onside, not @cQ, @d are either 4-3, or E has no entry|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now we will start to see results coming through from the other room|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
nt|exerdar: Franchi should play a very careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jkotor: low @h is for @d, high would be sth else (maybe @s honour)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The danger is that they bid the grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which might make actually|pg||
mb|6S|nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as the distribution lies,, it doesnt work :-D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: declarer will do well to hold this to down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Ruff and discards best defence here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: East does come under pressure with the @HJ being a winner|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: might try another @H finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Interesting yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||
nt|jkotor: now should play big one (suggesting A@s)|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: uh oh  i think the swing just went back to defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if a 4.5 loser hand openes 1N, what do you need to open 2N? and then 2C must be a slam-forcing opener...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9@S will hurt|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what about OUR mental toughness???|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: I'm beat|pg||
nt|loganrun: We are 'highly trained' professionals!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amen Nick!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Chris -- i've always wanted to see that in print|pg||
nt|murat: operator could you please send me a private message?|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: welcome to  yaserr rah√Ωm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: will he be thinking a ppossible loss there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it looks like you can make about 3 hearts|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: another multi-purpose 1@C probably better than PASS|pg||
nt|loganrun: 6H from West - that is mentally tough!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: x means stength|pg||
nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|2D!|an|min|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||
nt|lml: andeast-west should push north south to the 3-level.|pg||
nt|yr: hi all|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!D|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  right you are South doubled 2@h for takeout|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think W should raise to 3H to make it tougher|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jkotor: both tables fast in 2@c :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: : )|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: 2@d looks like the precesion type with short @d &11-15 hcp|pg||
nt|yr: 2@h was some relay |pg||
nt|exerdar: unlucky hand for e-ws ...|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the ONLY positive response  shows any hand with 6+ HCP|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Pass was a mirage Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm more into hallucinations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry,  1N was 15-17|pg||
nt|tejjyid: should be no trouble to bid 4@H now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Oh!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for west or east?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think WEst can bid the 4th without fear of criticism|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the rest of the boards will be this flat|pg||
nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fact of not redoubling marks 3H by W as competitive|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: Roland, you have to do the system 'translations' :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's true the 4441 is a bit sterile, but, overall, that's a big hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, with 9 card fit it blossoms|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|loganrun: Wrong black queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nick nick nick --  just trying to make sure we all stay awake|pg||
nt|babs59: North showed a minimum via the 2@D bid|pg||
nt|babs59: South asked more and settled in 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphA2: Too much chance I am being swindled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's an extra @S trick -- but also messes up transportation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry, was away|pg||
nt|babs59: with hearts 6-2 there is little drama here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, I get all the info from Jan Jansma|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he is playing poker simultaneously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so not always available with the info|pg||
pc|h5|nt|loganrun: Strange play!!!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorru I missed something|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: I think Evans might have competed to 3@D.  She is NV and you have to fit a bit for the partscore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D was min, 2@S was @D, 3@H was 5251|pg||
nt|babs59: and do you have someone to explain the Swedish auctions --- should they get to bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Walddk10|pg||
nt|babs59: Sjoert likes to give commentary teams lots of scope for chat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are in 4@S next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like making on the nose|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: I',m sure East would have rasied with the @DA in plce of the K, or a singleton somewhere, but it's hard to say that this hand necessitated it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|babs59: and about to go down in 4@S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i'm paranoid too -- but for good reasons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy Hung seems to be on Michael Prescott's side this hand|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1: have we had a straight forward hand yet?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can console themselves there with the reflection that on the chosen line, even 1S was going down|pg||
nt|lml: I guess even 2 was not trivial|pg||
nt|lml: south could have made it right up to the end by discarding at trick 11|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, lots of decisions both sides|pg||
nt|djneill:  100 honors would change the modern scoring landscape|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphA2: Both teams in the final are 5 person teams with one sponsor on each team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems they've all been see-saw between declarer and defense|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slightly poor stopper - but really, the @C suit, who takesthat seriously?|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no danger of getting too high now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphA2: Andy's 2@D bid may have hidden the 4/4 spade fit although Nabil may "reverse" now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is standard weak 2  --  no multi-2@D or 2-suited 2s for NS|pg||
nt|exerdar: √ùtalian style 2h, :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: slow because opps can make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: north choices interesting   PASS, DBL, 2@D |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Or 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Depending on methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the diagrammed hand i mean|pg||

mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: i didnt mean u get to score them. i mean they wont have a trump trick and wont double a NV partial without one|pg||
nt|exerdar: yes but if i have this hand, i want play|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s is -2 because of bad brakes|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: this doesn't llok too difficult, I'm going for coffee|pg||
nt|yr: Muller has the(unwanted) reputation of being one of the slowest players in the world!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I assume the double suggested 4 spades and likely only four diamonds so not sure about 4@D bid by Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry Noble seems to always have 4522 shape in support of partner's @H bids  - i wonder if that is systemic|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil thinking about bidding on but I suspect he wont|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Hmm 4@S|pg||
nt|loganrun: George (E) remembers the score before balancing with 3D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Now Andy thinking - "is this natural?"|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Yes mum I know the question mark should be outside the quotation marks|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Yes there are screens|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yr: 2@d by W here after the to dbl was a bad @h raise|pg||
nt|yr: this contract should make with an overtrick|pg||

mb|d|nt|djneill:  just imagining|pg||
nt|babs59: OR   NS have only reached a partial|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphA2: This is similar to an earlier board will be tough to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: so will they reach 3NT or 5C here?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yr: but of course muller will take his time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@C only|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|djneill:  West leads a Rusinow @dQ, showing the @dK (lowest of top two touching honors rather than highest)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jkotor: interesting: if W says 4@s after 2@s, N would probably bid 5@c :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Difficult for Drijver to bid 3NT with stiff @DQ|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: better ruff with the 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Getting to 5@C is very good I think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Is this going to force the @SA|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many other players would bid twice with that north hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|djneill:  South is setting up the @c suit prior to attacking trumps in case trumps go awry|pg||

nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tried to bid 1S but not allowed:)|pg||
nt|lml: the idea is that if you get to a slam that has a 5% chance and it makes you lose moral imps (But gain real ones) :)|pg||
nt|yr: after 4nt i cant see S stopping at the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Lavings   asks 5@H/@S AND size|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: nice lead directing bid|pg||

nt|exerdar: could be 1@s all pass|pg||
nt|aconterno: yes, W is a passed hand|pg||
nt|jkotor: but now 1@s is 7-11 when 10-11 not 5@s|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: now 6@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even if you dont expect to make can bid it, they probably sacrifice|pg||
nt|tejjyid: here NS have given EW too much room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: pd is balanced and S will be motivated to pass the double on a lot of shapely hands|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: are you ready for the next bid....|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry it is W who isthinking not Krock|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over here both EW players m,ight have bid diamonds on the first round|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would anybody else overcall 1@S [in lieu of DBL?]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: Only if Dbl guaranteed both majors|pg||
nt|yr: so far , so good, now they need to make it|pg||
nt|brgpro: in the old days we usually X then bid suit with 16 or more points...will not work well with this hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=12-13 HCP, 5@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also one should have agreements here NS about what is fit showing and what is one suited and/or what is interested in saving against a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: haviong trouble understanding N reluctamce to support hearts. if he had 5 of them he would have pened 1H|pg||
nt|djneill:  Klinger is not unhappy!|pg||
nt|djneill:  talk about 100 honors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @d's 3-3 and Q2@H all nice|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i started playing weak or kamikaze NT 35 years ago -- i'm sure i NEVER discussed East's sequence of the delayed 3@H|pg||
nt|yr: its natural to finnese they @h q right after the preempt & that shd be enough to make 5@h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphA2: But .... Pass= Penalties or two touching suits|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: So 3@H showed majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what strength??|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If Nabil finds a diamond lead this will be BAD|pg||
nt|peachy: landed well with that action|pg||
nt|lml: do you know what East meant 1@s to be?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might have bid 4D for example|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill:  must be in 4@h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: safety assures many tricks now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: well, pluses and minuses i guess|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|frankaus: nat F|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: N has opened a hand with almost 9 losers, and in almost his worst suit. one would think he would be thrilled to support hearts|pg||
nt|djneill:  or in fact, these may be the wrong hands|pg||
nt|jkotor: very good leads by NS other table (Q@s first lead) and well deserved poings|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|djneill:  seniors are having a Neill moment|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: but i dont like making the last guess. 1N X 2N (2 placesd to play, 3 level or better) seems to get a duirect message across|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do t think Ron would openm 1S with that shape|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|djneill:  what if East opened 1@s and South bid 2@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer to 1NT but it wasnt alerted|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphA2: Ouch now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: maybe a transfer advance = 1C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil choice of 3@C rather than PASS might not get the majority of votes   another sequence that doesn't get mentioned in print|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does the elimination work?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
nt|yr: sad result after they reached an exellent contract|pg||
mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||
nt|lml: no worries as you say|pg||
nt|lml: I love that expression|pg||
nt|yr: 4@s NS again the normal contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||

nt|nickd:  2@c shows 3 spades and 7-9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: I think that Sydney is the best city there is with maybe Vancouvre as second|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nytime|pg||

nt|marlowepi: what is 1D?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even corrected, here is an auction you dont see every decade|pg||
nt|aconterno: bad contract|pg||
nt|aconterno: N should bid 3@c|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|djneill:  often times the bid is right, but pd will not understand it, I don't think either happened here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Haughie dropped 5h on Club lead - not happy|pg||
nt|yr: ruffing a @d  brings the total to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit late to this match, but I hope sweden can do it well against our norwegian friends playing for Italy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||

nt|ralfwil: thx Ali!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jkotor: i dont understand this play with middle numbers when all we have on side is AQ@s|pg||

nt|lml: even vul it is pretty pushy|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp 12-14 I think 3NT pushy by S|pg||
nt|super nova: 1c Opening|pg||
nt|super nova: would you bid 2c spades and another?|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to play weak and strong micheals.|pg||
nt|yr: this looks like an exellent slam  for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jean Harings|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
nt|frankaus: S is a bridge teacher - represented Aus in Cannes some time ago|pg||
nt|super nova: This doesnt qualify so I would bid 1s over call.|pg||
nt|yr: in @s|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|nickd:  1@c=15+ - 1@h=10+ unbalanced hand any|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I would fancy opening 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: NO WAY would I open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
nt|nickd:  i suppose the answer will be|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade.  The @CQ is not a good card|pg||
nt|yr: @d preemption may actually help  here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no big scores so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome Jamie Ebery|pg||
nt|yr: i think it will be difficult to find slam if EW never bid @d at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||
nt|lml: hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi :-)|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess we have talked the lightner double on board 6 to death.|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
nt|super nova: WOW 16 imps.|pg||
nt|yr: but in any case, a splinter now should do the trick|pg||
nt|yr: i wonder what 2@c showed,,Nick?|pg||
nt|nickd:  splinter wont be enough, but i think nirth will bid once more after splinter|pg||
nt|brgpro: hoi|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
nt|nickd:  about 2@c i am not sure because over competition there are 2 approaches|pg||
nt|jeanhari: drijver has a strong preempt.. poss. because partner has a passed hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi Jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stopped on a dime|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
nt|yr: splinter means that your values are in @h & @c,,,jsut wat S wanted to hear|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
nt|yr: but of course he has a minimum forcing @c & tries to sign off,,,,but N wont let him off the hook here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
nt|lml: not clear|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|nickd:  yes splinter was possible even without Qh|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h looks a good contract...although will fail this time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Drijver happy to see hearts 3-1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: lucky stop, stiil chances for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: drijver cla√Ωmed|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: 3NT a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|brgpro: not with dd defence...say @s lead to the A and @d back?|pg||
nt|brgpro: u have to take @dA and duck a @h to the bare @hQ...which is not all that easy|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|loganrun: A heart is more believable|pg||
nt|djneill:  all this flirting and groping is making me uncomfortable|pg||

nt|marlowepi: xx   Axxxx   xxxxxx x and slam is great|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: set spades so Roman Keycard gets useful responses|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: i think after the conservative 3C, E could bid 3N wiuthout exaggerating. but may have been afraid to drive NS to making game. of course they would have to make the making game.....|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: he passed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: 2c here is TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: showing either Diamonds or both majors.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|s4|pc|cT|nt|djneill:  West knows East would never underlead an Ace against @s so the @d8 postponed the problem|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: board +12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down a bunch -- how many percentage actions do you take?|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok, North was giving a little credit to West to ducking the first heart|pg||
nt|lml: I think East might have worked it out with a lot of thought.  The heart position seems likely and so does the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: much easier from here though|pg||
nt|frankaus: 500 is not too be sneezed at|pg||
nt|lml: nope that is actually a decent result|pg||
nt|super nova: On the deal where they made 2h,.. but then no no down 2. They are in 4h at the other table.|pg||

nt|brgpro: with @dQx N wont X...|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so a good result for the dutch, |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  potentially|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a six is not a big card, but it is a winner when the other 12 cards in the suit have been played |pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: another easy 3N:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ending with nice NS combination for crib   556788|pg||

mb|p|nt|loganrun: 'Respectability' Al |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: before you ask the answer is YES|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another transfer explanation|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wd by EW. difficult to find the @c lead as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: surprising push there|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||
nt|tejjyid: c u all later|pg||
nt|djneill:  2NT inquiry, 3@d showing @s we guess|pg||
nt|yr: NS will probably end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Try again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multitasking is hard|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what is happening with the biggest hand at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx andrew see you:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  9 card fit + oxygen = game|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d is mostly 0-6 hcp|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: EW have 3N but NS play 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You left out the invesrted commas :EASY"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we could all leave, that would be an infinite increase|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by N may make here|pg||
nt|frankaus: or 4@H|pg||
nt|super nova: As it turns out 4s is a cake walk.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@s is 3+, 3-4 with weak NT, or 4@s-5@c 15+, or 18+ 5+@s not enough for 2@s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: franch√Ω ask√Ωng  b√Ωd  by  kotorowicz|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1NT from E would be 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this time David wanted  BBO to offer    delete PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Lavings -- asks 5-card Major AND size|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, S owes N a 1D opening, i think, even red|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|super nova: multiple potential games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12-13 HCP, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4cards, INV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill hits back to take the lead!|pg||
mb|4N|nt|loganrun: Unfortunately this will not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||
nt|djneill:  North obliges South with a @d lead|pg||
nt|lml: but the clubs are friendly and the trumps not too badly behaved so should make|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
mb|5S|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||
nt|djneill:  now it is not so clear, South should now play the @hA in order to get a signal from North|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||
nt|yr: declarer can count 9 tricks if the @cs come in|pg||
nt|yr: but what if they dont?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good score coming up for the Swedes as 3NT is going down on 11, decl gave up a heart|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: kibitzers' dream to have interesting boards!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and all three were offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  hmm, entries now to set up the clubs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why bother?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|loganrun: Hoping partner might have 1 heart (out by 2)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes that makes more sense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the old days you were able to bid a grand slam on a finesse in trumps (the king). Not today with Roman Keycard|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished board  9 -- but they started with  15  so we're not as far ahead as some think|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11 now|pg||
nt|yr: declarer has a 2nd stopper in @s,,|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: well north has to decide to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|lml: or 10|pg||
nt|yr: we can see that giving a @c to W is safe but declarer is afraid if the @d ace is offside he will go down|pg||
nt|yr: but he seems to have no other choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: olgersson th√Ωnk|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike throwing those winning clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Prescott going to regret not keeping @C5 in dummy?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Ace of clubs and squeeze South|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Jusrt a reminder Noble started with an 11 IMP carry forward|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Howard gets full credit for this pickup|pg||

nt|loganrun: Fine line between - genius and goat|pg||
nt|yr: S will open the forcing @c here|pg||
nt|yr: how many @hs will W bid facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|yr: 1 shd usually be enough , but u never know:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: short break  |pg||
nt|yr: players have the tendency to try to preempt the strong clubbers a bit more than any1 else|pg||
nt|yr: & good strong clubbers relish this , & the Fat ,Juicy  four figure penalties that often  result:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: so 80 because of trick 1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: most of the time the king was wrongplaced in those days :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||

nt|jkotor: 1N is 6-11|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, like this hand, even the K is right places 4@h wont make|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
nt|yr: here we go,,,3@h|pg||
nt|brgpro: placed|pg||
mb|r|nt|super nova: I woudl bid 1nt. to show some poiints|pg||
nt|yr: fair enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
nt|yr: that lead gives declarer a double @h chek,,,a small @h wud be double dummy though|pg||
nt|yr: interesting hand to plan the play|pg||
nt|yr: we can see the other table failed badly in 3nt,,down 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I understand that South didn't want to bid 1NT without a stopper but now she has a problem|pg||
nt|super nova: Then North can Double 2s to say they have 3 potential places to play.|pg||
nt|yr: well , this 3@h bid actually gives declarer a reason to play  for a 4-1 @d division & double finnese there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many players have left the weak 2 major openings and use a stronger variant |pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
nt|jkotor: some gadget and probably now 54+ nat |pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
nt|super nova: South already knows about the 5 hearts .|pg||
nt|super nova: So they can bid 3d.|pg||
nt|frankaus: downgrade to 12-14 1NT by N mayhave stolen the pot|pg||
nt|jkotor: @c lead best IMO|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphA2: Claiming|pg||
nt|yr: now if he crosses to hand & leads the @d 10,,,|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: ke says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh do the replies to 4N inform about diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Well done Mike says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i dont know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||
nt|yr: covered ,,,& then repeats the finnese against the 9 he can make the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Results.htm  for results and running scores|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: the 4 card major struck in open room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|super nova: But after the pass by south over 1s, it is not as clear for north to X|pg||
nt|lml: they can defeat this though and go plus so not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: they weren't making 3NT|pg||
nt|yr: all wishful thinking as declarer goes for a normal 3-2 @d division|pg||
nt|yr: which is a reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yr: now its all about undertricks,,,the hand cannot be made|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I fixed the bidding have a look at top|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: South elected to double in the OR|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this is a very thin game for EW, but it does not look as though it can be defeated - unless East plays clubs in a peculiar fashion  |pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW in OR not shining in their slam bidding |pg||
nt|mdgraham: same start as before :)|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|yr: thats why i prefer Natural methods!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so 3@D=hearts. Just a question of six or seven now, you would think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet on seven|pg||
nt|yr: E never bid his 6 or 5 card suit in the other room:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, East showed @C's first and they never found their fit|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think 2NT was an inv+ xfr to @C in the other room.|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 3@S bid by S took up a lot of room|pg||
nt|yr: & the 4@s bid by E ensured that none was left|pg||
nt|yr: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|yr: the next sesion starts in about 75 minutes from now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@S as exclusion roman? |pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|wstuart: the question now is, do they have a way to ask for the Q here?  :)|pg||
nt|yr: now 7,,,,,so iceland will lose sumthing like 33 imps in the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|yr: his response will show 2 with q|pg||
nt|yr: 2kc outside @s with q of trumps|pg||
nt|wstuart: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....just a little time to work it out, not something that happens every day|pg||
nt|wstuart: but had he bid 6@D, what would east do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the top clash in group A, Netherlands vs Italy Angelini|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|wstuart: or 6@C I mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: would 6@D be a Q ask there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if that is ERKCB, that should be two aces outside spades + @HQ |pg||
nt|yr: over a 0314 response, it shd be|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: 6h √Ωs alerted  by muller |pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming a "standard" response style |pg||
