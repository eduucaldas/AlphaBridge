nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||

nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||

nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
nt|jkotor: strange X from N, why not 3@h?|pg||
nt|exerdar: dbl showing max hand of 2@H, but e-w cant stop i think, after xx|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|hK|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|jkotor: 1 i think|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|jkotor: but Buras played E for worse @h, and probably 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|petergill: Still, with two keycards missing for clubs, stopping below slam is fairly normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now we will start to see results coming through from the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
nt|exerdar: Franchi should play a very careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jkotor: low @h is for @d, high would be sth else (maybe @s honour)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as the distribution lies,, it doesnt work :-D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: declarer will do well to hold this to down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Ruff and discards best defence here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: might try another @H finesse|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||
nt|jkotor: now should play big one (suggesting A@s)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Now West has the problem of whether to pass or bid on - not easy|pg||
nt|petergill: for all West knows, East might have only four hearts|pg||
nt|geot: It was a good moment to jump to 3@S by South with his quite good hand. Makes it difficult for E/S|pg||
nt|geot: E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Maximum preemption against strong clubs causes all sorts of problems for the strong clubbers who don't yet know how long their suits are|pg||
nt|petergill: I assume screens are in use|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, there is probably no ethical problem from East's (apparent) slight pause before he bid 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: How good a contract is 6@H?|pg||
nt|petergill: Clubs being 3-3 with @CA onside, and hearts 2-2, is a very friendly layout|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: yes, it is not that good slam to be honest, but all slams that makes are good, arent they:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H makes easily, but on other layouts, e.g. @CA offside and clubs 4-2, or hearts 3-1 and spade leads to remove dummy's trump entry, 6@H would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|geot: The Swedes bid slam on board 4 at the other table, but 6@D|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 4 was big for Italy with other table in 6@D|pg||
nt|geot: unlucky trump break, one down. 6@C was much better of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: 6@H on spade lead and continuation fails if @CA offside. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: I agree with specs who think East was a bit soft here, what do you think, Peter? |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: 5@H seems fairly conservative, unless East took 4@S as asking for the best place to play, in case 4@h was a 4-3 fit - still, I like 6@h more than 5@h on East's great cards. |pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||

nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||

nt|yr: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  right you are South doubled 2@h for takeout|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the rest of the boards will be this flat|pg||
nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fact of not redoubling marks 3H by W as competitive|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||

nt|petergill: Last chance to prevent 690|pg||
nt|petergill: i expect a spade play|pg||
nt|petergill: No, I think @HA - I think he is wondering whether to play a low heart or @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: I am allowed to change my mind|pg||
nt|geot: as long as you are right, Peter:)|pg||
nt|petergill: They play Reverse Smith|pg||

nt|vugraphzus: last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Kenan, well done|pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thanks all and the next round will start in 14.15 local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in exactly 1 hour|pg||
nt|petergill: when a spec named Jan Jansma tells you that @HA will be played, people like me change thier mind. :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Has Jan played before?|pg||
nt|geot: If there is no swing on this last board of the match, Angelini win by 8 imp (26-18) which is 16-14VP|pg||
nt|petergill: Great job by our operator Kenan, and thanks to Geo Tislevoll for commentary. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Jan - last time I played him, he conned me into letting him make an unmakeable grand slam - I think he can play!|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H = not my choice - I like to play in my 8 card suit|pg||
nt|geot: 4@S seems to be a better contract than 4@H. |pg||
nt|petergill: A chance to bid spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I dont like that 4@H bid with 8-3 in the majors|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: Good lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Note that he doesn't even consider a top sapde lead|pg||
nt|geot: this will be costly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or as Stave Robinson would say: what do you call QJ1097532|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Steve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Trumps!|pg||
nt|petergill: This will be costly for Sweden - it is the first hand on which their relative lack of experience has shown up|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: It is particularly important to play in spades when you don't have a fit there|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Yes, had East run to 4@S, then Nunes doubles it - Nunes would be surprised when 4@SX makes - or would Fulvio Fantoni have foreseen the need to lead hearts, given the bidding?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|h6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because then the suit is useless as dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|geot: Sad for the Swedes who have played an ok match so far, against two of the worlds best pairs|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, the Swedes have played well for 19 boards, but the Angelini team has played better. This is the first hand on which the difference has been very clear. |pg||
nt|petergill: If 1@H - 4@S is artificial, then you have to bid 1@H - 1@S followed by 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|geot: Yes, it was a tight match. Angelini won an early slamswing, 16 imps, and the lead was only 8 before the last board|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: 800 it will be|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|sT|pc|dQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: and an educational hand for anyone who still thinks the 5-3 fit is worth playing in|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sJ|pc|dK|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|geot: I agree, spades should be trumps here. And a deserved 15 imp loss for Sweden on the boards|pg||
nt|geot: board|pg||
nt|petergill: The weaker your hand, the more the need to play in the 7 or 8 card suit, due to lack of entries. |pg||
nt|vugraphzus: thanks all and the next round will start in 14.15 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: Just 500|pg||
nt|geot: Tks and bye bye all :) see you|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks everyone|pg||

nt|yr: so huge board for Netherlands, 16 imps & they go into the lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: EW in OR not shining in their slam bidding |pg||
nt|mdgraham: same start as before :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|yr: thats why i prefer Natural methods!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so 3@D=hearts. Just a question of six or seven now, you would think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet on seven|pg||
nt|yr: E never bid his 6 or 5 card suit in the other room:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, East showed @C's first and they never found their fit|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think 2NT was an inv+ xfr to @C in the other room.|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 3@S bid by S took up a lot of room|pg||
nt|yr: & the 4@s bid by E ensured that none was left|pg||
nt|yr: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|yr: the next sesion starts in about 75 minutes from now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@S as exclusion roman? |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|wstuart: the question now is, do they have a way to ask for the Q here?  :)|pg||
nt|yr: now 7,,,,,so iceland will lose sumthing like 33 imps in the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|yr: his response will show 2 with q|pg||
nt|yr: 2kc outside @s with q of trumps|pg||
nt|wstuart: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....just a little time to work it out, not something that happens every day|pg||
nt|wstuart: but had he bid 6@D, what would east do?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|wstuart: or 6@C I mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: would 6@D be a Q ask there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if that is ERKCB, that should be two aces outside spades + @HQ |pg||
nt|yr: over a 0314 response, it shd be|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: 6h √Ωs alerted  by muller |pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming a "standard" response style |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|yr: this has been a very tight match,,,but it ends with a bang, 36 imps to NEtherlands in the last 2 boards|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: a wise conversion to 7@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: or, as Arifin Halin said, a wijs conversion|pg||
