nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||

nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||

nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
nt|jkotor: strange X from N, why not 3@h?|pg||
nt|exerdar: dbl showing max hand of 2@H, but e-w cant stop i think, after xx|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|jkotor: 1 i think|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

nt|jkotor: but Buras played E for worse @h, and probably 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|petergill: Still, with two keycards missing for clubs, stopping below slam is fairly normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now we will start to see results coming through from the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
nt|exerdar: Franchi should play a very careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: And Hung wearing his traditional cap making it harder to see his reactions|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Andy|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jkotor: low @h is for @d, high would be sth else (maybe @s honour)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|loganrun: All the action is with South at the moment and his mental toughness is tested with 2 slam decisions|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as the distribution lies,, it doesnt work :-D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: declarer will do well to hold this to down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Ruff and discards best defence here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: might try another @H finesse|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too fast for me -- i'm still thinking about whether declarer was supposed to attack @D before @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Daily Bulletins from the World Championships that just ended in Philadelphia -- they actually printed a reminder that Declarer was allowed to ask an opponent to confirm none ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when failing to follow suit|pg||
nt|jkotor: now should play big one (suggesting A@s)|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: Now West has the problem of whether to pass or bid on - not easy|pg||
nt|petergill: for all West knows, East might have only four hearts|pg||
nt|geot: It was a good moment to jump to 3@S by South with his quite good hand. Makes it difficult for E/S|pg||
nt|geot: E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Maximum preemption against strong clubs causes all sorts of problems for the strong clubbers who don't yet know how long their suits are|pg||
nt|petergill: I assume screens are in use|pg||
nt|petergill: If so, there is probably no ethical problem from East's (apparent) slight pause before he bid 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: How good a contract is 6@H?|pg||
nt|petergill: Clubs being 3-3 with @CA onside, and hearts 2-2, is a very friendly layout|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: yes, it is not that good slam to be honest, but all slams that makes are good, arent they:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H makes easily, but on other layouts, e.g. @CA offside and clubs 4-2, or hearts 3-1 and spade leads to remove dummy's trump entry, 6@H would be in jeopardy|pg||
nt|geot: The Swedes bid slam on board 4 at the other table, but 6@D|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 4 was big for Italy with other table in 6@D|pg||
nt|geot: unlucky trump break, one down. 6@C was much better of course|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: 6@H on spade lead and continuation fails if @CA offside. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: I agree with specs who think East was a bit soft here, what do you think, Peter? |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: 5@H seems fairly conservative, unless East took 4@S as asking for the best place to play, in case 4@h was a 4-3 fit - still, I like 6@h more than 5@h on East's great cards. |pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Same score likely maybe doubled|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they printed that because each NCBO [National Contract Bridge Organization] is allowed to set rules about who can/can't ask|pg||
nt|peachy: It was a difficult hand to play, but leaving 3SX in would have been worse, it might have well made|pg||

nt|djneill:  West may want to bid here, for surely East is never leading a @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok transfer overcall, allows West to shape out with interesting hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: X|pg||

nt|yr: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H from west wide range opposite a limited 1@H opener|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: A club ruff is a trick the defence would get anyway likely declarer will lose 1-1-1-1 for one down|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphA2: Any other Vul I would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  right you are South doubled 2@h for takeout|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the rest of the boards will be this flat|pg||
nt|loganrun: oops - who can blame North?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fact of not redoubling marks 3H by W as competitive|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: David -- you get encouraged at other vulnerability when partner passes twice??|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
nt|yr: sad result after they reached an exellent contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||
nt|lml: no worries as you say|pg||
nt|lml: I love that expression|pg||
nt|yr: 4@s NS again the normal contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I love Australia.  Will you adopt me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  @H win in South  @H win in North  THEN @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  so a small swing to Neill|pg||
nt|yr: the strong @c by N & negative response by S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is this alert of 2nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  wow, 5@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: damn i thought i was here to ESCAPE the real world...|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: uh oh   i think 4@D says   4=4=0=5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North bid 6H, not Westr|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think W would bid 6H vulnerable|pg||
nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||
nt|loganrun: South had to throw a top heart and win the first heart and lead back to north's Queen - very tough|pg||
nt|nickd:  2@c shows 3 spades and 7-9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: I think that Sydney is the best city there is with maybe Vancouvre as second|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nytime|pg||
nt|yr: there should be no play problems in 4@s|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jkotor: 3N is bad, with direction to "horrible" :)|pg||
nt|aconterno: @d lead|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yup Michael knew it was a 4405|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what is 1D?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even corrected, here is an auction you dont see every decade|pg||
nt|aconterno: bad contract|pg||
nt|aconterno: N should bid 3@c|pg||
pc|s6|nt|djneill:  often times the bid is right, but pd will not understand it, I don't think either happened here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Haughie dropped 5h on Club lead - not happy|pg||
nt|yr: ruffing a @d  brings the total to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit late to this match, but I hope sweden can do it well against our norwegian friends playing for Italy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frankaus: pushy 3NT may need some assstance from the defence|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jkotor: now Q@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx Ali!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jkotor: i dont understand this play with middle numbers when all we have on side is AQ@s|pg||
nt|aconterno: must take A, for maximum damage|pg||
nt|aconterno: down 1 in OR, with @s lead and @d back|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3rd NS game without points and sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: kotorowicz  th√Ωnk√Ωng  |pg||
nt|aconterno: 2 imps decision|pg||
nt|exerdar: i have to go , thx all :-)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: North knows he likely has this beaten by playing @DJ and @DK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the new fashion, alert only the natural bids?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think you are right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: best - quieter, saves time|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: i like David's inference about declarer having a penalty DBL of 1@H -- even though he pulled -- but why lead @H then??|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E could show heart strength here more easily thn he could show clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: not really a game you want to be in NV... VUL okay but NV not so much|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: West wont enjoy two clubs|pg||

nt|lml: even vul it is pretty pushy|pg||
nt|frankaus: opp 12-14 I think 3NT pushy by S|pg||
nt|super nova: 1c Opening|pg||
nt|super nova: would you bid 2c spades and another?|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to play weak and strong micheals.|pg||
nt|yr: this looks like an exellent slam  for NS|pg||
mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
nt|frankaus: S is a bridge teacher - represented Aus in Cannes some time ago|pg||
nt|super nova: This doesnt qualify so I would bid 1s over call.|pg||
nt|yr: in @s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nickd:  1@c=15+ - 1@h=10+ unbalanced hand any|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I would fancy opening 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: NO WAY would I open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
nt|nickd:  i suppose the answer will be|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade.  The @CQ is not a good card|pg||
nt|yr: @d preemption may actually help  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome Jamie Ebery|pg||
nt|yr: i think it will be difficult to find slam if EW never bid @d at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||
nt|lml: hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi :-)|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess we have talked the lightner double on board 6 to death.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
nt|super nova: WOW 16 imps.|pg||
nt|yr: but in any case, a splinter now should do the trick|pg||
nt|yr: i wonder what 2@c showed,,Nick?|pg||
nt|nickd:  splinter wont be enough, but i think nirth will bid once more after splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
nt|nickd:  about 2@c i am not sure because over competition there are 2 approaches|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
nt|yr: splinter means that your values are in @h & @c,,,jsut wat S wanted to hear|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
pc|s7|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
nt|yr: but of course he has a minimum forcing @c & tries to sign off,,,,but N wont let him off the hook here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice pressure bid|pg||
nt|lml: not clear|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: amazing pass, given the @D Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the D flaw ntwithstanding|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes it depends if West is looking for slam potentially since East has a slam oriented hand with a @s cue|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|nickd:  yes splinter was possible even without Qh|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: but probably just make|pg||
nt|yr: very well bid slam in the end,,,its a claimer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|peachy: he needed just one heart trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is possible that 3N there was a spade cuebid, allowing them to use the step bid of 3S as a grope of some sort|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H = likely + will prob be a + imps as well|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: just delaying the inevitable claim for 9 tricks ??|pg||
nt|lml: they do have to make it though|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2c was puppet to 2d i think, but the pass is simply not consistent|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: best lead to give defense a chance was king of clubs. looks absurd of course but it is amazing how often it is right from this holdiong|pg||
pc|h8|nt|frankaus: seems to be on the right track|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: when in dummy  I think trump gives play for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using 2@C opening this way, they can actually get out in 2@H/@S via transfers   interesting concept|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing is an amazing euphemism:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: montanar√Ω cla√Ωmed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: anyway, well subsided|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: George Rosenkranz's Mexican 2@D [from Romex] and the 2@D version used by some of the Italian pairs doesn't allow stopping below 2N|pg||

nt|fabsayc: fair but silly|pg||

nt|marlowepi: on his hand, of course, club jack just gives N easy play for 11 trix|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N by N|pg||

mb|1D|nt|frankaus: 1@S 4 me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S weaker than Namyats 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Weaker in outside values|pg||
nt|lml: In third chair that might push me to 2|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: personally i think 3C worked very well....it established a context where 3N could be bid in perspective later|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Anyone for coffee \_ ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 11-16, 5+@S  UNBAL   [i thought he would open 1N]|pg||
nt|frankaus: 28 zars|pg||
nt|lml: definitely 1 in first or second|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a rather easy 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but on W because S can find the @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice claim!|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|marlowepi: E will lead spade vs 3N|pg||
nt|super nova: for south.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some super accept by Haughie?|pg||
nt|yr: its ok No Problem :) Ali|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: normally EW lead Ace from AKx -- so @DK confirms shortness|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: ha go that onetra ltra lA|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: in theory as well as practice, i think spade ace is best lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: i dont like 1nt, for me its always HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: and here awful 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: Hearts are 3-3.. luckily.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: too many values to hope for big enough club holding -- where will u get 4 tricks without a ruff?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N will conced a D and EW will try to figure out a plan with a hope|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: yes, best chance for ruff |pg||
nt|fabsayc: at least that is a plan|pg||
nt|super nova: with 4-2 in hearts on spade pumps it could be  a real mess.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: zar points - link - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|lml: its not that there aren't enough points.  2@S in third is tactical|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N on 24 went doen so 11 to Haughie widens the margin again|pg||
nt|yr: 4 obvious losers here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: this can go three down if the defense gets all their tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|lml: they cant play the @CA before their red suit winners are available|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|lml: The @DA and the @DQ look good... well done south|pg||

nt|yr: still 4 losers:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|loganrun: 2 suits uncovered - against 1NT but 5H with no tricks outside of hearts and 2 spades is not percentage|pg||
pc|c4|nt|djneill:  now time for a double-squeeze?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: just -2 now|pg||
nt|lml: but one problem with this line they have blocked hearts|pg||
nt|lml: defensive line|pg||

pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lml: they can still get 3 down|pg||

nt|frankaus: oh well declarer gets them back to -3|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: when we lead from four small in an unbid suit against a suit cntract, we need to be able to make the case that other leads were even less promising|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: board +12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down a bunch -- how many percentage actions do you take?|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok, North was giving a little credit to West to ducking the first heart|pg||
nt|lml: I think East might have worked it out with a lot of thought.  The heart position seems likely and so does the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: much easier from here though|pg||
nt|frankaus: 500 is not too be sneezed at|pg||
nt|lml: nope that is actually a decent result|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: before you ask the answer is YES|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another transfer explanation|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wd by EW. difficult to find the @c lead as N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: surprising push there|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||
nt|tejjyid: c u all later|pg||
nt|djneill:  2NT inquiry, 3@d showing @s we guess|pg||
nt|yr: NS will probably end up in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Try again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multitasking is hard|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what is happening with the biggest hand at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx andrew see you:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  9 card fit + oxygen = game|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d is mostly 0-6 hcp|pg||

nt|fabsayc: we could all leave, that would be an infinite increase|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by N may make here|pg||
nt|frankaus: or 4@H|pg||
nt|super nova: As it turns out 4s is a cake walk.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@s is 3+, 3-4 with weak NT, or 4@s-5@c 15+, or 18+ 5+@s not enough for 2@s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: franch√Ω ask√Ωng  b√Ωd  by  kotorowicz|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1NT from E would be 18-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this time David wanted  BBO to offer    delete PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Lavings -- asks 5-card Major AND size|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, S owes N a 1D opening, i think, even red|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: multiple potential games.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12-13 HCP, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4cards, INV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill hits back to take the lead!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|loganrun: Unfortunately this will not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||
nt|djneill:  North obliges South with a @d lead|pg||
nt|lml: but the clubs are friendly and the trumps not too badly behaved so should make|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||
nt|djneill:  now it is not so clear, South should now play the @hA in order to get a signal from North|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||
nt|yr: declarer can count 9 tricks if the @cs come in|pg||
nt|yr: but what if they dont?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|peachy: kibitzers' dream to have interesting boards!|pg||

nt|djneill:  hmm, entries now to set up the clubs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why bother?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|loganrun: Hoping partner might have 1 heart (out by 2)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes that makes more sense|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished board  9 -- but they started with  15  so we're not as far ahead as some think|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11 now|pg||
nt|yr: declarer has a 2nd stopper in @s,,|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: well north has to decide to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|lml: or 10|pg||
nt|yr: we can see that giving a @c to W is safe but declarer is afraid if the @d ace is offside he will go down|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Justin Howard gets full credit for this pickup|pg||
nt|yr: the problem for the defence is that wether W plays a low @d or q, declarer cant possibly go wrong|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|c5|nt|yr: this has been a very tight match so far, the biggest swing being a mere 4 imps|pg||

nt|yr: but that dosnt take anything away from W, he is hoping to find his pd with the @dj|pg||

nt|yr: how many @hs will W bid facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|yr: 1 shd usually be enough , but u never know:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: short break  |pg||
nt|yr: players have the tendency to try to preempt the strong clubbers a bit more than any1 else|pg||
nt|yr: & good strong clubbers relish this , & the Fat ,Juicy  four figure penalties that often  result:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: so 80 because of trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||
mb|2H|an|alerted|nt|marlowepi: can make 8 spades on round suit squeeze i think|pg||

nt|jkotor: 1N is 6-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
nt|yr: here we go,,,3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: I woudl bid 1nt. to show some poiints|pg||
nt|yr: fair enough|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
nt|yr: that lead gives declarer a double @h chek,,,a small @h wud be double dummy though|pg||
nt|yr: interesting hand to plan the play|pg||
nt|yr: we can see the other table failed badly in 3nt,,down 4|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I understand that South didn't want to bid 1NT without a stopper but now she has a problem|pg||
nt|super nova: Then North can Double 2s to say they have 3 potential places to play.|pg||
nt|yr: well , this 3@h bid actually gives declarer a reason to play  for a 4-1 @d division & double finnese there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many players have left the weak 2 major openings and use a stronger variant |pg||
mb|4H|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
nt|jkotor: some gadget and probably now 54+ nat |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
nt|super nova: South already knows about the 5 hearts .|pg||
nt|super nova: So they can bid 3d.|pg||
nt|frankaus: downgrade to 12-14 1NT by N mayhave stolen the pot|pg||
nt|jkotor: @c lead best IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Claiming|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||
nt|yr: covered ,,,& then repeats the finnese against the 9 he can make the hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: the 4 card major struck in open room|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|super nova: But after the pass by south over 1s, it is not as clear for north to X|pg||
nt|lml: they can defeat this though and go plus so not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: they weren't making 3NT|pg||
nt|yr: all wishful thinking as declarer goes for a normal 3-2 @d division|pg||
nt|yr: which is a reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yr: now its all about undertricks,,,the hand cannot be made|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
nt|super nova: I would X = some values with south.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hehe  the psychic transfer|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugrapha2: South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it may stop EW from competing -- but what about partner?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: NS are not a regular partnership|pg||

nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugrapha2: Hung grinnign whne he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|djneill:  oof|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hi|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|super nova: I think jurovic likes Kalmins auction also.|pg||
nt|lml: once south bid they were destined for spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|lml: the lure of the vul game is too much|pg||
nt|super nova: This wont play too badly.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S presumably constructive, as otyherwise E just has an inbvite|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: helgemo cla√Ωmed|pg||
mc|12|nt|super nova: 2d diamonds and a spade off the top.|pg||
nt|yr: the last hand was made actually & so the biggest swing o the match so far, |pg||

nt|fabsayc: are we done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and in a sense well-judged, in that in the other room EW did go to 5S (cold) and were doubled|pg||
nt|lml: you need to have a rule about who pushes for the vul games.  You cant have both sides pushing|pg||
nt|super nova: Evans will likly start with pass.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks operator, commentators, noisy cheering spectators|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a reasonable auction for preceding board would be 1S - 2S -3H - 3N ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-purpose 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room still has 3 boards to complete|pg||
nt|super nova: 2s|pg||
nt|super nova: clubs or the reds.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so last board here, no swing, then the last few to come from the OR|pg||
nt|yr: heres the link for running scores|pg||
nt|yr: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the only positive response   ANY 6+ HCP|pg||
nt|super nova: North will want to punish 3c,.. but south will not like to co-operate with that.|pg||
nt|lml: no if south has a way to show both majors I think she will|pg||
nt|jkotor: transfer for 1nt|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|djneill:  this table is significantly faster than the other, difficult for Judy but good to watch|pg||
nt|djneill:  or @dA and @d hook if West follows, securing 5@d, 2@h, 1@s, 1@c|pg||
nt|lml: right now|pg||
nt|lml: thats the bid I use too|pg||
nt|yr: well this looks like a 1@s opening to me:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: probably will bid 2@c after 1N|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|vugraphA2: South elected to double in the OR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with spades surely n the way S sgould maybe do more than 2D....but his defense is fart from negligible...toughh problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no respect --- NS always interfere over the EW multi-purpose 1@C opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: far:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is a very thin game for EW, but it does not look as though it can be defeated - unless East plays clubs in a peculiar fashion  |pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  South could try the @sA and @sQ, spurning the finesse - if they take @sK then 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think this can make|pg||
nt|yr: well its reasonable Not  to bid it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: final hand for our table --- shouldn't pre-gloat, but congrats to Team Noble    and 4 of the Juniors on Team Horwitz are collecting their 2nd consecutive 2nd place finish in the ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big Australia Open Team even|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is best not to take the spade finesse even not looking at the hands :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugrapha2: I think the engravers already plugged his pen in Al|pg||
nt|djneill:  normal looking auction if N-S are bidding it|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @h lead seems marked, the unbid suit|pg||
nt|yr: but i still think E should open 1@s even at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: tehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that DBL was over a 1@H transfer response   |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think we missed a double by north or something|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry to miss th play but 10 tricks madeby south|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok thanks Judy|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry I was a bit slow, but next session in one and a quarter hours...thx everyone for yr patience|pg||
nt|djneill:  excellent, thanks all!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphA2: Thanks for you company restart around 15-20 minutes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think N must have bid 1D, tr to hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: E fated to succeed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|lml: so takes the pitch and now I like spade to the ace and then another|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: Nabil likes to lead trump|pg||

pc|c4|nt|loganrun: They are very promising young players and they all have an excellent temperment - which they needed in this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Ally for a great job on the vugraph, thx specs for you great feedback, Nick Fahrer and the ABF for organising and BBO for hosting, hold your breath for the final result all ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzuu: muller  cla√Ωmed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: thx all|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: ducking D would have been fine|pg||
pc|c8|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i believe Bilski's PASS places @DQ in West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does that help declarer?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think so - @DK  @D [intending to finesse]   losing only the last trump trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it all depends on how strong Bilski can be for PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alternatively   @D3-2  then @DA  @DK  @H9 scoring @S7 en passant|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: thinks its 11 either way|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: +3 thought was going to be plus 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yr: its the sort of game Meckwell will always be in,,,but as both European teams didnt bid it, we can say safely that they  have a different philosophy about bidding games:)|pg||
