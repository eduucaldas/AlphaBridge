mb|p|nt|heyz:  i heard they were on bridgewinners.com yesterday, but i could not find them|pg||

nt|rmb1: Need to unblock @SA for 9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: OK then, would be easy if 2@D really was what I thought it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H  2@S  ;   3@S|pg||

nt|xenya: semi-garbage stayman?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|heyz:  now the guys with 25 HCP can start bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess, but you might have found the only partial that could go down on an ugly trump break|pg||

nt|vugraphzrk: EW reverse attitude, standard count|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|neobas: I think most of us would be in it still though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it begs the question of how to bid 6-4 hands, here a 2@H rebid would have worked better|pg||
nt|peachy: even so,  I expect both rooms to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like down now, with no quick entry to dummy to play trumps|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|heyz:  easy for me to say from here but if you dont come in precision pairs will steal you blind|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|neobas: In my opinion with 2@D you have told about 9/13 of your cards, and with 2@H only about 6/13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passing 3@H seems fairly clear to me|pg||
nt|peachy: there is advice existing that with bad hand 6-4, rebid the major insted of showing the 4-card minor|pg||
nt|peachy: if he is into that, then it was a guestion of was the hand bad :)|pg||
nt|neobas: Hard to find a bad 6-4 though|pg||

nt|henryb:  On the otherhand, A10732 is not the sort of defensive holding you normally want against a one level contract|pg||

nt|tomi2: I like 3@D if 2@D is not available :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tlc: me too..|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|othered1: If I open, I'd try a weak 2@D.  I"d pass rather than bid something else.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tlc: many would play a X of 1@h here is penalty, showing 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|rmb1: Comparison from OR now|pg||
nt|bobh1: another swing on 7 when 4@s made in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Short break here. Which gives me a chance to tell you something interesting :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Frank doesn't rearrange his cards when he picks them up: a legacy of playing a lot of Mahjong|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Quite interesting?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Back now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Y 4@H would be dangerous :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|othered1: Ok, on last hand, if 4@D was slam try, it was clear.  I"m told that in some parts of Europe, 2@D itself showed extras|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a 1@d opening on S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  no scores available sadly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt: hanlon mcgann used 2 play carrot club of 1987 vintage|pg||
nt|bt: so this is forcing if i remmeber correctly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: i suppose 2@d was unavailable|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|heyz:  can make on @h lead|pg||
nt|heyz:  maybe any lead |pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur: " I only bid again because I need the loo"|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes for some 1C-(1M)-X -2D shows the same values as 1C-1M-2D|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east responded in the long, bad suit rather than the short, good one.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: They're playing 3 weak 2s|pg||
nt|bobh1: then 3@d is verry strange|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Yes, Switch Ns @c and @s and 4@S looks very decent|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s K?|pg||
nt|bobh1: or @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: lots of practical chances anyway|pg||
nt|heyz:  there up to spade guess in other room|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what do you mean|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|c3|nt|xenya: now it's a spade guess, on the face of it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  Will we get updates on the standings?|pg||
nt|neobas: For instance Bergen raises|pg||
nt|neobas: Showing 4@H instead of 3_|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dJ|nt|heyz:  can POlowan play @D back now and spade back later|pg||
pc|h8|nt|neobas: *3+|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|heyz:  probably no updates unless someone at site post to bridgewinners or tells a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: we receive no updates at all.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would prefer to buy this hand at a makeable level if possible|pg||
nt|peachy: As a passed hand, I think it unwise to drive to the three level voluntarily, opposite passed hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|neobas: 2@H doesn't buy it that often though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: so they get away with it|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: bergen is invalidated by four card major openings|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|heyz:  decl will know e 55 blacks so polowan will have to throw @cQ away on first round|pg||
nt|peachy: Agree with Martin on that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how about 2@C drury|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|neobas: They play 4cM?|pg||
nt|peachy: If they have Drury, that would work. Otherwise 2H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt McGann was looking for other chances rather than committing himself to to a guess in spades -- he saw none|pg||
nt|heyz:  excellent defense by Polowan|pg||
nt|bt: very nice defence by polowan here|pg||
nt|bt: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: yes 4 card majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|4+|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Start off with a 20-20 hand, that plays a peaceful 1N.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: And cards very friendly for declarer, also without a spade lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|tlc: a relatively calm start for sure...altho hearts might have scored +140,,this should come home easily|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tomi2: I would bid 2@H in N, Kx is dias must be worth more in a suit contact. parttner can have no spade stopper or 3 hearts and 2 clubs so we can ruff one|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|othered1: Some might consider a double of 1@D wit the west hand and EW might play a low @S contract, probably down a couple|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|tlc: easier for the weak NTers , who just bid 2@h over 1NT|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzrk: 2NT not discussed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: standard London rubber bridge style|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|heyz:  need to figure out how to blackwood on this hand|pg||
nt|peachy: Considering vulneraaability, logically it should be a goodish hand, in addition to 2-suiter|pg||
nt|rmb1: Second half due at 21:15 (in 15 minutes) but we started late. |pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: i think 3@D is inv if decl is 10-12 balanced|pg||
nt|fabsayc: except when i played there was cheaper minor for takeoout over 3 preempts, and double for PENALTY|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Its meaning is becoming evident|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: A reluctant pass by Rob|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  or turbo for italians :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
