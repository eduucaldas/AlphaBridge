pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: well this lead choice will save a trick I think|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bt: now east just has to guess @H or @D, does that make it a 75% game?|pg||
nt|atalok: neden konturlamadý nezih en fazla yapar ortagý zonda açmýþ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S is just too speculative, 3@C ditto, and -180 isnt the end of the world, so he takes his chances here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on a good day pd has 3424 and opps have no fit|pg||
nt|mcphee: W was a little pushy bidding 3@H, even tho he may find 4 card support|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but Muller did not promise more than 3@hs|pg||
nt|mcphee: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can have any 5 4 1 3 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well as 4 4 1 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this will be on diamond guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my turkish is worse than my Dutch|pg||
nt|henryb:  does he have clues? perhaps: will know East started with stiff spade amd @cKJ. Perhaps with @dA also would have made a to double of 1@s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|djneill:  ok swing to Onstein after Angelini on previous board got to 3@s after opening 1@s on the 9 HCP|pg||

nt|bt: @CA @CK and @C ruff to start with is normal |pg||

nt|Gerben42: so could be 7 imps to Onstein|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: very important & much needed 7 imp gain for onstein on tha deal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still a long way |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 500 confirmed from other room|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he has entry problems|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he would like to play a 4th @S but then cannot get @CK in|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but West had a balanced 7 or 9 count and spade length.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|tez: @d as alýp @h oynarsa|pg||
nt|fabsayc: helness saw something|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: same contract open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or maybe an extra chance to set up diamonds this way to avoid a heart loser when king onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think perhaps he should have cashed the @sA first. Now his best plsy in trumps is the finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  stiff small is four times as likely as stiff queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does the spade lead change anything|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: belki 1 imp kurtarýrýz|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Could be 84-82 soon|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: this is another tough board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 3-3 spade split is useful in 4 spades. but the 4-1 club break isn't helpful|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s makes |pg||
pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: what's the best defense?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|niekbrink: second round of hearts?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cant they beat this by playing 2@hs now and then duck 1 @S, take 2nd and play another @H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then duck the ace of spades once|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Niek :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|niekbrink: seems like south has to guess the break in the minors|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, after seeing @s 3-3, he will cash @d b4 @c, if @d 4-1 then @c must be 3-2|pg||
nt|brgpro: when E shows up with 2@d, then he knows his 7-3-2-1 distribution, so he can safely cash 1 more @c( make sure) then give W a @d, knowing he has no more @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: with Niek's defense he cannot ruff a @d and a @H and pull trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|niekbrink: sorry, lost connection|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: he doesnt have to ruff a @d, just pull yrumps and give W a @d trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: fasten seatbelt|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is safe i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness going down in 4@S in a different way on board 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing to @SQ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so both declarers lost a queen to east....|pg||
nt|hedyg: after K@D was drawing A@S not safe?|pg||
nt|brgpro: niek, say defence starts with 2@h, u ruff and play trumps, W will duck one, takes 2nd and play 3rd @h, u ruff and play last trump. now knowing E is 7-3 in the majors. all u have to ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: do is to cash @d Ak, if they are 4-1 then E must have 2@c, when E shows up with 2@d, u just cash @cA, seeing 1@C by E, u can see all 13 cards now. then u safely duck a @d to make ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: this|pg||
nt|brgpro: nobody has any trumps|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I see|pg||

nt|niekbrink: i think he is considering what to do if east ruffed from 2 small spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: he cant come back to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he just goes down|pg||

nt|fabsayc: he guessed it but is it the best single dummy line, still not sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|wstuart: Many players feel that they should loosen up their preempts when pard is a passed hand since there is no game, but there is actaully a good argument for tightening up your preempts ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: since the only thing you are bidding for is finding a save, therfore your pard needs to know exactly your defensive prospects.|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: hidayet abi yok muydu?|pg||
nt|aap00: and notice @h10 in hand |pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: not sure who would be temopted to double here. even seeing all four hands.|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4@d bid did its job|pg||

nt|hedyg: Brogeland bid 4@s freely over 4@d, Blackwood saved them|pg||
nt|hedyg: or rkc|pg||

nt|marlowepi: the 4H bid by N was cutting it really fine. after the auction conducted by S, 4H does not rate to make, but if you push them into 4S you might find u cant beat it|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: suspect we might hear from Drijver at some point with that distribution |pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even wthout distribution he would be unlikely to keep quiet about AQ986 of clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure Brink promises more that 2 @C (if any)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he might wait and enter with a NT bid later|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 1@C = 13++ with @C or 15+ NT|pg||

nt|sybarra: am told it is 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5+ cards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: 1@H = @S|pg||
nt|jbgood: but chose to bid both minors economially|pg||
nt|henryb:  certainly a comfortable contract|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@d is comfortable enough|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  South could ask for a minor, potentially improving the contract, but potentially getting to 2NT or 3@h, which is worse|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs say in 4th seat 11-13|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: which is why he took the low road|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right shirley, but he is not precluded from having long clubs, and if he does then E needs to show his support right away while it is still safe|pg||

nt|hedyg: maybe you have it in your system page Dan? it is not on the CC|pg||
