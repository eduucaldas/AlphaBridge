mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: EW similar but with a multi and constructive 2s|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to all kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: NS 3 weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mrt2000: Hi Folks  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a standard 4@s now - nothing much to say about it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I do think transfer responses are one of the great theoretical advances of the last 10 years|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hi paul|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: David said "we open 1@c a lot"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Welcome back to TGR's in Marble Arch for the second half of this match - Dhondy with a bit to do |pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: There is one ruling to come on board 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d X-1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mrt2000: hi andrew|pg||
nt|peachy: East had a problem, he solved it this way|pg||
nt|mcarroll: seems a bit unilateral - esp[ecially with such good @Ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hi Paul|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: May change to 2@d making.....but unclear why at the moment|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.tgrsbridge.com/Super_League.html  for the tournament website with standings after round 5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So this is 1st vs 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Martin|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps he was concerned W could leave it in, and he does not want to defend|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bt: jon,south doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|mrt2000: hi raija|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  question of whether N-S make 4 or 5|pg||
nt|bt: now he does|pg||
nt|peachy: *she|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: S surely having shown his stiff club on the way|pg||
nt|henryb:  or go down 1 when declarer ducks this to his Q|pg||
nt|xenya: might go down on this lead?|pg||
nt|bt: i wouldnt formulate it like that in english jon|pg||
nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a 3 or 5 play|pg||
nt|bt: but i have a dirty mind|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is - contract will be the same all over the room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it did rather seem that NS were not on the same wavelength on that board |pg||
pc|d3|nt|heyz:  most fields you would try to make as many tricks as possible|pg||
nt|heyz:  this one an exception?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bt: having escaped heart lead decl will go up @DA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cute underlead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mrt2000: 7 tricks, next hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|henryb:  If N goes up with the A he can draw trumps and pitch a @h on the @cK. making 5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|heyz:  well predicted|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jbgood: i think 80% will go down - N must have gotten a clue from the speed of the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: better perhaps to win the Ace, having avoided a @H lead|pg||
nt|mrt2000: more interesting on a @D lead, perhaps?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|heyz:  a whistler as we call it in USA|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: not much more|pg||

nt|bt: going up ace will be majority play|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and then there was 6   lol|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: he|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW can hope that the opposition reach 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I suspect the stiff will be the normal lead|pg||
mb|1C|nt|heyz:  West has an easier lead than East vs @s contract|pg||
nt|bt: u have 2 know ur opps to duck that in dummy|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - and the question is how many try to take a double advantage (that isnt there)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: N and W = she|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|heyz:  solves any lead problems|pg||
nt|bt: now the question is, does north know his pds style?|pg||
nt|jbgood: weak weak in spades being the text here - n has a guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  I feel sure that he does|pg||
nt|heyz:  kib says this could be misinterpreted as t/o for @ss|pg||
nt|bt: a guess?|pg||
nt|heyz:  the dbl|pg||
nt|jbgood: that must be an odd interpretation - this is a normal suit showing double|pg||
nt|vugraphzsx: N asking E what the double means. East stating, I am not sure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: heavyweight 2NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not alerted|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hardly a takeout -- W could double before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 3@d not discussed|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 3NT doomed, I fear|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mrt2000: 8 tricks only|pg||
nt|tejjyid: So, do you assume transfers are safe in undiscussed auctions?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: could hsve been much worse  though|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2@d bad weak 2 in a major or balanced 23/24|pg||
nt|peachy: he can take his eight and give up|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I personally think it's crazy, but I observe myself to be in a minority|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I'm with you  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: perhaps without the misunderstanding, they would play in 4H|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 4@H practically laydown, and they're in 3NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: also, you have to assume if your system is 4 card majors, strong NT, that you are heavily oriented to natural bids|pg||
nt|peachy: NS sat down just before gametime and made a card, I was told. They dont usually play together (although did play in Norway sometime in the past)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is actually an interesting question in big pickup environments like BBO, where you rarely have detailed discussions|pg||
nt|peachy: I make the blanket agreement with all partners that systems on, makes life simple|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and avoids mistakes like this too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Artur in the tank|pg||
nt|peachy: it has some flaws but avoids misunderstandings|pg||
nt|tejjyid: yes, system on covers a multitude of situations|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  West still has to find the @c shift|pg||
nt|jbgood: a very careful 3@s - but 3@d bid got defense to a nice start - conventions sometimes give away leaddirecting doubles|pg||
nt|henryb:  otherwise declarer can still make five|pg||
nt|mrt2000: Artur may surface and make the best of it, I think !   lol|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky lead for declarer - the defence can attack spades from the South hand |pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  by guessing hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and duck on the way bacl|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not like that though |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: NO !!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: YES!|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so I see|pg||
nt|peachy: well, back to same 8 he had before|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  no, only 4|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think he can avoid losing a club|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, no|pg||
nt|peachy: well, undoubled overtricks notvuln are not too awful, he was hoping to make|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure why West did that. I think a spade is better, to clear the spade trick. Entries may be awkward now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: not a bad contract, the only fault is it is not making :(|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|s7|nt|jbgood: .. or two|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  now 2 clubs to lose|pg||
nt|henryb:  He could make 4 after the start by taking a ruffing finesse in hearts and getting three club discards: one on the @dQ and two on hearts|pg||

nt|vugraphzrk: They've now agreed systems on|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|henryb:  missed a decent slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: not only decent|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bt: slam is great but in natural systems after 1@H - 1@S ...|pg||
nt|mrt2000: XX maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: forgot to agree on BW :) as well|pg||
nt|peachy: vulnerable, decision is clear|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Given the state of the match aggression is probably the option|pg||
nt|peachy: that also|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: ow|pg||
mb|p|nt|heyz:  best lead now @D to 9 not safe|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|mrt2000: N is a difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|mrt2000: has|pg||
nt|peachy: I wonder if Dbl was anti-lead directing in clubs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: only a bit unlucky, the @D were going away on the @H eventually|pg||
nt|tejjyid: actually, BW doesn't help because of the void|pg||

nt|oliverc: this looking a little one-sided at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Evening. A pedestrian start to the 2nd session|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: Yes. 4 swings in the 1st set, though one still subject to a ruling|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, West might have made the game on  14|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: true|pg||
nt|oliverc: The OR in the same 3NT on 14|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  either that or playing a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|mrt2000: not if Tom bids 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: sorry, David|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: x showing extra values|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yuck !!!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very surprising actions by first West, then East. My guess is they are on slightly different wavelengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: 2NT shows @D and 3@c shows dislike of @d ie less than Hxx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lead from N?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|heyz:  can you combine spade plays and diamond hook + ruffing a @D/|pg||
nt|heyz:  ?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: by several megahertz, I fear !|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Smell @S|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|oliverc: this looks fairly routine from here. just take the Diamond finesse and concede a @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: to me, east's X shows this hand, which makes West's bid PASS rather than 2NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  I do not think you have the entries|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|heyz:  1@H is balanced gf here?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|heyz:  and Geoff patterned out i presume|pg||
nt|rodal f: But platable it seem. Or?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mrt2000: at this vulnerability?|pg||
nt|peachy: Agree, take the plus instead of trying for a potentially tight 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: playable|pg||
nt|peachy: the return of the nine might be not easily read by Callaghan|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|cuan: 1@H is any 8-11 |pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't worry about redesigning mys system so much for vulnerability|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|mrt2000: 500 isn't great against 600+|pg||
nt|peachy: but much better than -100|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
nt|peachy: but if not, then declarer has five spades, which could be unlikely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: helpful lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|heyz:  spade to K for 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly the 8 is prommised|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt: discarding @D then spade to K|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I know, but for the simplicitu of the bidding, I make the sacrifice|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: that may not be made at other tables|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|peachy: well, maybe it didn't say that, for them. Afterall, playing in NT with Jxx opposite "can';t defend" does not feel right|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jbgood: and defense do not often counterattack declarer's first played suit|pg||
mc|10|nt|cuan: 1@H is any 8-11|pg||
nt|xenya: should be a very good score for NS i think|pg||
nt|cuan: 1@C is strong|pg||
nt|henryb:  above average for N-S on both boards|pg||
nt|heyz:  should holman have suspected Greco's @hs were strong?|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would really be nice to get updated standings sometime|pg||
nt|heyz:  or just credit G_H for a system win|pg||
nt|bt: both pairs here are in the hunt|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, because of NT in the face of partner's shortness, but they did not have to be that strong|pg||
nt|jbgood: a common auction would be 1 c - 1 h - 2 s - 2 NT - 3 nt|pg||
nt|henryb:  I will say this just once more: there are no websites with updated standings in the pairs of which I am aware|pg||
nt|xenya: it doesn't look like declarer can make 11 on a @D lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: no - you have to get 2 heart tricks - and dont do that unless hearts are lead'|pg||
nt|henryb:  They do have updated standings in Philadelphia, but they are not being communicated to the Web|pg||
nt|xenya: or, as a spectator points out, on any lead but a heart -- it's just that a @D lead appears to be obvious |pg||
nt|bt: at mp a diamond lead is fairly obvious, yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: the standing is actually published in the playing room - i will get them in half an hour|pg||
nt|henryb:  Interestingly, at the other vg table, 6@h was bid and made on 15, and 3N made 430 on 16|pg||

nt|rodal f: 1NT= Buy?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Guy|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  the best line in 6@h is to win a @c in dummy and play a @d to the 9, intending to finesse the @dQ later if it loses to the J or 10. This is about 60%, taking into account the possibility that @h are 4-0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South ducked the second spade to the ace and there were only eight tricks - a chance missed in this room  |pg||

nt|bt: phil gordon has 2 nabc championships i hear|pg||

nt|jbgood: stand corrected: 1.5 %'|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: the 3NT bid is rash|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no, I'm sorry, S has every bit of his bidding, it's N who was suicidal|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: a 64 shape is serious by definition|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bt: i think south has doen really well here|pg||
nt|heyz:  agree|pg||
nt|xenya: S will get two more trumps and a diamond -- at least|pg||
nt|bt: and now east is endplayed|pg||
nt|peachy: there is also an inference that a 1D overcall that takes away no bidding room from oponents, can be potentially a very good hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|heyz:  two round of @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: good news - diamonds not 5-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrk: he didn't flinch at the Q|pg||
nt|mamos: North's think here cannot help the defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, it rather marks the @SQ|pg||
nt|mamos: overuffing doesnt feel right either|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bt: south can get out a spade|pg||
nt|xenya: but he can endplay S :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: i don't think that inference is particulalrly valid, although I know it's popular|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: the least N can do is just rebid his diamonds and not make it look like he does hae thegood hand. I may be wrong|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|bt: south is counted out isnt he?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|bt: maybe a few 200s so average+ ew?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: just look again how the auction wpold have gone if Artur has passed throughout|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, that's another possibility, if you play that bidding 2 suits guarantees full weight|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|nt|mamos: all over well done|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Right, you can't stop in 3@S if opener has a doubleton, but how often do you want that?|pg||
