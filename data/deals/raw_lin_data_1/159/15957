mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Another Acol 2 or is this a 2@C opening?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s in the other got nowhere close|pg||
nt|athene: i certainly would not want to open 1@H on that north hand|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: acol 2's should steam into it|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is if you do that you have no sensible rebid other than 4@H and that uses up so much room, you miss slams all the tiem|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's a perfect Namyats opening for me, but they don't play that|pg||
nt|athene: because partners don't risk the 5-level even with decent hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: another possibility indeed|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@C strong with hearts but not enough defence for a 2@C opening. 4@D = 1 ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then we are there, no?|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam looks inevitable|pg||
nt|athene: i don't like 2@S - 3@H has to be better?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i am sure bernard plays 2@S as guaranteeing 3+ controls - so this is the proverbial duck soup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor can't be sure that partner has @SK, but he did bid a positive 2@S, so 6@H is definitely worth a try|pg||

nt|oliverc: difficult for South over 4@H, I suspect|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not fond of 4 @H but then not sure what to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: the problem is the Jxx of @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: you could be off 2 or 3  quick @D?|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|oliverc: truth is you can't bid every perfect-fit 27-point slam that comes along|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the S hand is pretty good....do you move again?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Bidding 6@H may be better than 50%,  They might lead the wrong minor, and there may not be a right minor to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec suggesting gazilli |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oliverc: Not sure I would. I would over 3@H (which I would play suggesting a partial @S fit)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrs: We're off! Systems discussions finished|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: in the past people used to open 1@C with 5-5 in the black suits but 1@S is more popular these days|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|othered1: 1@S-2@D-3@C-3@S?|pg||
mb|2C|an|gf|nt|roswolf: how will west treat this - gf it seems|pg||
nt|athene: they may play that 1@S - 2@D promises five|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think any gf|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite common to respond 2@C on any balanced hand - the logic is similar to opening 1@C on any balanced hand; you want to maximise bidding space|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this might be difficult to bid to slam|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: I'll be interested in how the auciton develops if east can't be sure of actual @C in west's hand|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|roswolf: indeed ed but e/w are of a modern scientific bent|pg||
nt|athene: most top pairs who play this sort of loose 2@C response try to make responder the captain|pg||
nt|athene: so he finds out exactly what opener has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may get to 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: or perhaps a general|pg||
nt|athene: and it doesn't matter that much that he isn't describing his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7@S can't make with clubs 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a grand is certainly possible - which was the point of my initial question|pg||
nt|athene: you do make 7 don't you?|pg||
nt|othered1: But not a good contract needing both @S pick-up and @C without loss.|pg||
nt|athene: heart-club squeeze on north as it happens|pg||
nt|athene: with the @H10 being a menace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suppose there is|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: This EW pair missed a grand slam on the last board of the previous segment |pg||
nt|roswolf: this will take sometime i fear|pg||
nt|athene: they surely won't bid 7 - even getting to 6 is by no means trivial|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|athene: neither black suit is exactly solid|pg||
nt|othered1: might have some entry problems for that squeeze on some reasonable, non-double dummy lines|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|Walddk2: Not only did they miss a grand slam, they also let the opponents play in 4@SX, and the defence was miserable|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes not a good effort all round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, they would have lost 12 instead of 14 IMPs regardless|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Without knowing their style, do you think there was adequate investigation here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamond lead looks normal|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Can't you just set up diamonds in 7 when one opponent has KQx?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to draw trumps ending in dummy then take an immediate club finesse?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No squeeze needed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: no they are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|athene: true you can set up a second diamond trick as well|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|athene: or just use the diamonds as yet another threat against poor north|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now will south double on the way out?|pg||
nt|othered1: That wouldn't be my favorite way to bid south's hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't seem right that spades were not mentioned|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has shown a fair hand but even so i feel north should pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaping Michaels (4@D) is not on the CC is my guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Might be hard for north to work out what's happening here, especially with pass of 3@C by east|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: I wonder if North was not sure what double of 3@C would have been?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a lot of good judgment in that auction|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Since no game is available for N-S they did very well to stop in 3@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: 130 is a nice score on these cards|pg||
