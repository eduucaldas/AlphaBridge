mb|2S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: in the other room a solid plus for crouch|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: or a spade and a club switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For some reason Erichsen switched to a heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had to guess where to set up a trick|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Seems practical just to call 5@D now|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  can't sensibly investigate a slam can he?|pg||
nt|roswolf: some danger of e/w getting too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@S is an aggressive option|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A switch is bound to come at trick 2 if they are in 5@D, but not so easy to know if partner has @CK or @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in continuing spades, of course, as declarer is marked with a singleton|pg||
nt|henryb:  where is the @h trick going if partner has the @cQ?|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hQ|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  K@C is a better lead against 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Valid point|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But if Byrne bids 3 or 4@C now, will you find the club lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will do well to stop now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: easier for South to switch|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suppose if North has @hQ and @cQxx, you have to knock out the @hA before the @c are set up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chrisdixon:  I would want to play 5@D on this hand|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As John Matheson points out, a heart switch is also needed if partner has @HQ and @CAxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a testing board - if this goes off then crouch will more than likely win handsomely|pg||
nt|henryb:  is this the last set, or is there one more?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: one more|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|chrisdixon:  I think this contract has more chance - even with the spades 5-0|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Despite the 5-0 trump break he can make it if he guesses @DJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: it certainly does and the lead will help|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  I think he can discard a diamond on the 2nd heart and play a sort of Xruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it can make but will it!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure he needs to guess the @dJ. He takes 5@s in hand, (the @sQ, a @c ruff; two @h and a @d and two ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|chrisdixon:  Natural play is cash 2 hearts and lead a @D to the Queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even ruff a heart first|pg||

nt|vugraphzrs: still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: making the contract will certainly raise n/s spirits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he needs the diamond finesse if his next move is to play a club from dummy. Because East will get in and switch to a trump|pg||

nt|henryb:  He needs to win the @s switch with the Q, and if East continues clubs, I think he is in deep doo doo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He still has the diamond guess to fall back on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would East continue clubs you may ask|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but i fancy he wont get it right|pg||

nt|ady: if the defence gets this right   could be 2 or 3 hundred to e/w|pg||
nt|viren169: North probably should have bid 1@S to catch the 4-4 spade fit (if it existed)|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 1@H was weak NT and 1N would have been 4 spades|pg||
nt|iain sime: The methods have resulted in playing 1NT from the wrong side. The defence is a tempo ahead.|pg||
nt|viren169: so North knew he did not have a spade fit...|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@H that is |pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: probably not natural  |pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: They will need to get their skates on to bid it first!|pg||
nt|garnetts: South might try a double but North has thought for too long --state of the match thing though|pg||
nt|garnetts: South is good for 3@H--prefer maybe a dbl of 2NT to suggest a good raise |pg||
nt|viren169: cant see anyone applying the red card to the 3-level|pg||
nt|iain sime: 4@H in tempo might have induced a "save".|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rmb1: I guess 2@C is one of "@C or balanced GF"  OR "@C GF or 3 card @S raise"|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is conservative |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: true, that was the idea:)|pg||

nt|garnetts: Odd thing is Gad you are right nobody ever doubles stretch contrcats these days--maybe that is where the new money is |pg||
nt|ady: Quuen and jack of spades followed bya club switch seems likely|pg||
nt|ady: Liggins woulc have played higher spade for a diamond   |pg||
nt|iain sime: If East has been paying attention to the pips, this should be no problem. The @S9 would have suggested a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|garnetts: a @D looks possible too--maybe the second spade is Suit preference or should be |pg||
nt|ady: danger is passive defence|pg||
nt|viren169: both spades are likely to be suit preference|pg||
nt|garnetts: the 8 is close to the 9--best defence is to overtake the Q@S and lead back the 2 --should be clear then |pg||

nt|iain sime: I think 2@D was ok, but follow it with 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Last of this set|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|iain sime: 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|rmb1: Last board of the set.  Thanks to the operator Tim and fellow commentators Shirley and Oliver.  Thanks as always to Roland and BBO, and to EBU|pg||
nt|garnetts: My issue with that is that in my view the ucb is best used for hands suited to suit play |pg||
nt|ady: Rosen needs to stay out of a slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Thanks to Tim for some great operating and thanks all for putting up with me and my now ex fellow commentators |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: ty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 52 the difference now (Crouch needs 38 to overtake Rosen), but this will likely cost Crouch 11-12|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: like the last baord not a great deal of interest --11 tricks in 4@S so thanks again |pg||
nt|Walddk4: so they are very 'close' in a way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still 20 boards to come after this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1. Rosen 115 - 2. Teltscher 110 - 3. Crouch 106 VP  before the last round|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|kerasidis: why cant we see the auction in the other room of this board?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: my problem too:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius to see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: we started late because of technical problems, so results only for the first 8 boards|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 4N by South opposite 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other matches after the first stanza: Small +22 vs de Botton, Hinden +20 vs Hackett, Senior +16 vs Teltscher|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Last hand, and a good start for Crouch, who are lying third. They will both be concerned that second placed Teltscher are playing the tail-enders.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Forresters good weak twos appear to vary.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S will not play as well as 3@D in OR|pg||
nt|oliverc: thanks Robin. Teltscher should gain IMPs here|pg||
nt|viren169: 5N?!?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not the best auction I have ever seen|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: pick a|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Well, N-S got out of jail here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 20 minutes remaining called by director|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: think we'll get this one in!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Jon Vos for great operating!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: and to you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to Rashed, Ralf and Roberto for commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: Tom shows his hearts suit to dummy |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: John (not Jon)  sorry, John|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: My last here. I'm off to lose a Gold Cup match!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good luck, I could easily lose it for you if you like|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Peter's jumper going back on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Air con kicking in|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzrt: Espen thought Norman was on lead!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: As predicted, 12 IMPs to Rosen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzrt: slam|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: provided that he makes this|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: NS have the advantage of playing the same contract on both the tables.:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5NT was presumeably a nudge to get partner to make the final mistake and he made it |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|oliverc: Certainly off 1 or 2 from here|pg||
nt|ady: good session for Crouch   |pg||
nt|viren169: found their 2nd worst fit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: even so I do not understand the 6@C bid |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: I need to have supper now --so bye all --probably make 12 now with the q@H ruffing out |pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the difference 40|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|iain sime: Unluckily this goes down. But Jones might have tested the defence by stripping the spade out first.|pg||
