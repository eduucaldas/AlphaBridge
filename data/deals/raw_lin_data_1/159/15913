mb|4S|nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||

nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Negoescu - Briciu is not a regular partnership, but let's hope that they'll do well today|pg||
nt|bobholl: if n @H lead may be even 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@s should be 8-10, so 3@h invitational with losers @h i guess|pg||

nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
nt|tez: if dbl again pd could bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: 2@Cx make no game|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tez|pg||
nt|anton72: too agressive start :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
nt|haans: you for the kill |pg||
nt|haans: good start|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble would be too agressive, but pass, not 5@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
nt|bernix: difficult to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: penalty doubles have died in IMPs|pg||
nt|milton_se: in any case, NS have given away a lot of information|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S @D @H 4 made |pg||
nt|edmunte1: the romanian team in Stara Zagora has only 3 members of the team that won the Romanian Teams Bridge Championship last year|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS are a strong pair, member of Greece national team that finished 29th this year in Ostende|pg||

nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bobholl: why not @D K ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however just a guess, bcos declarer still have no idea abt @d values|pg||
nt|haans: worth full 6 tricks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: so Croatia draws first blood :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D now|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or will she cash the setting trick first?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no hurry there, I think|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not easy for Justin|pg||
nt|tez: if he plays @h..he can put ace of @h i thk|pg||
mc|8|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|udo: still -2 and a decent score,,maybe the board|pg||

nt|kerasidis: hi thomas!|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hey Tomi|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|andy_h: A little problem for Smirnov. It's an 8 card suit with a good shape, but the vulnerability and the lack of suit quality will prevent him from preempting 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 5 @h?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think Kalita can double with 2 aces|pg||
nt|tomi2: he knows partner opens very sound only :)|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|andy_h: 1@H-(3@S) can be a very annoying auction for standard system players. The reason is because you can't "cuebid" showing a good raise unless you drive to the 5level. This is why some ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: people have adopted transfers in competitive bidding especially after certain preempts|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: that you mean andy :)|pg||

nt|andy_h: If 4NT was intended as two places to play, I wonder how he knows that a 5-4@D fit (if there is one) fairs better than a 5-4@H fit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tomi2: you might ruff the spade(s) with the shorter trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: live from izmir http://www.ustream.tv/channel/champions-cup-2010|pg||
nt|kerasidis: some times is better to pass a secrifise bid though they can approach slem....with  a little luck|pg||
nt|andy_h: I don't really buy it if it was intended has keycard. If 4@S can be bid on a doubleton (like it was here) for all he knows spades could be breaing 7-2-2-2 around the table|pg||

nt|haans: the right answer? Tez: i prefer 2@h..not double|pg||
nt|stc: and a rare good save at bad vuln|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|edmunte1: Briciu, Filip and Ionita were also members of romanian team that finished 27th in Ostende|pg||
nt|stc: will N risk a Staymann ?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||

nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there Ron described overcall principles|pg||

nt|gmarco24: it's not common to bid 3 doubles with 3 spades and club void|pg||

nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||

nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||

nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||

nt|andy_h: Smirnov is contemplating who has the @SK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: must unblock ace spade in order to cash the additional spade trick|pg||
nt|andy_h: He will probably give up a diamond now and let the defenders set up their heart(s) in a way in which Smirnov can endplay the person with the @SK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|andy_h: Given that hearts are 3-3, he should be safe|pg||

nt|andy_h: East knows that West has the @HK and can see only 3 tricks. West has only 1 entry to put either a heart or a spade through but not both|pg||
nt|tomi2: interesting, Narkiewicz took a compleatly different line, he played a heart from dummy in 2nd trick|pg||
nt|andy_h: If East switches to a heart to let West push a spade through, I think declarer would be able to read that it is East who has the @SK. Smirnov can thus win the @SA, cash his ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: diamond, and exit with a spade|pg||
nt|tomi2: small spade now woudl work if Smirnov thinks west had doubleton king, then he might duck the queen|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
nt|ady: if they try 3NT   likely to fail|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
nt|bobholl: but do both players know each otheres habbits ?|pg||

nt|bobholl: other rrom 5@H X|pg||
nt|bobholl: and made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: adventurous 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and mirror position in @d suit bad|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@c is a pass/corect bid|pg||
nt|edmunte1: showing fit for both minors|pg||
nt|haans: DBL = lead directing|pg||
nt|april7: N can't find the K of @S in 5@H, then only 1 down, but also 2 down is ok|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe he'll find @c lead after all|pg||
nt|bernix: part score penalty doubles en vogue in open room|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe they double more confidently because north didnt bid spades there|pg||
nt|haans: or 2@H being Ekrens|pg||
nt|bernix: what is ekrens|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It has several chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS might make 6@D here - needs a bit of play on a spade lead |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Many chances|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
nt|haans: best 2@S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fave= in USA we mean 'favorites' in internet explorer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a bunch of nt here |pg||
nt|mamos: good slam here|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@d would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still a chance for 6@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable|pg||
nt|haans: right no support pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: @DJ, than @S to 10 ... opps will have to be very careful|pg||

nt|gmarco24: no rdbl, no trouble  :)|pg||
nt|haans: heading to 7nt?|pg||
nt|haans: assume this board will take some time at OR 2 :)|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 2nt invite because they have bad suppprt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
nt|ady: showing their stoppers    but not enough for 3NT to make|pg||
nt|haans:  3-8 at leastb 4-4 in M|pg||
nt|bernix: will he find the killing lead ?|pg||
nt|bernix: 4@h will propably fail on lack of entries |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||

nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: till to here USA 79, Europe 65|pg||
nt|milton_se: and down|pg||
nt|tez: israel yadlin was my teammate this summer..mersin bridge festival..he played very well|pg||
nt|danilo1: reasonable @SK try |pg||
nt|haans: yep 1 trick or none|pg||
nt|danilo1: still time for @S trick|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess they know each other|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d by N is an acceptable contract, basicaly on @d 3-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what does South do now, though?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Draw trumps, try to make @HQ drop, and if not a club finesse or a show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isn't that what you would do in 6@D?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West will certainly lead @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play two times clubs towards hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S lead necessary to beat them|pg||
nt|haans: chicken :(|pg||
nt|tez: whats trump they have not an idea|pg||
nt|stc: even 2@s may go down !!|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: Sorry,but there was lead out of turn and I will claim final result|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
nt|mamos: so Europw will win this board|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @C lead 5@H probably fails|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 tricks if either major finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sabine checks which responses to Keycard they are playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 0314  to me|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s not bad|pg||
nt|ady: West stepped in at wrong time|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry was fixed on S playing :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to play without regular partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is individual |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @dK|pg||
nt|tez: now show your suit:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Look like the best line of play|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d may be unanimous in the field|pg||
nt|ady: only have to negotiate club position if east ducks twice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and two rounds hearts before west discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sp A+ruff also needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who knows a slip in defence - actually almost impossible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if the @c 9 would be at the table things would be easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while @sA not knocked out would just concede a @c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you duck that you have recitified the count for a possible squeeze|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|bobholl: lose 1 trick in each colour i fear|pg||
nt|april7: K of @C no good card, so the X is also a bad one|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
nt|mamos: only a small club as it happens|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so all "suffering" under same rules |pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed a 60% (guess) @D slam but ...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||

nt|sybarra: one for USA and one for Europe,  my guess permitted to glance at to double check|pg||
nt|bobholl: have to guess @S to make :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: better for europe|pg||
nt|bobholl: on our first board ns in 5@C 1 down doubled|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: but @s lead was very bad, made @sK winner|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and gave a chance to pitch @d lsoer|pg||

nt|h_karluk: club loser at hand goes to @hK|pg||
nt|danilo1: @HK and @H if not 2-2 now .. East is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that East passed 3@H. There are people who would double it  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: I assume this is Jill |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, at least 6 boards, both sides have a chance to read their way well, i won an indy a month ago in my unit, played with 14 different partners 2 boards each round|pg||
nt|edmunte1: more IMP's for the home team|pg||

pc|h3|nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, bobby|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: way easy|pg||

nt|bobholl: well we know where the @C K is he doesn't|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: might win the board with that|pg||

pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: vwd|pg||

nt|tez: no need @s finesse..|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andy_h: Here's your job now Tomi, since I only know 1% of their system :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 1@C is Blatic :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@H is basicly natural, constructive, but could frequently be on 3 cards only|pg||
nt|tomi2: thats why they alert|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1@S is forcing, can be 12-14 or 18+bal with 4 sapdes, 12+ with 4 spades and 5+ clubs or 5+@S 18+hcp|pg||
nt|tomi2: *baltic|pg||
nt|tomi2: 3nt is to play vs the 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|tomi2: now north must find some practical bid to show his extra strength|pg||
nt|andy_h: Was there any way that Smirnov could have slowed the auction down say with 2@D?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andy_h: 3NT is certainly practical I agree given that 12-14NT comes up more frequently, but jamming the auction when partner doesn't have that can be a little awkward|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2: I think they play some kind of transfers after 1@S but 3NT perfectly fits to smirnovs hand, noth red suits well stopped, bal hand|pg||

nt|h_karluk: allright, think i said "gosh" :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|stc: nice fight in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suspect they win that one|pg||
nt|westjava: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio Duboin (born September 30, 1959 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian bridge player. Duboin has won four World teams championships along with six consecutive European teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: championships and a seventh European in 2010. For many years his regular partner was Norberto Bocchi; now he plays primarily with Antonio Sementa.|pg||
nt|jbgood: no records of the play in the OR - Broge will not be happy to lose that board|pg||
nt|Walddk7:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d then maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a normal result|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops sorry,  wd Bobby :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries they r both fm th family|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is unique fomat |pg||
nt|edmunte1: probablyNS playing a strong club system, that's the only way i can understand pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|haans: plus for Radisic-Altman|pg||
nt|haans: more here :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be imp to Israel|pg||
nt|bernix: +1 is wrong isnt it|pg||
nt|bernix: 10 tricks only|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: sorry =|pg||
nt|haans: Final word: bbhants: and he played it well to that point!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: only small @S from hand makes it|pg||
nt|stc: you can play J from dummy for Hx in S or small to the dummy for Hx in N|pg||
nt|stc: small from dummy is good only for stiff H in S|pg||
nt|stc: on a good day you make 4@s with ew hands, not today|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S all pas is possible|pg||
nt|anton72: horoble hand|pg||
nt|anton72: 33 points 2 fits ...no slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a good solid result|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he got an easy win prev hand, so they are even|pg||
nt|bobholl: show up is the rigth expression |pg||
nt|h_karluk: nah, i expect the field wld be in 5@d with same tricks, to me a tie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and south may reopen, who knows|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 again|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops 9-13|pg||
nt|rado: here 2NT 5+@s INv+ maybe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unfair.... You have their system in front of you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes this will happen often|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes checks the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no doubt checking if 3@H or some such bid shows 5-5 Majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia laying in the bushes|pg||
nt|mamos: and it seems ok to consult your own card :)    a couple of times I think teams have been helping the oppo witheir system :)|pg||
nt|haans: score is not decide here we just have to carry along|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Should Zia just pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strectched mini roman|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 4 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H could be 4 cards when 4@s4@H(32)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north surely looking for slam here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they may and are unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     1NT likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult choice for N 3Nt or 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: here EW win 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a friendly group |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Quite refreshing to see players being allowed to check their own cards imo|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  aggressive lead here by rodwell cost s costly trick|pg||
nt|haans: max 3@H|pg||
nt|tez: muranli/ozden playing first time i think at vugraph |pg||
nt|haans: double looming here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes asks for the card - he hasn't brough one with him|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this in the system notes i doubt it :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully that shows 55 majors  :)  on both sides of the table  East and West :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it seems EW don't have any European system cards with them|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes that is in notes 55 majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i would bid 4@H as W|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers suggests that they just tell each other :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: meanwhile the director brings them a copy of the system|pg||
nt|mamos: Its a sensible gadget |pg||
nt|riccho:  it is on the card 4@d =5+5+MAJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it is not clear if the 4@D bid is actually on the system!|pg||
nt|bobholl: but did nunes know it ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Note 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Ah, think Eric's found it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  He looked on the cc, didnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i still believe a questionable decision|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's wait Fulvio's result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the overtrick was critical  for a Eorope gain|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately an unmakable contract |pg||
nt|bernix: i would have opened south hand with 2@h|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: edit : stretched|pg||
nt|jbgood: voidshowing 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: need to put some brakes on soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this one is THE VERY WILD contest. Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: von arnim and hamman picked double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe was dominant half of the round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bobby decides to stay on defence in case they also reached 6@d things may change|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H I mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: NO strong @C now ?|pg||
nt|stc: did well to stay low|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @S's? What @S's?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe some east west (a minority) might decide to compete with ie 5@h <prev board>|pg||
nt|ady: interesting     win and play back 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia lent Rodwell his 3@H card two boards ago, and now has to ask for it back :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: don't know, just guessing|pg||
nt|milton_se: don't think they play a strong C -- se board 1|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: Opening Bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld ask Fulvio's idea in Facebook:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew very good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claudio is pleased he remembered correctly :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: he cannot misclick as we, So Nunes knew|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He guessed that he remembered the bid correctly|pg||
nt|haans: a Ekren version at least 54 in M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  surely 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 6@d pick a major suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fulvio did not use any convention vs 15-17 1N blindly at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|edmunte1: identical bid as in OR|pg||
nt|edmunte1: ok, they play natural|pg||
nt|haans: Kib say that Ozden-Muranli may play vugrapgh for 1st time|pg||
nt|haans: and they are new players|pg||
nt|bernix: 2@s looks weired to me|pg||
mb|4N|nt|haans: in BAM you scores nothing for second best contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normally 11-15 any 4441|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and 3@S = 2@S and 6@H, Rado?|pg||
nt|rado: unfortunatelly don't remember LOL|pg||
nt|rado: with trumps 3-3 4@S will be ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: We seem to have a mild technical hitch, but hopefully the broadcast will continue|pg||
nt|westjava: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld be happy to play this board 31c by N|pg||
nt|haans: 1 trick short|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c by North|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cheap defence in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not found.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @C lead beats 3 NT|pg||
nt|stc: no play on a @c lead|pg||
nt|stc: @d will also do, he will not put the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: was told the twins' NT is 14-16 ... but that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-2 is  68%  (not 28)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: "how light do you open"|pg||
nt|mcphee: gazilli in  action|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well bid by Jason|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken claimed 10 tricks, but Meckstroth was very honest and declared that the @DK falls, so 11|pg||
nt|ady: duck   or take and switch to a sspade    easier defence    duck|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably North enquires and South shows max with Heart feature|pg||
nt|mamos: so Rodwell goes for the magic NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both M aces favorably placed|pg||
nt|tez: results http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|stc: he can play on @s and make or on @d and go down|pg||
nt|stc: wrong, wrong, a @c after K@s is good enough to beat|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobholl: J of @H and Q of @S my guess|pg||
nt|kastan88: all USA pairs went for 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS playing udca and 2/4 leads in standard bulgarian way |pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: Ekren is rocking the boatth Truct they make misstake|pg||
nt|bernix: how is he to know that pard has equal length in majors ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: unlucky opening bid (probable @H lead) ... I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: -1 next|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East must be unlimited since West is thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so long|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@h a bit dangerous, East may go past 3NT w/o something in @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this is the final contract, NS have to be careful not to block the hearts - we can assume South will lead one |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: when we pass 1NTx we have a balnced and|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fulvio liked his @s Qtx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff preferred double with same hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which indicates there were also strong NT opening values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now we are about to see which strategy would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind this is super matchpoints|pg||
nt|haans: Jacks of low value|pg||
nt|bernix: although my partner does not appreciate w2 bids with 2 outside tricks|pg||
nt|haans: well we have all done worse|pg||
nt|haans: Running score http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/  + klick on results|pg||
nt|tez: woow|pg||
nt|gmarco24: wasn't easy to push to 6 with xxx@d|pg||
nt|haans: no good preformance all around|pg||
nt|tez: will altman lead small @d for @s ruff|pg||
nt|haans: boath|pg||
nt|bobholl: first steal a @D then @S makes|pg||
mb|6S|nt|h_karluk: For Europe 4 Norwegians there : Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Brogeland- "you pulled out of slam again!"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes's played cards are difficult to see from this vantage point, so please don't read too much into the pips etc :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't 5@D that already ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Hampson : "I just didn't want to get doubled :)"|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   mixing hands up|pg||
nt|kastan88: from europeans only Nunes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you want to win the board just trust your luck, place @c9 to righty |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play a spade towards table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways after the opening lead quick tricks are : 1@s, 4@c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer should produce extra 2 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: for a spade ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: the italian slam on 3 gives a 2-1 lead to Europe|pg||
nt|oliverc: despite the 4-0 trump break, this looks like it should make|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-3 among 6 is 36|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gazilli - A complex method of rebidding after a major opening and forcing 1 no trump response, involving an artificial forcing rebid of 2 clubs by opener to handle awkward rebid ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hands. Similar in effect to the Bart Convention but handles more hand types.|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 2@S bid some sort of relay|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks Roland|pg||

nt|h_karluk: declarer claims|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but no reason for that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a dia would work better|pg||
nt|edmunte1: going down now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: In Bam you sometimes score nothing for the best contract  all that matters is the score :)|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|westjava: thats why I agree with you, a dime stopped|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 4@C was the hand W expected 4@D would be a last train sort of cue bid|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: FN are probably the best pair in the world, so strange to see them in a 5-2 fit here|pg||
nt|rado: true:) but habbits|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (sorry if I offended all the other world-class pairs here)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: again conservative approach rewarded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild slam, rather a novel problem|pg||
nt|gmarco24: so, 2@d would be @d/@s|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead best|pg||
nt|anton72: they did it |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  on trump finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good bidding by norway here |pg||
nt|mamos: ta just looked at CC  -- |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: In fact in the match yesterday both US and Europe had to check they were playing Drury, and they both were|pg||
nt|yvesj49: quite dangerous......|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept|pg||
nt|haans: may have a problem with ace asking|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: slightly odd position for West  p opens the bidding  oppo bid a slam and you need to save|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 2 clubs losers|pg||
nt|haans: @D finesse |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia off for a comfort break|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He appears to be suffering from a cold|pg||
nt|mamos: certainly quite tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: wont finesse the @H :)|pg||
nt|mamos: likely to go down methinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: migth be even 2 down|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wd Bob|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@h|pg||
nt|tez: not my style dbl with altman hand|pg||
nt|bernix: but will east continue after finding that 2 aces are missing ?|pg||
nt|haans: West may bid 6 after 5|pg||
nt|boyklas: yes...this is more possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would if QJ of @H were Kx|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt for he had to much|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but there are 4 @h losers|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: so there!!  wd Bobby |pg||
nt|milton_se: very tough by Nego but the cards lie well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S will make i guess thanks to fav @S position|pg||
nt|haans: best direct 4NT 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: in my book raise now to 4NT is quant|pg||
nt|stc: reached by less scientific aproach|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice result if natural bidding you "ll reach 6@D|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: güzel atak|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: spade guess for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4N rkcb 0314 - last asked suit|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think east may have bid 3Spades as a Q-bid would be better|pg||
nt|haans: @DT good card|pg||
nt|stc: and loose 3IMP|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they may make|pg||
nt|haans: win some lose same|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be not good enough W may guess rigth (i would'nt)|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer must guess @D after @C lead, no tempo if he does not pick ip 5 @D tricks|pg||
nt|haans: odds for flat board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|blewah: nootice the low @s played by meyers, making sure her p have entry to her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might suggest cashing a bunch of tricks |pg||
nt|blewah: *notice|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same Arya,  very important |pg||
nt|bobholl: after @D K spades are guessable may be :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: yes lots of specs agree may be down two|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Fred is saying "thx pard"   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 controls + @h Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||
nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
nt|ady: lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont have sympathy to 2@s there, to me clear cut 2N|pg||
nt|haans: had 2@S been natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|anton72: exactly that is game but .... with 20 points this is not serious ....1 finesse and 3-3 break @h ...about 16 % chance|pg||
nt|stc: must cash @d now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board I will re enter some of the play on the 3NT, then move to 12|pg||
nt|haans: thinking or no connect?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably Tony taking his time|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 75 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|riccho:  He will finesse in @h I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably going to watch a few pitches on spades first |pg||
nt|mamos: partly it depends on if he thinks 3NT or 4@S is the likely contract at the other table|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for non-americans Bob or Bobby are acronyms of Robert|pg||
nt|april7: I am pretty sure that they will be in 3@S in CR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: generally, it's better when you are defending, showing leads etc. but can be quite self-destructive as here was|pg||
nt|haans: ace aking with @DK as ace?|pg||
nt|stc: BIG OOPS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|murat: operator could you please send me a private message?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @h 8 still firm even covered|pg||
nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||
nt|ady: Fantoni needs to duck diamond|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff's 1@d opening quite interesting, probably he has different ideas when both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: in Swedenen we bid 4NT direct = only 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it|pg||
nt|bobholl: may make now indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: luckily didnt of course :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bobby Levin, has always been known as "bobby" |pg||
nt|bernix: in OR you mean|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: found a good line to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 10 of @H's dropped |pg||
pc|s7|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems speedy gonzales at the field, gl Russell|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: nice short auction :)|pg||
nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@c pre-sacrifice, might want them to put into a doubt they miss 4@s or not|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly lucky result NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fine result in my book|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we focus on the field, all around sharks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to be honest, 1@h seems a good idea to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 3rd seat, passed partner, both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: as so often no Strong Jump Shifts any more|pg||
nt|boyklas: 2Spades is invitational with 6 spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to convince declarer|pg||
nt|haans: Fantoni played late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks boye for @d pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, just too quick for me there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Tried to catch up on the last few tricks, but I'll get the result in when they finish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +620 |pg||
nt|yusufb: zonsuz olmasý teselli|pg||
nt|atalok: 3 tur cl sonra kor oynasa 6 el alacaktý|pg||

nt|kastan88: meanwhile USA is 2 up in Match A and B|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good discards|pg||
nt|gmarco24: as i said, 2@d would be @d/@s 4+4+|pg||
nt|tez: if duck first @s..|pg||
nt|haans: then thats out|pg||
nt|bobholl: if N has the long @C the chance for Kx is better |pg||
nt|haans: did all see how quite we were|pg||
nt|stc: ruff a @c, let j@h run|pg||
nt|bobholl: decision time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a spade would have been good for EW|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course helgemo/helness didnt play in Pau so Norway didnt do well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/brogelandcollage.htm   many photos there|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D6 exit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not for me with bad @H|pg||

nt|april7: except if N doesn't X but bids 1 @S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oliverc: yes, wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the other room,  no way she can win the bd |pg||
nt|westjava: wow, USA fly too high at other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as east no splinter was available|pg||
nt|mamos: needs to get Clubs right to keep it to one down  --  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i guess @cA+ruff ---which @dtop + ruff also same given layout|pg||

pc|hA|nt|sybarra: meant no way she can lose the bd |pg||

nt|stc: BIGGER OOPS|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: played with espen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the idea there|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: when Zoric played small on @CQ, Roussev could have maked it|pg||
nt|haans: cards form 5@H|pg||
nt|haans: understand that but how to bid with spades?|pg||
nt|stc: IMO the hand is too good for 3@c|pg||
nt|stc: not really, If the A@c is missing, there is no danger of discards on the K@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  at the other table, Stefanov (North) played a @s at trick 3 himself, killng the entry to the table|pg||

nt|atalok: bence epey az |pg||
nt|vahaboglu: biz Türkler uygun deðil bile desek yeridir|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4@c yada 4@h dicek|pg||
nt|arigun: iyi aksamlar kolay gelsin|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||

nt|yvesj49: maybe.....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: b|pg||
nt|haans: 0GUCCI: 4h for EW  ME: right without clubs ruff|pg||
nt|stc: too good because of 8 @cs and the extra K |pg||
nt|stc: If W X now, there is an ethic problem...|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW look like they are playing xfrs over the opps t/o DBL, so 2@D is a normal raise to 2@H.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't be here, instant matchpoints in USA, also wld b busy as a player and appeal committee, gl everybody|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must find @SQ|pg||
nt|wstuart: 2@H would have been a subminimum blocking bid.|pg||
nt|funtay: slm CEngiz|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean direct wjo|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 cards fir 4@D??:)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H is transfer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they bid and play very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia: "hopefully not too much"|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K OR J lead puts 6@S 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have,  but only has Ax in spades,  last thing he wants to hear is  4 @S |pg||
nt|h_karluk: which Nunes did not follow the same route like Eric|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around, congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pedjabre: 1@s from N would be @s+@c |pg||
nt|yusufb: iyii akþamlar cengiz|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: if so that wont work|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|haans: but tempting|pg||
nt|ady: might stop out of game|pg||
nt|westjava: *for|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in practice very hard to find @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, last board now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: restart in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "She has a better takeout double than you :)"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and my homework wld b done, wow|pg||
nt|mamos: hard to show the North hand any other way|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer double instead of 3@h if it's not played as penality, the suit is just too weak for 3@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C presumably a fit-non-jump, as South is a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|riccho:  this scoring is named "board a match"|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  97 EUR 77 ****   after this round|pg||

nt|h_karluk: very nice organization|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||
nt|westjava: 4@D, natural and @S support, do you play this, Shirley?|pg||
nt|haans: Have a good time Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks sir:)|pg||
nt|ady: not a great 3NT    but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C did say no game for me|pg||
nt|ady: gl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: many skilled operators and top players were there|pg||
nt|bernix: does not work out particularly well on the actual setup. 4@sx is a good save |pg||
nt|wstuart: looks like this should make exactly - east can't both pick up trumps and ruff out his @Ds.  However, if N-S aren't careful a minor suit squeeze could develop against south.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: diet coke with gree lime time, brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *green lime|pg||
nt|jacksond: its a long story hamdi but of course Boye is World champion and it was unfortunate that for whatever reason Norway didnt field their strongest team in the last ewuroean ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: Championships|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: a short suit game try at the 2 level. I never saw that before|pg||

nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com |pg||
nt|edmunte1: best lead|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3NT had no play at all|pg||
nt|stc: NS preempted them selfs out, hoping ops are in a bad spot|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: hmm.. didnt think it would die at the 2 level|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||
nt|oliverc: Even 3@S may be too highNunes may go one more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i agree with all bids there except finall pass by Jill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a bridge book double, opener hand but 2 cards clubs, 3 wld be a bridge book double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are indebted to Roland Wald for such great provide|pg||
nt|anton72: brave DBL :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT could have been down if you have 6@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|westjava: I play precision|pg||
nt|ady: Europe home in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H2 being considered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @c hook there|pg||
nt|haans: only three spades do no agree with 3@S|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt minors 5/5..ozden says i have 10 card in minors..not important|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: Mackwell boys have played BAM before Sure they know |pg||
nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's makeable|pg||

nt|isp: -6|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh Lisa there|pg||
nt|ady: only needed to share the hand|pg||

nt|h_karluk: gtg, bye guys, god bless|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: bye!|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´ve read that in USA they played this in the 60s a lot. They stopped it, because the winner of the events were always the same!|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play|pg||
nt|haans: tricky|pg||
nt|haans: 8 tricks |pg||
nt|bernix: as cards lie he cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|anton72: i guess new 7 imps coming for South Zone |pg||
nt|anton72: how I know players from other room ...they will play 4 @s with DBL|pg||
nt|anton72: let see|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: well done got to the right spot|pg||

nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
nt|bernix: after trump lead west will  make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: rare to find a save on just 5-3|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: örneðin doðu-batý konuþmasalardý (öyle elleri olsaydý), bu zon bulunamayacaktý|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board is finished I will load up 1 again and enter some of the play |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @c Q hook marked|pg||
nt|haans: but does not know that|pg||
nt|bernix: best is @d6. declarer has to make a crucial discard|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
nt|stc: @h now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bernix: what's the point in ruffing a @d? i dont see it|pg||
nt|haans: decl hate to have to guess|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook obv|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: güneyde tekrar konuþacak el yok|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 1N, 2@d dislike|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still worth only 1IMP|pg||
nt|bernix: but is in the confortable position that he cannot misguess|pg||
nt|haans: Objection: lalislol: @D6 tells decl where all the cards are|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: but could he he did not have cards to slam|pg||
nt|mamos: she|pg||
nt|haans: Well done all day Ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H made now|pg||
nt|haans: Most point out that @CT was what made this deal|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
nt|kastan88: B-A-M sounds as former known Soviet trans-Siberian BAM (Baical-Amur magistral)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be that is reason to stop BAm counting|pg||
nt|riccho:  Bd 5 is a next-to-sure winner for europe (my prediction ary lousy... :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead stops 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The europeans seem to have a stanglehold on this match  needing just half from the last two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: and the good 3@S will bring them at least a 1/2|pg||
nt|bobholl: ouder als mijn dochter (1975)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board, thanks all. We restart in 25 mins.|pg||
nt|bobholl: thanks ant your perfonce was as usual very good |pg||

nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: sadece kompetisyon yapmak için 3@h dedi|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|kerasidis: here in greece we say best is betters enemy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: 1NT here shows a 5 card minor and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|andy_h: Polish NT aka Raptor NT, depending which part of the world you're from|pg||
nt|tomi2: since 1@C could be on no clubs at all or on two samm in case they are bal., Piekares minor maybe clubs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|tomi2: I would have passed with Piekareks hand I must say :) that shows my hand perfectly I think :)|pg||

nt|andy_h: Lucky escape for Piekarek|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I think the double of 2@C should be TO and Kalita should have passed planing to enter later|pg||

nt|andy_h: auction with clubs headed by the Jack|pg||
nt|tomi2: Piekareks agressive bidding made EW overbid in a competitive situation for the 2nd time now. I think if he passed, E would have been able to show a very weak hand with spades ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: (starting with 1@D)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andy_h: It depends if E/W can differentiate between @SQxxxxx and out or @SQJ109xx and out. Since with the latter, 4@S is a reasonable game|pg||

nt|wstuart: Though they have a 4-4 @S fit, many north's will not bid Stayman with 4333 pattern.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: play is not that easy|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this is that kind of board when you don't have to lead your partner's suit :)|pg||
nt|haans: save may cost to much|pg||
nt|haans: best to have East  as leader|pg||
nt|bobholl: diminished @H Q|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North? |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oliverc: small @D now and it's easy|pg||
nt|ady: thin game    but hackets are aggressive|pg||

nt|mamos: 4 losers?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 2NT maybe positive with @C? (or any bal positive)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I think the latter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: One missed board entered|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst going for the money due to vulnerability|pg||

nt|haans: pass or xx as support|pg||
nt|danilo1: but I would jump to 4@S with 5 ... especially after 2@H Dble|pg||
nt|bobholl: i didn't mean this way but works equally well|pg||
nt|stc: 2Nt for minors ?|pg||
nt|anton72: new ...200 or 300 coming|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: fasten your seat belt pls!|pg||
nt|haans: Who can understand Radisics bidding?|pg||
nt|stc: no, 3@c for @cs|pg||

nt|stc: trumps 3-2, @c friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably 4@S was "fast-arrival"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: poor game   needs to avoid anymajor suit losers and bring in the 4th diamond to discard a spade|pg||
nt|mamos: right i see yep sorry   lots of work to do|pg||
nt|ady: OR  got no higher   should be all square|pg||
nt|jbgood: can even affort 2 club losers and still win the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: perhaps jill should have raised hearts as north with her good shape|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2nt 16-18 here|pg||
nt|april7: a very light opener,but only a NT game |pg||
nt|bobholl: bit weak for a reverse but what else|pg||
nt|boyklas: me too, i havent got any other good option, and the 2D is too little for this hand|pg||

nt|stc: note tha 3NT have some chances on a @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: blackwood for @C here, I think|pg||
nt|blewah: so Auken probably "cheated" to her p|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it's a Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have taken the plunge|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers's bidding shows 5 hearts, but not a good suit. Levin showed 4@Ss|pg||

nt|haans: trumf queen again|pg||
pc|hT|nt|edmunte1: i agree with 2@h, lots of controls and most of points in suits|pg||

nt|haans: you know that one opps did say I like the lead of ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: however, looks like great guess by brothers ... 4@S is probably -1 (to -2)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the silly ?! double migth let 4 make|pg||
nt|anton72: A here made contract|pg||
nt|anton72: = 13 imps back for CONTRA|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: Very well done by NS|pg||
nt|haans: spade 9 in right place|pg||
nt|edmunte1: or no :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that would depend on what 3@D meant - whether it was GF or a high-card raise to 3@s. |pg||

nt|westjava: she saved by 3@D:)|pg||

mb|1S|nt|oliverc: 3NT looks pretty inevitable here|pg||
nt|mamos: JJ play 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2nt=20-21|pg||
nt|stc: a simple 4, a tricky 6 :)|pg||
nt|anton72: 1-st they agressive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the cards seem to be running in a NS direction this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Rockwell compare score against Helgemo-Helness|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c > 16+|pg||
nt|oliverc: might see a result here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but th problem would they land there|pg||
nt|westjava: yup,good spot in 3nt|pg||
nt|mcphee: e/w may well play 4@S|pg||
nt|blewah: not so eventful slam|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 4@S for NS|pg||
nt|anton72: 2-nd they lost 1100 in previous boards|pg||
nt|wstuart: 4@s might even make.|pg||
nt|funtay: Cerkezköy 5 board sonunda 8-0 önde|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|h_karluk: Meyers see quick tricks at her hand, anyways what about clubs and hearts |pg||
nt|danilo1: 3NT by West is on|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6 @D very !! nice contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: not sure Bobby overcalled with 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless aliens changed that nice guy|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, alerted but no explanation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Russell|pg||
nt|oliverc: there are defences to precision that would overcall 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|westjava: and NS will save by 5@D?:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: meyers wastes not time reaching 3N:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there's a passed partner|pg||
nt|mcphee: i bet against save|pg||
nt|haans: many use support x only with extra|pg||
nt|haans: and again|pg||
nt|haans: raise?|pg||
nt|haans: good chice|pg||
nt|boyklas: sorry have to go, ty all see you at the next match|pg||
nt|danilo1: even by East|pg||
nt|stc: you need "only" two cards on side|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|oliverc: no reason for Berkowitz to do anything other than bid it|pg||
nt|oliverc: 1NT probably round or sharp given the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expected a double |pg||
nt|mcphee: thot levin might dble but he chose 4N minor suit t/o|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Giorgio smelt the danger|pg||
nt|blewah: EW play 4card M|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkk|pg||
nt|bobholl: i wouldn't bid 2 nt as west but some number of @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: reasonable 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: yep 9 easy tricks|pg||
nt|anton72: 25 %|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: BAM rare in Europe played in Reisinger in USA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Oliver but in USA ( as i live there ) Precision Defense Systems only manufactures. Standard machine guns :))))|pg||
nt|jbgood: 1@s denying 4 spades|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|bobholl: 25% is better than a "roland" slam|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: she know noe 4 card support ...and will continued i think over 4|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit less than 25|pg||
nt|stc: I agree, after -1100 in a short match the should risk|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a partial in no-trump|pg||
nt|edmunte1: it was a maker on any lead, so just a small loss for Romania|pg||
nt|haans: books have been written about leading from Jacks|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think NS have to play a trump before the @DA is knocked out now to beat it.  Then, they can put south in with a @C to lead a 2nd trump before decl can ruff 2@Ds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: defence seem likely to cash six tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: Zia might do best to pass this   but trf looks normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Bob would double if he had one club short and one spade more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile let's not forget Zia fans ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O37j3G2SwgU   :)|pg||
nt|haans: preemtive raise cost this time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 4th, 2nd from bad. Right side up on trick 1, then upside down after|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about the 1@C - shows 4 unless 17/18 4333|pg||
nt|mcphee: or natural:)|pg||
nt|haans: have not bid 2@C on that for many many years|pg||
nt|danilo1: West want to wait the lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @D lead ?|pg||
nt|anton72: some missunderstanding here|pg||
nt|anton72: points is not importanr for this pair :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|stc: But, as we know nobody plays minors anymore :(|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: this would give him a better chance to play 2@h or 2@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: You will almost never see players at this level look for a  Major fit with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|haans: west hand 1 trick in 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure Levin's decision|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: not clear at all how o play this|pg||
nt|haans: bidding = but we may be lucky|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: Nicer in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helness laughs :)|pg||
nt|ady: flat 17   nice tops   but needs good clubs to have a decent play|pg||
nt|haans: slam a hearts finesse away|pg||
nt|haans: yep 1 spade trick then|pg||
nt|danilo1: on @D lead, tempo for @S trick(s)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they expect a @H lead so :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but not now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't but isn't his partner limitred to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: limited|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp back or no....doesent matter ...20-10 for BMP|pg||
nt|anton72: is he is|pg||
nt|anton72: I just make some guessings|pg||
nt|anton72: what to play ...they decide at table|pg||
nt|twcho: rehi|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S lead being in 4@H won't make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely even Roland would not want to be in a slam here|pg||
nt|motu: nasty @S break|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: against three NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: unless this brogeland is a son of Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice double|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, forcing and 4 cards support|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The slam score was wrong- +1 is correct, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressed that n/s got to game,  slow start |pg||
nt|anton72: new DBL for 1 down :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look at the breaks - spades 3-3, clubs 3-3 with the king onside|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seeing all 13, he would|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sure I would, it's a terrible slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I just said that in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: neede a @S switch|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think it's cold now if decl gets the trumps right|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @D, @H, 2 @C and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: major suit switch will leave declarer short   and that is certain to come|pg||
nt|mamos: or more if this @DK wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose this 4N was to play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's|pg||
nt|westjava: switch to @C now|pg||
nt|westjava: or never:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she would enjoy to @c switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just low towards hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think this may be a long think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: musing|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C switch would not be welcome at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin as gone for a comfort break, a kibitzer sits in|pg||
nt|jbgood: good communication E-W to win another board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: significant double|pg||
nt|rado: E might have 1-2 hcp only, so declarer  has a chanse|pg||
nt|haans: lot of thinking :)|pg||
nt|anton72: some spectacors said poss -2 ...yes that is correct ...but with current lead|pg||
nt|anton72: let see the lead ...not easy realy|pg||

nt|edmunte1: 2@d=GF relay|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@d no 4 majors|pg||
nt|haans: Good advice: Tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: Turkey did bid the Grand on board 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: loss not great :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: say 1N received than 1N (16-18) after reasonable range in competition and not against the odds |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|westjava: means thar score now is 3-1, Ant?|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no, score is now entered, 2.5-4.5 is correct|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll re-enter the play before the next board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just a simple matter of probabilities|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led after ace of @H N must set up the @C suit to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: why ? A@d, @h finess, discard 2@s on @ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they bid and make it against you - it's not your day |pg||
nt|funtay: 7nolu elde öbür oda 3ntye gelip 1 batinca 6 verdik|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: yes we have all seen better opening bids|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west also contributed well, cool x |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h invitational, 5@h... hmmm, that's not it  :)|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mamos: her first thoughts were best :)|pg||
nt|westjava: bingo!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now : 7 @d in bag, 2@c also|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good news is Sementa has a second @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so th tenth either spades or hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no transportation problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have 4 tricks Hamdi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's try this one|pg||
nt|skaftij:  of course you spotted the slam Roland |pg||
pc|h4|nt|edmunte1: 4@h still a bridge too far|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: natural lead i think 1 p for each pair|pg||
nt|xenya: @H finesse is not safe in 4|pg||
nt|anton72: think here is not a bridge school|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: in 4 yes ...but if u play 6 ?.....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzrj: Levin: "what's 1@S-3@D" - answer: "inv"|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in hearts for 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Nunes scratching his head now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: certainly in thought :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: clearly he was hoping his @S were running|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: so South did well to win the first @S|pg||
nt|haans: artificial systems is like marriage  you must stay with you long time partner|pg||
nt|petepunt: still has to time play well|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos: my Gran would have approved of that lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *edit: then|pg||
nt|westjava: lovely @H4|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, @H lead best for defense (saves overtrick)|pg||
nt|anton72: think he have to play trumps imideatly after lead ...but he afraid from 4-2 break|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bu sekansta Kuzeyde iyi el olmalý 15+HCP|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: also Bob Hamman fans, i have the chance to watch their play here in USA,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeIw1XMZfeU   :)|pg||

nt|reisig: Hiya :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Bob, they will get their winners to set it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 bridges :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h=relay, 2@s=5@c, 3@c fit and RKC, 3NT=2+Q@c and probably spiral scan after it|pg||
nt|haans: spiral scan is Bid suit you do not have control in|pg||
nt|wstuart: yes|pg||
nt|funtay: Nafiz abi @sye transfer edip 3nt demiþ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|westjava: and contract is 4nt:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we all see|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin is back, and North/South send out a kibitzer for some diet cokes|pg||
nt|haans: will end with @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: two ways, either ruffing finesse in @D or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: yep can try clubs first|pg||
nt|stc: a match of missed oportunities|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit: 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: before winning @SA Meyers checked 1@S showed 5|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not really, there are different ways|pg||
nt|anton72: How many teams we have operator ?.......|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 2NT dese belki kabul etmezmiþ diðeri|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwi_joker: my Gran is only in 2NT on the EW cards tho :)|pg||
nt|mamos: defence does best to get ruff now because otherwise declarer can cash two clubs discarding Hearts|pg||
nt|haans: yes often scan by steps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|blewah: push board|pg||
nt|xenya: we were talking about 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  We have seen worse than that :-)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: spade needed|pg||
nt|haans: bright defense needed|pg||
nt|mamos: South would have made this hand much easier if she had allowed @DK to win|pg||
nt|haans: kib: NicJans: do you like this result of the bidding Me dont know yet 50% slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: friendly lead, +1 now|pg||
nt|anton72: with this result i think we will look Quantum 3 more rounds here until knockouts|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|milton_se: isn't it a bit remarkable that East's hand isn't enough against an opener?|pg||
nt|anton72: ok|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: :) i guess this is the same guy used "Pomo" nick, great|pg||
nt|oliverc: he can run but he can't hide :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's very true sir:) you nicely pointed out|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: cashing the @HA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C is best defence |pg||
pc|hT|nt|wstuart: ooops|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: a heart to hand - ruff|pg||
nt|petepunt: key play now|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: common IMP play never to stop at 2nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  some 6% or so ?|pg||
nt|atalok: 16 var hakan kabul ederdi bencede 3 nt normal alt tarafý cl kýzýnýn yerini degiþririverin|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: still can get Heart ruff for -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @h 9|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: will let south know|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if you went wrong you'll usually lose only 6 IMP's (vs 2nt=). If you're right you'll win 10 IMP's (vs 2nt+1)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: too late now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|reisig: Sontag has been a GREAT player for many years|pg||
nt|oliverc: absolutely|pg||
nt|bernix: a witty german once wrote "the worst of all evils is the lead of jack 4th" which gives a nice rhyme in German|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: easy defense|pg||
nt|anton72: about 55 I guess...may be 60|pg||
nt|twcho: isn't it a bit strange to finesse a @c before the trump?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and then a @d towards table - ruff|pg||
nt|ady: heart then and it would have made if Justin plays the 6|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: west has 2@C|pg||
nt|rado: and if no Q@C would have open 2@S:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: and a spade or another @h?|pg||
nt|oliverc: still going to lose a @S and 2 @C whatever he does|pg||
nt|edmunte1: so you just need to be right in 37.5 % of cases to go even|pg||
nt|tez: i have been played for 1 year artificial system..when i was bad card player|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi I am John Buchheister from the U|pg||
pc|c2|nt|oliverc: needs to ruff this|pg||
nt|oliverc: high|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or slip in defense|pg||

nt|gmarco24: 42 imps for turkey last 4 boards|pg||
nt|gmarco24: Turkey, sorry|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: seems Sabine musing|pg||

nt|petepunt: poss thought N would have switched to @SJ with actual hand :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: so off two was inevitable|pg||

nt|sybarra: and I was only using precision as a generic description of the 2 @C bid|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: yalnýz 1@c açýþlarý özelse ayrý|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: someone gets a text message loudly in the room - everyone looks|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@s normal spot|pg||
nt|haans: no game for NS|pg||
nt|danilo1: may be interesting board ... if West wait (he should) ... and if 2@D is Forcing|pg||
nt|bucheister: wow; what a 2S bid bul vs nv after a 2C opening|pg||
nt|bucheister: Vul|pg||

mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
nt|jacksond: looks impossible for declarer to get out for one down which would be a half|pg||
nt|blewah: closer to ultra canape, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no we do not know|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, no discussions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, no worries|pg||
nt|april7: without @S stop I'd rather bid 2 @H than 1 NT|pg||
nt|haans: 1@Sx no game if make|pg||
nt|haans: kibs say 4@H 4@H|pg||
nt|bernix: 4@h loses 3 aces and ?|pg||

nt|desinka: oia|pg||
nt|desinka: sorry|pg||

mb|3N|nt|haans: but can 2@D be forcing|pg||
nt|atalok: iyi yerde durdular  cl Q oynarsa fazla yapar dogrusuda Q oynamasý zaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The USA players all suffering different degrees of jet lag|pg||
nt|edmunte1: kalin will upgrade due to 10 card fit|pg||
nt|haans: 1ntx no game if make|pg||
nt|haans: novel bid :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2@C is game force , 2@D msut be a puppet to 2@S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|blewah: prec obligates 5 card M|pg||
nt|westjava: back to the Italy at '70 era, arya?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 11 tricks in hearts    but might settle for 10?|pg||
nt|westjava: helpfuly|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting hand to play |pg||
nt|blewah: maybe. i was not borned yet :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Roman and Neapolitan, a wonderful nostalgic...|pg||
nt|haans: i rather pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|april7: to high already on !G leads!!!|pg||
nt|april7: @H leads|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 7 tricks the limit here for NS|pg||
nt|haans: urkk|pg||
nt|haans: may i enter a novel bid: Pass|pg||
nt|haans: in 2/1 time a bid that aint forcing?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This could be interesting for a small deal|pg||
nt|motu: 3n is makeable i guess, but you have to be a good guesser|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: ask me , my jet lag lasted a month|pg||
nt|haans: well vul game|pg||
nt|bernix: and i cant see east leading anything else|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play |pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: this could be a breakpoint, in case @dJ lead|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claim was for -1, at the point when I claimed. Weird.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: seemed impossible from here too|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 58  EUR 50**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I could well have misheard|pg||
nt|jacksond: unlucky in 3nt in other room. Must have guessed spades wrong on lead|pg||
nt|westjava: play @DK and cash @c..?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably he will make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: bloody|pg||
nt|danilo1: some does it :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d shows 5+@d 4 card @s..to play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
nt|haans: Good make me get for @HT|pg||
nt|bernix: failure due to lack of aces|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
nt|haans: clubs finesse win or lose the board :)|pg||
nt|ady: lot of trumps coming now|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|gmarco24: i wonder what that 6@c was?|pg||
nt|tez: how many slam in this set?|pg||
nt|gmarco24: :)|pg||
nt|haans: i think i know :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: "i have clubs"?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@S is poor but could make on an obscure x-ruff.  4@S is normal here|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, I'd very much prefer  to be in 4 looking only at the NS cards.  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||

nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i will get us some CCs|pg||
nt|motu: thx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok declarer claims|pg||
nt|gmarco24: oh, well, seems like this table likes new suit on 6-th and 7-th level|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: best choice|pg||
nt|bobholl: Thank you all (hans ans danilo and operator) got to go |pg||
nt|skaftij:  If decl manages to enjoy 13th @d somehow|pg||
nt|bucheister: That bid might win the match|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: win some lose some|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos: whatever we think a  top score :)|pg||
nt|april7: E knows his job alright:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: run @s8?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: Jet lag is the curse of modern jet travel, but it doesn´t have to spoil your trip.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h switch obvious from East|pg||
pc|h7|nt|reisig: Knowing Sonty -- he'll say "I give you AK  AK and you go down??"|pg||
nt|haans: nice having u Bob|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: thanks Hugh  Walter Kelsey, especially for "Killing Defence at Bridge" rest in peace, amen. i am the lucky guy bought  it in 1966 printed by Faber and Faber Limited|pg||
nt|h_karluk: footnote : it was hard enough to understand for a 12 years old kid, but today i got the great value |pg||
nt|oliverc: I have to go. thanks everyone.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeya buddy|pg||
nt|stc: A@h and @h will do|pg||
nt|westjava: she choose @S first|pg||
nt|sybarra: going for @s...probably doesnt matter |pg||
nt|blewah: 10 tricks and win the board|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: most are still playing IMP im sure|pg||
nt|haans: in their mind|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|oliverc: LOL. Fantoni had to start with 3 @s's to beat this|pg||
nt|westjava: yes, cash AH@C|pg||
nt|haans: question is Had 2NT from South been lavinthal so 3@C did show a strong hand?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i open those hands 1N|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|westjava: 5332,right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the bidding is easier when you open 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me simple 1@h, melih ozdil of new york also likes to begin with 1N since long years|pg||
nt|westjava: AK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: BAM in Super MP take your tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about carding - "standard"|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Decl might have tried to muddy things by ducking a @h, who knows, maybe defense clears @s|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: this is ahand that shows this scoring methods difficulties  playing imps we would have bid Board 24 by now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: catchy board|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Saelensminde asks about signals in the trump suit - answer SP|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seen before|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: Koksoy not happy :)|pg||
nt|tez: Bye Bob|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mcphee: even 5-4-2-2 with certain provisions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe it|pg||
nt|scotty: I don't believe the TD should step in and announce one team can't win - any more than we do in the Spingold or Bermuda Bowl and a team is down 25 with one board to go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean @c9 got a trick 1st round|pg||
nt|jbgood: nice play! |pg||
nt|danilo1: in OR, Israel missdefended 4@S (also played by South) ...so first 10 IMPS for Romania|pg||

nt|h_karluk: the penultimate board there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still total 12 boards there Ant?|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|jan_go:  4@H down 1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: a declarer missplay on board 5 provided Romania 10 more IMP's|pg||
nt|wstuart: they will likely have an uncontested auction as well.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ady: I think last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in weak NT maybe 5 cards junk major suit|pg||
nt|blewah: 1 point for that board was not fair she shuld be rewarded for her play too|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember 1 @H could be 4 card|pg||
nt|edmunte1: offshape 1nt by Probst|pg||
nt|haans: Many get violent if you open 1nt with 2-5-4-2 but have my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: handle with care , use it in your own risk|pg||
nt|westjava: 1 point + clap clap|pg||
nt|edmunte1: too many con's imho|pg||
nt|edmunte1: offshape and maximum|pg||
nt|wstuart: wow, I don't see much opint in bidding with the west hand at equal vulnerability.|pg||
nt|petepunt: good to come in with some shape over a strong @C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|westjava: sure|pg||
nt|rado: quiet 3NT here:)|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C 1@S 2NT and then pass or 3NT, which I doubt|pg||
nt|wstuart: *point|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: When I lead the K the J always pops down in the dummy also:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks then we have 3 more including this one|pg||
nt|jacksond: started on bd 15 so 3 more|pg||
nt|blewah: 2nT 12-13 bal|pg||
nt|haans: unusual rare pass by North|pg||
nt|april7: to strong for 1NT, E's hand!!|pg||
nt|tez: no slam here?|pg||
nt|haans: prefer 5@C to 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big opportunity for QUANTUM here. 4@S is close to making and 4@H should have been beat|pg||
nt|bucheister: 800 is correct |pg||
nt|wstuart: but with that little playing strength, there isn't a lot going for you at equal vul.|pg||
nt|petepunt: takes away a few relay bids|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: inverted herhalde|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jan_jansma: 3NT never quiet at BAM :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Levin think about 5@C...|pg||
nt|haans: well if you see it as 18 point taken|pg||
nt|haans: not even gards for game|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@D-2@C-P-P- ... and Fight starst with Dble|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Do they change pair to compare with?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mamos: No Haans I thin they compare throughout with same opponent|pg||
nt|bernix: rare but not unusual. rather normal|pg||
nt|haans: to pass nowdays is not normal :)|pg||
nt|bernix: he cant refrain from balancing now|pg||
nt|april7: but there are limits!!!|pg||
nt|bernix: i tell you i would have passed whenever it was my turn|pg||
nt|haans: fighting for nothing|pg||
nt|bernix: will go down in 2@h instead of collecting +50 in 1nt|pg||
nt|april7: 1 or 2 down in 2@H, depends on declarer- or defence play|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+!@H+2@D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: easy to set this|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C normal 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
nt|westjava: aha:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS play upside-down count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a trick taking game and i am not volunteer to fool my partner at any phase of the game|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: or 3nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't make 4@H on best defence|pg||
nt|skaftij:  no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 12 boards a session|pg||
nt|haans: 10 board should be 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead, club switch|pg||
nt|isp: but 4@s?|pg||
nt|wstuart: The strength of @C systems is mostly when they don't open 1@C.  Many people get afraid when the opps open a strong @C, thinking they will automatically get some terrible result if ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: they don't interfere.|pg||
nt|petepunt: overcall brushed aside :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: That's really not true.  It's most important to just accurately describe your offensive potential to your pard so when you can successfully compete, you know it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: declarer's hand is a little lacking ................:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 2@h and x as passed hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Broge has a problem - will he go for the @d game (or slam)? or NT?|pg||
nt|jacksond: disadvange of the splinter is that it allowed north to indicate a lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes right :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFET CUP - USA  64  EUR  56  ****|pg||

nt|vahaboglu: Nezih de onu düþünüyor|pg||

nt|reisig: I live in the same area|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know|pg||
nt|jbgood: the former - it is only 420 against the overtrick for 430 in NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1nt  3nt MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEART LEAD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the good old days Texas Aces were using a similar bid, Goldman's 3@h/3@s after NT described a mild slam interest in @c/@d, but with different shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not to mention the bigger score for the @d slam bid and made in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 35 minutes, is Romania 1 vs Greece|pg||

nt|haans: If decl have @SJ he still have it|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... and finaly time for 1 bid by South (probaly Dble)|pg||
nt|haans: yes must show he is alive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: close but you need to ruff 2 cards in the West hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: bid loss for Croatia|pg||
nt|bernix: i doubt whether they have finished round 2 by then|pg||
nt|haans: presume a 1@H  had not shown good hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and trumps are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: a heart and a diamond because @D10 does not drop|pg||
nt|funtay: tahminin salvonun dbli inverted dbl yani dbl=2*3 kart @d pass=1-4 kart@d|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|h_karluk: major suit guesses there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: missing queens, one should decide abt lesser evil|pg||
nt|mcphee: he will gain a discard on the J@C but it is not so helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Geoff shoot the moon|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be the deciding trick :)|pg||

nt|edmunte1: but again luck goes with the braves|pg||
nt|yusufb: patlatmýþ 3nt yi 1sn de|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jacksond: Yes in the long run it is useful to be able to show a minor suited hand and a short major suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I feel a bit sorry for EW. My team had a set like this last week - it is very hard to sit there and defend hand after hand. |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|reisig: Balancing is dangerous (although tempting) when Vul w 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: smile always smile, even it's bitter or sad, never reveal the color, just poker face cool :)|pg||
nt|stc: -1 and board for Europe ?|pg||
nt|haans: Do we have a running score?|pg||
nt|motu: with a different lead you might catch W in @C@D sqz|pg||
nt|hedyg: official event site for all info: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Izmir.htm|pg||
nt|motu: but that would be double dummy i guess|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: obviously|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mamos: this looked more like an imps auction than Bam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : previous deal @d J was the only card to set it more|pg||
nt|mamos: no game making|pg||
nt|mcphee: guess  1 worked great:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet he watched Meyers playing tempo|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: the low @H was smooth|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just the overtrick i presume|pg||
nt|haans: may stop at 2nt at OR|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: -2?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, you are right - if he finds a spade now|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|h_karluk: deception ended|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell's underlead of @H suggested he wanted Meckstroth to start Spades from North|pg||
nt|ady: aI would bet on 11|pg||
nt|mamos: using the Club entry first might be safer|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  72  EUR  60  ****|pg||

nt|bucheister: your are correct at 1100 with the uppercut at the end; thanks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: for an ordsinary player to commentate on the World greats is a privilege   sometimes  daunting  -- scared to make oneself look foolish  but its fantastic to see the care of players ...|pg||

nt|ady: sing club bad for west|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Steve paid pack the favor to Sabine:)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: that indicates @sK on the way|pg||
nt|westjava: guess  2 now|pg||
nt|wstuart: Had they not lead a @D, he would have made 7 by pitching a @C on one of the @Hs and then setting up the 4th @C in dummy for the 2nd @D pitch.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFETT CUP - USA  72  EUR  60  ****|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mamos: her Heart discard was a mistake i think|pg||
nt|mamos: ten the max now|pg||

nt|haans: defense did right|pg||
nt|haans: dont think the xx of 2@C did mean anything|pg||

nt|mamos: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mamos: -1?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 60  EUR 48**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||

nt|haans: reopne have my vote|pg||
nt|haans: 3 boards 30 min they will make it|pg||
nt|edmunte1: in the meantime, Greece bid and made slam on board 6|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: not easy to avoid game|pg||

nt|mcphee: this one can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken asks what dbl of 2@D is|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I didn't hear the answer - the other finished tables are walking through|pg||
nt|blewah: for blood, i think|pg||
nt|westjava: 5 hcp and over call, South hand!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's better to support to 2@H when you have a hand with just one bid|pg||
nt|jan_go:  1@S is?|pg||
nt|motu: dont ask me|pg||
nt|motu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: meyers will need to guess well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Sementa-Duboin would like to play there|pg||
nt|jacksond: maybe JILL should have waited to double 2c|pg||
nt|haans: but @HK of value|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Any views?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@h bid helped in the other room - no assurance of heart support here|pg||
nt|atalok: oyunu kolay deklerasyonu zor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: demek zor|pg||

nt|april7: 3NT but not more|pg||
nt|april7: don't lead @H!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 3+|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play Swiss acol, i.e. 5 card @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bernix: he wont, east opened 1@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has only chances in S|pg||
nt|wstuart: double dummy I think you can make 4@H, and maybe even would after the DBL steers you in the right direction,.|pg||
nt|atalok: biz oynasaydýk ne derdiniz kontura?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: unless +2 Europe lost|pg||
nt|stc: I am informed that 2@h/3@d are art and showing points and shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: modified precision, i bet at least 50 pages|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W showing 5/4+ in minors with short S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2254 another story|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North now also on limit ... has some additions to 8 Hcp |pg||

nt|atalok: bbunlar kuvvetli cl oynuyorlar o ayrý|pg||
nt|isp: @c|pg||
pc|c5|nt|westjava: yup, give 2@S and double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|tez: back..i m here now|pg||
nt|haans: Obbs tend to bid with your needed cards|pg||
nt|skaftij:  agree, support with weak hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|edmunte1: but Kx in @c is just a too big negative feature|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if we're going to fight for the part score, at least we should have some chances to make it|pg||
nt|haans: one more board Balkan has done well |pg||
nt|tez: @s's are block|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly in a 5-card major system|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 card 1@d and 1@H|pg||
nt|motu: you have some communication problems in this hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: this looks like a gamble that will not pay off|pg||
nt|oliverc: -2 is too many|pg||
nt|oliverc: but -1 might have been a good result|pg||
nt|oliverc: if 2@S was making|pg||
nt|oliverc: not sure it was, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: He might have opened 2NT (or 2@c - intending 2NT next)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 tables Hans   do you expect them all to bid game?|pg||
nt|ady: even on a non heart lead  should go down|pg||
nt|mamos: so not dead   ....yet|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   not likely any would stop short of game|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree  ady|pg||
nt|mcphee: she has not so far:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: if Saelensmin was indicating the other two suits|pg||
nt|atalok: 3 d?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: Zia supposed to know the fact : groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: HH did played Mini-Multi before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I believe in this comp all Euro pairs are playing same system|pg||
nt|bobholl: now only guess @H :)|pg||
nt|haans: unblocking|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@s derdim|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: olabilir|pg||
nt|atalok: 9 imp aldýkk|pg||
pc|s4|nt|blewah: if rdbl was good hand with no fit, dbl by Levin is penalty, but S with that shape and hcp ran, IMHO|pg||
nt|westjava: agree arya|pg||
nt|tez: if duck he is at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: and blocked :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Possibly, u may still get to spades|pg||
nt|isp: at least -2  , but... may try for more|pg||
nt|hedyg: could start with @D and finesse @H|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|stc: also informed that Meck ducked the @s allowing 6@h !! to make|pg||
nt|haans: one more clubs and home it gets|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer 2nt with Agge hand over the second double|pg||
nt|wstuart: -3 seems about right.|pg||
nt|petepunt: if he can reduce his trumps in 4@H, maybe,  but very unclear.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, definitely 4@H wouldn't be a claimer.  :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: North and East had their bids but west and S a little light:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a different bidding S would lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d-3NT for instance|pg||
nt|jan_go:  all ways should lead to at least 9 tricks cuz of the 33@H split |pg||
nt|hedyg: Gromöller trying for 3-3 @ss and A@C in N?|pg||
nt|motu: well but he will make it anyway even if he missguess @C @H 3-3 with K onside will save the day...|pg||
nt|jan_go:  with finessing @Hk|pg||

nt|tez: @s now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: u know owl see better in dark :)|pg||

nt|andy_h: I'm still a bit surprised by East's 3@S bid. Maybe he was hoping to get doubled in 4?  Partner made a game try bid with 3@D and he's looking at AQxx|pg||

nt|tomi2: maybe W expected no @S fit - then 3@D becomes not a gametry but a try to play 3@D|pg||
