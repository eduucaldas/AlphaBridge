nt|arobson:  Did North not have a way to show both majors? I think he has got himself into trouble unnecessarily here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or double again|pg||
nt|roswolf: a mere mortal like me would bid 4@D but ........|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|arobson:  He may double again, but (a) will S bid 3 or 4@S and (b) if he bids 3@S will North raise?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: so South could pass to request 4@H, and then 4@D could be used as a cue-bid |pg||
nt|garnetts: North  will duck the K@D lead and make 4@H  --if he doesn't west will get in and lead a fatal spade --and it is the only lead that give the defence a chnace  |pg||

nt|roswolf: i just think its nonense to bid on here with good defence AND NOshape|pg||
nt|othered1: But they better get that @C switch in mighty quickly|pg||
nt|roswolf: but west is still there|pg||
nt|jtr: So, i think double just said i want to bid 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Crouch confirming his x is for take-out and expected to be taken out|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: ie bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.camrosebridge.com/ccards/patterson-crouch.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he had 3NT available as a better 4M opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not convinced but west might be|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: You'll need a powerful computer to download that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume they will find the defence if Bell passes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SK for count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then a club switch|pg||
nt|othered1: Why is defense clear, assuming @SK lead?  Doesn't @D look more promising on auction?|pg||
nt|roswolf: with trumps breaking the 65@H give 2 entries to lead up to the queen of diamonds if no club lead/switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch gained 11 + 9 on boards 18 and 19|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm slightly surprised west is still thinking.  East took his life in his hands and got them up a level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: still thinking|pg||

nt|viren169: West has a bit of work to do here...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mdgraham: told NS have changed the system - 1@C can be a doubleton|pg||

nt|mdgraham: jump overcalls weak.|pg||
nt|garnetts: is it a death wish ?  |pg||
nt|oliverc: I hate 2@H here, I must confess|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: eg board 1 and the 3@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kxxx and out maybe --at least that is real junk|pg||

mb|p|nt|rmb1: Hinden take the lead, as 6@C-2 on board 8 was as bad as it looked|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: why did he open 1@C ?  |pg||

mb|1D|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I agree with you Oliver if you must bid then try 1NT or ven 1@S |pg||

nt|viren169: a passive defence would have been interesting in 6@H|pg||

nt|rmb1: Will Whittaker lead his suit - it does get set up|pg||

nt|ady: this should be  1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|iain sime: The cards lie well for the defence|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@H is probably weak NT or unbal'd with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: if the defence gets this right   could be 2 or 3 hundred to e/w|pg||
nt|viren169: North probably should have bid 1@S to catch the 4-4 spade fit (if it existed)|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 1@H was weak NT and 1N would have been 4 spades|pg||
nt|iain sime: The methods have resulted in playing 1NT from the wrong side. The defence is a tempo ahead.|pg||
nt|viren169: so North knew he did not have a spade fit...|pg||
nt|viren169: or a heart fit|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should get five clubs, two diamonds and a heart for minus two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Apologies IT issue here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Neil has first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: rather none of 1st 7 tricks :)|pg||

nt|iain sime: I didn't think Willie could be spending ten minutes deciding which club to play. |pg||
nt|viren169: Okay we have the correct explanation to the bidding... I think|pg||
nt|viren169: 1N by North showed exactly 4 spades|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Position before the last stanza: Crouch 126, Rosen 125, Teltscher 124. We don't get it much closer than that|pg||
nt|roswolf: very close|pg||
nt|arobson:  Very interesting on trump lead; East must not rise C!A and WEst gets in with C!10|pg||
nt|roswolf: teltscher may be favorite now |pg||
nt|arobson:  @HKQ might tell West to lead a trump as ruffs may be the extra tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|roswolf: playind the bottom team senior - while crouch + rosen beat each other up|pg||
nt|arobson:  Declarer may lead @C9 and dump @H8|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Peter folds his cards and puts them on the table|pg||
nt|arobson:  Crouch has had a fine weekend, I am sure he will make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but he needs to win this match by at least 38 to have a chance of winning the event|pg||
nt|ewj: Well with the KQ@H on his left and @S 3-1, he's not going to go off regardless of what he does|pg||
nt|ewj: Guess he's a little worried about losing to a trump if West has 4 of them|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ewj: and he somehow suffers a trump promotion when trying to get back to hand to draw trumps after a @D ruff|pg||

mb|4D|nt|viren169: They will need to get their skates on to bid it first!|pg||
nt|garnetts: South might try a double but North has thought for too long --state of the match thing though|pg||
nt|garnetts: South is good for 3@H--prefer maybe a dbl of 2NT to suggest a good raise |pg||
nt|viren169: cant see anyone applying the red card to the 3-level|pg||

nt|viren169: E/W may well take the push to 5@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: I guess 2@C is one of "@C or balanced GF"  OR "@C GF or 3 card @S raise"|pg||

nt|viren169: Est bidding it to make!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rnmalik: true, that was the idea:)|pg||

nt|ady: Quuen and jack of spades followed bya club switch seems likely|pg||
nt|ady: Liggins woulc have played higher spade for a diamond   |pg||
nt|iain sime: If East has been paying attention to the pips, this should be no problem. The @S9 would have suggested a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|garnetts: a @D looks possible too--maybe the second spade is Suit preference or should be |pg||
nt|ady: danger is passive defence|pg||
nt|viren169: both spades are likely to be suit preference|pg||
nt|garnetts: the 8 is close to the 9--best defence is to overtake the Q@S and lead back the 2 --should be clear then |pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|jtr: Running out of fingers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: that doesnt lookh good|pg||
pc|h9|nt|arobson:  Down one at best unless West fails to cover @CJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzrt: Yes, last board - restart at 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have no knowledge.|pg||
nt|garnetts: we now come to the last board of this set |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not shocked at that --not sure there is a defence if dec guesses the heart suit accurately --and $@S look the better shot over 3@S to me |pg||
nt|iain sime: I think 2@D was ok, but follow it with 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Last of this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: 2@C|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|rmb1: Last board of the set.  Thanks to the operator Tim and fellow commentators Shirley and Oliver.  Thanks as always to Roland and BBO, and to EBU|pg||
nt|garnetts: My issue with that is that in my view the ucb is best used for hands suited to suit play |pg||
nt|ady: Rosen needs to stay out of a slam here|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: Thanks to Tim for some great operating and thanks all for putting up with me and my now ex fellow commentators |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: ty|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 52 the difference now (Crouch needs 38 to overtake Rosen), but this will likely cost Crouch 11-12|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: like the last baord not a great deal of interest --11 tricks in 4@S so thanks again |pg||
nt|Walddk4: so they are very 'close' in a way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Still 20 boards to come after this|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1. Rosen 115 - 2. Teltscher 110 - 3. Crouch 106 VP  before the last round|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|rmb1: Last board (but lots to come in Open Room).  Thanks to fellow commentators Gad and David.  Thanks to operator, and to EBU.  Open Room will stay open for results of other matches|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kerasidis: why cant we see the auction in the other room of this board?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: my problem too:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius to see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: we started late because of technical problems, so results only for the first 8 boards|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 4N by South opposite 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Other matches after the first stanza: Small +22 vs de Botton, Hinden +20 vs Hackett, Senior +16 vs Teltscher|pg||
nt|viren169: Thks all|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Last hand, and a good start for Crouch, who are lying third. They will both be concerned that second placed Teltscher are playing the tail-enders.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Forresters good weak twos appear to vary.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S will not play as well as 3@D in OR|pg||
nt|oliverc: thanks Robin. Teltscher should gain IMPs here|pg||
nt|viren169: 5N?!?!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|garnetts: Not the best auction I have ever seen|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: pick a|pg||
nt|viren169: I think Espen expect a slightly better hand here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Well, N-S got out of jail here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 20 minutes remaining called by director|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: think we'll get this one in!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to Jon Vos for great operating!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: and to you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to Rashed, Ralf and Roberto for commentary|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzrt: Tom shows his hearts suit to dummy |pg||
nt|viren169: cant see a line for 9 tricks... can you?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: John (not Jon)  sorry, John|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: My last here. I'm off to lose a Gold Cup match!!!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Good luck, I could easily lose it for you if you like|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Peter's jumper going back on!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Air con kicking in|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzrt: Espen thought Norman was on lead!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: As predicted, 12 IMPs to Rosen|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: slam|pg||
nt|rmb1: No|pg||
nt|viren169: West needs to be careful not to be in a hurry to cash the Q of @H here|pg||
nt|rmb1: As long as Liggins doesn't set up @HJ by continuing partner's suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Shd thk why he took Ace|pg||
nt|viren169: anything but a heart is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Thats what he might be thinking as he contemplates |pg||
nt|rmb1: But on other layout any suit could be wrong|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: ..and contemplates|pg||
nt|viren169: but the @H cant be right can it?|pg||
nt|viren169: On the bidding and play at trick 1|pg||
nt|viren169: However these are well needed imps for Rosen!|pg||
nt|viren169: West will switch to either a spade or diamond knowing that Pd has to have one of those aces to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and as it happens both work|pg||
nt|rmb1: The board where South had 8 @H and North had two aces was flat in 5@H-1, on a different (but similar) auction |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: at least|pg||
nt|Walddk4: provided that he makes this|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: NS have the advantage of playing the same contract on both the tables.:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5NT was presumeably a nudge to get partner to make the final mistake and he made it |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|oliverc: Certainly off 1 or 2 from here|pg||
nt|ady: good session for Crouch   |pg||
nt|viren169: found their 2nd worst fit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: even so I do not understand the 6@C bid |pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: I need to have supper now --so bye all --probably make 12 now with the q@H ruffing out |pg||
nt|Walddk4: So the difference 40|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|iain sime: Unluckily this goes down. But Jones might have tested the defence by stripping the spade out first.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bye all.|pg||
nt|garnetts: thanks all bye for now |pg||
nt|viren169: thks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: thks all next stanza 2pm|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Senior up by 16imps vs Teltscher|pg||
