nt|djneill:  well if 3@d indeed is weak, then 9 fast tricks on a @h lead require perfection|pg||
pc|c8|nt|murat: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/European_championships/TeamChampionships.asp?qmenuid=19|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: well this lead choice will save a trick I think|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bt: now east just has to guess @H or @D, does that make it a 75% game?|pg||
nt|atalok: neden konturlamadý nezih en fazla yapar ortagý zonda açmýþ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@S is just too speculative, 3@C ditto, and -180 isnt the end of the world, so he takes his chances here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on a good day pd has 3424 and opps have no fit|pg||
nt|mcphee: W was a little pushy bidding 3@H, even tho he may find 4 card support|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice switch|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but Muller did not promise more than 3@hs|pg||
nt|mcphee: right|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can have any 5 4 1 3 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: as well as 4 4 1 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like this will be on diamond guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my turkish is worse than my Dutch|pg||
nt|henryb:  does he have clues? perhaps: will know East started with stiff spade amd @cKJ. Perhaps with @dA also would have made a to double of 1@s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|djneill:  ok swing to Onstein after Angelini on previous board got to 3@s after opening 1@s on the 9 HCP|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|champ i: irde bu kadar geriyken |pg||
nt|atalok: boyle çeyler onemlidir veriri 800 u  stress baþlar sonra ne yapacak |pg||
nt|atalok: bari korlerden sonra sp donselerde çok batýrsak yine 12 imp alýrýz|pg||
nt|champ i: zonda 2 karo açýlmýþken x suz geçmesi düþünülemez|pg||
nt|tez: bizimkiler 4@d kontrlu oynuyor|pg||
nt|atalok: sp donerlerse fazla degisiklik olmaz |pg||
nt|tez: sayý vereceðiz yari|pg||
nt|atalok: tez hoca?|pg||
nt|champ i: 2 içeri x lu 300|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes twice past hand is a slight clue, but also kind of works if you apply to west also|pg||
pc|c2|nt|drewsky: I believe this hand is cold for 4@H if declarer NEVER touches hearts |pg||
nt|Gerben42: i hear Helness is playing 3@Dx even|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|atalok: hayýrlý haber yokmu hiç?|pg||
nt|tez: iki masayýda seyrediyorum.ne yapayým..yalan haber mi?|pg||
nt|atalok: bursa 0 trabzon 2 soranlara|pg||
nt|tez: izmirde vugraf salonundayým|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he first has to play a top spade|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bt: good idea|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wayne Stuart|pg||
nt|wstuart: Hi all.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Results.htm  for results and running scores|pg||
nt|bt: @CA @CK and @C ruff to start with is normal |pg||
nt|bt: and then he sees the drew line, lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: South's failure to shift to @Ds marks him with the queen @D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: 2 içeri|pg||
pc|dK|nt|2celik1: Tezcan Hocanin dedigi gibi oldu|pg||
nt|tez: hepsi mecburi hamle|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 1 in the glue|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so could be 7 imps to Onstein|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: very important & much needed 7 imp gain for onstein on tha deal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still a long way |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 500 confirmed from other room|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he has entry problems|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he would like to play a 4th @S but then cannot get @CK in|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but West had a balanced 7 or 9 count and spade length.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|tez: @d as alýp @h oynarsa|pg||
nt|fabsayc: helness saw something|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jbgood: same contract open room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or maybe an extra chance to set up diamonds this way to avoid a heart loser when king onside|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think perhaps he should have cashed the @sA first. Now his best plsy in trumps is the finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  stiff small is four times as likely as stiff queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does the spade lead change anything|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: belki 1 imp kurtarýrýz|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|funtay: bu turnuvada transfer serbest:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|drewsky: Devils coup variation coming up here|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry. the spade changes nothing, and the score is cumulative|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|tez: @s 10 oynayacak|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hobakan: kontursuz gitmeseydi iyiydi ama her 2 oyuncumuz da dbl diyecek güç göremedi ellerinde|pg||
nt|mcphee: and even that is a bit lucky I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|drewsky: now he will probably go down|pg||
nt|bt: now east will get a count of the hand |pg||
mc|9|nt|bt: unfortunately|pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SQJ97HJ3DT3CQ7652,SA52H542DJ85CJ843,SKT3H6DAK9742CAKT,S864HAKQT987DQ6C9|sv|b|nt|djneill:  both sides are contributing to keep it exciting|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|niekbrink: that was slightly unlucky |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I dare say|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5 boards to go|pg||
mb|1D|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: Helness in 4@S on a @c lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He'll have the same guess eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be 84-82 soon|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: this is another tough board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niekbrink: 3-3 spade split is useful in 4 spades. but the 4-1 club break isn't helpful|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@s makes |pg||
pc|h2|nt|niekbrink: what's the best defense?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|niekbrink: second round of hearts?|pg||
nt|hedyg: cant they beat this by playing 2@hs now and then duck 1 @S, take 2nd and play another @H?|pg||
nt|niekbrink: then duck the ace of spades once|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Niek :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|niekbrink: seems like south has to guess the break in the minors|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: not anymore|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, after seeing @s 3-3, he will cash @d b4 @c, if @d 4-1 then @c must be 3-2|pg||
nt|brgpro: when E shows up with 2@d, then he knows his 7-3-2-1 distribution, so he can safely cash 1 more @c( make sure) then give W a @d, knowing he has no more @h|pg||
nt|hedyg: with Niek's defense he cannot ruff a @d and a @H and pull trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|niekbrink: sorry, lost connection|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: he doesnt have to ruff a @d, just pull yrumps and give W a @d trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: fasten seatbelt|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is safe i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helness going down in 4@S in a different way on board 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing to @SQ|pg||
nt|niekbrink: so both declarers lost a queen to east....|pg||
nt|hedyg: after K@D was drawing A@S not safe?|pg||
nt|brgpro: niek, say defence starts with 2@h, u ruff and play trumps, W will duck one, takes 2nd and play 3rd @h, u ruff and play last trump. now knowing E is 7-3 in the majors. all u have to ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: do is to cash @d Ak, if they are 4-1 then E must have 2@c, when E shows up with 2@d, u just cash @cA, seeing 1@C by E, u can see all 13 cards now. then u safely duck a @d to make ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: this|pg||
nt|brgpro: nobody has any trumps|pg||
nt|niekbrink: I see|pg||
nt|niekbrink: you are right jack|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i missed that there were no more hearts with west|pg||
nt|brgpro: but now it is much easier for declarer|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|brgpro: he can even ruff a @d to set up the suit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, if E is 2-1 in the black suits, i dont think he can make, so just draw trumps...|pg||
nt|niekbrink: i think he is considering what to do if east ruffed from 2 small spades|pg||
nt|brgpro: he cant come back to hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he just goes down|pg||
nt|niekbrink: as Jack pointed out, no way to make then... so....|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|brgpro: missing @s8xx by W? no way to make this!|pg||
