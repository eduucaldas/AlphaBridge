nt|vugraphA2: a few mins|pg||
nt|marlowepi: game here ns|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: delay as Hung as 1 blue and 12 red cards|pg||
nt|davidstern: What suit is blue|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: Hi all   welcome  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Team Horwitz has 5 youngsters  - and Horwitz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i hate to ask what SNOT stands for :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: you can keep an eye on the other room using  http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||
nt|super nova: but they lost the first set 47 - 0. so they were quite behind.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: .|pg||
mb|1S|nt|super nova: The second set Pitt team won 47 to 13.. seems that 47 is having a role to play in todays match.?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury   2@H=I'm so ashamed|pg||
nt|exerdar: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Hi all for the final set|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: if N had gone more slowly, he would very likely have been allowed to play the cold 4H|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: good evening all. This is the second Round Robin session|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|super nova: The defence should be able to take, 1 heart 2 spades and a diamond and a club. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice stop partner|pg||
nt|loganrun: South hoping that the same happens at the other table with them in slam!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't know why EW didn't want their @C trick|pg||
nt|super nova: I wouldnt open a weak 2 H at this Vul.|pg||
nt|super nova: With this questionable suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: why middle, when we take only 1 spade, and all points in @c@c|pg||
nt|jkotor: lavinthal position|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|djneill:  no results from open room yet|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok they finished 31|pg||
nt|jkotor: here some luck for EW other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, 5+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C= multi-purpose   a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
nt|super nova: I remember once in the worlds one commentator was saying that the player was caught speeding with a bad suit and a weak hand.. yes -800 in 2h x.|pg||
nt|jkotor: could have been 800-1100|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|alert|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
nt|jkotor: but Buras played E for worse @h, and probably 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Prescott gave any thought to 3N instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||
nt|peachy: chose*|pg||
nt|peachy: the tenaces would have been nice though, to have lead come into|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Or if you have an ipad http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil asking iff Andy has something good for him and Andy says INDEED|pg||
nt|super nova: I personally like the TD lead.|pg||
nt|exerdar: now 2sp or 3cl|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other tables on Bd 3, all the other Souths have played 3NT on a  club lead to dummy's jack|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: seems Bilski needs one of the black Kings onside|pg||
nt|exerdar: 2sp could be good for competetive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here we are again|pg||
nt|petergill: South continued correctly with @SJ at Trick 2, which all the Easts correctly ducked, with varying degrees of smoothness. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert result on board 2 manually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6HE-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: yrwlc|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|super nova: I am trying to pump down declarer so that my trumps become longer than theirs.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Notice Nabil falsecards on every trick - so predictable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull trump eliminate @D pitching @H    exit @H -- let defense break @C|pg||
nt|petergill: Then South, with little else to do, played three top diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugrapha1: Klinger clkaimed i1 down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugrapha1: sorry lost play will give yu theresult|pg||
nt|super nova: of course it wouldnt help much on this deal.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like @H was still a transfer even with the overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: however a wheel fell off|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'd imagine Bill would have woken up had Ron reopened with 2@S rather than X|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|super nova: So long as Dec does not try to set up a heart trick too early they will have an easy run to 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So sister and brother commentating at the same table|pg||
nt|babs59: not for too long - I'm scaring him away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't recall that you did that before|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|vugrapha1: Sick of this Table Paul goes too fast|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C seems clear to me. it is not as if one fears a lead directing doub;e|pg||
pc|d6|nt|djneill:  here a showup squeeze on West but @c split|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil just working out if hearts could be 4-1 how best to play it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: but still, they are seniors don't forget|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Michael was worried about overruff of 3rd round of @D|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi Linda Lee from sunny Toronto!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: On the top @D's, the various Wests have tried to discourage clubs with varying degrees of success - perhaps @CQ to deny the king , and a discouraging pip to deny the ace, might get ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the club discouragement job done|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|nt|lml: actually pretty sunny today|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi Linda|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: if @HJ had popped up, he could overtake to play @D toward dummy twice|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|exerdar: defance didn't found to clubs  or @d A@@other table,  After @H win of @H K n-s can do 800 |pg||
nt|exerdar: 200 good save realy, bloody board:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence still has difficulty avoiding being endplayed, and might have to open up spades, hoping declarer misguesses, if @SK was ducked very smoothly. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: they've had a very good week really, reaching the semis of the Open with Newell and Reid, and now this final |pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: about to claim 4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence from Sellberg|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT made in the other room|pg||
nt|babs59: but he's still about to get endplayed isn't he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ instead of a low heart, hoping partner wins @HK, then declarer misguesses on the next heart, might avoid the looming endplay. |pg||
nt|petergill: A heart now, then cash hearts and exit a low spade, hoping for a misguess, seems to be the defence's only remaining chance|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: nice try for an extra chance  but will have to fall back on @CK in South or  North having started with 14 cards|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|loganrun: Nicely played - poorish pitch by West but has South thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think better line was  @DA  @SA @D ruff @SK @DK pitch @H  @D ruff then @H|pg||
