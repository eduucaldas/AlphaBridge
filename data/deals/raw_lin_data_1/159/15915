mb|p|nt|haans: clubs lead to break|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia is never afraid|pg||
nt|mamos: either one down or the whole lot?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double is the correct approach, 2@c would describe less|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over t/o x 1@s still fine|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but personally i expected 2@d by Boye|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for North was easy pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still wld pull to at least slam|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, mistake in bidding, now on trick 5|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Hans|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning all   we have had a small problem here on Board 1 but hope to bring you the result shortly|pg||

nt|jeanhari: probalbly normal contract here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makes also 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: well not doubled     but Europe might win this one|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@s isnt everyones choice I would guess...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia has brought a box of tissues to the table, blows his nose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because she knows 17 at hand, 12-13 at opener, and say 6-7 at east, so South 0-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Resume in 12 mins. Sorry lost play on 7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1N off balanced, only points out values|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: US players sitting other way round - will change display shortly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Negoescu - Briciu is not a regular partnership, but let's hope that they'll do well today|pg||
nt|bobholl: if n @H lead may be even 4@S|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@s should be 8-10, so 3@h invitational with losers @h i guess|pg||

nt|haans: Operator Playing against which piars (compare with?)|pg||

nt|mamos: ah of course if the opp has the wrong declarer   -- we think its Rodwell the play won't work easily either :(|pg||
nt|haans: new for us all :)|pg||
nt|mamos: the twins often play canape iM openings so Diamonds then Spades shows long diamonds|pg||
nt|jacksond: at least in hearts you can get to the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a problem in auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: impossible twofold 3@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Liliek:)   welcome|pg||
nt|blewah: hi pak Liliek|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to make 5@d a complete guess because of two way @c finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 5 minor/s good save|pg||
nt|tez: if dbl again pd could bid 5@c|pg||
nt|haans: 2@Cx make no game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mamos: dummy may be a disappointment to declarer|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: good|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: the normal 4@H (down a million)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: where NS make game with their 18HCP :)|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S seems ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 points for a win, 2 for a tie, 0 for a loss|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 12 points at stake again|pg||
nt|blewah: these are arguably the world's two of the very best woman pairs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 5 losers off two, in case @cK pinned off one, without double still good while 4@h fine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Tez|pg||
nt|anton72: too agressive start :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Among the soundtracks she has done are Forrest Gump, Good Will Hunting and the last five Woody Allen movies.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: EW carding is UDCA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h required|pg||
nt|haans: you for the kill |pg||
nt|haans: good start|pg||
nt|danilo1: Dble would be too agressive, but pass, not 5@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Justin asks about carding - didn't hear answer sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: even at this scoring I tht 3NT an unlikely spot    if South had the 4th club this would have been bad for the Hackets|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think "mostly upside down", but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|ady: or could have been|pg||
nt|haans: BAM is Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes it was the board slam missed at both tables|pg||
nt|haans: happy dummy :)|pg||
nt|bernix: difficult to reach 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: penalty doubles have died in IMPs|pg||
nt|milton_se: in any case, NS have given away a lot of information|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S @D @H 4 made |pg||
nt|edmunte1: the romanian team in Stara Zagora has only 3 members of the team that won the Romanian Teams Bridge Championship last year|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS are a strong pair, member of Greece national team that finished 29th this year in Ostende|pg||
nt|haans: Good pass by Doron Y|pg||
nt|anton72: defence need to find @s switch |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||

nt|westjava: tourney website : http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|pg||

nt|blewah: the americans plays 2/1, while the germans strong club, 4 card major with canape possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: In the individual each team has to use a single system, even when playing in practised partnerships. |pg||
nt|sybarra: so we have "std. american" and "std. european" |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: although both are a 2/1GF system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would lead to play at hand and concede all picture cards to opps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may end with just +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: connection down in other room will have to restart this one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: surprisingly @hQ falls|pg||

nt|h_karluk: however just a guess, bcos declarer still have no idea abt @d values|pg||

nt|jan_jansma: or will she cash the setting trick first?|pg||

nt|jeanhari: not easy for Justin|pg||
nt|tez: if he plays @h..he can put ace of @h i thk|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: as long as declarer has 2 trumps, yes|pg||
nt|udo: still -2 and a decent score,,maybe the board|pg||
nt|ady: I see 4@H did make|pg||
nt|haans: the best chance im sure|pg||

pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 1@S really? How quaint|pg||

nt|h_karluk: cool Liliek, jill is a great personality, always humble and she doesn't even play a lot of bridge  world championships, trials. most of her close woman friends aren't even bridge ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: players. her most important person in her life is her husband Mr Sid Brownstein :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: NA style is to o/c with the S hand as opposed to a t/o dble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Geoff disagreed abt Klinger's 100 winning tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: ah, this one was a "player's hand in the way of the card" issue :)|pg||

nt|gmarco24: it's not common to bid 3 doubles with 3 spades and club void|pg||

nt|tez: 2@d either weak major ..mulri|pg||

nt|danilo1: * coffee |pg||
nt|anton72: but not so percentage.....|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. But Americanized, 1/2 added |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-0 Hampson here|pg||

nt|bobholl: miss @S now|pg||
nt|stc: yes 1@s should be perfect here|pg||
nt|stc: a free bid shows a good hand anyway|pg||
nt|stc: S is not here to pass !|pg||
nt|anton72: guess part score in @d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|ady: may be a heart guess for 10 or 11 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|bobholl: J of @H is a very fine card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good raise by Auken, but maybe 2@H would have won it too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant say somebody decides to start directly 41h|pg||

pc|sA|nt|haans: Mackwell cxomparing with Helgemo|pg||

nt|udo: solid contract,,3@D|pg||
nt|stc: looks like a win for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey Ant, gl there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back, you'll watch Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde for Europe and Jill Levin & Jill Meyers for USA, www.buffettcup.com|pg||
nt|jeanhari: close call here, as would be the play in 4@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have no sympathy to 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: K@D lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: >|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The convention cards have been slightly modified I believe, but I don't know where sadly|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst had a hard choice between 3@s and 3NT|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a nice slam @s there|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi jackson|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: not certain to make 10 tricks in hearts    depends how club suit is handled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "did you pass Gerber?" :)|pg||
nt|haans: small spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c more descritive than 2@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *descriptive|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think 1@H-3@C is inv with clubs though|pg||
nt|sybarra: and she as safe spot in @D's |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days your pard bids spades |pg||
nt|sybarra: the indy format is interestign |pg||
nt|sybarra: Each player on Team Europe is drawn to compare with a particular player on Team USA. A player does not meet the player with whom he or she compares. |pg||
nt|sybarra: That player will always be in the same seat at the corresponding table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: will put board 7 in later|pg||
nt|haans: all cards right for decl|pg||
nt|bernix: hi hans. since you're on your own apperently i will help out if you dont mind|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 3@H is good weak (should be), than West must bid 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: odds for game making|pg||
nt|anton72: also 5 @d is cool|pg||
nt|anton72: looser in @h going over Q @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: this is a wild contest, reminds me "topgun" movie :) we will see best of bests|pg||
nt|ady: hackets have opted for no-trumps in this scoring method   might have come unsuck on a club lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: surely would have|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sementa - "I might have passed a splinter"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe dbl over 4@s wld lead to 4@s disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i read 3N-3 on myscreen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: OR Jeff and Eric lucky, they are regular partners|pg||

nt|anton72: no|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|haans: dont understand 2nt at all|pg||
nt|rado: maybe 4+fit and some defense:)|pg||

nt|westjava: East will support, of course|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3NT for north south no problem|pg||
nt|tez: unagressive|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is a 50% NV so you have to guess rigth in those situations |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mcphee: I did not think a @C would be led after the splinter|pg||

nt|bernix: simple but you still have to find the trump queen|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward contract, this. |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
nt|westjava: so do I|pg||
nt|bobholl: can't be staying bidding NT but 3NT is best manche|pg||

nt|bernix: in 6|pg||

nt|anton72: if defence switch in @d after A @s .... 10 tricks ..loose 2 @c and A @s|pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|stc: the good choice to play on @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: good he didn't lead the T of @C|pg||
nt|mamos: the cards mostly lie well for EW   probably made game if they had bid it |pg||
nt|mamos: one|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 12 tricks isn't easy|pg||
nt|mamos: exactly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: everything on the right spot here, the fate of contract depends trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 too high  but NS can make @C contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: EW should stay passive to play it down|pg||
nt|bobholl: think i would have bid 3@S on first opportunity :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: the auction took some twists and turns - 3nt looked alikely contract   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jacksond: south can bid 2s on her second bid because they play2/1 forcing to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are not friendly|pg||
nt|rado: 2@D relay 2@H 3-4 cards natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: might be keeping low because of the scoring I guess|pg||
nt|westjava: West down grade her stiff @DK|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh just as bad :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff sluff|pg||
nt|haans: need 1 trick more|pg||
nt|stc: but only 6 tricks if the defense stays passive|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: double dummy AK winning line|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Sabine Auken sometimes visits USA, a nice lady from my unit 160, district 7 <Miss Joyce Hampton> hires her for top events and they win&scratch in teams|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5@C denies @S control?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: then 5@D now? (@S control)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it shows a mixed @h raise and very nice help to opener|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I swear my P key is having an off day :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwi_joker: Am told 2@C is a mixed raise, 3 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S2 out of the hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: Sabine not comfortable with 3 nt |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice one easily would employ a losing hook|pg||
nt|haans: i counted 9 losers 9 p|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: DOUBLE and get the point|pg||
nt|haans: or support spades later|pg||

pc|d5|nt|jan_jansma: OK, 6@D was a try for 6NT|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 or 7 now|pg||
nt|bobholl: restricted choice in @C and no rpoblem|pg||
nt|bobholl: still searching for 12th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: Brogeland is in 6@S in OR  |pg||
nt|mamos: sorry it was  NUnes  Boye was South|pg||
nt|mamos: and made|pg||
nt|kastan88: in all matches, Europeans bid 6@S|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Richard Bley|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Richard :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Levin, wants to lead a @D but is likely pickling pards @D trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant, is Bobby in a trance?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes Aggelopouls played with Koukuselis in Ostende|pg||
nt|bobholl: why anxious to be on lead other than @H play|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mcphee: well I guess not:(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shortness might be your partner's winner, why not to lead it before declarer dumps somewhere|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @c lead was best|pg||
nt|ady: would have had to duck if K@D led|pg||
nt|bobholl: did they play @H and let one grow ?|pg||
nt|milton_se: making??|pg||
nt|edmunte1: http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/ the official page, waiting for inputs|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jan_jansma: with no clue|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: he will just bang down @HAK|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: (slowly)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, much thought at the moment|pg||
nt|sybarra: may try the spade up now?|pg||
nt|westjava: or now a @H finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Closed room are in 3@H, so all a matter of overtricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: may play @H to the ace and a club up also |pg||
nt|westjava: she still count Levin's hand|pg||
nt|blewah: @h has to guess but @s will likely give in to N from the bid|pg||
nt|blewah: and if n continues, will create trump problem|pg||
nt|westjava: make decision, a @H drop or finesse |pg||
nt|blewah: yes, that would be my prediction too for W|pg||
nt|westjava: dont touch your @S, Arya:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: she is likely certain where the K of @H is,  question is layout |pg||
nt|h_karluk: forgot to cash @dK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: BAM is Super MP Best pairs (team) close to always win :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes after @dJ|pg||

nt|sybarra2: will be back with the @D |pg||
nt|sybarra2: or @S I mean|pg||
nt|haans: do not like discarding|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer has no loosing option in @D|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|udo: 10 tricks now,,,,,good score|pg||
nt|haans: S will not pass this time but why start with 2nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt was certainly higher risk  but was successful in OR|pg||
nt|tez: what dou you bid with ozden's hand..2@s or 2@c(drury)?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe payback for not bidding game :)|pg||
nt|tez: if partner has @c ace ..he must shift @d|pg||

nt|haans: here we go :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c..i bet|pg||
nt|stc: a tricky board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: that 110 doesnt look too flash a score on  2..anyone in NT will surely amass at elast 120|pg||
nt|haans: trying for 6nt?|pg||
nt|rado: now some 5 level battle:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: was afraid of over ruff may be|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needed very little at the table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ant, pls add fave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Convention cards:  Europe  http://tinyurl.com/253kuld   USA  http://tinyurl.com/3s3g4r|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous deal proved, timing is everything|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Thankfully this board is the correct way arround :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 losers for EW|pg||
nt|haans: leve opps with the two first @D|pg||
nt|bernix: let's see if the turcs manage to reach 5@d after 2-suited opener|pg||
nt|bernix: this one looks interesting. both sides can win game in a major|pg||
nt|danilo1: but 2NT pass (correct bidding) may make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d lead but....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i prefer neg x level 4@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|ady: n/s can make 5 of a minor    but may not get there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but was almost a yarborough there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this looks an everyday 3N by EW|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D easy found|pg||
nt|haans: 7@H?|pg||

nt|udo: what is the westhand worth?   for me straight 4@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1-1|pg||
nt|ady: might get overboard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but slam for NS|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@s is a 2 suiter with @s|pg||
nt|haans: good to dind hearts suit|pg||
nt|april7: 5@H then a good save|pg||
nt|bernix: a club lead would beat 5@d but difficult to find from south hand|pg||
nt|haans: most experts say NOT Blackwood|pg||
nt|haans: thats a new one|pg||
nt|haans: 7NT a finesse away|pg||
nt|haans: most do not pass anymore taking the chance|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... in fact .. will just go 1 trick less down :)|pg||
nt|haans: Israel may win an imp :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: so gain 2 imps :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@D is not such a bad contract|pg||

nt|oliverc: NT's the only making game here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still safe|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to 3@d as East|pg||
nt|haans: 4@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Jon, good to see you again|pg||
nt|ady: if they try 3NT   likely to fail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however minors length problem|pg||
nt|haans: players getting older with every bid :)|pg||
nt|tez: now they have an idea where is king of @s|pg||
nt|gmarco24: this can be made with 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Retip: 7@c around 95%|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: berkowitz would definitely have hard times|pg||
nt|jacksond: hi jon|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 1NT (F) to show a weak @S raise later|pg||
nt|bobholl: but do both players know each otheres habbits ?|pg||
nt|mamos: we can expect some excitement here|pg||
nt|bobholl: other rrom 5@H X|pg||
nt|bobholl: and made|pg||
nt|h_karluk: adventurous 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and mirror position in @d suit bad|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 4@c is a pass/corect bid|pg||
nt|edmunte1: showing fit for both minors|pg||
nt|haans: DBL = lead directing|pg||
nt|april7: N can't find the K of @S in 5@H, then only 1 down, but also 2 down is ok|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe he'll find @c lead after all|pg||
nt|bernix: part score penalty doubles en vogue in open room|pg||
nt|bernix: maybe they double more confidently because north didnt bid spades there|pg||
nt|haans: or 2@H being Ekrens|pg||
nt|bernix: what is ekrens|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It has several chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS might make 6@D here - needs a bit of play on a spade lead |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Many chances|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in this form of scoring, losing the board by 10 is same as losing it by 1400 ... its  a minus|pg||
nt|mcphee: because it only gets 1 trick at most and may pass timing to the offense|pg||
nt|haans: best 2@S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fave= in USA we mean 'favorites' in internet explorer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make a bunch of nt here |pg||
nt|mamos: good slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra2: N is suppose to be "in charge"  |pg||
nt|haans: deutch at its best|pg||
nt|edmunte1: another part-score fight here|pg||
nt|haans: Cernat made it easy|pg||
nt|funtay: cerkezköy isveç ile oynuyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score  hand    looks like 10 tricks in clubs for n/s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you can also put your partner to an early hook|pg||
nt|westjava: cant find a @S lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unlucky lead, helps to decl to pitch @d loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however transportation problem|pg||
nt|jacksond: in fact of course he has no diamond loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we see that, dK stiff|pg||
nt|jbgood: will not be easy to get the 11 needed to half the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: stiil hard to make 11 tricks as i other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who would not try @cQ hook then @sK wehen hold pitch a @d at hand|pg||
nt|rado: 4@S has a little better chanses than 4@H|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: experts NEVER pass an opening bid from partner (at Teams) nonvul vs vul) !!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: NEVER|pg||
nt|westjava: yup, handle with carefully|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@d would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still a chance for 6@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable|pg||
nt|haans: right no support pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|danilo1: @DJ, than @S to 10 ... opps will have to be very careful|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 6 nt could roll |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5 @d decided by N, S ready to correct 6@d|pg||
nt|gmarco24: no rdbl, no trouble  :)|pg||
nt|haans: heading to 7nt?|pg||
nt|haans: assume this board will take some time at OR 2 :)|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 2nt invite because they have bad suppprt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jan_jansma: (not to get to game themselves, but to prevent the oppo from reaching one)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 3@C shows either 5+@Ss&4@H or @S and @C GF|pg||
nt|ady: showing their stoppers    but not enough for 3NT to make|pg||
nt|haans:  3-8 at leastb 4-4 in M|pg||
nt|bernix: will he find the killing lead ?|pg||
nt|bernix: 4@h will propably fail on lack of entries |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: again 3NT looks an obvious place to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about leads; "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|haans: need 4@Sx to get points in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H4 out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *when|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: (in this case, both of course :))|pg||
nt|haans: now its serious|pg||
nt|stc: heavy 2@s by E|pg||
nt|atalok: muhtemel 1 imp veririz 140 olursa|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mamos: and there are plent of tricks  is slam out of the question?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|stc: best lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: today bobby levin and alan sontag starred about the opening leads|pg||
nt|oliverc: Difficult to get the hand wrong, though|pg||
nt|udo: if she places @C king with south,,she can win and finesse @H for @C discard,,has to risk diamond to hand and hope they are not 5-0|pg||
nt|stc: the Q is if you take the hook in @h or not|pg||
nt|oliverc: right|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but @d lead would help declarer, pitches @c|pg||
nt|haans: double: in case you want to pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to guess @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S lead may make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some bidding by Sabine, not even sure of some kind of fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: till to here USA 79, Europe 65|pg||
nt|milton_se: and down|pg||
nt|tez: israel yadlin was my teammate this summer..mersin bridge festival..he played very well|pg||
nt|danilo1: reasonable @SK try |pg||
nt|haans: yep 1 trick or none|pg||
nt|danilo1: still time for @S trick|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess they know each other|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d by N is an acceptable contract, basicaly on @d 3-2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what does South do now, though?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Draw trumps, try to make @HQ drop, and if not a club finesse or a show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Isn't that what you would do in 6@D?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West will certainly lead @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: will just claim 11, I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play two times clubs towards hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S lead necessary to beat them|pg||
nt|haans: chicken :(|pg||
nt|tez: whats trump they have not an idea|pg||
nt|stc: even 2@s may go down !!|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: Sorry,but there was lead out of turn and I will claim final result|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: 6nt not easy|pg||
nt|haans: sqz possibilities|pg||
nt|mamos: Meckstroth Rodwell 's +140 beat Helegemo Helness' 130 on Board 1  to win the first board for them  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: fantoni would obviously try to knock out @h AK|pg||
nt|ady: sensible auction  though if Meyers could have doubled 3@S for penalties that would win the board|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @CJ|pg||
nt|mamos: so Europw will win this board|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @C lead 5@H probably fails|pg||
nt|mamos: 12 tricks if either major finesse works|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sabine checks which responses to Keycard they are playing|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 0314  to me|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: @s lead and? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the answer is Brogeland:)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: or Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s not bad|pg||
nt|ady: West stepped in at wrong time|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry was fixed on S playing :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to play without regular partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is individual |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @dK|pg||
nt|tez: now show your suit:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Look like the best line of play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oliverc: but only 10 available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: clubs|pg||
nt|ady: J@D lead can get 300|pg||
nt|jeanhari: BAM-dbl :)|pg||
nt|ady: well done  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d may be unanimous in the field|pg||
nt|ady: only have to negotiate club position if east ducks twice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and two rounds hearts before west discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sp A+ruff also needed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: who knows a slip in defence - actually almost impossible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if the @c 9 would be at the table things would be easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while @sA not knocked out would just concede a @c|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you duck that you have recitified the count for a possible squeeze|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bobholl: lot of upgrading from meckstroth but in BAM all is well that ends well|pg||
nt|bobholl: lose 1 trick in each colour i fear|pg||
nt|april7: K of @C no good card, so the X is also a bad one|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford the @D to hand, though as it exposes the K@D once North takes the A@S|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: sing @H now looks normal|pg||
nt|mamos: only a small club as it happens|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so all "suffering" under same rules |pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed a 60% (guess) @D slam but ...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: The norwegians have bid 6NT on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: I mean there is no net gain|pg||
nt|udo: u are rite,,,so the lead was the winner for USA|pg||
nt|udo: @D lead other room|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 135 is popular :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  good choice|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES BUFFETT CUP **** USA  96 EUR 78 ****   |pg||

nt|sybarra: remember this is BAM   |pg||
nt|riccho:  are the players allowed to look into their own systemcard here?|pg||
nt|mamos: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting 11 just cash @dA and be happy not landed grand slam|pg||
nt|haans: and you are still alive :)|pg||
nt|tez: north will be sqz if @d lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: ahalim: W will be strip-squeezed ME agree|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be very clever to gove declarer the extra entry to finesse in clubs twice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: still must play hearts from the table too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth leans forward, elbows on the table, cards face down in a pile|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting individual format, still usa-europe camp. normally individual is an event all players make partnership.|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no easy return|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff musing abt @s count and 3@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seeing @sK defence not much hard|pg||
nt|jeanhari: the longer it takes , the more I expect Sabine to make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H she can make if guessing rigth|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in general 3rd 5th leads widely accepted, the picture would appear |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @S4@C3 towards the front of the hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h switch - table's weakness, follow the old book|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meckstroth apologies, and continues his thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: before long suit stopper knocked out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needs 3 more tricks to set|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dK, 2 hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: this is too ambitious as the cards lie  -- |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they are |pg||
nt|riccho:  13 tricks now|pg||
nt|sybarra: each team (USA and Euro) are playing a "standard" card |pg||
nt|h_karluk: another @s hook after @hQ|pg||
nt|stc: 10 quick tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first hurdle passed - they got there|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: clubs, but @h A favborablhy placed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : favorably|pg||
nt|udo: not to forget the 2@C bid of course|pg||
nt|mcphee: the next @H applies pressure on S hand|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H even|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ducking should be routine|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|haans: not clubs lead in 6nt|pg||
nt|mamos: 5NT looks like pick a slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 @h break then makeable one|pg||
nt|bobholl: !K not sure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer would obviously hook trumps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks on accurate defense, which we can expect|pg||
nt|tez: duck @h now|pg||
nt|stc: now 11 :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: another chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i shut my eyes not to see @h hook|pg||
nt|udo: next door NS bid 1@H and 3 @H so @C and @D never mentionned|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|oliverc: The hand pretty much an open book now, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h? oh acolish|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,the brothers|pg||
nt|udo: acol|pg||
nt|oliverc: I think it has to be the @H hook now at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|oliverc: Can't afford NOT to make 11 tricks from here|pg||

pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: @d position was : 3-2 36 %, 4-1 28 %, 5-0 4%|pg||

nt|h_karluk: plans changed after 2nd @s |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am surprised Jeff couldn't read the picture|pg||
nt|bobholl: better for europe|pg||
nt|bobholl: on our first board ns in 5@C 1 down doubled|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but @s lead was very bad, made @sK winner|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and gave a chance to pitch @d lsoer|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 3rd h ruff then c|pg||

pc|h3|nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: club loser at hand goes to @hK|pg||
nt|danilo1: @HK and @H if not 2-2 now .. East is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: note that East passed 3@H. There are people who would double it  |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I assume this is Jill |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, at least 6 boards, both sides have a chance to read their way well, i won an indy a month ago in my unit, played with 14 different partners 2 boards each round|pg||
nt|edmunte1: more IMP's for the home team|pg||
nt|haans: and he is the winner|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, bobby|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: way easy|pg||
nt|mamos: WEinstein went down in 3@H on board 2 so Europe who lag behind by a large margin (18 points)  off to the good dtart they need|pg||
nt|bobholl: well we know where the @C K is he doesn't|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: might win the board with that|pg||

nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@D a better contract   but losing the points |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: bingo|pg||
nt|h_karluk: europe 3 US 0|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and if 2@d is transfer with 4+@h why not 2@h from S?|pg||
nt|jkotor: NS 1nt = 14-16, 2@c = pre with both majors i think, 1@c is polish style but 11-13 bal (not classic 12-14)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrace: lets see how they will rach to 7|pg||
nt|jkotor: so, 2@c is not both majors :)|pg||

nt|mrace: if that toy is available in their agreement|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and can only be reached bye cuebids, with a void on S|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jkotor: 4@d - 4@h - 5@s - ???(1/4kc) - 7@d|pg||
nt|mrace: now 5@S ? |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mrace: once N skips 4@s here he can bid i guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now NOT 4nt|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jkotor: this way they will bid only 6 IMO, i dont like 4@c, with 7-4 not my choice|pg||
nt|mrace: folks, i have an emergency here and have to leave, was short but nice to be with u both, good luck! |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|jkotor: and this bidding shows the weakness of 2@c opening - less place for bidding|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Giorgio Duboin (born September 30, 1959 in Turin, Italy) is an Italian bridge player. Duboin has won four World teams championships along with six consecutive European teams ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: championships and a seventh European in 2010. For many years his regular partner was Norberto Bocchi; now he plays primarily with Antonio Sementa.|pg||
nt|jbgood: no records of the play in the OR - Broge will not be happy to lose that board|pg||
nt|Walddk7:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@d then maybe 2@h|pg||
nt|mamos: seems a normal result|pg||
nt|yvesj49: hi shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: bjr yves |pg||
nt|sybarra: oops sorry,  wd Bobby :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries they r both fm th family|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is unique fomat |pg||
nt|edmunte1: probablyNS playing a strong club system, that's the only way i can understand pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: that was quick :)|pg||
nt|haans: plus for Radisic-Altman|pg||
nt|haans: more here :)|pg||
nt|haans: may be imp to Israel|pg||
nt|bernix: +1 is wrong isnt it|pg||
nt|bernix: 10 tricks only|pg||
nt|vugraphzra: sorry =|pg||
nt|haans: Final word: bbhants: and he played it well to that point!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: only small @S from hand makes it|pg||
nt|stc: you can play J from dummy for Hx in S or small to the dummy for Hx in N|pg||
nt|stc: small from dummy is good only for stiff H in S|pg||
nt|stc: on a good day you make 4@s with ew hands, not today|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@S all pas is possible|pg||
nt|anton72: horoble hand|pg||
nt|anton72: 33 points 2 fits ...no slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a good solid result|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: he got an easy win prev hand, so they are even|pg||
nt|bobholl: show up is the rigth expression |pg||
nt|h_karluk: nah, i expect the field wld be in 5@d with same tricks, to me a tie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and south may reopen, who knows|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jan_jansma: 10-14 again|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops 9-13|pg||
nt|rado: here 2NT 5+@s INv+ maybe|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: unfair.... You have their system in front of you?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes this will happen often|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes checks the convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no doubt checking if 3@H or some such bid shows 5-5 Majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: zia laying in the bushes|pg||
nt|mamos: and it seems ok to consult your own card :)    a couple of times I think teams have been helping the oppo witheir system :)|pg||
nt|haans: score is not decide here we just have to carry along|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: Should Zia just pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strectched mini roman|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H 4 carder|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H could be 4 cards when 4@s4@H(32)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north surely looking for slam here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: now they may and are unlucky|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     1NT likely|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult choice for N 3Nt or 4@S|pg||
nt|yvesj49: here EW win 5@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: its a friendly group |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Quite refreshing to see players being allowed to check their own cards imo|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Break for lunch after this set. Restart at 14.00 BST, in about 1 hour and 5 minutes|pg||
nt|riccho:  aggressive lead here by rodwell cost s costly trick|pg||
nt|haans: max 3@H|pg||
nt|tez: muranli/ozden playing first time i think at vugraph |pg||
nt|haans: double looming here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzrj: Nunes asks for the card - he hasn't brough one with him|pg||
nt|bobholl: is this in the system notes i doubt it :)|pg||
nt|mamos: hopefully that shows 55 majors  :)  on both sides of the table  East and West :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it seems EW don't have any European system cards with them|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes that is in notes 55 majors|pg||
nt|bobholl: than i would bid 4@H as W|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers suggests that they just tell each other :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: meanwhile the director brings them a copy of the system|pg||
nt|mamos: Its a sensible gadget |pg||
nt|riccho:  it is on the card 4@d =5+5+MAJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: it is not clear if the 4@D bid is actually on the system!|pg||
nt|bobholl: but did nunes know it ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Note 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Ah, think Eric's found it now|pg||
nt|riccho:  He looked on the cc, didnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i still believe a questionable decision|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's wait Fulvio's result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the overtrick was critical  for a Eorope gain|pg||
nt|april7: unfortunately an unmakable contract |pg||
nt|bernix: i would have opened south hand with 2@h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: edit : stretched|pg||
nt|jbgood: voidshowing 4@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: need to put some brakes on soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this one is THE VERY WILD contest. Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: von arnim and hamman picked double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Europe was dominant half of the round|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bobby decides to stay on defence in case they also reached 6@d things may change|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H I mean|pg||
nt|bobholl: NO strong @C now ?|pg||
nt|stc: did well to stay low|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @S's? What @S's?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe some east west (a minority) might decide to compete with ie 5@h <prev board>|pg||
nt|ady: interesting     win and play back 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia lent Rodwell his 3@H card two boards ago, and now has to ask for it back :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: don't know, just guessing|pg||
nt|milton_se: don't think they play a strong C -- se board 1|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|haans: Opening Bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld ask Fulvio's idea in Facebook:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: he knew very good :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Claudio is pleased he remembered correctly :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: he cannot misclick as we, So Nunes knew|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: He guessed that he remembered the bid correctly|pg||
nt|haans: a Ekren version at least 54 in M|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  surely 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 6@d pick a major suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fulvio did not use any convention vs 15-17 1N blindly at 2nd seat|pg||
nt|haans: Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|edmunte1: identical bid as in OR|pg||
nt|edmunte1: ok, they play natural|pg||
nt|haans: Kib say that Ozden-Muranli may play vugrapgh for 1st time|pg||
nt|haans: and they are new players|pg||
nt|bernix: 2@s looks weired to me|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|haans: in BAM you scores nothing for second best contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normally 11-15 any 4441|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: and 3@S = 2@S and 6@H, Rado?|pg||
nt|rado: unfortunatelly don't remember LOL|pg||
nt|rado: with trumps 3-3 4@S will be ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: We seem to have a mild technical hitch, but hopefully the broadcast will continue|pg||
nt|westjava: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld be happy to play this board 31c by N|pg||
nt|haans: 1 trick short|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@c by North|pg||
nt|yvesj49: cheap defence in @s|pg||
nt|yvesj49: not found.....|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @C lead beats 3 NT|pg||
nt|stc: no play on a @c lead|pg||
nt|stc: @d will also do, he will not put the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: was told the twins' NT is 14-16 ... but that doesnt look right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 3-2 is  68%  (not 28)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: "how light do you open"|pg||
nt|mcphee: gazilli in  action|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well bid by Jason|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken claimed 10 tricks, but Meckstroth was very honest and declared that the @DK falls, so 11|pg||
nt|ady: duck   or take and switch to a sspade    easier defence    duck|pg||
nt|mamos: presumably North enquires and South shows max with Heart feature|pg||
nt|mamos: so Rodwell goes for the magic NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both M aces favorably placed|pg||
nt|tez: results http://5bbc.neo-bridge.org/|pg||
nt|stc: he can play on @s and make or on @d and go down|pg||

mb|4D|nt|bobholl: J of @H and Q of @S my guess|pg||
nt|kastan88: all USA pairs went for 3NT|pg||
nt|edmunte1: NS playing udca and 2/4 leads in standard bulgarian way |pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: Ekren is rocking the boatth Truct they make misstake|pg||
nt|bernix: how is he to know that pard has equal length in majors ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: unlucky opening bid (probable @H lead) ... I agree with 1NT|pg||
nt|haans: -1 next|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East must be unlimited since West is thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so long|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@h a bit dangerous, East may go past 3NT w/o something in @c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if this is the final contract, NS have to be careful not to block the hearts - we can assume South will lead one |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrj: when we pass 1NTx we have a balnced and|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fulvio liked his @s Qtx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff preferred double with same hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which indicates there were also strong NT opening values|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now we are about to see which strategy would work well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind this is super matchpoints|pg||
nt|haans: Jacks of low value|pg||

nt|bobholl: wasn't 5@D that already ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Hampson : "I just didn't want to get doubled :)"|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   mixing hands up|pg||
nt|kastan88: from europeans only Nunes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classic 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you want to win the board just trust your luck, place @c9 to righty |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and play a spade towards table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways after the opening lead quick tricks are : 1@s, 4@c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer should produce extra 2 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: best lead|pg||
nt|haans: for a spade ruff|pg||

nt|westjava: I am told 18-19 balance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to have a worldgrandmaster title you must be world champ and lotsa placing points|pg||
nt|mcphee: mexican 2@D for strong 18-19 balanced hands, balanced, no 5 card suit I believe is how this pair use it|pg||
nt|mcphee: the 5 card suits alter a hand a lot|pg||

nt|yvesj49: happy to avoid @d lead|pg||
nt|mamos: ten in Spades nine in NT here|pg||
nt|sybarra: the other minor suit K and down it would go |pg||

nt|sybarra: this gamble will not pay off |pg||
nt|mamos: someone with time could check all the boards but i guess the NT gamblers are a long way ahead in this event|pg||

nt|sybarra: how to make +1 in nt,  I do not see a way |pg||

nt|jbgood: Duboin decided to enter the bidding in the OR - cost the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they have many special gadgets but unfortunately yet not much hands occurred to show that skills|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@d was another option for west players|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo - "never accept gifts from opps"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and as east even pass to 2@d would be available|pg||
nt|yvesj49: finesse @h lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: undo pls|pg||
nt|haans: many many raise with just a 4 carder minimum value|pg||

nt|h_karluk: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||

nt|boyklas: yes...this is more possible|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would if QJ of @H were Kx|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt for he had to much|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but there are 4 @h losers|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: most use WJS so 2@S could not be a minimum hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: as you have a lot of stress rebidding over a 2NT rebid from partners|pg||
nt|westjava: and 2nt is forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Italians try a new partnership : Augustin Madala  Antonio Sementa, i guess in five years that will give good results|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2/1 passed hands are nonforcing|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can fail on the same position|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: so there!!  wd Bobby |pg||
nt|milton_se: very tough by Nego but the cards lie well|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @S will make i guess thanks to fav @S position|pg||
nt|haans: best direct 4NT 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: in my book raise now to 4NT is quant|pg||
nt|stc: reached by less scientific aproach|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice result if natural bidding you "ll reach 6@D|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: güzel atak|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: i think 2@d over x would give much chances, ie responder would raise to 4@c --  i know it tells 6/4 @h+@s|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h not easy to find|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was a wrong input by operator, was not a psyche|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries, happens|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: thanks for spotting it though :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: spade guess for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4N rkcb 0314 - last asked suit|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think east may have bid 3Spades as a Q-bid would be better|pg||
nt|haans: @DT good card|pg||
nt|stc: and loose 3IMP|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah,2nt opening is ghost for me!|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think they may make|pg||
nt|haans: win some lose same|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be not good enough W may guess rigth (i would'nt)|pg||
nt|danilo1: declarer must guess @D after @C lead, no tempo if he does not pick ip 5 @D tricks|pg||
nt|haans: odds for flat board|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: @H right|pg||
nt|blewah: nootice the low @s played by meyers, making sure her p have entry to her hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: might suggest cashing a bunch of tricks |pg||
nt|blewah: *notice|pg||
nt|sybarra: typing same Arya,  very important |pg||
nt|bobholl: after @D K spades are guessable may be :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: yes lots of specs agree may be down two|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am sure Fred is saying "thx pard"   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 controls + @h Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: i hope 1@c alerted|pg||
nt|udo: perfect fitting hands,,,,,@S 3-3|pg||
nt|oliverc: I would think everyone here was alerted :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hA+9 would be interesting|pg||
nt|jeanhari: @D K will make guess easier|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 @H ruffs in S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@c was drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: yes, as soon as West looked for his notes everyone knew he was checking for Drury, so NS allowed them to agree it regardless of the convention card|pg||
nt|jeanhari: dbl very questionable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok Ant, so far so good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double indicates clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I get the impression the dbl was made partly for lead-direction and partly for comic value after the discussion :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe|pg||
nt|bobholl: small @D now migth beat it anyway|pg||
nt|ady: lucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont have sympathy to 2@s there, to me clear cut 2N|pg||
nt|haans: had 2@S been natural and forcing?|pg||
nt|anton72: exactly that is game but .... with 20 points this is not serious ....1 finesse and 3-3 break @h ...about 16 % chance|pg||
nt|stc: must cash @d now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|oliverc: everything|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true mf|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board I will re enter some of the play on the 3NT, then move to 12|pg||
nt|haans: thinking or no connect?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: probably Tony taking his time|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: with 11 points|pg||
nt|mcphee: those 2N jump rebids also eat up room creating little issues|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: well played|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** RUNNING SCORES **** BUFFETT CUP **** USA  93 EUR 75 ****   (First to 100 Wins)|pg||
nt|riccho:  He will finesse in @h I guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably going to watch a few pitches on spades first |pg||
nt|mamos: partly it depends on if he thinks 3NT or 4@S is the likely contract at the other table|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: Jumping to 2M = to weak to bid natural :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I can imagine that at some tables EW will be bidding minors|pg||
nt|haans: 1@d-1@S-2@d- do you have cards for 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they did it with a delay and different way, w passed, then after xx |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for non-americans Bob or Bobby are acronyms of Robert|pg||
nt|april7: I am pretty sure that they will be in 3@S in CR|pg||
nt|gmarco24: generally, it's better when you are defending, showing leads etc. but can be quite self-destructive as here was|pg||
nt|haans: ace aking with @DK as ace?|pg||
nt|stc: BIG OOPS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|murat: operator could you please send me a private message?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say allowed by both then @c9|pg||

nt|jbgood: Sælensminde is back to playing Broge's "old" system - more or less the same Broge played with Odin Svendsen i Pau this summer|pg||
nt|ady: Fantoni needs to duck diamond|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jeff's 1@d opening quite interesting, probably he has different ideas when both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: in Swedenen we bid 4NT direct = only 4 aces|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it|pg||
nt|bobholl: may make now indeed|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: luckily didnt of course :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bobby Levin, has always been known as "bobby" |pg||
nt|bernix: in OR you mean|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: found a good line to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 10 of @H's dropped |pg||
pc|h5|nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems speedy gonzales at the field, gl Russell|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: nice short auction :)|pg||
nt|udo: 5th push board in a row|pg||
nt|udo: now way to go wrong, and no way for 11|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@c pre-sacrifice, might want them to put into a doubt they miss 4@s or not|pg||
nt|bobholl: fairly lucky result NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fine result in my book|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we focus on the field, all around sharks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and to be honest, 1@h seems a good idea to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 3rd seat, passed partner, both nonvul|pg||
nt|haans: as so often no Strong Jump Shifts any more|pg||
nt|boyklas: 2Spades is invitational with 6 spades|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two hearts and a spade for defenders|pg||
nt|westjava: some one told me : nt=trf to 3@c, 3@d=trf to 3@h: to play or slam try, 4@h mild slam try @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to convince declarer|pg||
nt|haans: Fantoni played late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks boye for @d pitch|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Sorry, just too quick for me there!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Tried to catch up on the last few tricks, but I'll get the result in when they finish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +620 |pg||
nt|yusufb: zonsuz olmasý teselli|pg||

nt|tez: if duck first @s..|pg||
nt|haans: then thats out|pg||
nt|bobholl: if N has the long @C the chance for Kx is better |pg||
nt|haans: did all see how quite we were|pg||
nt|stc: ruff a @c, let j@h run|pg||
nt|bobholl: decision time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a spade would have been good for EW|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: @HQ chance play|pg||
nt|mamos: Rodwell attacking his side suit first|pg||
nt|Walddk7: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss. However, the scoreboard is americanized for obvious reasons, so we ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: must live with 1-½-0 on the scoreboard. I am sure you can figure it out regardless|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer claims after touching trump|pg||
nt|jacksond: of course helgemo/helness didnt play in Pau so Norway didnt do well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.clairebridge.com/brogelandcollage.htm   many photos there|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: @D6 exit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not for me with bad @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is Super Matchpoints|pg||
nt|april7: except if N doesn't X but bids 1 @S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|oliverc: yes, wd|pg||
nt|sybarra: given the other room,  no way she can win the bd |pg||
nt|westjava: wow, USA fly too high at other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as east no splinter was available|pg||
nt|mamos: needs to get Clubs right to keep it to one down  --  |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess @cA+ruff ---which @dtop + ruff also same given layout|pg||

nt|edmunte1: after Probst have shown DA+|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to see|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: meant no way she can lose the bd |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 9@h|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @S and @DK, it would have been pretty normal to play him fot 2722|pg||

nt|jeanhari: daclarer cant draw trumps and start on clubs, would be short of f trumps so plays clubs  right away|pg||
nt|bobholl: moment of truth|pg||
nt|april7: for some the hand is on the verge of a X but could also bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|stc: BIGGER OOPS|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: played with espen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the idea there|pg||
nt|bobholl: playing very clever to escape for 1 down|pg||

nt|bobholl: now N gets squeezed|pg||
nt|bobholl: or he just finesses @C|pg||
nt|danilo1: he could postpone guess starting with @H first |pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: tied|pg||
nt|gmarco24: decided for "safety" -2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: still cannot claim, because maybe hearts 1-1 remained|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but maybe negotiation allowed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will be squeezed|pg||

nt|haans: best play by Helgemo|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: sorry, +2|pg||

pc|c4|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: may be goes down if S has 4 @S so ?!|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzrj: board being played with Sontag as N!!!|pg||
nt|oliverc: can they stop at 3@S?|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps they are playing transfer pre-empts|pg||

nt|haans: 0GUCCI: 4h for EW  ME: right without clubs ruff|pg||
nt|stc: too good because of 8 @cs and the extra K |pg||
nt|stc: If W X now, there is an ethic problem...|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW look like they are playing xfrs over the opps t/o DBL, so 2@D is a normal raise to 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: honestly surprised to 1@s overcall, 2@s fine in many books, glad Ron Klinger did not see that overcall|pg||
nt|haans: odds for going wrong in spades|pg||
nt|westjava: heheh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't be here, instant matchpoints in USA, also wld b busy as a player and appeal committee, gl everybody|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must find @SQ|pg||

nt|funtay: slm CEngiz|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: just three red tricks to lose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean direct wjo|pg||
nt|westjava: 7 cards fir 4@D??:)|pg||
nt|rado: 1@H is transfer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a fast table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they bid and play very quick|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Zia: "hopefully not too much"|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K OR J lead puts 6@S 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: might have,  but only has Ax in spades,  last thing he wants to hear is  4 @S |pg||
nt|h_karluk: which Nunes did not follow the same route like Eric|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around, congrats to both teams|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: Yes, last board now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: restart in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Berkowitz - "She has a better takeout double than you :)"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and my homework wld b done, wow|pg||
nt|mamos: hard to show the North hand any other way|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer double instead of 3@h if it's not played as penality, the suit is just too weak for 3@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C presumably a fit-non-jump, as South is a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  this scoring is named "board a match"|pg||

nt|h_karluk: very nice organization|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: might be tempted to play this one in NT instead of spades, because of the allure of the higher score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems angels whisper to try 5@d|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt easier to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most players prefer to pick a M suit opening lead |pg||
nt|mcphee: how hard is it to find A@H lead against 3N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and Boye Brogeland, still the world's top ranked Junior|pg||

nt|ady: not a great 3NT    but it makes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C did say no game for me|pg||
nt|ady: gl|pg||
nt|h_karluk: many skilled operators and top players were there|pg||
nt|bernix: does not work out particularly well on the actual setup. 4@sx is a good save |pg||
nt|wstuart: looks like this should make exactly - east can't both pick up trumps and ruff out his @Ds.  However, if N-S aren't careful a minor suit squeeze could develop against south.|pg||

nt|edmunte1: best lead|pg||
nt|stc: note that 3NT had no play at all|pg||
nt|stc: NS preempted them selfs out, hoping ops are in a bad spot|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and 2@h cue not fit as obv seen, just stopper|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all pass expected here|pg||
nt|oliverc: Even 3@S may be too highNunes may go one more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i agree with all bids there except finall pass by Jill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a bridge book double, opener hand but 2 cards clubs, 3 wld be a bridge book double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: We are indebted to Roland Wald for such great provide|pg||
nt|anton72: brave DBL :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 NT could have been down if you have 6@C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|westjava: I play precision|pg||
nt|ady: Europe home in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: @H2 being considered|pg||
nt|h_karluk: two way @c hook there|pg||
nt|haans: only three spades do no agree with 3@S|pg||
nt|tez: 2nt minors 5/5..ozden says i have 10 card in minors..not important|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: Mackwell boys have played BAM before Sure they know |pg||
nt|mamos: it's difficult to imagine this auction at imp scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@d could be fatal|pg||
nt|haans: solid bidding|pg||
nt|mamos: North had a good hand  Im not sure shed quite expect this shape from South   but game reached :)|pg||
nt|ady: so far|pg||
nt|haans: question is could N pass 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: AJtx|pg||
nt|jbgood: club shift?|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it is needed - 3@h will go down 1 on any defense (but one)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wasn't Norway's decision, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected twelve players from different countries of Europe|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed Oliver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think wld bring +660 for NS|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's makeable|pg||

nt|isp: -6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: oh Lisa there|pg||
nt|ady: only needed to share the hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: bye!|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´ve read that in USA they played this in the 60s a lot. They stopped it, because the winner of the events were always the same!|pg||
nt|bobholl: good play|pg||
nt|haans: tricky|pg||
nt|haans: 8 tricks |pg||
nt|bernix: as cards lie he cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|anton72: i guess new 7 imps coming for South Zone |pg||
nt|anton72: how I know players from other room ...they will play 4 @s with DBL|pg||
nt|anton72: let see|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: well done got to the right spot|pg||

nt|haans: shevek: Helgemo plays in 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: Helgemo Helness have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @C too even luckyer|pg||
nt|bernix: after trump lead west will  make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: rare to find a save on just 5-3|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: örneðin doðu-batý konuþmasalardý (öyle elleri olsaydý), bu zon bulunamayacaktý|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|blewah: 1 down 2 to go for guessing A/Q|pg||
nt|sybarra: S totally quiet with 3 aces may not be easy to see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks all around|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: After this board is finished I will load up 1 again and enter some of the play |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @c Q hook marked|pg||
nt|haans: but does not know that|pg||
nt|bernix: best is @d6. declarer has to make a crucial discard|pg||
nt|haans: right :)|pg||
nt|stc: @h now|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: if he could pass 4@D  I am sure he would not on that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: my guess is that would be the normal opening lead to gambling 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: short spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems straightforward eleven tricks|pg||
nt|ady: meyers mad a tight 1NT hand 16|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bernix: what's the point in ruffing a @d? i dont see it|pg||
nt|haans: decl hate to have to guess|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcphee: then the @C swithc is obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you lose when K onside and p has Q, just give up a trick|pg||
nt|jbgood: now 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: hand 17  the 460 looking good to maybe win the match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we are 6 tables all days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hook obv|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: güneyde tekrar konuþacak el yok|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: falcons vs pigeons, let's see which wing would rise the trophy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 1N, 2@d dislike|pg||
nt|edmunte1: still worth only 1IMP|pg||
nt|bernix: but is in the confortable position that he cannot misguess|pg||
nt|haans: Objection: lalislol: @D6 tells decl where all the cards are|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: but could he he did not have cards to slam|pg||
nt|mamos: she|pg||
nt|haans: Well done all day Ant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: This board will not be scored at this board :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: I will open 3N against you more often then:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant long minor|pg||
nt|westjava: fault no.1|pg||
nt|bobholl: 12 tricks on a double squeeze (rodwell found it) but in @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4 @H made now|pg||
nt|haans: Most point out that @CT was what made this deal|pg||
pc|s2|nt|westjava: for gambling 3nt, I lead a gambling honour at other (M) suit|pg||
nt|jacksond: 2NT in other romm was a grwat result for europe and was  likely to win board anyway.|pg||
nt|kastan88: B-A-M sounds as former known Soviet trans-Siberian BAM (Baical-Amur magistral)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be that is reason to stop BAm counting|pg||
nt|riccho:  Bd 5 is a next-to-sure winner for europe (my prediction ary lousy... :))|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead stops 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The europeans seem to have a stanglehold on this match  needing just half from the last two boards|pg||
nt|bobholl: and the good 3@S will bring them at least a 1/2|pg||
nt|bobholl: ouder als mijn dochter (1975)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: That was the last board, thanks all. We restart in 25 mins.|pg||

nt|wstuart: 4@S and 3NT look like normal contracts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 23/17 and this time hard layout, could be a bloody one|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Great result for Bulgaria in OR|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1NT by South ?|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|jan_jansma: Will East get his @S in in time?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: probably|pg||
nt|haans: same here im sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: sure didn't :)|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H had been hard to beat if played by West|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s looks cold here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a small chance of getting too high|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|rado: E will expect better suit for 2nd pos preempt vuln|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D good save NS|pg||
nt|haans: yep 100 of 100 times|pg||
mb|1D|an|!H's|nt|mamos: or something similar but conventional|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: no, he will be on lead himself|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: if they get to 3NT|pg||
nt|stc: I expect pass and XX from N|pg||
nt|bobholl: very risky system if you have to open 1nt V versus NV :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: wasnt much to say say on that hand |pg||
nt|bernix: i must say i would not have bid 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: vul dare not bid more|pg||
nt|bobholl: but @C will save them|pg||
nt|stc: sure, not a good slam|pg||
nt|anton72: good bid by Nanev|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oliverc: looks ok|pg||
nt|haans: Here's a link http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php if you feel like browsing through the past presentations. |pg||
nt|sybarra: Ant  are these the bds we missed? or live action? |pg||
nt|haans: i do not like it but I would|pg||
nt|wstuart: Though they have a 4-4 @S fit, many north's will not bid Stayman with 4333 pattern.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: play is not that easy|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this is that kind of board when you don't have to lead your partner's suit :)|pg||
nt|haans: save may cost to much|pg||
nt|haans: best to have East  as leader|pg||
nt|bobholl: diminished @H Q|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North? |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: small @D now and it's easy|pg||
nt|ady: thin game    but hackets are aggressive|pg||
nt|mamos: 170 looks a good EW score|pg||
nt|mamos: 4 losers?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 2NT maybe positive with @C? (or any bal positive)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: I think the latter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: One missed board entered|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Probst going for the money due to vulnerability|pg||
nt|bobholl: he thinks :)|pg||
nt|haans: pass or xx as support|pg||
nt|danilo1: but I would jump to 4@S with 5 ... especially after 2@H Dble|pg||
nt|bobholl: i didn't mean this way but works equally well|pg||
nt|stc: 2Nt for minors ?|pg||
nt|anton72: new ...200 or 300 coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North has a bit in reserve but wisely passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: fasten your seat belt pls!|pg||
nt|haans: Who can understand Radisics bidding?|pg||
nt|stc: no, 3@c for @cs|pg||
nt|bobholl: we don't know their agreement for pass :)|pg||
nt|stc: if need K finesse any many extras|pg||
nt|stc: trumps 3-2, @c friendly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably 4@S was "fast-arrival"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: poor game   needs to avoid anymajor suit losers and bring in the 4th diamond to discard a spade|pg||
nt|mamos: right i see yep sorry   lots of work to do|pg||
nt|ady: OR  got no higher   should be all square|pg||
nt|jbgood: can even affort 2 club losers and still win the board|pg||
nt|jacksond: perhaps jill should have raised hearts as north with her good shape|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2nt 16-18 here|pg||
nt|april7: a very light opener,but only a NT game |pg||
nt|bobholl: bit weak for a reverse but what else|pg||
nt|boyklas: me too, i havent got any other good option, and the 2D is too little for this hand|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 4@s oluyor ama nasýl bulunacak|pg||
nt|atalok: anlaþamýyarak tabikii|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: he he|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bizim gibi yani|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt 3nt olabilir|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: neden transfer etmedi|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: acaba transfer konvansiyonunun doðrusu bu mu|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: herhalde bir anlaþmalarý vardýr|pg||
nt|atalok: 5 d belki|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: evet|pg||
pc|c2|nt|westjava: Europe on fire, that's all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: back to real time now|pg||
nt|westjava: ok Ant|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll enter the other's bidding and play when I can|pg||
nt|westjava: good,saving you time Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: dbl is 4M 5m i suppose|pg||
nt|edmunte1: wow|pg||
nt|haans: cluibs 3-3 make it|pg||
nt|haans: but look out for spade lead|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H 1 down|pg||
nt|stc: note tha 3NT have some chances on a @s lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jan_jansma: blackwood for @C here, I think|pg||
nt|blewah: so Auken probably "cheated" to her p|pg||
nt|westjava: after pass, just balancing I think|pg||
nt|blewah: but see von Arnim didn't take the joke|pg||
nt|bobholl: knows ?! position of @H T now|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt oynarlar bence|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: ama daha @s i yeni buldular|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @d yu ne zaman bulacaklar|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: easy 7 tricks but?|pg||
nt|oliverc: difficult to go wrong now|pg||
nt|westjava: I bid pass with that hand, forever|pg||
nt|haans: openings go down and down|pg||
nt|gmarco24: his partner obviously not  :)|pg||
nt|haans: looks like Altman can|pg||
nt|tez: why not 2@d before|pg||
nt|stc: most of the time is weak or business|pg||
nt|atalok: bence 5 li sp davet etti oda pas dedi|pg||
nt|funtay: yer acildiðinda Haldun:)|pg||
nt|yusufb: evet 5li @s davetti konuþmalarý|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins,Running Scores,the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have taken the plunge|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers's bidding shows 5 hearts, but not a good suit. Levin showed 4@Ss|pg||
nt|april7: everything works fine for declarer making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 1@d= 11-20, 3+@d|pg||
nt|stc: 1 IMP for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H lead in other room :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes but 3@h only invitational+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Janko Katerbau|pg||
nt|motu: hi janko|pg||
nt|motu: nice to have you on my side|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, a tie and a loss. |pg||
nt|haans: trumf queen again|pg||
pc|h2|nt|edmunte1: i agree with 2@h, lots of controls and most of points in suits|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@S and a @H lead ?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: declarer will test @s, then @h|pg||
nt|haans: you know that one opps did say I like the lead of ...|pg||
nt|danilo1: however, looks like great guess by brothers ... 4@S is probably -1 (to -2)|pg||
nt|bobholl: the silly ?! double migth let 4 make|pg||
nt|anton72: A here made contract|pg||
nt|anton72: = 13 imps back for CONTRA|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so 4@s = non rock-bottom minimum|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: this may prove too expensive|pg||
nt|h_karluk: namaskar ravi dost, zia and hamman vs duboin, sementa in this room:) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps i m sorry slipped|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Very well done by NS|pg||
nt|haans: spade 9 in right place|pg||
nt|edmunte1: or no :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but that would depend on what 3@D meant - whether it was GF or a high-card raise to 3@s. |pg||
nt|vahaboglu: herhalde öyledir|pg||
nt|motu: this contract has no play...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|diumraid: ******  LIVE IN RUNNING ****** BUFFETT CUP ******   USA  38 -  EUR 22  ******  Last Round of the Day.  Teams tomorrow with another 72 points at stake. ******|pg||
nt|haans: still the Hackett did good|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Jill x 2 was bad at this board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: back and forth|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guessed rigth :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not|pg||
nt|wstuart: Winning the @DA and playing a high @C, ducked by declarer, then reverting to @Hs would have been more attractive to me as east.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: yep Helness did well here|pg||
nt|westjava: she saved by 3@D:)|pg||
nt|tez: for real man enough 4 card @d|pg||
nt|gmarco24: i guess NegX promises 4@h|pg||
nt|tez: for support|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sontag|pg||
nt|rado: E did well to blast to 5 level even little hope to make 5@c |pg||
nt|motu: i guess 7 trinks will be the limit|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C split complicates matters|pg||
nt|mcphee: reducing a table entry to just 1|pg||
nt|stc: unlucky lead, very unlucky|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzrj: discards = att|pg||
nt|sybarra: may misguess this hand,  the balance is on a real piece of cheese |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|oliverc: Berkowitx opts for a passive exit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: born eight and a half years before I was born (1954 end), i am glad to catch his articles, books, cool|pg||
nt|oliverc: rather than risking opening up a round suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he was born in 1946|pg||
nt|anton72: now routine play for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike that @d2 pitch|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty Ant|pg||
nt|haans: as we can all see spade lead had been a killer|pg||

nt|rado: rarely may see nice action to 5minor when 3NT is bad after 2@C wd|pg||
nt|westjava: :)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: OR the spade return|pg||
nt|haans: right play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcphee: the @S switch is coming soon:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, defence would like to set up BOTH their diamonds and spades, but they dont have the luxury of enough time :)|pg||
nt|haans: sad isnt it :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: looking like +1 only now|pg||
nt|oliverc: North cannot be endplayed to lead a @C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could berkowitz visualize it|pg||
nt|oliverc: no chance North will do that now, since South cannot have the A@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Berkowitz_(bridge)|pg||
nt|oliverc: or Fantoni would not have his Opening|pg||
nt|diumraid: ***** BUFFETT CUP LIVE ***** IN RUNNING SCORING *****  USA 26  EUR 22  ****** We are in Round 4 of 5 for today.  |pg||
nt|skaftij:  most play as high-card raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyway, contract fairly impregnable|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|westjava: yeah|pg||
nt|sybarra: pice of cheese=lousy hand |pg||
nt|danilo1: he should play well and make 3 ... now @H  as first endplay ... than @D enplay ... no need to play @C alone|pg||
nt|anton72: good job for CONTRA|pg||
nt|bobholl: compensation coming|pg||
nt|wstuart: West will have to have an entry in @S or @D else decl has 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: Sontag has already shown up with the AJ@D and a top @H, so cannot have anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: else|pg||
nt|april7: W plays it very safe now,so only 9 tricks or now 10|pg||

pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: i have big expectations from Brogeland, is already making his mark in Open bridge. Played in the Norwegian team which qualified for the Bermuda Bowl and took 3rd place. He has won ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: both the Norwegian championships and was in the Norwegian team which won the Nordic championships. Congrats|pg||
nt|edmunte1: after Zoric's strange play|pg||
nt|haans: a deal to reflect upon|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mamos: @C looks likely to outscore NT unless declarer can come to eight tricks somehow|pg||
nt|haans: clubs still hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Jas thinking|pg||
nt|haans: time to get boring Janson|pg||
nt|haans: Jason :(|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: with a sure @D entry, what on earth can he be thinking about besides a further @S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: yesa Jason must continue Spades and not switch to Diamonds giving Declarer eighth trick|pg||
nt|haans: good question :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: toyed with @S8 several times but still thinking|pg||

nt|april7: 11 again|pg||
pc|d6|nt|oliverc: Need something to break the deadlock here :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still retains control no matter loses to 10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders need 3 morra tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: @D now?|pg||
nt|mcphee: Q@S now creates a problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: i do not think they can afford to break @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: should touch @s9 ?|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @h lead is not anormal as long as @d lead for partner has few chances to win, knowing that partner doesn't have too many  points|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|h_karluk: all information i posted emailed by Roland Waldd, we are indebted for such valuable support, great work, very nice.|pg||

nt|wstuart: I think NS have to play a trump before the @DA is knocked out now to beat it.  Then, they can put south in with a @C to lead a 2nd trump before decl can ruff 2@Ds.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: defence seem likely to cash six tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: Zia might do best to pass this   but trf looks normal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Bob would double if he had one club short and one spade more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile let's not forget Zia fans ; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O37j3G2SwgU   :)|pg||
nt|haans: preemtive raise cost this time|pg||
nt|ady: this should be overboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 4th, 2nd from bad. Right side up on trick 1, then upside down after|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin asks about the 1@C - shows 4 unless 17/18 4333|pg||
nt|mcphee: or natural:)|pg||
nt|haans: have not bid 2@C on that for many many years|pg||
nt|danilo1: West want to wait the lead |pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @D lead ?|pg||
nt|anton72: some missunderstanding here|pg||
nt|anton72: points is not importanr for this pair :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|stc: But, as we know nobody plays minors anymore :(|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: this would give him a better chance to play 2@h or 2@d|pg||
nt|oliverc: You will almost never see players at this level look for a  Major fit with 4333 shape|pg||
nt|haans: west hand 1 trick in 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure Levin's decision|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: not clear at all how o play this|pg||
nt|haans: bidding = but we may be lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 3Nt should be a fast -2|pg||
nt|diumraid: ******  LIVE IN RUNNING ****** BUFFETT CUP ******   USA  38 -  EUR 22  ******  Last Round of the Day.  Teams tomorrow with another 72 points at stake. ******|pg||
nt|oliverc: looks like -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helgemo: Nicer in spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Helness laughs :)|pg||
nt|ady: flat 17   nice tops   but needs good clubs to have a decent play|pg||
nt|haans: slam a hearts finesse away|pg||
nt|haans: yep 1 spade trick then|pg||
nt|danilo1: on @D lead, tempo for @S trick(s)|pg||
nt|bobholl: they expect a @H lead so :)|pg||
nt|anton72: but not now|pg||
nt|bobholl: he doesn't but isn't his partner limitred to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: limited|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp back or no....doesent matter ...20-10 for BMP|pg||
nt|anton72: is he is|pg||
nt|anton72: I just make some guessings|pg||
nt|anton72: what to play ...they decide at table|pg||
nt|twcho: rehi|pg||
nt|bobholl: after @S lead being in 4@H won't make 6|pg||
nt|xenya: correct|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely even Roland would not want to be in a slam here|pg||
nt|motu: nasty @S break|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: against three NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: unless this brogeland is a son of Boye Brogeland|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice double|pg||
nt|westjava: 2@S, forcing and 4 cards support|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: The slam score was wrong- +1 is correct, sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: impressed that n/s got to game,  slow start |pg||
nt|anton72: new DBL for 1 down :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but look at the breaks - spades 3-3, clubs 3-3 with the king onside|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seeing all 13, he would|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sure I would, it's a terrible slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I just said that in the other room|pg||
nt|petepunt: neede a @S switch|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think it's cold now if decl gets the trumps right|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: @D, @H, 2 @C and a @S|pg||
nt|ady: major suit switch will leave declarer short   and that is certain to come|pg||
nt|mamos: or more if this @DK wins|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers considers @D10|pg||
nt|h_karluk: since 2 boards a tad aggressive approach to cards|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose this 4N was to play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's|pg||
nt|westjava: switch to @C now|pg||
nt|westjava: or never:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she would enjoy to @c switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just low towards hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I think this may be a long think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: musing|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C switch would not be welcome at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin as gone for a comfort break, a kibitzer sits in|pg||
nt|jbgood: good communication E-W to win another board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: significant double|pg||
nt|rado: E might have 1-2 hcp only, so declarer  has a chanse|pg||
nt|haans: lot of thinking :)|pg||
nt|anton72: some spectacors said poss -2 ...yes that is correct ...but with current lead|pg||
nt|anton72: let see the lead ...not easy realy|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: Kuzey bu sefer de @h den davet etti herhalde|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/DM1COpeningBid.html  Defense Methods Against 1 Club Opening Bids|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 2@d=GF relay|pg||
nt|tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@d no 4 majors|pg||
nt|haans: Good advice: Tez: they are playing artificial system now..pls dont try at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: Turkey did bid the Grand on board 5|pg||
nt|bobholl: loss not great :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: say 1N received than 1N (16-18) after reasonable range in competition and not against the odds |pg||
nt|jan_jansma: oops|pg||
nt|westjava: means thar score now is 3-1, Ant?|pg||
nt|westjava: *that|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: no, score is now entered, 2.5-4.5 is correct|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I'll re-enter the play before the next board|pg||
nt|edmunte1: just a simple matter of probabilities|pg||
nt|april7: if @S is led after ace of @H N must set up the @C suit to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: why ? A@d, @h finess, discard 2@s on @ds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if they bid and make it against you - it's not your day |pg||
nt|funtay: 7nolu elde öbür oda 3ntye gelip 1 batinca 6 verdik|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: yes we have all seen better opening bids|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west also contributed well, cool x |pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h invitational, 5@h... hmmm, that's not it  :)|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mamos: her first thoughts were best :)|pg||
nt|westjava: bingo!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now : 7 @d in bag, 2@c also|pg||
nt|mcphee: the good news is Sementa has a second @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so th tenth either spades or hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no transportation problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have 4 tricks Hamdi|pg||
nt|gmarco24: let's try this one|pg||
nt|skaftij:  of course you spotted the slam Roland |pg||
pc|s7|nt|edmunte1: 4@h still a bridge too far|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: natural lead i think 1 p for each pair|pg||
nt|xenya: @H finesse is not safe in 4|pg||
nt|anton72: think here is not a bridge school|pg||
nt|anton72: :)|pg||
nt|anton72: in 4 yes ...but if u play 6 ?.....|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzrj: Levin: "what's 1@S-3@D" - answer: "inv"|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in hearts for 3 hearts|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: Nunes scratching his head now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: certainly in thought :)|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: clearly he was hoping his @S were running|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: so South did well to win the first @S|pg||
nt|haans: artificial systems is like marriage  you must stay with you long time partner|pg||
nt|petepunt: still has to time play well|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mamos: my Gran would have approved of that lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *edit: then|pg||
nt|westjava: lovely @H4|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, @H lead best for defense (saves overtrick)|pg||
nt|anton72: think he have to play trumps imideatly after lead ...but he afraid from 4-2 break|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: bu sekansta Kuzeyde iyi el olmalý 15+HCP|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: also Bob Hamman fans, i have the chance to watch their play here in USA,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeIw1XMZfeU   :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Now will take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Rich, welcome aboard, nice to see you joined us|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Bob, they will get their winners to set it|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 bridges :)|pg||
nt|gmarco24: 2@h=relay, 2@s=5@c, 3@c fit and RKC, 3NT=2+Q@c and probably spiral scan after it|pg||
nt|haans: spiral scan is Bid suit you do not have control in|pg||
nt|wstuart: yes|pg||
nt|funtay: Nafiz abi @sye transfer edip 3nt demiþ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: off one|pg||
nt|westjava: and contract is 4nt:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we all see|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Levin is back, and North/South send out a kibitzer for some diet cokes|pg||
nt|haans: will end with @D finesse|pg||
nt|april7: two ways, either ruffing finesse in @D or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|haans: yep can try clubs first|pg||
nt|stc: a match of missed oportunities|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit: 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: before winning @SA Meyers checked 1@S showed 5|pg||
nt|gmarco24: not really, there are different ways|pg||
nt|anton72: How many teams we have operator ?.......|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 2NT dese belki kabul etmezmiþ diðeri|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kiwi_joker: my Gran is only in 2NT on the EW cards tho :)|pg||
nt|mamos: defence does best to get ruff now because otherwise declarer can cash two clubs discarding Hearts|pg||
nt|haans: yes often scan by steps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: push board|pg||
nt|xenya: we were talking about 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  We have seen worse than that :-)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: spade needed|pg||
nt|haans: bright defense needed|pg||
nt|mamos: South would have made this hand much easier if she had allowed @DK to win|pg||
nt|haans: kib: NicJans: do you like this result of the bidding Me dont know yet 50% slam|pg||
nt|gmarco24: friendly lead, +1 now|pg||
nt|anton72: with this result i think we will look Quantum 3 more rounds here until knockouts|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: agree|pg||

nt|westjava: *Duboin|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 4 or 5@D?|pg||
nt|jan_jansma: 5 I think|pg||
nt|haans: every time you ask you will allsways be told "random deals "|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt off one, whatever|pg||
nt|sybarra: a precision 2 @C  |pg||
nt|sybarra: 6+ clubs |pg||
nt|blewah: 2@c 6+ 10-15 usually no 4M|pg||
nt|westjava: Arnim-Auken system, looks like close to precision I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I was only using precision as a generic description of the 2 @C bid|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: yalnýz 1@c açýþlarý özelse ayrý|pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||

mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||

nt|westjava: back to the Italy at '70 era, arya?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: that 4@D looks costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||

nt|westjava: Roman and Neapolitan, a wonderful nostalgic...|pg||
nt|haans: i rather pass as soon as possible|pg||
nt|april7: to high already on !G leads!!!|pg||
nt|april7: @H leads|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 7 tricks the limit here for NS|pg||
nt|haans: urkk|pg||

nt|haans: in 2/1 time a bid that aint forcing?|pg||

nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
nt|haans: Good make me get for @HT|pg||
nt|bernix: failure due to lack of aces|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
nt|haans: clubs finesse win or lose the board :)|pg||
nt|ady: lot of trumps coming now|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||

nt|gmarco24: "i have clubs"?  :)|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: medically referred to as "desynchronosis," is a physiological condition which is a consequence of alterations to circadian rhythms.|pg||
nt|westjava: did you open 1nt or 1 @H, Bob?|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  Jet lag results from rapid long-distance transmeridian (east-west or west-east) travel, as on a jet plane.|pg||
nt|mcphee: i open those hands 1N|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|westjava: 5332,right?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the bidding is easier when you open 1N|pg||

nt|jan_go:  4@H down 1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: a declarer missplay on board 5 provided Romania 10 more IMP's|pg||
nt|wstuart: they will likely have an uncontested auction as well.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: I think last hand of the session?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in weak NT maybe 5 cards junk major suit|pg||
nt|blewah: 1 point for that board was not fair she shuld be rewarded for her play too|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember 1 @H could be 4 card|pg||
nt|edmunte1: offshape 1nt by Probst|pg||
nt|haans: Many get violent if you open 1nt with 2-5-4-2 but have my choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: handle with care , use it in your own risk|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|westjava: sure|pg||

nt|april7: to strong for 1NT, E's hand!!|pg||
nt|tez: no slam here?|pg||
nt|haans: prefer 5@C to 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Big opportunity for QUANTUM here. 4@S is close to making and 4@H should have been beat|pg||
nt|bucheister: 800 is correct |pg||
nt|wstuart: but with that little playing strength, there isn't a lot going for you at equal vul.|pg||
nt|petepunt: takes away a few relay bids|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: inverted herhalde|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt 3nt|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jan_jansma: 3NT never quiet at BAM :)|pg||
nt|westjava: Levin think about 5@C...|pg||
nt|haans: well if you see it as 18 point taken|pg||
nt|haans: not even gards for game|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@D-2@C-P-P- ... and Fight starst with Dble|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Do they change pair to compare with?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: that's a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|mamos: No Haans I thin they compare throughout with same opponent|pg||
nt|bernix: rare but not unusual. rather normal|pg||
nt|haans: to pass nowdays is not normal :)|pg||
nt|bernix: he cant refrain from balancing now|pg||
nt|april7: but there are limits!!!|pg||
nt|bernix: i tell you i would have passed whenever it was my turn|pg||
nt|haans: fighting for nothing|pg||
nt|bernix: will go down in 2@h instead of collecting +50 in 1nt|pg||
nt|april7: 1 or 2 down in 2@H, depends on declarer- or defence play|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S+!@H+2@D|pg||
nt|gmarco24: easy to set this|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C normal 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: Boca Raton Florida players lucky, this year i was busy a lot, hope in 2011 will visit there to see some familiar faces, including Larry Mori, SC-FL not much distance|pg||
nt|westjava: aha:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: NS play upside-down count|pg||

nt|westjava: ty Ant|pg||
nt|blewah: or 3nt?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can't make 4@H on best defence|pg||
nt|skaftij:  no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: routine 3NT|pg||
nt|mamos: no we started at 15   so although session length has been changed 14  we have two to play after thisboards to 12 |pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: 12 boards a session|pg||
nt|haans: 10 board should be 14|pg||
nt|mdgraham: spade lead, club switch|pg||
nt|isp: but 4@s?|pg||
nt|wstuart: The strength of @C systems is mostly when they don't open 1@C.  Many people get afraid when the opps open a strong @C, thinking they will automatically get some terrible result if ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: they don't interfere.|pg||
nt|petepunt: overcall brushed aside :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: That's really not true.  It's most important to just accurately describe your offensive potential to your pard so when you can successfully compete, you know it.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mamos: declarer's hand is a little lacking ................:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 2@h and x as passed hands|pg||
nt|jbgood: Broge has a problem - will he go for the @d game (or slam)? or NT?|pg||
nt|jacksond: disadvange of the splinter is that it allowed north to indicate a lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes right :)|pg||
nt|diumraid: **** LIVE IN RUNNING - BUFFET CUP - USA  64  EUR  56  ****|pg||

nt|reisig: I live in the same area|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i know|pg||
nt|jbgood: the former - it is only 420 against the overtrick for 430 in NT|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1nt  3nt MIGHT HAVE GOT A HEART LEAD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the good old days Texas Aces were using a similar bid, Goldman's 3@h/3@s after NT described a mild slam interest in @c/@d, but with different shape |pg||
nt|jbgood: not to mention the bigger score for the @d slam bid and made in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 35 minutes, is Romania 1 vs Greece|pg||

nt|mcphee: she can see future exit issues|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Meyers asks about Sementa's possible @D holdings - answer: 4+|pg||

mb|6C|nt|haans: bid loss for Croatia|pg||

nt|haans: presume a 1@H  had not shown good hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzuw: ara vardý kusura bakmayýn|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 5.5 to 4.5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last board|pg||
nt|blewah: this is a 12 bd match so the team with at least 6.5 wins |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: that was a novel bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22/18 again dangerous sea|pg||
nt|westjava: and you also smile of course,Ant:)|pg||
nt|haans: cards wrong for NS|pg||
nt|haans: will east try 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: what would you bid?|pg||
nt|haans: question 1nt of more|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Match is getting closer ... 7 more IMPs for Romania when Israel did not bid 3NT on Bd 8 ... and more to expected in Bd 10 (previous)|pg||
nt|haans: how many would have bid now?|pg||
nt|haans: me no|pg||
nt|petepunt: north tempted to @D :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: X|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|haans: bidding as in OR|pg||
nt|haans: almost a slam but ...|pg||
nt|gmarco24: slamish again|pg||
nt|wstuart: He could conceivably go down a trick.|pg||
nt|petepunt: most likely will|pg||
nt|atalok: 800 guzel skor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: iyi skor geldi|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks all around mates, special thanks to Roland and Russell|pg||
nt|ady: still only 10 tricks  I think needed to play low heart early for a chance of an 11th|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT ?|pg||
nt|mamos: -1?|pg||
nt|danilo1: Rdble wass strong, and aditional 3@C very strong ... surprised by Israel's pass|pg||
mb|2C|nt|diumraid: **** BUFFETT CUP IN RUNNING Currently USA 60  EUR 48**** - Last set for today in progress|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this may end with 6@d|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Roussev won't reopen|pg||
nt|edmunte1: @CK is just too bad|pg||
nt|haans: reopne have my vote|pg||
nt|haans: 3 boards 30 min they will make it|pg||
nt|edmunte1: in the meantime, Greece bid and made slam on board 6|pg||
nt|haans: When obbs have cards to bid You may not have cards for slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Another very good result for QUANTUM|pg||
nt|atalok: anca zor bir 6 karo geçer|pg||
nt|yusufb: dense bile 3 veririz ama denmezse 9 alýrýz bence zor derler|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: This is the last board of the set - play continues throughout today and the next three days   fantastic chance to watch the best palyers from both sides of the pond|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|edmunte1: with @ck in @d agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: this gets them to 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: best to bid aftre opps 2@S|pg||
nt|yusufb: yada inþallah demezler:)|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: 2@c e çakarsa 12 löve var|pg||
nt|hedyg: live izmir http://www.ustream.tv/channel/champions-cup-2010|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: not easy to avoid game|pg||
nt|mcphee: as would even a weak raise I suspect|pg||
nt|mcphee: this one can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Auken asks what dbl of 2@D is|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I didn't hear the answer - the other finished tables are walking through|pg||
nt|blewah: for blood, i think|pg||
nt|westjava: 5 hcp and over call, South hand!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's better to support to 2@H when you have a hand with just one bid|pg||
nt|jan_go:  1@S is?|pg||
nt|motu: dont ask me|pg||
nt|motu: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: meyers will need to guess well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Sementa-Duboin would like to play there|pg||
nt|jacksond: maybe JILL should have waited to double 2c|pg||
nt|haans: but @HK of value|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Any views?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the 2@h bid helped in the other room - no assurance of heart support here|pg||
nt|atalok: oyunu kolay deklerasyonu zor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: demek zor|pg||
nt|yusufb: deklerasyonu baya zor|pg||
nt|yusufb: @d bile bulmalarý zor|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: daha herhangi bir koz bulunmuþ bile deðil|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwi_joker: will make a lot on this lead ... @DQ lead of course works better|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT but not more|pg||
nt|april7: don't lead @H!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s= 3+|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW play Swiss acol, i.e. 5 card @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bernix: he wont, east opened 1@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt has only chances in S|pg||
nt|wstuart: double dummy I think you can make 4@H, and maybe even would after the DBL steers you in the right direction,.|pg||
nt|atalok: biz oynasaydýk ne derdiniz kontura?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless +2 Europe lost|pg||
nt|stc: I am informed that 2@h/3@d are art and showing points and shape|pg||
nt|h_karluk: modified precision, i bet at least 50 pages|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: W showing 5/4+ in minors with short S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2254 another story|pg||
nt|danilo1: pass by North now also on limit ... has some additions to 8 Hcp |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, there is now, but it may not be primary support|pg||
nt|isp: pass earning a lt of imps here|pg||
nt|atalok: bbunlar kuvvetli cl oynuyorlar o ayrý|pg||
nt|isp: @c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|westjava: yup, give 2@S and double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|tez: back..i m here now|pg||
nt|haans: Obbs tend to bid with your needed cards|pg||
nt|skaftij:  agree, support with weak hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|edmunte1: but Kx in @c is just a too big negative feature|pg||
nt|edmunte1: if we're going to fight for the part score, at least we should have some chances to make it|pg||
nt|haans: one more board Balkan has done well |pg||
nt|tez: @s's are block|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly in a 5-card major system|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 card 1@d and 1@H|pg||
nt|motu: you have some communication problems in this hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oliverc: this looks like a gamble that will not pay off|pg||
nt|oliverc: -2 is too many|pg||
nt|oliverc: but -1 might have been a good result|pg||
nt|oliverc: if 2@S was making|pg||
nt|oliverc: not sure it was, though|pg||
nt|oliverc: EW look to have 6 tricks against 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: He might have opened 2NT (or 2@c - intending 2NT next)|pg||
nt|mamos: 6 tables Hans   do you expect them all to bid game?|pg||
nt|ady: even on a non heart lead  should go down|pg||
nt|mamos: so not dead   ....yet|pg||
nt|ady: 26 hcp   not likely any would stop short of game|pg||
nt|mamos: i agree  ady|pg||
nt|mcphee: she has not so far:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: if Saelensmin was indicating the other two suits|pg||
nt|atalok: 3 d?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Zia supposed to know the fact : groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: HH did played Mini-Multi before|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: I believe in this comp all Euro pairs are playing same system|pg||
nt|bobholl: now only guess @H :)|pg||
nt|haans: unblocking|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@s derdim|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: olabilir|pg||
nt|atalok: 9 imp aldýkk|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|blewah: if rdbl was good hand with no fit, dbl by Levin is penalty, but S with that shape and hcp ran, IMHO|pg||
nt|westjava: agree arya|pg||
nt|tez: if duck he is at home:)|pg||
nt|haans: and blocked :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Possibly, u may still get to spades|pg||
nt|isp: at least -2  , but... may try for more|pg||
nt|hedyg: could start with @D and finesse @H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stc: also informed that Meck ducked the @s allowing 6@h !! to make|pg||
nt|haans: one more clubs and home it gets|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i prefer 2nt with Agge hand over the second double|pg||
nt|wstuart: -3 seems about right.|pg||
nt|petepunt: if he can reduce his trumps in 4@H, maybe,  but very unclear.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Yes, definitely 4@H wouldn't be a claimer.  :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: North and East had their bids but west and S a little light:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a different bidding S would lead @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d-3NT for instance|pg||
nt|jan_go:  all ways should lead to at least 9 tricks cuz of the 33@H split |pg||
nt|hedyg: Gromöller trying for 3-3 @ss and A@C in N?|pg||
nt|motu: well but he will make it anyway even if he missguess @C @H 3-3 with K onside will save the day...|pg||
nt|jan_go:  with finessing @Hk|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: thanks to op   fellow commentataors|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays a spade early after coming to hand with a diamond defence might just go wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let's see Jill Levin's way |pg||
nt|jacksond: Even a slam isnt as good as 2CX . i dont think EW would take one trick|pg||
nt|tez: @s now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: u know owl see better in dark :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: might have played hearts first to get some information on the count; would have found N long in both majors and made the diamond guess a little easier; but he got it right ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: anyway;good job|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Can you make 10 tricks on a trump lead?|pg||
