nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Ed Shapiro and Henry Bethe, USA. I am Roland Wald from England/Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Simon Cochemé|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Henry, Roland and specs!|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We'll get the scores after 2 segments in the other matches shortly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Standings before this round: 1. Rosen 101 VP - 2. Teltscher 93 - 3. Crouch 88 - 4. Hackett 75 - 5. Hinden 65 - 6. de Botton 63 - 7. Small 53 - 8. Senior 50|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Players drifting in ... deciding who is seating|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks like N_S's hand for a partial in spades or conceivably 3N by North|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N would not make on a @d lead but can be made on a @h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ready and raring to go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with 18-20, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: They're off!|pg||
nt|othered1: If east opens, NS will play partial, I'd guess.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: I would bid 2NT as North|pg||
nt|henryb:  to make 3N from the N side after a @h lead, N has to guess to play a club to the Q first, then knock out the @sA and take the @d finesse when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner overcalled vul against not, so this hand is surely worth 2NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: But not for Small|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed, and the devil take the @d: no one has bid them yet|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: 2@H raise didn't help north at all, and maybe 2N isn't natural, as many play it to distinguish between spot bids and forward-gooing actions|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Rosen have a ruling pending and may get 5 imps|pg||

nt|othered1: I have a bid for the north hand, a cue-bid double.  Says I would have cue-bid if they hadn't raised.  Gives up on responsive double in this position, but shows a lot of plusses.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  And it leaves 2N as a natural action? or do you play that as minors?|pg||
nt|othered1: No, as natural.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sounds like a playable method|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Until you get both minors and like to compete|pg||
nt|othered1: with more and more players opening on true junk and raising on next to nothing, I need a value bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now I play X responsive, 2N natural and 3@h as forward going in @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So do I|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|rmb1: In OR, West responded 2@C which was not necessarily clubs and East got excited|pg||

mb|2H|nt|garnetts: 2nt natural?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: probably not natural  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: I guess 2@C is one of "@C or balanced GF"  OR "@C GF or 3 card @S raise"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, you have to guess in 4@S after 3 rounds of diamonds, but you have no choice really, must ruff with the 10|pg||
mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|henryb:  It suggests that 2@c was artificial and that they started a relay seqqquence|pg||

nt|henryb:  that @d7 is a very good card|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: yes, I was thinking of a heart to the ace and @DJ back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then @D7 is vital|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Specs rightly point out that you just duck after @DJ back|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then Q432 will do it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with 109 in dummy|pg||
