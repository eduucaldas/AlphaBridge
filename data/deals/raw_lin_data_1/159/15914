nt|sybarra: hello David and Marshall |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi aLL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: s IS HLFWY BETWEEN MIXED AND LIMIT RAZE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E overcalls as expected, expect N to be bullish|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: few mins way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S will probably cue 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W may save of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but probably will just bid 4C, lead diorecting and suggesting a save. E will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bilski-Prescott play the same system as Noble-Prescott and Bilski-Noble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, E wont save against 4H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is called Modified Polish Club -- but nobody remembers how it got that name -- it really doesn't resemble Polish at all other than 1@C is multi-purpose|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the 1 @D the catch all?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are 11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+ suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention card for NS is available under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Youth---Under-26/Australia.aspx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: David -- that was much better comeback than what i was typing|pg||
nt|super nova: 2d = Hearts or the black suits.|pg||
nt|super nova: TWERB= two way exclusive relay bid.|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|davidstern: Score one to me|pg||
nt|super nova: Two way because you have either the suit above or the two suits below.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but they're starting with board 31 [or 30] so we won't see comparisons|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a calm approach by S here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H as a choice suggests to me that NS like to open light|pg||
nt|super nova: Normally I would like to have a 6th. for the bid.. but the hand shoudl be worth one bid.|pg||
nt|super nova: It is part of a convension called TWERB|pg||
nt|super nova: Exclusive because you bid the one suit you dont have which is often the opps suit.|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N is overbidding, but cannot make a GT without bidding a potentially ambiguous 3D....normally would not mind that but he has no real reason to think he can beat 5m if his 4H bid ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stampedes EW ionto ut|pg||
nt|super nova: Relay because your partner makes a relay to find out what you have typically.|pg||
nt|super nova: Pitt team had a 3 imp carry forward,|pg||

nt|djneill:  there was a 3 IMP carryover from the RR|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, Adam West playing with Ron and Joe South with Neill|pg||
nt|super nova: I believe that Lorna and Kalmin are top womens players originally from South Africa.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hello everyone it's a pleasure to be here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Izmir/Results.htm  for results and running scores|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Prescott-Noble-Bilski in whatever combination play play what's called Modified Polish Club|pg||
nt|super nova: Evans Djurovic recently finished 23 in the World Womens pairs.|pg||
nt|exerdar: n-s good started |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H will buy it I think|pg||
nt|babs59: several years ago Sjoert Brink's brother, Niek, spent nearly a year in Australia...  |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2N=(19)20-22|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Klinger has always struggled with counting points|pg||
nt|tejjyid: bot on loser count, 1@S is clear|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This is the final of the Sydney National Open Teams (SNOT)|pg||
nt|babs59: Niek actually taught Sjoert to play bridge, but has basically given up the game himself|pg||
nt|babs59: he lived with my family for 1 month, so I have a sort of 'attachment' to the Brink family :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@H is interesting after 2 rounds of spades when trumps are 4-0|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphA2: Playing 4 x 16 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it really have very little resemblence to Polish Club |pg||
nt|loganrun: Hi Al and specs|pg||
nt|loganrun: A slam in hearts or NT as long as you play the diamonds in the appropriate way|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough for North; 3@D not quite enough|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but X too risky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has a 7th @H to make up for the suit quality :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry, ignore that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 losers no matter what|pg||
nt|Walddk2: one in spade, one in diamonds|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, the Poles had a hiccup (where I was watching) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is another|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought 4@C must be some transfer after the awkward 1@H  3@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: and for your future viewing plans, full vugraph schedule with all times local to you is found here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for non-americans, adam west played Batman on TV, and Joe south was a country singer (games people play)|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think the operator may fill those in, though Adam West would be great to see|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bill is West and Paul is South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he also sang the classic "dont it make you wanna go home?"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much response from Neill only 16 highs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphA2: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Welcome to a wet windy cold rainy sydney day|pg||
nt|peachy: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Seniors Teams|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: North probably thinking about 6@D - assuming 3@S is a raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sellberg took 4@C as natural it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: BW - the simple answer to all slam questions|pg||
nt|babs59: Andy Hung, in the Polish room, was discussing transfers - to give more room after some specifically awkward preempts such as this one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|loganrun: Hi David - a suuny Melbourne welcomes you|pg||
nt|loganrun: sunny|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo   Andy is playing with Nabil     in the PABF it was Andy-Adam|pg||
nt|super nova: Seems like a relatively routine hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and give up on the natural 3NT?|pg||
nt|babs59: he didn't discuss 3NT :)   |pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphA2: Yes this is an irregular partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Prescott had an opening bid option with 5+/5+ @H & @S   so  this 2@H probably [keyword] implies 5/4|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok Ron is clearly a NT-o-phile, last hand 1NT with 5 good hearts, now 1N rebid with 6 hearts|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so the @H game missed|pg||
nt|jkotor: strange X from N, why not 3@h?|pg||
nt|exerdar: dbl showing max hand of 2@H, but e-w cant stop i think, after xx|pg||
nt|jkotor: same is 2N and then 3@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugrapha2: not sure what 5@h is|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 3N or 4N :)|pg||
nt|loganrun: South has a max. with good trumps - there must have been a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and claims|pg||
nt|exerdar: will be one down,  looks like 3 more imps to Ýtaly    |pg||
nt|Walddk2: so where is the club suit hidden?|pg||
nt|babs59: that remained a mystery|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   standard count & attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: Prescott caught a pretty nice dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: I was about to ask, but came here instead |pg||
pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: ron understandably treating his hearts as a 4.72 card suit on second round, then accordioning the out to 5.6 on next round|pg||
pc|c2|nt|babs59: Sellberg's only option is to hope that South has singleton @DJ|pg||
nt|babs59: the singleton @DK with SOUTH leaves a loser to the @DJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S 3-3 is pretty friendly too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|loganrun: Declarer has got himself a bit tangled up here|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Bit is very charitable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Noble won the Qualifying -- that accounts for their 11 imps|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|jkotor: 1 i think|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: the only remaining consideration is to not lose more than two trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d2|nt|exerdar: nice @DQ by Franchi|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|djneill:  8 tricks looks easy but 9?|pg||
nt|djneill:  must rely on his one Ace up his sleeve, the fact opponents think he has 5 hearts, not sure if it can be done|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how the new partnership would treat North's 2nd DBL instead of the chosen 3@D|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|djneill:  it is hard for me to think outside the box on defense, if declarer made a "judgement", defense is hard enough|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: that's the last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
nt|super nova: I remember once in the worlds one commentator was saying that the player was caught speeding with a bad suit and a weak hand.. yes -800 in 2h x.|pg||
nt|jkotor: could have been 800-1100|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh yeah -- 1@C was 1-Round Force|pg||
mb|d|nt|super nova: 4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: an excellent hand to defend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can make a case for X rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is a breather...|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes, Marshall would you have responded 3NT on this North hand?  It is close|pg||
nt|jkotor: but Buras played E for worse @h, and probably 4|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: notice Nabil's 1@S -- in preparation of showing @H if he gets a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is exactly the kind of hand that defends the case; playale in 3 suits, why not tell partner about it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this might have been a good time to try an offbeat mini-splinter  [showing 9-12 HCP]   but Whibley is there anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: would you play clubs thru West to create a swing here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally you wouldn't expect to see  the 4@S bidder with an ace|pg||
nt|loganrun: South punting here - could be off 2 controls here|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: we are fortunate to have al here to explain all the bids|pg||
nt|peachy: when I am kibitzing, I appreciate that a lot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice "all" is spelled with small letters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Prescott gave any thought to 3N instead of 4@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: not for .05 second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: or it wasnt apparent|pg||
nt|peachy: 2H being NF, he understandably shose the trump contract|pg||
nt|peachy: chose*|pg||
nt|peachy: the tenaces would have been nice though, to have lead come into|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphA2: Or if you have an ipad http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil asking iff Andy has something good for him and Andy says INDEED|pg||
nt|super nova: I personally like the TD lead.|pg||
nt|exerdar: now 2sp or 3cl|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other tables on Bd 3, all the other Souths have played 3NT on a  club lead to dummy's jack|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: seems Bilski needs one of the black Kings onside|pg||
nt|exerdar: 2sp could be good for competetive|pg||

nt|exerdar: 200 good save realy, bloody board:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence still has difficulty avoiding being endplayed, and might have to open up spades, hoping declarer misguesses, if @SK was ducked very smoothly. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: they've had a very good week really, reaching the semis of the Open with Newell and Reid, and now this final |pg||

pc|d8|nt|petergill: Good defence from Sellberg|pg||

nt|babs59: but he's still about to get endplayed isn't he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately the tables are not linked|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ instead of a low heart, hoping partner wins @HK, then declarer misguesses on the next heart, might avoid the looming endplay. |pg||
nt|petergill: A heart now, then cash hearts and exit a low spade, hoping for a misguess, seems to be the defence's only remaining chance|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, unbal, 5+@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-16 HCP, 5+@H, unbal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout at 2-level   i assume that also applies at 3-level|pg||
nt|djneill:  West ducked the @d as the only chance to set, but also to stop a squeeze from operating sometimes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Minor suit slams are tough after a 2@c opening.  Can the find the grand?|pg||
nt|snigill: in  diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|super nova: oh 5d is an excellent bid on this hand.|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|peachy: Apparent takeout since it was pulled|pg||
nt|djneill:  :-)  Paul Lavings (West) may play slower now for you Judy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could miss a laydown 6C even facing PH, or play doomed 3N with 5C spread|pg||
nt|djneill:  well, North cooperated by not transferring, this looks a little odd|pg||
nt|djneill:  unless not play transfers|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: l in 2 spadesBruce transferred and Pau;|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that description actually covers 1@D, 1@H & 1@S opener's  filling in the correct suit for the 5+|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Paul stuffed up - thank goodness|pg||

nt|marlowepi: cannot approve 1NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugrapha2: not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even so -- with 4333 converting to penalty had to be an option|pg||
nt|super nova: oh.. but that was b/c it now gave East another chance.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: lots of work for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C relay. 2NT 6@S, max|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphA2: This hand looks tough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead|pg||
nt|peachy: but he might manage to make it, provided he does not start on clubs early on|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that you cant make a minor slam which is certainly a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|lml: so this might work out well for east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has a 1C opener|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on the auction - he was NEVER going to play for both reds to be 33 with preemptor holding @HQTx|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Hung still thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming upside-down count/attitude for NS --- @D continuation is expected  -- but no need to rush without thinking|pg||
nt|exerdar: Franchi should play a very careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder how close Noble was to bidding 4@H instead of 3@H   that would have been interesting |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: What would you bid here as south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 1N opener is weak [another non Polish Club treatment] that allows 5@H/@S -- but apparently not 5422|pg||

nt|ahollan1: have we had a straight forward hand yet?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can console themselves there with the reflection that on the chosen line, even 1S was going down|pg||
nt|lml: I guess even 2 was not trivial|pg||
nt|lml: south could have made it right up to the end by discarding at trick 11|pg||
nt|santyclz: Very nice defense.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|peachy: I was thinking the same, lots of decisions both sides|pg||
nt|djneill:  100 honors would change the modern scoring landscape|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nebulous @d?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphA2: Both teams in the final are 5 person teams with one sponsor on each team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems they've all been see-saw between declarer and defense|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slightly poor stopper - but really, the @C suit, who takesthat seriously?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing ron did not open 1S|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4+@s|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3or 4h now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no danger of getting too high now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: Andy's 2@D bid may have hidden the 4/4 spade fit although Nabil may "reverse" now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S is standard weak 2  --  no multi-2@D or 2-suited 2s for NS|pg||
nt|exerdar: Ýtalian style 2h, :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: slow because opps can make 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: north choices interesting   PASS, DBL, 2@D |pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Or 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Depending on methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the diagrammed hand i mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe need to bring up another hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no all wrong opened 1d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the layout showing is the previous hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  rehi all|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: bbo wasostfprhile - sorry so Haughie is in 1NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: result - 3 down|pg||
nt|jkotor: same as other table|pg||
mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: i didnt mean u get to score them. i mean they wont have a trump trick and wont double a NV partial without one|pg||
nt|exerdar: yes but if i have this hand, i want play|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s is -2 because of bad brakes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: this doesn't llok too difficult, I'm going for coffee|pg||
nt|yr: Muller has the(unwanted) reputation of being one of the slowest players in the world!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphA2: I assume the double suggested 4 spades and likely only four diamonds so not sure about 4@D bid by Andy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Barry Noble seems to always have 4522 shape in support of partner's @H bids  - i wonder if that is systemic|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil thinking about bidding on but I suspect he wont|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Hmm 4@S|pg||
nt|loganrun: George (E) remembers the score before balancing with 3D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: Now Andy thinking - "is this natural?"|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Yes mum I know the question mark should be outside the quotation marks|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Yes there are screens|pg||
mb|p|nt|yr: 2@d by W here after the to dbl was a bad @h raise|pg||
nt|yr: this contract should make with an overtrick|pg||
nt|yr: just need to ruff a @d  in dummy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is the @h8 sufficient extra to go?  Vul at imps, yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: we have a short break |pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: ok  back |pg||
pc|sA|nt|djneill:  just imagining|pg||
nt|babs59: OR   NS have only reached a partial|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphA2: This is similar to an earlier board will be tough to make|pg||
pc|s4|nt|babs59: so will they reach 3NT or 5C here?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|yr: but of course muller will take his time|pg||
nt|snigill: if declarer finds the heart queen he makes|pg||
nt|santyclz: You can use the same technique to review play of boards you may have missed at this table.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Maybe 4@C only|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|djneill:  West leads a Rusinow @dQ, showing the @dK (lowest of top two touching honors rather than highest)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jkotor: interesting: if W says 4@s after 2@s, N would probably bid 5@c :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Difficult for Drijver to bid 3NT with stiff @DQ|pg||
nt|snigill: 5 heart tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: better ruff with the 4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Getting to 5@C is very good I think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|snigill: 2 clubs and 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are 3@D tricks automatic?|pg||
nt|snigill: 10 9 stiff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphA2: Is this going to force the @SA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: how many other players would bid twice with that north hand?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: He seems to me to have a choice of playing for doubleton 10,9 or doubleton Q.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|djneill:  South is setting up the @c suit prior to attacking trumps in case trumps go awry|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: rarely correct to play back the suit declarer saw fit to start out on|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jkotor: seems a flat board ;)|pg||
nt|exerdar: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pc|cT|pg||

nt|lml: who thinks east-west will get to 3NT?|pg||

nt|snigill: 3rd 12 imps swing in a row to Swden|pg||
nt|santyclz: The match is getting out of hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: does everybody like 1NT with 7 solid.  It really understates the playing strength of the hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jack Zhao|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|vugraphA2: 3NT NS looks the go here especially after spades block|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi &hoi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: confession time -- I did NOT think about south opening 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: profiles updates|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|tejjyid: THe dead @D K is unattractive, but you have to ignore that really|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: uh uh should have passed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: they dont bloxk when E leads king|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well if South is balanced, i suppose we can say East is single-suited|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if spades bad 4@S will be no picnic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thinking short, rather than bad. Stil, 3NT is OK here|pg||
nt|lml: I asked if people thought E-W would get to 3NT at the beginning of the hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: at the bridge table lool|pg||
nt|lml: and looks liek they have|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: lucky the clubs work |pg||

pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: which is the correct spade to lead if u are going to kead one on thius acution|pg||

pc|h2|nt|brgpro: i can see 6-7 tricks...can anyone find more?|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Lets agree the 5 is wrong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if pd has Ax, declarer is going to get it wrong anyway and you will be better off. but main chance is someone havinbg stiuff queen|pg||
nt|yr: this contract will depend on how declarer plays @ds|pg||
nt|yr: given that muller dosnt play @cs|pg||
nt|exerdar: aconterno suggestion:if duck @c, need to unblock @sQ|pg||
nt|jkotor: now I think K@h, if part have KJ@c its still ok, if Kxxx@c only J@h saves us|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frankaus: 9 top tricks|pg||

nt|jkotor: or for players mistake if Q@c behind and @c 5-3?|pg||
nt|aconterno: will play@cJ|pg||
nt|jkotor: he can still loose it with @c 5-3 after @c trick 3 if E has 2 honours in @s|pg||
nt|exerdar: 1@c showing polish club  or others?|pg||
nt|jkotor: polish style|pg||
nt|aconterno: thinking in 2@s, 1@h 4@d 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: franchý  askýng  1cl  kotorowicz |pg||
nt|jkotor: but 8 now is for 3, with 4 W would play the lowest|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: now  thýnkýng  |pg||
nt|babs59: the other room reached 3S which appears to be failing by 1-2 tricks|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 5 wins if dummy has 9xxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about winning layout for ten or jack winning layouts|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: declarer should make something like 1-2-2-3 so will really need to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|peachy: EW succeeded in getting a plus from this hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i can't find a line here that doesn't rely upon peeking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how might this go in the open room?     1@H-1@S-2@H??-DBL    then what??|pg||

pc|h6|nt|peachy: I would bet 1NT was not opened even if HCP range were right|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yr: i think its natural to run the @d 10,,,& it will work here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphA2: Mike did not realise that declarer called for top club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||

nt|marlowepi: only if they think you have to be very weak rather than just very offensively oriented. and in any case they wont bid one if they dont fiind a fit they are confident is adequate|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: would anybody else overcall 1@S [in lieu of DBL?]|pg||
nt|snigill: sorry|pg||
nt|snigill: rubber squeeze the only chance :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: Only if Dbl guaranteed both majors|pg||
nt|yr: so far , so good, now they need to make it|pg||
nt|brgpro: in the old days we usually X then bid suit with 16 or more points...will not work well with this hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=12-13 HCP, 5@S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: also one should have agreements here NS about what is fit showing and what is one suited and/or what is interested in saving against a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: haviong trouble understanding N reluctamce to support hearts. if he had 5 of them he would have pened 1H|pg||
nt|djneill:  Klinger is not unhappy!|pg||
nt|djneill:  talk about 100 honors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @d's 3-3 and Q2@H all nice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: i started playing weak or kamikaze NT 35 years ago -- i'm sure i NEVER discussed East's sequence of the delayed 3@H|pg||
nt|yr: its natural to finnese they @h q right after the preempt & that shd be enough to make 5@h|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: But .... Pass= Penalties or two touching suits|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: So 3@H showed majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what strength??|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If Nabil finds a diamond lead this will be BAD|pg||
nt|peachy: landed well with that action|pg||
nt|lml: do you know what East meant 1@s to be?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: right. and no matter what E showed, why couldnt it go all pass after the double?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does W always RD?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'll bet PASS not only showed the 2 options -- but was also FORCING|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Because presumably West must act|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that lets NS escape when they have a runout spot and u were making|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Redouble on the basis it is penalties or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if overcalling 1@C has changed now that transfers are used over 1@C-P and 1@C-DBL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S might have bid 4D for example|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|djneill:  must be in 4@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: safety assures many tricks now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|snigill: 10 to Swden|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: well, pluses and minuses i guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frankaus: nat F|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: N has opened a hand with almost 9 losers, and in almost his worst suit. one would think he would be thrilled to support hearts|pg||
nt|djneill:  or in fact, these may be the wrong hands|pg||
nt|jkotor: very good leads by NS other table (Q@s first lead) and well deserved poings|pg||
nt|aconterno: another imps for Poland in this board|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: short the odd spade|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|yr: opps|pg||
nt|yr: needed to finnese again|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: Neill just gives up :(|pg||
nt|exerdar: i thnk with this trumps anyone dosen't play 2or 3@s :) |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|djneill:  seniors are having a Neill moment|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: but i dont like making the last guess. 1N X 2N (2 placesd to play, 3 level or better) seems to get a duirect message across|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i do t think Ron would openm 1S with that shape|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|nt|djneill:  what if East opened 1@s and South bid 2@h|pg||
nt|lml: it looks like a transfer to 1NT but it wasnt alerted|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Ouch now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: maybe a transfer advance = 1C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Nabil choice of 3@C rather than PASS might not get the majority of votes   another sequence that doesn't get mentioned in print|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does the elimination work?|pg||
nt|exerdar: overtrick wiil more imps for Poland|pg||

nt|marlowepi: i think S figured out what E had and was trying to make trhge auction more difficult for EW. not a bad idea in my view|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice result|pg||
nt|loganrun: It does now|pg||
nt|lml: West could have made an uptrick once South was squeezed out of a spade|pg||
nt|brgpro: -100 may not be that bad with this hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|cT|pc|hA|nt|lml: but she was only in 2NT so not worth the brain cells I suppose|pg||

mb|1D|nt|wstuart: Many players feel that they should loosen up their preempts when pard is a passed hand since there is no game, but there is actaully a good argument for tightening up your preempts ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: since the only thing you are bidding for is finding a save, therfore your pard needs to know exactly your defensive prospects.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: how could defense stop that after the @D lead?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly for Southy the thoughtful 3@D bid has turned into information that makes West very confident abloutslam|pg||
nt|frankaus: the sping nationals in its 9th day  - 60 a day  - for some - |pg||
nt|lml: On Board 5 where Kalmin didn't untangle the play in 2@H the other table made an overtrick and so won 6 more imps|pg||
nt|frankaus: spring|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry abput not alerting but her friend is supposed to bwe doing that|pg||
nt|yr: sad result after they reached an exellent contract|pg||
mb|1N|an|12-14 |nt|marlowepi: the method played by EW for 1N X Pass seems theoretically questionable because it giuves the opps the whole two level when E is 2 suited|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E has a 2 suited runout, the n it is fine, but withg a hand that might produce a game ui think a different call is in order, e.g. 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: On the 4@S going down 2 and you asked what the result at the other table might be 5@H -2 and 9 imps to Noble|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Both sides need to avoid trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Sorry 5@HX -1|pg||
nt|tejjyid: illustrates the theme that bridge is ablout balancing information for partner & info for opponents|pg||
nt|santyclz: E didn't have the necessary 5+@ss.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C is multi-purpose  and  1-round force |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 10-20, 5440, 4+@C  b) 12-21, 4@C(441)  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not a surprising outcome for that bid when LHO has opened 2C. still it might have been the key to the city if LHO was slated to end in 3N and had a spade tenace|pg||
nt|lml: no worries as you say|pg||
nt|lml: I love that expression|pg||
nt|yr: 4@s NS again the normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not keen on 2N with so much playability in spades, even though pd is a PH|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right, it's only the huge EW fit that makes it fraught|pg||
nt|djneill:  meanwhile back in the real world, the other table stopped in 2NT on brd 18 after East chose to rebid hearts rather than NT|pg||
nt|lml: well actually I love Australia.  Will you adopt me?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: you bewdy glad yu do|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: for those who like to see very long descriptions     1@C=a) 11-16, 5+@C or 5@C & 2nd suit  b) 15-20 BAL [or 4441 singleton honor]  c) 17-20(21) any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=any 7+ HCP|pg||
nt|nickd:  hello, 1@c=15+ 1@d= semipositive 3-9 points any|pg||
nt|brgpro: do they play mini Nt in this Vul.?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphA2: Anybody for 1@S now by South|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interesting second action by E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S is privy to the info that E mnight have a stiff spade, then yes|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: No need to bid 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=17-21 HCP  5440 or 4441 with short @C/@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Bilski was struggling to recall if this was the right rebid, now Prescott is trying to work it out too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm cheating -- looking at notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  @H win in South  @H win in North  THEN @C|pg||
nt|djneill:  so a small swing to Neill|pg||
nt|yr: the strong @c by N & negative response by S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: what is this alert of 2nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  wow, 5@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi: damn i thought i was here to ESCAPE the real world...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill's 4@S has produced a big pickup, now it's almost all square|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: welcome  ralf |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: alerts explanations reversed|pg||
nt|yr: hi nick tx & welcome|pg||
nt|aconterno: NS can make 3@c if finds Jx|pg||
nt|brgpro: so this 1NT rebid shows 13-16 i assume|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 3@S=RELAY     4@S=5=4=0=4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: uh oh   i think 4@D says   4=4=0=5|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: prescott looks at 4@D incredulously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D would be right shape for a weaker hand than the 3@H rebid|pg||
nt|peachy: this would be a tricky hand to bid in any system|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: A+ for your homework Al.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|nickf: I think North bid 6H, not Westr|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont think W would bid 6H vulnerable|pg||
nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: East looking puzzled|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not more than me|pg||
nt|loganrun: South had to throw a top heart and win the first heart and lead back to north's Queen - very tough|pg||
nt|nickd:  2@c shows 3 spades and 7-9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: I think that Sydney is the best city there is with maybe Vancouvre as second|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nytime|pg||
nt|yr: there should be no play problems in 4@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jkotor: 3N is bad, with direction to "horrible" :)|pg||
nt|aconterno: @d lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: yuk|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: yup Michael knew it was a 4405|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what is 1D?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even corrected, here is an auction you dont see every decade|pg||
nt|aconterno: bad contract|pg||
nt|aconterno: N should bid 3@c|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|djneill:  often times the bid is right, but pd will not understand it, I don't think either happened here|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Haughie dropped 5h on Club lead - not happy|pg||
nt|yr: ruffing a @d  brings the total to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: noit without play|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Nabil knows Mike likely has a penalty double of 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curiously -- there were more tricks available in @D than declarer will see in @C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a little bit late to this match, but I hope sweden can do it well against our norwegian friends playing for Italy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unbalanced real suit is my guess|pg||
nt|tejjyid: standard-ish|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok good info thank you Judy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: pushy 3NT may need some assstance from the defence|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jkotor: now Q@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx Ali!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: Nick -- tell them they both remembered incorrectly :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: natural-esque|pg||
nt|lml: well the club return was a killer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|djneill:  so South is playing on the fact West must play the penalty card on the first @h, even if he holds the @hK!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if N id unsure what 5H means, what he does knwo uis that almost all his strength consists of cards that S probably doesnt care about since only red suits have been bid|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: in this case a club lead seems a better bet than a heart lead in my view|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case i mean|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: i dont understand this play with middle numbers when all we have on side is AQ@s|pg||
nt|aconterno: must take A, for maximum damage|pg||
nt|aconterno: down 1 in OR, with @s lead and @d back|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3rd NS game without points and sense|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: kotorowicz  thýnkýng  |pg||
nt|aconterno: 2 imps decision|pg||

pc|d9|pc|cT|pc|d7|nt|djneill:  I think you are right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: best - quieter, saves time|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i like David's inference about declarer having a penalty DBL of 1@H -- even though he pulled -- but why lead @H then??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: E could show heart strength here more easily thn he could show clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|super nova: 1c Opening|pg||
nt|super nova: would you bid 2c spades and another?|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to play weak and strong micheals.|pg||
nt|yr: this looks like an exellent slam  for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Jean Harings|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: all N has is a fifth heart, but it does not feel like enough. after all S did not opoen 2C. in fact S indeed did even HAVE a 2C opener, yet slam was hopeless, so that says it all|pg||
nt|frankaus: S is a bridge teacher - represented Aus in Cannes some time ago|pg||
nt|super nova: This doesnt qualify so I would bid 1s over call.|pg||
nt|yr: in @s|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi all|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|nickd:  1@c=15+ - 1@h=10+ unbalanced hand any|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphA2: Interesting position for North|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: I would fancy opening 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If I open at all which I will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N is attractive...let them figure it out on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand was just destined for trouble -- there is no science for bidding hands with 5@D 7@C and singleton Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You know you cant get doubled and you are playing for the money|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Partner has 10 outside diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: NO WAY would I open 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=(17)18-19 BAL-Semi BAL|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H a good bid for North here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: redouble maybe|pg||
nt|nickd:  i suppose the answer will be|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|marlowepi: spec suggest that in fourth seat, 3m should be a transfer to 3N:)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade.  The @CQ is not a good card|pg||
nt|yr: @d preemption may actually help  here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no big scores so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there's a fun twist for the viewers|pg||
nt|loganrun: 2C - 18/19 bal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Reese describes a set of hands where raising the overcall with a Doubleton honour is best; this seems like one|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok normal 1@c opening, but 1@d is the equivalent of a 1@h response|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome Jamie Ebery|pg||
nt|yr: i think it will be difficult to find slam if EW never bid @d at all|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|marlowepi: interesting theoretical/practical issue for W on first round -- make sure u show the four spades and clarify strength later? or make sure you shoiw values and fish for spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: later? i am in the latter camp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: reese never heard of LOTT|pg||
nt|djneill:  (and 1@h would have been a 1@s response)|pg||
nt|djneill:  a Jacobini transfer|pg||
nt|lml: hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|super nova: Hi :-)|pg||
nt|super nova: I guess we have talked the lightner double on board 6 to death.|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: ty Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=Puppet 2N|pg||
nt|djneill:  but East does not have to accept - 1@h promises @h tolerance|pg||
nt|super nova: WOW 16 imps.|pg||
nt|yr: but in any case, a splinter now should do the trick|pg||
nt|yr: i wonder what 2@c showed,,Nick?|pg||
nt|nickd:  splinter wont be enough, but i think nirth will bid once more after splinter|pg||
nt|brgpro: hoi|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphA2: I would try 3@D on second round inviting 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If partner passes here you get the worst of both worlds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what 4th seat 2@D opening is for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean, double vs. 2C|pg||
nt|nickd:  about 2@c i am not sure because over competition there are 2 approaches|pg||
nt|jeanhari: drijver has a strong preempt.. poss. because partner has a passed hand|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi Jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stopped on a dime|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: an artificial 2C rebid is a useful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he divine the @H situation??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would bid 2C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NO, he never did, and yet still managed to bid quite well. WHich suggests something about LOTT|pg||
nt|super nova: sorry board 4|pg||
mb|4N|nt|lml: east-west wimped out so it was not a question at this table|pg||
nt|frankaus: they found the X ruff in 6@C|pg||
nt|super nova: This shows a forcing 6 card heart suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphA2: I cant believe North is thinking here|pg||
nt|peachy: the moment.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS may be playing rosenkranz X & XX so forced to XX to show an honor, which a raise over the double would deny|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3H is forcing|pg||
nt|lml: some wires got crossed|pg||
nt|super nova: But it seems that east doesnt like their hand.|pg||
nt|lml: east-west do have 25 HCP|pg||
nt|lml: on the other hand I cant see what they can make|pg||
nt|frankaus: can they make 3NT??|pg||
nt|super nova: yes.|pg||
nt|yr: splinter means that your values are in @h & @c,,,jsut wat S wanted to hear|pg||
nt|santyclz: A grand slam if it weren't for that pesky trump ace.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: now simple Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: that decides the fate of the hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now maybe an overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid 2@C as well|pg||
nt|super nova: yes as in 'it is not clear what they make'|pg||
mb|6C|nt|marlowepi: why would this EW auction ven be forcing? ne of the problems with an initial double|pg||
nt|djneill:  with various checkbacks available, the jumps may be forcing|pg||
nt|djneill:  3NT was odd however|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i mean, from W point of view why would 3C be forcing?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm suprised @C was adequate|pg||
nt|yr: but of course he has a minimum forcing @c & tries to sign off,,,,but N wont let him off the hook here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not that odd -- 11 of his 14 points are in unbid suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he is thinking how lucky he is|pg||

mb|p|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: set spades so Roman Keycard gets useful responses|pg||

nt|djneill:  ok South doubles the completely artificial 2@d bid to indicate some strength, some play it shows balanced, some a takeout of a major in particular|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will NS go on over 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: Another 'percentage' action|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 9 the defense lost their way a bit and 3NT made.  Declarer ran 4 hearts and West through a club which was fatal|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wd by EW. difficult to find the @c lead as N|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: surprising push there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: OK, I have to go, but that should raise the average standard of the commentary|pg||
nt|tejjyid: c u all later|pg||
nt|djneill:  2NT inquiry, 3@d showing @s we guess|pg||
nt|yr: NS will probably end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphA2: Try again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: multitasking is hard|pg||
nt|loganrun: West knows what is happening with the biggest hand at the table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx andrew see you:)|pg||
nt|djneill:  9 card fit + oxygen = game|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d is mostly 0-6 hcp|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW have 3N but NS play 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: You left out the invesrted commas :EASY"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we could all leave, that would be an infinite increase|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOL|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by N may make here|pg||
nt|frankaus: or 4@H|pg||
nt|super nova: As it turns out 4s is a cake walk.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@s is 3+, 3-4 with weak NT, or 4@s-5@c 15+, or 18+ 5+@s not enough for 2@s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: franchý askýng  býd  by  kotorowicz|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1NT from E would be 18-20|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: this time David wanted  BBO to offer    delete PASS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is Lavings -- asks 5-card Major AND size|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, S owes N a 1D opening, i think, even red|pg||
pc|c3|nt|super nova: multiple potential games.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=12-13 HCP, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4cards, INV|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: unlucky|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Neill hits back to take the lead!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|loganrun: Unfortunately this will not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from earlier hand I'm a bit surprised Bilski chose DBL rather than 1@S    maybe the difference was bidding over 1@H rather than a minor|pg||
nt|super nova: North decides to show their 6-5 shape. fair enough.|pg||
nt|super nova: Ace of diamonds and diamond continuations I would imagine to be the best defence.|pg||
nt|lml: on a non-diamond lead the diamond can go away|pg||
nt|super nova: With the east hand you want to pump declarer.. and D is the unbid suit.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: we have seen a plethora of singleton Kings this match|pg||
nt|djneill:  North obliges South with a @d lead|pg||
nt|lml: but the clubs are friendly and the trumps not too badly behaved so should make|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: holey moley - suh 8magination|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: 10 cold anyway it would seem|pg||
nt|djneill:  now it is not so clear, South should now play the @hA in order to get a signal from North|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugrapha2: 3 on the one board was my fav.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 fell to the Ace -- but the 3rd snuck through to beat the contract|pg||
nt|yr: declarer can count 9 tricks if the @cs come in|pg||
nt|yr: but what if they dont?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good score coming up for the Swedes as 3NT is going down on 11, decl gave up a heart|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|santyclz: These are not the hands Iceland needs.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|peachy: kibitzers' dream to have interesting boards!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: and all three were offside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|djneill:  hmm, entries now to set up the clubs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why bother?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|loganrun: Hoping partner might have 1 heart (out by 2)|pg||
nt|djneill:  yes that makes more sense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the old days you were able to bid a grand slam on a finesse in trumps (the king). Not today with Roman Keycard|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|nt|snigill: true|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: the other room just finished board  9 -- but they started with  15  so we're not as far ahead as some think|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11 now|pg||
nt|yr: declarer has a 2nd stopper in @s,,|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: well north has to decide to take the club finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|lml: or 10|pg||
nt|yr: we can see that giving a @c to W is safe but declarer is afraid if the @d ace is offside he will go down|pg||
nt|yr: but he seems to have no other choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: olgersson thýnk|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphA2: Mike throwing those winning clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Prescott going to regret not keeping @C5 in dummy?|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S run|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yr: so he is going for it:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you can't be certain which keycard you're missing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|vugraphA2: Ace of clubs and squeeze South|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Jusrt a reminder Noble started with an 11 IMP carry forward|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Justin Howard gets full credit for this pickup|pg||
nt|yr: the problem for the defence is that wether W plays a low @d or q, declarer cant possibly go wrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-16 HCP, 5+@S, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't matter on this layout -- but i'm still wondering|pg||
nt|loganrun: Fine line between - genius and goat|pg||
nt|yr: S will open the forcing @c here|pg||
nt|yr: how many @hs will W bid facing a passed pd|pg||
nt|yr: 1 shd usually be enough , but u never know:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: short break  |pg||
nt|yr: players have the tendency to try to preempt the strong clubbers a bit more than any1 else|pg||
nt|yr: & good strong clubbers relish this , & the Fat ,Juicy  four figure penalties that often  result:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: so 80 because of trick 1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: most of the time the king was wrongplaced in those days :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Might have held this but it's probably not worth the mental effort.|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|marlowepi: maybe it is W who opened 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: can make 8 spades on round suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 2 boards left in our room  the other room still has to play EIGHT  [8]|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1N is 6-11|pg||
nt|snigill: the right spade play here can give Sweden 7 imps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphA2: Yes well spotted|pg||
nt|djneill:  brd 21 was a similar auction to 3@h, and 22 both tables got to the doomed @s game|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sexier than the clkub ruiff for 14|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Mike counting on his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: He will guess club ruff for 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will do it -- but don't let your children see the use of 4N with unstopped @D suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to INSERT PASS|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, like this hand, even the K is right places 4@h wont make|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: on the intricate auction that led to 6@C+1 here -- the other room played ... 3@D!!!|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1H - on the way to 6 at least|pg||
nt|djneill:  North throws in a little @d action to attract a raise or something|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4N?  avert eyes, o ye of faint gizzard|pg||
nt|yr: here we go,,,3@h|pg||

nt|yr: fair enough|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Whibley doesn't know that his void is working|pg||
nt|yr: that lead gives declarer a double @h chek,,,a small @h wud be double dummy though|pg||
nt|yr: interesting hand to plan the play|pg||
nt|yr: we can see the other table failed badly in 3nt,,down 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: E could easily have openeing bid with no D control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has super max for bidding to date|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody pass with s over 1nt?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: I understand that South didn't want to bid 1NT without a stopper but now she has a problem|pg||
nt|super nova: Then North can Double 2s to say they have 3 potential places to play.|pg||
nt|yr: well , this 3@h bid actually gives declarer a reason to play  for a 4-1 @d division & double finnese there|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many players have left the weak 2 major openings and use a stronger variant |pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: : )|pg||
pc|d3|nt|loganrun: Justin believes that Michael will not open the same 1H hand as he did!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 1@S is usually unbal -- but this is 3rd seat |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Howard still blasts knowing they're off  2 keycards|pg||
nt|jkotor: some gadget and probably now 54+ nat |pg||
nt|snigill: down with 3 times diamond|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: If east has no diamond contro how bad will 5@S be|pg||
nt|super nova: South already knows about the 5 hearts .|pg||
nt|super nova: So they can bid 3d.|pg||
nt|frankaus: downgrade to 12-14 1NT by N mayhave stolen the pot|pg||
nt|jkotor: @c lead best IMO|pg||

nt|yr: now if he crosses to hand & leads the @d 10,,,|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphA2: ke says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh do the replies to 4N inform about diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Well done Mike says Barry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i dont know their system|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: 2 key cards so must have @D control problem arises if one key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, exactly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: It is a little different game when light openings are systemic|pg||

pc|d4|nt|super nova: But after the pass by south over 1s, it is not as clear for north to X|pg||
nt|lml: they can defeat this though and go plus so not so bad|pg||
nt|lml: they weren't making 3NT|pg||
nt|yr: all wishful thinking as declarer goes for a normal 3-2 @d division|pg||
nt|yr: which is a reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|yr: now its all about undertricks,,,the hand cannot be made|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: not sure why it would make a difference|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Whibley started with 2@C rather than Prescott's DBL|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: South says 1NT is clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes that was my point. W is a LOT closer to bidding 4H over an invitation than E is to bidding 4. for several reasons, in fact...for example, if they do bid 4S how will you feel?|pg||
nt|djneill:  seemed like a good shot, very unlikely to set that 4@s otherwise on this auction|pg||
nt|super nova: I would X = some values with south.|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Lavings in deep thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a tactical bidding situation|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but i think it is called something else in New Zealand and Australia|pg||
nt|loganrun: At this vul - perhaps 'Suck'tion|pg||
nt|lml: I like Kalmin's auction|pg||
nt|brgpro: if EW can manage their @d ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=constructive   7-10 HCP, 3+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphA2: Three obvious losers but some work to be done here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H splinter?   is that really the agreement or just Nabil's intent??|pg||
nt|snigill: the match is now 24-6 to Sweden|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphA2: So we can see the OR went -1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still NS have a sac but 5@S home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear what N is up to, without knowing their understandings. might be trying to buy it in hearts as cheaply as possible by pretending to sound slammish|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can manage two ruffs|pg||
nt|brgpro: only 1400...|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  West, a passed hand, has a great hand for @h - a 4@h here seems reasonable - as East might have 16-17 so a 3@h is courtesy|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 1100|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and a questionable invite at that, with bad trumps and a gaggle of queens|pg||
nt|loganrun: North had both!! - just in case partner forgot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the score is about 50-20. Much tighter here. |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jeanhari: sorry|pg||
nt|brgpro: more than that!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: sort of cant see selling to 4S, but maybe 3S was trying to fetch a D noise from S, so when that didnt happen N thought the save might be too expensive or that iin one way or ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another 5H did not have enough upside/downside ratio|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Noble would take down 1 in a second if they gave him the option|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry i mean a questionable co nstructive raise|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|vugraphA2: South elected to double in the OR|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and to my co-commentators, Jean, Jack, Drew and Barbara|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: EW in OR not shining in their slam bidding |pg||
nt|mdgraham: same start as before :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|yr: thats why i prefer Natural methods!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so 3@D=hearts. Just a question of six or seven now, you would think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and I bet on seven|pg||
nt|yr: E never bid his 6 or 5 card suit in the other room:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, East showed @C's first and they never found their fit|pg||
nt|wstuart: I think 2NT was an inv+ xfr to @C in the other room.|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 3@S bid by S took up a lot of room|pg||
nt|yr: & the 4@s bid by E ensured that none was left|pg||
nt|yr: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|yr: the next sesion starts in about 75 minutes from now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@S as exclusion roman? |pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S natural with 0-2 hearts|pg||
nt|jeanhari: next round will start at 17.25?|pg||
nt|brgpro: hard to keep low here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too good for 4@h opposite an unpassed hand, but with partner having passed...|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|wstuart: the question now is, do they have a way to ask for the Q here?  :)|pg||
nt|yr: now 7,,,,,so iceland will lose sumthing like 33 imps in the last 2 boards|pg||
nt|yr: his response will show 2 with q|pg||
nt|yr: 2kc outside @s with q of trumps|pg||
nt|wstuart: true|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes....just a little time to work it out, not something that happens every day|pg||
nt|wstuart: but had he bid 6@D, what would east do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the top clash in group A, Netherlands vs Italy Angelini|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|wstuart: or 6@C I mean|pg||
nt|wstuart: would 6@D be a Q ask there?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if that is ERKCB, that should be two aces outside spades + @HQ |pg||
nt|yr: over a 0314 response, it shd be|pg||
nt|vugraphzuu: 6h ýs alerted  by muller |pg||
nt|mdgraham: assuming a "standard" response style |pg||
