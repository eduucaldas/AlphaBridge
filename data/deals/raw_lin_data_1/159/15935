pc|sT|nt|roswolf: north shows both majors but does he show the spades - he didnt and has fixed himself|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe Gold could have bid 3@S over 3@H to show 6-4|pg||

nt|viren169: either that or 18-19 bal'd I guess|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|viren169: what would you suggest you should bid over 1@D?|pg||

nt|arobson: 1H feels better|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy... |pg||
nt|roswolf: i think bidding with the south hand would be loony - where he found the axe i dont know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, the heart suit is a little better :)|pg||
nt|viren169: I have to admit I would have been in the 1N camp!|pg||
nt|viren169: probably on my own!|pg||

nt|roswolf: trouble is i have been convinced that it should be used constructively|pg||
nt|arobson: The three aces ensure control and probably no more than down one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Osborne must think hearts are 5-0. He has a combined 27, and the man with no points doubled|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point|pg||

nt|Walddk2: N-S should have defended next door, but difficult to fault Hinden for bidding 3@S after Allerton's card-showing double|pg||
nt|arobson: most moderns bid 1S to show a neg dbl without four spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which often includes four spades, but not necessarily|pg||
