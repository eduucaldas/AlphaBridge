mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|garnetts: They might get lucky if they overbid--but the odds favour a club finesse if they get to 6@S |pg||

nt|sybarra: the problem is the Jxx of @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: you could be off 2 or 3  quick @D?|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|oliverc: truth is you can't bid every perfect-fit 27-point slam that comes along|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the S hand is pretty good....do you move again?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Bidding 6@H may be better than 50%,  They might lead the wrong minor, and there may not be a right minor to lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: spec suggesting gazilli |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: the lack of entries here will hurt west if he bids game --but North might lead a heart |pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: a pity we dont have running scores|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: We will maybe get the segment scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: on a bad day this might go off|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: I'll provide what I can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Guy can get them for us before the next stanza. That would be great|pg||
nt|jtr: Great Thanks Guy|pg||
nt|roswolf: x2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jtr: even on an average day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: good lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i am ever hopeful at this level - these guys dont do average|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|jtr: In fact will this make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Depends what he does in diamonds|pg||
nt|jtr: Needs to play @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@ss 2@ds 3@cs 1@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: it certainly can but you may have to view the @D suit correctly|pg||
nt|jtr: @ss looks reasonable now anyway with no entry to the @ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Espen has played, just didn't see if it was K or Q, and they're now folded up whilst he thinks|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i like the spades line:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK Guy, just play any card|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: If you insist, but it won't speed up the play :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Test the @ss then @cAK or @dAK in case the Q drops then finesse in the other suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What if @SQ is ducked, David?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How do you continue from there?|pg||
nt|jtr: Reverse count by N/S so looks like the @hs are 4-4|pg||
nt|jtr: North cant have 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Espen staring at dummy, chin in hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, ducking the @s would present problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Fingering the @d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Liggins also got a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: and then the @sJ|pg||
nt|jtr: If the @sQ holds and South plays the 7/8 maybe continue with the J?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond to the 10 and a spade up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe that's the best line|pg||
nt|jtr: He did know @hs were 4-4 for sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's how Liggins played|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he got @H2 lead, 4th best|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C minimum of three cards |pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes --although the Japanese and the Welsh make a whisky--not to mention the Irish--but I admit 50 year old McCallan has a lot going for it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|viren169: off to a good start|pg||
nt|iain sime: The first three boards have turned out to be flat- on the hand where NS went three off in 4@S here, they played 2@H on a 5/0 fit in the other room.|pg||
nt|viren169: West has a bit of work to do here...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: told NS have changed the system - 1@C can be a doubleton|pg||

nt|rmb1: More IMPs to Hinden on board 7, NS in OR played in 4@S-1.  Now recovered from board 4, leading +1 on segment|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Not a big fan of the double of 2@C --partner is there if it gets to him --here he would pass|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|garnetts: It is that way isn't Mike--I agree |pg||
nt|mdgraham: speaking of penalties, there was an amusing hand on BBO earlier. South opened 2@S on @SA7654  @HQ6 @D87 @C QJ76. Pass, pass, double, all pass - down seven, -1700. 4@S+2 next door ...|pg||

mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: slam hand for NS.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not my idea of a weak two --still maybe there is a bridge God, though I doubt it |pg||
nt|mdgraham: was spades+minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Looks easier but depends on @C play.|pg||
nt|garnetts: why for example would you want to bid 2@H on this garbage?  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: jump overcalls weak.|pg||
nt|garnetts: is it a death wish ?  |pg||
nt|oliverc: I hate 2@H here, I must confess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It is consistent with the generally disruptive EW style|pg||
nt|garnetts: I make WJOs but not on Kxxxx--with some defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: eg board 1 and the 3@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kxxx and out maybe --at least that is real junk|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might score a goal here, as 3NT is on for NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|rmb1: Hinden take the lead, as 6@C-2 on board 8 was as bad as it looked|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: 6@D better then 6@C which can be defeated on @D lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am consistent Mike --I mentioned my opposition to that too---also on that baord what would have done with a real 3@H bid |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: enough|pg||

nt|garnetts: this may hurt a bit |pg||
nt|oliverc: Not sure 4@H can possibly make, either|pg||

nt|vugraphzrt: mg still studying convetion card|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true when 3@D in this sequence is far better then rebid of a major with 5+.|pg||
nt|viren169: would have been interesting to know what 1@S over 1@H was in that seq...|pg||
nt|garnetts: This transfer method of responding is interesting--I think a better treatment is to bid 1@H to show fit or otherwise make a natural rebid--here 1NT is in my view better|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: this should be  1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|iain sime: The cards lie well for the defence|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@H is probably weak NT or unbal'd with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: if the defence gets this right   could be 2 or 3 hundred to e/w|pg||
nt|viren169: North probably should have bid 1@S to catch the 4-4 spade fit (if it existed)|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 1@H was weak NT and 1N would have been 4 spades|pg||
nt|iain sime: The methods have resulted in playing 1NT from the wrong side. The defence is a tempo ahead.|pg||
nt|viren169: so North knew he did not have a spade fit...|pg||
nt|viren169: or a heart fit|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should get five clubs, two diamonds and a heart for minus two.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Apologies IT issue here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Neil has first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: rather none of 1st 7 tricks :)|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 2 hearts    north getting squeezed on run of clubs|pg||
nt|iain sime: I didn't think Willie could be spending ten minutes deciding which club to play. |pg||
nt|viren169: Okay we have the correct explanation to the bidding... I think|pg||
nt|viren169: 1N by North showed exactly 4 spades|pg||
mc|4|nt|viren169: so North is known to be 44xx shape|pg||

mb|1D|nt|sybarra: I am going to have to leave now, nearly lunch time in Wash. DC |pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: This may have an interesting point --if west opens 4@H and South tries 4@S then dble should show a desire to bid 5@H |pg||
nt|mdgraham: strong club....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|garnetts: daft to start with a strong club in my view |pg||
mb|1S|nt|oliverc: Agree totally|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that is some kind of weak 2 !|pg||
nt|sybarra: little heavy or maybe is something else?|pg||
nt|oliverc: agreed, shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told it is 9-12|pg||
nt|oliverc: Why make it so easy for whoever has the Spades to get in?|pg||
nt|iain sime: They seem to have bid every suit except their fit, and wrongsided 1NT as a result. I am sure the methods have had better results!|pg||
nt|viren169: Does North have a raise to 2@S or a good raise to 2@S here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: 2@H is 8-11 (or 9-12) and 2@D would show a real weak two (in either M)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|oliverc: should have little difficulty in reaching 6@D, I'd have thought|pg||
nt|rmb1: bye shirley, enjoy lunch|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: playing complex methods is a euphemism for slow play|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@H that is |pg||
nt|iain sime: Looks like EW have missed a game this time. Better news for Rosen who have had a rocky patch.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|garnetts: I agree that partner has denied 3 card heart support --but he can still have two--and on this bidding quite likely --3@H has more to gain and less to lose--also I agree with the ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: point made to me that 3@H from west is a good bid over 3@D as it must show a doubleton  |pg||
nt|viren169: West may have have bid 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|viren169: playing support dbles it would now show 2!|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|iain sime: Yes, if playing support doubles he cannot have three hearts.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: second club was not a good idea |pg||
pc|c2|nt|kerasidis: teachers say 1 nt is the most difficult contract!|pg||

nt|viren169: cant see anyone applying the red card to the 3-level|pg||

nt|garnetts: Odd thing is Gad you are right nobody ever doubles stretch contrcats these days--maybe that is where the new money is |pg||
nt|ady: Quuen and jack of spades followed bya club switch seems likely|pg||
nt|ady: Liggins woulc have played higher spade for a diamond   |pg||
nt|iain sime: If East has been paying attention to the pips, this should be no problem. The @S9 would have suggested a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|garnetts: a @D looks possible too--maybe the second spade is Suit preference or should be |pg||
nt|ady: danger is passive defence|pg||
nt|viren169: both spades are likely to be suit preference|pg||
nt|garnetts: the 8 is close to the 9--best defence is to overtake the Q@S and lead back the 2 --should be clear then |pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rmb1: Chance for NS to steal by making this|pg||
nt|rmb1:  Board 15 almost flat in 6@D =/+1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: oops|pg||
nt|garnetts: As mentioned Glyn could have made it simple overtake at trick one and lead back the lowest spade |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iain sime: Another missed vulnerable game. |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: Glyn suggesting may have missed game|pg||
nt|ady: 1@H   opening in other room   Selaway overcalled 2@D   and West went straight to 3NT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|viren169: I think 2N over 2@D looks right here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any point in the 2@C bid--totally pointless--partner has made a non space consuming overcall and 2NT is the obvious response  |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|viren169: or even 3N over 1@D|pg||
nt|ady: much needed swing for Rosen here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: 11 tricks and the imp back lost on the last baord for NS  |pg||
nt|garnetts: next |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: Hinden heading for a useful lead. +32 on the segment, |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|viren169: Maybe 2N is a good raise with 4 card support?!?!|pg||
nt|garnetts: This idea of having to use a toy every time worries me--too often an excuse for leaving your brain in the box|pg||
nt|iain sime: On board 12 where South had @SKJ109xxx, they failed to find the defence to beat 4@S in the ther room so conceded a double game swing.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Ok Ghad--then be brave and try 3NT believe me it is likely to be OK against most 1@D overcalls |pg||

nt|vugraphzrs: Peter picked up 4nt and wants to change his mind|pg||
mb|r|an|asks !hq|nt|vugraphzrs: xx asks @h queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kickback is a low level bid ace asking, usually in the suit above the trump suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|roswolf: should stop here!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no chance says a spec - i agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: it was right to stop today|pg||
nt|vugraphzrs: Peter was allowed to change his bid as the card had not hit the table though Espen had seen it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: well it is slightly under 50% slam but not so much so that you would call bidding slam an error|pg||

nt|vugraphzrt: Yes, last board - restart at 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have no knowledge.|pg||
nt|garnetts: we now come to the last board of this set |pg||
nt|garnetts: Not shocked at that --not sure there is a defence if dec guesses the heart suit accurately --and $@S look the better shot over 3@S to me |pg||
nt|iain sime: I think 2@D was ok, but follow it with 2NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: 2@C|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Last board of the set.  Thanks to the operator Tim and fellow commentators Shirley and Oliver.  Thanks as always to Roland and BBO, and to EBU|pg||
nt|garnetts: My issue with that is that in my view the ucb is best used for hands suited to suit play |pg||
nt|ady: Rosen needs to stay out of a slam here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|garnetts: Thanks to Tim for some great operating and thanks all for putting up with me and my now ex fellow commentators |pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: like the last baord not a great deal of interest --11 tricks in 4@S so thanks again |pg||
mb|5N!|an|pick a slam|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|kerasidis: why cant we see the auction in the other room of this board?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: my problem too:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i am curius to see :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: we started late because of technical problems, so results only for the first 8 boards|pg||
nt|viren169: pushy 4N by South opposite 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Last hand, and a good start for Crouch, who are lying third. They will both be concerned that second placed Teltscher are playing the tail-enders.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Forresters good weak twos appear to vary.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@S will not play as well as 3@D in OR|pg||
nt|oliverc: thanks Robin. Teltscher should gain IMPs here|pg||
nt|viren169: 5N?!?!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: Not the best auction I have ever seen|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: NS have the advantage of playing the same contract on both the tables.:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5NT was presumeably a nudge to get partner to make the final mistake and he made it |pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|oliverc: Certainly off 1 or 2 from here|pg||
nt|ady: good session for Crouch   |pg||
nt|viren169: found their 2nd worst fit...|pg||
nt|garnetts: even so I do not understand the 6@C bid |pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: I need to have supper now --so bye all --probably make 12 now with the q@H ruffing out |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|iain sime: Unluckily this goes down. But Jones might have tested the defence by stripping the spade out first.|pg||
