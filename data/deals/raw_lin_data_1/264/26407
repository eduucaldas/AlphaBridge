nt|woozle:  Jacobs-Thompson have bid the previous slam, making that 43 imps in 4 boards in slam swings. At this point, I can't see Wilkinson coming back|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle:  A good hand for Lazer to take a deep play in clubs - run the 8, then lead the honours through west crushing the jack|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle:  If East were a weaker player, you'd know where the club ace is when he plays low on the first round|pg||
