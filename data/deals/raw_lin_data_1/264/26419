nt|mwigor: but as soon as theres a chance they will miss slam (which is true most of the time) you need it to be a lot better|pg||

nt|mwigor: 2@d showed 10-13 points and 5+@d|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mwigor: 2NT was weak with @c or some GF hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: (weak with @c in this case)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: krochmalik was faced with an extra level of bidding - but i still dont like his pass|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: yes he may just have to bid game himself here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: lavings cant be expected to bid more than 3@s on his cards|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: hasn't shown anywhere near this much yet|pg||
nt|mwigor: i predict he will pass after a long thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|Fugitiv: correct|pg||
