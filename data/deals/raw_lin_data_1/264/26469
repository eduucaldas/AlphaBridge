nt|Clinch: Reardon|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Clinch: John|pg||
nt|dburn: relief for Dhondy, who wasn't looking forward to having to bid with those East cards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc:  3NT is pushy but the cards lie well - is there any case for South to invite with 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|dburn: not really|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc:  I may be being a results merchant|pg||
nt|dburn: but he did anyway|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|idc:  So I'm bidding like Callaghan and not like Burn - not sure this is a positive development in my bidding|pg||
nt|Clinch: I must admit I'd have passed 2@h|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  I'd pass 1NT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|dburn: the South hand has more playing strength than a lot of 15 counts, and a free 1NT after the double does not show rubbis - but even so, its maximum is about nine points with no great ...|pg||
nt|dburn: fit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 2@h showed a doubleton and the @hQ is likely to be onside after the double, so Callaghan hoped for five heart tricks and four something else tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|dburn: he (or his partner) will end up with four heart tricks and five something else tricks instead, but he won't mind that|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|an|2+, 11-13bal or nat !C or !D|nt|dburn: this one also, judging by efforts at the other table, where North hoisted his side to the three level|pg||
nt|idc:  The E-W 1NT is 14-16, so we see another vague 1@d opening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@D  2+|pg||
nt|dburn: and if I'd been South he'd have hoisted his side to the four level - South did pretty well to pass 3@h|pg||

nt|dburn: reasonable enough - switch South's minors and game is a decent proposition vulnerable|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure he went three down, even if he was concetrating on finding his 5@d card|pg||
nt|Clinch: This room has completed 5 boards; the other seems to have managed only two |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ady: part score hand    north n/s   hearts  or e/w clubs|pg||
nt|ady: North will take some action|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w accordinging to their card play 14-16 nt in 3/4 therefore this is an upgrade|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: surprising|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ady: 2@D  their method   might be hearts and another   or majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: cant really see any reason for upgrade|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming north has shown both majors east may be tempted into an indiscretion|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i agree david|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east silenced by north's bid|pg||

mb|2H|nt|dburn: may use Michaels here, but 2@h also sensible|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: good hand for negative free bids - playing those, North would have to double and South could pass|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Clinch: As voice commentators point out, 3NT has 9 top tricks....strangely Reardon bid 3@s at this stage|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc:  Not a hand you'd be pleased to go minus on N-S as happened at other table|pg||
nt|Clinch: The thing is, bidding 3@s means you are never going to play in NT as you know partner can't bid it|pg||
nt|Clinch: Whereas partner might still choose to correct 3NT to 4@s|pg||

pc|cT|nt|idc:  West might have tried 3@h and East 3NT - but perhaps a little fanciful|pg||

pc|h6|nt|roswolf: brilliant|pg||
nt|ady: on the north pass  3NT seems to be natural |pg||
nt|roswolf: its poker says a spec - i agree|pg||
nt|ady: up with ace   and 9 tricks on diamond finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a trial claiming is good|pg||
