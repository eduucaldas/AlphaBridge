nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 4+@H, if 2nd suit either LONGER or maybe 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder how much Verhees thought about opening 1@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: PASS seems way too deep of a position|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1NT would be GF, no?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but might be expecting the @S canape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  1N = non-force, 0-2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the response i expected|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: but also thought Louk would open 1@C -- so there|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Walter, would you open a strong club with the West cards?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: right on the cusp|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: right train -- was just counting total tricks in 4@S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i can do either considering the vulnerability maybe 1@S is better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 620 was a very strong position|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then a strong club?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Fu -- nice job|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with an almost solid 7-card suit (vs a broken 4-carder) the hand should be treated as a 1 not 2-suited hand|pg||
