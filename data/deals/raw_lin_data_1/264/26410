nt|mwigor: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mwigor: braithwaite does actually hold a balanced 15 count - but i can understand his view that this hand is not worth 1NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|woozle:  South misses the chance for a good, clean description with 1NT. An error, I think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: instead he gets to defend 1NT|pg||
nt|iceking: i like dbl pd is passed hand is rather weak|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle:  Easier to play than defend, but the real advantages of 1NT is that it makes it easy to bid those vulnerable games|pg||
nt|woozle:  Missing a vulnerable game is as much a disaster as going for 800|pg||
nt|mwigor: a club lead was maybe slightly better for the defense - but unbid major is understandable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|iceking: thats true |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|woozle:  A club lead would be very odd in view of the takeout double|pg||
