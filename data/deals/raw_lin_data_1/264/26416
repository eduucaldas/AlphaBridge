mb|2N!|nt|mwigor: hi all - welcome to the final day of the 2013(sic) Australian Team Selection|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|mwigor: Beauchamp have been leading throughout the event - can they finish it off today or will the Brown team mount a comeback?|pg||
nt|KingCur: this may end in 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mwigor: Beauchamp's 2@h was just a normal weak two bid (not the 8-11 variety) so he was full value for his bid|pg||
nt|KingCur: my first prediction wrong: 4@H it is|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 3@s bid to show maximum?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mwigor: i suspect it showed a singleton @s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mwigor: i'm surprised beauchamp didnt run the opening lead to his Jack|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|KingCur: if 3@S shows shortness, 4@H indeed makes more sense...the x being @SJ however, makes 3NT an option as well, but S couldn't judge that|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mwigor: even if it loses it creates two pitches for you|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|cc469: if they play Ogust responses 3@S would be his proper response as well|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: in fact 3@s was an ogust response (just checked the card)|pg||
nt|KingCur: communications somewhat easier in 4@H than in 3NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cc469: yes, 4@H better thyan 3NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes - often a good idea to play in the weak hand's long suit|pg||
nt|mwigor: that way there are entries to that hand|pg||
nt|KingCur: but maybe declarer should have let the opening lead run to his @SJ?|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes i think so|pg||
nt|KingCur: now left with two minor suit losers|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cc469: cant duck now|pg||
nt|cc469: ducking opening lead was a viable option though|pg||
nt|mwigor: in fact he can pitch a @c on a @d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|KingCur: but @DK on side and @D 3-2 will see declarer home now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mwigor: so he makes his contract - and given the score in the other room wins 11 more imps for his side|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|an|Diamonds|nt|mwigor: sorry typo - i did in fact mean 1@h|pg||
nt|mwigor: this 2@c opening showed a 3-suited hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: (or a strong balanced hand)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mwigor: 2@d was a forcing relay (7+)|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably 2@s showed short @d|pg||
nt|mwigor: (but that is a guess)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: I wonder what the point range is for 2@C|pg||
nt|KingCur: huge @D fit for NS, but the EW bidding making it hard to judge how many tricks there are for them|pg||
nt|mwigor: a normal opening bid range|pg||
nt|cc469: apparently 9 points is ok|pg||
nt|mwigor: 10-20 if 5440 or 12-21 if 4441 according to the card|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mwigor: so he is a fraction light|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: but 3 10s probably makes this worth 10|pg||
nt|KingCur: and a similarly huge @H fit for EW, which bosses the NS fit|pg||
nt|cc469: likes his 3 10's perhaps|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Short !d|nt|mwigor: 6@h makes with the @hK onside but presumably they will find out they are missing @sA and @hK and stop before the 6-level|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about 2 black losers?|pg||
nt|mwigor: @c gets pitched on a @s|pg||
nt|cc469: kibs can decide who the slowest typist is of the commentators :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|KingCur: club goes on long @S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had 800 against 5@D next door|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugrapha3: Brown tells Bilski he owes him a point|pg||
nt|KingCur: with N having doubled 2@D, this slam is a little better than finesse-only, but let Roland be the judge of that :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why better?|pg||
nt|mwigor: bilski probably didnt know he was facing 5@h|pg||
nt|cc469: and perhaps Brown drew his p's attention to those 3 10's :)|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|mc|12|nt|cc469: Michael is probably right otherwise Brown would have owed his p 2 points :)|pg||
