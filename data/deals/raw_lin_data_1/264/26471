nt|dburn: slam on the trump finesse - not a bad proposition, but RKCB tends to get in the way|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3NT not on the trump finesse, for obvious reasons|pg||
nt|dburn: not on at all either, so Kendrick had better remove it|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|runnerup:  6 @d =50% ,but 5 almost 100% -3nt awful -as the final contract -but west had cards to continue so lets see|pg||
nt|dburn: Collins' bid may seem uncouth, but if you don't have a forcing diamond raise available you are forced into uncouthness from time to time|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: Hallberg's raise to 3@d is a slight underbid, but rather more couth than 3NT|pg||

nt|dburn: 6@h a good spot if you can find it|pg||
nt|dburn: even 7@h not bad|pg||
mb|2C!|an|20-22 or GF|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|any 4+|nt|dburn: but bidding seven when the other table may not bid six is a dangerous business|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|20-22|mb|p|mb|4C!|an|Meant to bid 3!C Baron|mb|p|nt|dburn: at the other table North was driven to 3NT via his Multi, so North-South could not investigate majors at a low enough level|pg||
nt|runnerup:  surely so and @s lead makes problems here in 7|pg||
nt|dburn: 7@h is in truth pretty poor on a diamond lead - you lack communications to ruff clubs in South's hand, so will need 3-2 breaks in both majors|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  yes lets agree 6 @h |pg||
nt|dburn: it seems that Simpson thinks 4@c is Baron while Price thinks it is something else|pg||
nt|dburn: or has a heart in with his diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbp: Simpson explaining that he meant to bid 3@C not 4@C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|runnerup:  so one way to win 1 imp|pg||
nt|dburn: was wondering about that|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@c Baron seemed a bit odd, but 3@c Baron would have got the job done|pg||

nt|sybarra: although, would pard understand that as stayman ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: only if agreements are in place probably |pg||

nt|sybarra: hi Ronny :) |pg||
pc|d7|nt|STRIK3R: 2NT after 2@d Multi is normaly GF|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|STRIK3R: after 3NT(strong NT), you must have a treatment that allows you to investigate for Major fit|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|dburn: finely judged save over 6@s, which would have scored 1460|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dburn: 8@c would be an even more finely judged save - 1700 against 2210|pg||
nt|dburn: sadly, such bids have been outlawed for a while now, though some of the players in this event may have been alive when they were legal|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|dburn: Collins may even bid seven now, though more prudent would be 6@c to see if Kendrick could bid 6@d|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|an|1st Round !H control|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|dburn: or redouble, trying for the same sort of thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  entryes are nor very good so 7 @s is very poor -less yhan 50%|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dburn: not really - you can deal with 4-1 diamonds by running the queen, unblocking the ten, then running the nine|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but you have to ruff @h ' and @d ruff is in the air|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe that involves drawing too many trumps|pg||
nt|runnerup:  3 @h ruffs needed|pg||
