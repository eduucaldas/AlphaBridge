nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Andy.|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: Chinese Taipei (3) - Japan (2)|pg||
nt|patricck: I like double over the 1@C opening rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|patricck: gets 3 suits into the picture rather than just the A9742 of @D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Re Chayes and specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Welcome :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any undo or tru?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W wont pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  but question whether to dbl as take out or bid suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: So here we go with a big @C opening, what is the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  this would explain S taking so long over 2@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would have thought so but in that case what is p/c by the 2@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weak|pg||
mb|3H!|an|inv|nt|andyv:  ok, don't know because hand doesn't match what I would expect for p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: and the 3 card @H suit is AJ10 after all, not too shabby|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Yamada must have improved to 2nd then, I only have them at 3rd|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@S 1@H 2@C = 6 tricks. Declarer will struggle after that|pg||
nt|patricck: To beat 4@H the defence needs to play spades early|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dennis|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi all hi roland!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here timing must be correct|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Dennis and Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: South doesn't double, in case giving away the heart position gives West her 10th trick|pg||
nt|patricck: straightforward hand to begin with, both 3NT and 5@C have no problems and unlikely to have a slam accident because missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, reached 3NT in the time it took me to type that :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: China, World Champions in 2009 and 2010 and |pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we to see a 4@H at the end.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not now.|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: So NS here stopping short of game may be either good or bad depending on what happens in the other room|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kerasidis: @c KQ in favour side|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Wonder if neg X ain't better to use at the long term over 2@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @D in hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: The first costful one?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  since 4@h wasn't making, this may not be a great save|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
nt|petergill: when China lost the 2008 World Championship final by one imp, excellent Chinese people like Jack Zhao consoled them by telling them that he would help them become champions in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009, correctly as it turned out|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: N with a sure trick is there to wield the ax and bidding 5 over 5 is not in the picture at this level so W has elected to "take insurance" and although not a winning decision the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: cost will not be too dear.|pg||
nt|robbroy: Destined to be a little unfortunate|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzek: Chinese Taipei (3) - Indonesia (9)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: If club ruff, then @HQ should be ducked by South|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are young, played youth events in 2008 I think|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome to this match in the Asia Pacific Championships between the Ladies teams of Japan and Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|robbroy: maybe the best psychological chance is to play a small heart trick 2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|patricck: declarer cashing up the spades in case east can pitch one after 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer of course doesn't know about the favourable position of the J@D|pg||
nt|robbroy: Hard to get defence wrong I feel|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|jcwla: Let us say, it would take exceedingly friendly defense to bring home 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h dbld can go for 300-500, the cost isn't that cheap|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|patricck: If declarer leads the J@H West needs to duck to encourage the continuation|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||
nt|petergill: West now hopes @HQ drops doubleton then @CJ drops singleton under @CQ, about a one in a million chance. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Paula a bit lucky after the @D try?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: This is an improtant match between the teams that are 2nd and 3rd, at the moment China is in the lead|pg||
nt|patricck: well done|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: or Axxx i meant |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: cliam time|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|patricck: if West had taken the K@H then the 7@H would have been an entry to play the @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: NS are one of the highest ranked female pairs in the world, if not the highest ranked|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could easily be 7 imps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: @CK play at Trick 1 was too revealing to declarer. Better to play small on the club lead, then the king on the 2nd round of clubs might be from Kxx - less revealing to declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: China are overwhelming favourites to win the Women's ABPF Championship for the umpteenth time is a row|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei and Indonesia are good medal chances, not good gold medal chances though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|patricck: endplay coming on East for down 1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|patricck: small club and declarer may misguess|pg||
nt|patricck: thx Chayes, but that still tells me Yamada are 3rd, so the latest results perhaps have not been updated|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|patricck: would have been even less revealing to ruff with the J@C and then exit a small one to give the impression West has the 10@C|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzek: wait a minute for update :)|pg||

nt|petergill: His coach Patrick Huang would be proud of his play. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim*|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly 4@H also would be home. Only a @D lead from E to beat it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the problems with the weak hand making a decision at the 5 level|pg||
nt|petergill: No double, so only 50's = no big deal|pg||
nt|patricck: prior to this match Korea was 6th and Australia 10th, both teams have a lot of work ahead of them|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Regardless of the level S chose (and made a choice here that worked out great), showing the majors and then bidding @H's did show the nature of the hand well.|pg||
nt|patricck: Current scores are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT from East will make with the favourable @D break. 6NT from West can be beaten with a @S lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
nt|patricck: The 3-3 spade break means 2 things, NS can luckily make 9 tricks in @S and EW can't make more than 8 tricks in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: Suci Amita Dewi and Kristina Wahyu have been regulars on BBO for the last 5 years, practising a lot on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: But if you were playing6NT from East you might well go down even playing it reasonably|pg||
nt|rodal f: S aint gona give up here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 2@h kind wild i thing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Chayes, can u exsplain 1@H - 3@D?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C a nice spot and on for 500 at wourst now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ns vul prevented north no show some values|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C probably shows clubs and @D, at least 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|patricck: South had better run or this will be expensive|pg||
nt|patricck: possible expenive even if she does run|pg||
nt|patricck: That is because if you play 3 rounds of diamonds you have no real chance to recover if they do not break|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@D has guaranteed that they will reach 6@D or 7@D|pg||
nt|patricck: So best line may be 2 rounds of diamonds(in case doubleton J@D and then if nothing appears take the 50% chance of the Q@S finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: If the @D didn't break but the Q@S was onisde then everyone would say 6NT could be made with the spade finesse, unfortunately declarer doesn't know which option works|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_O.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: this could be tricky, the finesses are not onside for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Got there income it seems.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this must show a strong sequence for EW|pg||
nt|patricck: that gives the opportunity for 4 @S tricks though, makes all the difference I think|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S 2@H 3@C and North doesn't get in often enough to play @D through twice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Hi Gupta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...usually 1@D does not include a 5-card M, no?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 1@D showed spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps they are playing negative free bids.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh OK.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Steve.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Steve:)|pg||
nt|robbroy: 5 top defensive tricks but not east to cash - ptience will restrict declarer to 8|pg||
nt|robbroy: maybe|pg||
nt|robbroy: the cards lie luckily for EW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|robbroy: 9 or 10 now for sure|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@S is fairly safe, but still down after the defence starts with 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no alert all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Wang Hogn Li worked out that her very bad heart pips would make 2@H difficult to play, opposite a void or singleton @H.|pg||
nt|petergill: Hong Li|pg||
nt|patricck: ast won't pass tho|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, famous last words by the commentator there :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  would 2@h over 2@c have been forcing or not?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: as suits are less likely to break when opponents bid vulnerable on low HCP|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: called commentator's curse,, |pg||
nt|patricck: so, this is interesting, declarer may pin everything on the @D and be lucky, or he may try to combine the chances as I have suggested and then he will fail|pg||
nt|patricck: I hate leading from Jxx or Jxxx so I personally think it got what it deserved. However to be fair South didn't have a nice hand to lead from|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwi_joker: sry I dont really know the continuations|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and hello Patrick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  ruffing 2@cs in dummy seems to have some merit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|patricck: If the spades weren't 3-3 this contract would have been badly forced off, a little luck for Australia|pg||

pc|hA|nt|andyv:  still, W will make 4|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, east took the simple line, an easy 12 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: Board 17 could be a swing in either direction, this can only be flat or good for Hong Kong, so a small advantage to them early on|pg||

nt|patricck: hard to imagine a hand that was more likely to be flat. 3NT making 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 11-15, can be very short|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EW to 3@D in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, or 11-14. Their club is 15+ any|pg||
mb|1N|nt|petergill: 1Nt will be East's bid|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: I expect NS to reach 3NT and with the well placed @H suit that shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|robbroy: 2@H dbl likely now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: as 2@D would be like a 2/1, 10 or 11+ with @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
nt|patricck: I am not a fan of doubling on hands like West's, seems to me that I am in the minority though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|patricck: 4333 you either have enough to overcall 1NT (on 15-18) or you simply pass and await developments|pg||
mb|2C|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  that treatment over NT seems to be losing favor|pg||
nt|sybarra: some might recommend overcalling 1 sp  (but not me)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 1@S on such a good suit is better than the takeout double, but pass is still the best choice|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: agree,  I  would pass and see if pard can come int|pg||

nt|tejjyid: East gets a 2nd chance - I prefer to save my 2nd chances for more importtant things :)|pg||
nt|patricck: with the vulnerability it looks like E/W will be a well deserved -200 unless declarer can guess the @D suit|pg||
nt|robbroy: looks like 7 tricks NS every day|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@S, 1@H, 4@D and 2@C make 9 tricks, but EW get 4@H and a @D first, so should be 8 tricks here, maybe only 7 if declarer finesses for the J@D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf  updated after round 6. Hong Kong leading now, Thailand 10th|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thailand killed from a slam? Let's ee what OR will do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gives the opponents an extra round of room to maneuver.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: After 9 rounds, China leads the Women's event by 31 VPs from Japan, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia, who are all close together|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  if they can unscramble their tricks, 2@h should have gone down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it looks like it's making|pg||
nt|patricck: ok, 8 tricks then|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer can make 10 now, but with the diamonds open it would be very dangerous to do so|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Careful with the @S10 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was NF as exspected and drurey by 2@C no fit - 2@D with fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  E lead looks pretty natural though|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|tejjyid: If East had ovecalled 2@D the first time; West would find the raise to 3@D more easily|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: *see|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H weak, as 2@D would be a 7+ raise, an increasingly common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, not stopping at 3NT, fortunately the cards are friendly enough to allow other possibilities|pg||
nt|patricck: wrong again, east didn't want to cash her @Hs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s6|nt|offthebend: shouldn't take too long to claim  |pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer does know that south has Q@H and AK@C, but that shouldn't be enough to help|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: Patrick, unfortunately, I am going to have to leave  and will be seeing everyone from the European championships tomorrow morning|pg||
nt|patricck: Thx for your help Shirley, g'night :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: g'nite all :) |pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  W, looking at that @s suit in dummy, might have thought about taking the A@d and switching to @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim time|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have doubled 1@D on the East cards, but some experts prefer to bid their 5 card major |pg||
nt|patricck: Thx Chayes, we wouldn't have been able to guess at the meaning of all those bids otherwise|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|kiwi_joker: I note that with 9-6-3 Trevor gave (upside-down) count with the 6. I must say I like loud signals, when loud cannot cost. (ie, the 9 here)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|patricck: hmmm, 4@S could be interesting|pg||
nt|patricck: One thing is certain, declarer won't be happy when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|patricck: what should West lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, South shouldn't have split the honours, now East has a known finesse for 10 and maybe an imp|pg||
mc|10|nt|jcwla: Absolutely.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Only 31 match points between NS and EW.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|offthebend: D partial for EW if they can find it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Only about 100 to 200 bridge players in Malaysia, so not many volunteers to do the hard work, so do not expect instant updates of websites|pg||
nt|rodal f: At B1 OR are playing 4@H and not 3NT= as here.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT was also made in the Open Room, no swing|pg||
mb|2N!|an|inv|nt|petergill: Splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi. Sorry that I'm late.|pg||
nt|robbroy: even a 4@D splinter should not excite Gemma here|pg||
nt|robbroy: but maybe they play fit jumps in which case an alternative to simply bidding 2@S is 4@C|pg||
nt|patricck: another part-score hand, maybe not quite as simple as the last two|pg||
nt|tejjyid: First they have to stop in a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 6@H is not a great contract, and of course would fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the worst S hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|patricck: the operator decided board 3 wasn't esciting enough :)|pg||
nt|patricck: EXciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after this board :)|pg||
nt|robbroy: Dbl P P 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: B1 sold at the mol. 4@HN= here and 3@DW at OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And one more overtrick IMP on 2.|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D will be some sort of 3 suiter, I don't have the system details|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: rather sensible contract on a 9 card fit on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3-card raises are awkward after a X for most pairs|pg||
nt|patricck: Paula McLeish has never been described as a conservative player. I am not surprised she opened the North hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|petergill: It would be a major triumph to reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter? |pg||
nt|petergill: South ranked  1 female in the world, North ranked  4, and Gu at other table ranked  2 female in the world, in WBF rankings|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid again as S?|pg||
nt|robbroy: no interest in slam even opposite a void!|pg||
nt|patricck: EW have game values but the cards do not lie well|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
nt|petergill: Gu Ling's partner took a break of about 10 years from international bridge, then won the World Championship in Philadelphia last year, so is ranked "only" about  46. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yet again S treats the hand as both M's despite the large discrepancy.|pg||
nt|robbroy: well the defence should get their 3 trix here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Guess was old fashioned treatment of "double for the majors" over the big club, so an easy 4@S call for N|pg||
nt|petergill: North follows the Kit Woolsey approach of getting in and doubling early with 12+ and 4333 shape|pg||
nt|patricck: EW will get at least a couple of chances to beat this with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|robbroy: not now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Right, she is a bidder|pg||
nt|patricck: This will likely be the contract in both rooms, the swing will come from how many undertricks I suspect unless the defence is very generous|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kerasidis: or maybe jumbing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it worked the first time so why not?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: In order to know how sympathetic to be with West's decision we would need to know how clearly penalties the double was or whether it could be just 'values'|pg||
nt|patricck: Whether it is right or not to do so is another matter but it depends on what partner expects|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Maybe South could try an invitaional 2NT instead of the cue - it's a soft 12 without many @S pips|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome Andrew|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: E bid his colors and don't care the 2@S from S?|pg||
nt|patricck: no, I don't bid 5@S with Jx and Qxx in the opponent's suits|pg||
nt|patricck: expensive lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to make now |pg||
nt|patricck: wasn't it likely that West would have a void @S here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the X gives the @D suit away|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi Patrick - I invited myself :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kerasidis: even if the dont lead dia i can not see 5 making|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's not a horrible treatment as long as the dbler has about equal majors or a stand along major (like the previous auction)..here, dbld has simply a good hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl 10+, then East's Dbl take-out (a non-standard treatment), converted to penatly|pg||
nt|patricck: I'm glad to see Australia still has some places for ex Kiwis in your teams :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of too many lead-directing doubles - they tend to advise the opponents that their values are in the right places, as here |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by French Polynesia|pg||
nt|rodal f: A natural lead from E|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: May we say that a 3NT might is lost. Bit hard for EW here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: they will have chance later also|pg||
nt|kerasidis: sure|pg||
nt|petergill: Right suit to lead but wrong card|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  stand alone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, not that good.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not great....just good|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the call better on 1 than here though it hit paydirt as far as N is concerned.|pg||
nt|patricck: can't pick up the @D suit and take the pitches on KQ@S|pg||
nt|offthebend: best she can mange is 8 tricks with favourable layout in Diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: This looks to me like 500|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Last year, Chinese Taipei won this event on 401 VPs, Australia 2nd on 399 VPs. French Polynesia finished 12th out of 13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: cross-ruff on the way, and the high heart ... leading to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: so all roads lead to 11 tricks I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to thinking about the lead |pg||
nt|rodal f: Find the @C ruff and -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 3@C Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: in CC|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: plopping down the ace just seems dangerous to me|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|offthebend: oops -- she didn't cove the SJ -- now only one S stopper |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|offthebend: if the leads are 3/5 , clubs must be 5-5 and N should be marked with doubleton SK for her opening|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows West has only 3 hearts - with 4 hearts, West would play a low @h (not a high @H) at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Any deep hook to come in @S? N have opened.|pg||
nt|patricck: how can declarer not take any club pitches?|pg||
nt|patricck: I was apparently wrong about the opening bid. Not sure that I would want to play a 2@D opening that is 18-19 balanced, but apparently that is what it was|pg||
nt|petergill: @CA lead would have allowed North to discourage, to get the heart ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: EW want to take @DA then cash @h, but cannot tell that South has singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: - 200 is easy for South now, via 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: West thought East might have Jx in @D, hence the duck|pg||
nt|patricck: on a club lead and a spade switch I think it could even have been -300|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: I wonder also|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @H would made problems.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kerasidis: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: seems have a chance :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  my adage, I always make the right bids, pd has to make sure she/he has the right hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Wang Hong Li follows best procedure of taking extreme care, and plenty of time, in all doubled or slam contracts at imps, as plenty of imps are at stake, so take all the time ...|pg||
nt|petergill: needed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: I wonder if anyone watching can help me find out why the scores from the other romm aren't coming through? Maybe the operator knows?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Next|pg||
nt|sybarra: about to -1 |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzek: :(|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: West will feel pained but without any actual need |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: South did well to retain @C2, so that @C3 switch by West was harder for East to read|pg||
nt|patricck: BIG opportunity for Chinese Taipei that has got away from them|pg||
nt|patricck: but we are headed for -200|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: she surely will play a club now, but there's no harm in taking her time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|petergill: the risk of boring us spectators is not her highest priority |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and down 1 - the 6331 is a sterile shape & East probably has theworst possible hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|patricck: A heart exit there would have been 3 down|pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East says, let's end it now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: B2 here 3@DE-2.   Or ended in 2@H by 4-3 at N|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh dear me|pg||

nt|jcwla: In the open room 3, the NZ South did elect to open that "third seat weak 2" in first seat, failing by one.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So 4 more to Indonesia.|pg||
nt|petergill: so North's decision to enter the auction looks like a good one, though risky. It's a bidder's game. Defence is harder than declarer play. |pg||

nt|rodal f: Pass for pun or 2@C. Make the last|pg||
nt|kerasidis: first pass roads me to pass again|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: and again|pg||
nt|patricck: all the black cards onside for N?S are enough to give them a chance for 10 tricks in @S, but entries to the North hand may be a problem|pg||

nt|offthebend: why is it so tempting these days to open any random 11 pointers when partners don't expect it  |pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|petergill: There were some major upsets in Round 1|pg||
nt|jcwla: What is this double?|pg||
nt|patricck: If West leads a @D and South plays low from dummy 10 tricks will be easy|pg||
nt|patricck: enough points that they will probably get there, but it is a little lucky that the spades are 4-4 and the clubs can be played for 1 loser|pg||
nt|patricck: we have all been in many games much worse than that though|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A help for a @S or....|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision, 1NT 8+ balanced GF|pg||

nt|jcwla: Was there some part of that of which N was not already aware?|pg||
nt|andyv:  works out very well|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C shows both majors and a specified point count, details of which I don't know|pg||
nt|patricck: aah, but how do you know that partner doesn't expect it? :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Perennnial (prior to 2010) winners China, not at full strength this year, lost to Japan 7-23.|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer should pick spades and make 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H sets hearts|pg||
nt|woozle: Paula wisely declines the opportunity to rebid her lousy spade stopper|pg||
nt|tejjyid: more to the point is, how come partner never notices and adjusts accordingly?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: N hoping to beat it in his side's high cards .. nothing promising to bid|pg||
nt|patricck: to be fair North would have devalued the K@S and south wouldn't have been ecstatic about @SJxx|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a fan of "I have 5 tricks in my hand" doubles.|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW was max -2 at non vul|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: Not the world's greatest contract but will make as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C cue bid, denies spade control, so E knows @SA is missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10-13|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Chayes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: Interesting 1NT bid|pg||
nt|patricck: surely partner notices, half the time they become declarer and see what comes down in dummy|pg||
nt|offthebend: well , If Pele did then she should have passed 3C :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Kim, with trump length, would have done better to start with a spade, but she leads her singleton trump into declarer's known second suit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North can't pass the re-openign X, becasue he pips are so bad, so despite the length opts of the value showing bid|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: 4@D cue, getting into dangerous territory with no check that 2 aces aren't missing|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D cue|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: and NZ lost to Malaysia 13-17 here on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: well not low on that @D lead :)  but the J@D also allows an easy 10 tricks if declarer was in 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have bid 4@H, but thought his sparse 12 count was maximum|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, NS will do very well defending|pg||
nt|jcwla: Andy, I can understand forcing to game with just a king over a powerhouse opening, but even being aggressive in not requiring the usual combined high-card strength, it usually ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: plays poorly when the values are all in one hand.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Once against, I would double 1@H on West cards (along with a majority of experts, surely), but the Indonesian youngsters prefer to overcall their five card suit. |pg||
nt|petergill: and thus they miss their spade fit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: Now the defence has to find the cashout|pg||
nt|petergill: @D lead and @s switch looks best to me, but i can see all 52 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead = -980|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: High enough @d lead for N to play @DA, not @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: Defence has various traps to negotiate here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and @S for a glue? Belive not|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree about its having the appearance of DONT, which is perfectly good.|pg||
nt|petergill: If @SA lead, N must discourage and S has to find @D switch, not easy after East's @d cue bid|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing 1/2 cue bids, bypassing 4NT to cue like this is very dangerous, something I personally avoid like the plague.  |pg||
nt|patricck: as expected there awas a game swing from the 3NT HongKong made on board 2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: If @CQ are to be found. Still then problems. 4@C max.|pg||
nt|patricck: A slower approach from South might have allowed them to find that|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele should probably have worked out what was happening in clubs - either lead a trump to dummy and finesse again, or duck the second round|pg||
nt|patricck: did declarer really think that the lead was away from the J@C|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@Hcertainly an alternative playing 5 card majors|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|offthebend: H 10 is the trouble maker here -- but paula should make 8 tricks if played carefully|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|petergill: Spade switch looks costfree to me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Hi all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Welcome :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: North can now be strip-squeezed/endplayed for the overtrick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although East can't see all 4 hands, so won't risk it|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Looks like 110, a likely pickup for China|pg||
nt|patricck: surely that would be so unlikely on this bidding that crossing to a top heart and finessing the 10@C must be a good idea|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: Max normaly |pg||
nt|rodal f: But this ain't good eigher.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

pc|h6|nt|petergill: and S will be endplayed for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't think N would make move over 2N, so he was quite willing to sit for dbl with one trick (and he made the right lead..a @s lead would have been fatal)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|offthebend: well done :)|pg||

pc|d9|pg||

nt|petergill: I predict that Australia, China and Chinese Taipei will win the medals in this event, but in which order I have no idea. |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: Dynamite hand this one - anything could happen |pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 made one more IMP to the Aussies|pg||
nt|robbroy: Philippines slightly unlucky here to find a cashing AK on lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Last year Chinese Taipei came 1st on 401, Australia 2nd on 399, Indonesia 3rd and China 4th|pg||
nt|patricck: yes the lack of entries to the South hand doesn't really allow declarer to find a losing option|pg||

nt|petergill: on Bd 21|pg||
nt|robbroy: no dbl though spotingly|pg||
nt|robbroy: sportingly|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele looks at the vulnerability but perhaps not at her hand|pg||
nt|woozle: At least if she shows the specific suits, North can just arrange to play in clubs by bidding them|pg||
nt|offthebend: might be in 6/7 D very soon on that bidding :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 5NT - 6@D..|pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Australia  would be very happy with 25-5 win over Japan Yamada who won World Seniors in 2008. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Michaels, both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H and double back later if needed?  Or double originally?|pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia had Asbi-Tobing and Sacul - Karwur in their lineup last year. |pg||
nt|patricck: another borderline game|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: heart lead would be awkward in 6@D|pg||
nt|woozle: An error to make diamonds trumps, especially played by South|pg||
nt|woozle: Paula makes no error|pg||
nt|patricck: not that a heart lead from Jxxxx of declarer's other suit was very likely|pg||
mb|1H|nt|patricck: very straightforward 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei team is unchanged|pg||
nt|offthebend: good practical  bid By Paula |pg||
nt|patricck: If NS find the @C lead against 3NT it seems destined to fail|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwi_joker: second double should get them there|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: danger if they find 4-4 C fit and start exploring slam |pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D = one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D or 6NT - that's what he's thinking about|pg||
nt|patricck: If South had KQJxx of diamonds we would be wondering how they missed 7@C|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele won't be proud of her hand, but it's good enough on any reasonable line|pg||
nt|patricck: A lot of pairs play double by West in that position as showing 3 card @H support|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I think I would have passed as North and hope S reopens with Dbl, which I would expect S to do|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like watch more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a nice spot in @H here|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: and if S does not reopen with X of 3@S, then 4@H, not 5@D, needs to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: women's Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: Korea beat NZ 16-14 - a huge upset, and a mild upset was hosts Malaysia over Thailand 19-11|pg||
nt|petergill: After @S2 lead 4th best, I would play back a low spade as North at trick 2|pg||
nt|patricck: Open Team placings before this match are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S K and get a lavental or a shot in the sky?|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: short and sweet -- who bothers about showing second suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H=longer @S than @C? No idea. But remember the 1@H opening by 10XXXX|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice contract cinsidering that 4@s can be down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: or 3@H   :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or @C?|pg||
nt|woozle: Poor technique from Park - aside from the dangers in a trump lead (dummy could be void, partner holding Jxxx) but she should lead low from two trumps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kerasidis: considering|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Now that is some lead directing X|pg||
nt|jcwla: E totally devaluing the hand b/c of @SK - almost worth the raise just on trumps.|pg||
nt|patricck: this contract might have been more interesting with some 4-1 breaks in the red suits, but on this layout everyone makes at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT to protect @CK seems best|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, as long as you don't mind the aggressive 3@D opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
nt|petergill: in case East has Qxx|pg||
nt|petergill: Let's see what Sun Ming does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
nt|petergill: An Indonesian team of Lasut - Manoppo (+ a whopping 1.9 imps a board in the Seniors event at present), Asbi - Tobing and Sacul - Karwur would be favourites to win this event, given ...|pg||
nt|petergill: that China are not at full strength (with Jack Zhao, Fu and Dai all not playing)|pg||
nt|petergill: Australia however has a stronger team than last year - Australia's teenage debutant Nabil Edgtton is an excellent player, currently he's +0.85 imps a bd in datums. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
nt|patricck: EW have done well to stay out of game on 24 points|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a funny board. EW as well as NS kave nive fits, but whome do bid as W do here?|pg||
nt|patricck: when playing a 4-3 fit it is usually vital that the 3 card suit is the one being force to ruff. So this is good, I am fairly confident declarer will make his contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Obvious if u have a invome or two.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *income|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Sun Ming rarely (almost never) lets you down |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, I'm not in love with this sequence.  This sounds like a very big @H hand that's one-suited in @H's.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|offthebend: everybody UPGRADES these days 14 into 15 , 15 into 16 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: My sister (npc of Aus Women in Kuala Lumpur) says that Sun Ming would be ranked much higher than  4 women player in the world, if she played more often|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|patricck: on a diamond lead 3 rounds of hearts and 5 rounds of diamonds pitching spades, then with the club finesse there are 12 tricks, maybe even 13 if south pitches a club|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: @C5 from East was bottom card, showing originally 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: there is a very real danger that she will play West for @DKx|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: No squeeze, so no overtrick|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcwla: If you're going to emphasize the @H's, then I think you start with 2@H and double back later.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|offthebend: If N opened !NT , they would have been in 5C or 3NT -- now we wait |pg||

nt|petergill: In recent years, I am told Singapore has had Chinese and other coaches for their youths, which might be (part of) why Singapore U26 and U21 are doing so well |pg||
nt|petergill: Unusual decision by West not to open 3@H nor 2@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|andyv:  after 3 rounds of bidding, NS wound up in 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by East to compete - Dbl was a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT about 8-11|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer will play out all the diamonds hoping for a @H discard, time to quickly make a coffee|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still 4@S are only -2|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D to set up forcing auction|pg||

nt|petergill: Seniors Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf - no upsets|pg||
nt|patricck: on 2 hands with marginal game values NS has stopped in part-score on one and made a slam try on another|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: Still a healty contract.|pg||
nt|petergill: Having 3 cards in the other major is a downside for any preempt - might miss a 5-3 or 6-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|patricck: slam would b a errible contract, but 12 tricks can be made thatnks to the A@D onside if you can guess which way to play the @H suit|pg||
nt|offthebend: DA right , find the HQ for 12 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So I always open 1@C with 5-5 in black when I cant revers and @S +@S from W show the hand. 5@S and 5 or 6@C|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: well it won't take much finding now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: so West can place the NS HCP as "8 N -12 S or so" as a starting point for her declarer play|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In the Seniors, Indonesia, Japan Yamada and Australia all have classy teams |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT must have shown 4414 minimum or perhaps 4!+ @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = various, then 2@H = both majors|pg||
nt|patricck: There is a theory that bidding grand slams on a hand such as this is a good idea missing Qxxx. Because trumps are so often led against a grand slam you either get a trump lead or ...|pg||
nt|patricck: you finesse against the opening leader for the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: so some message didn't get pass|pg||
nt|twcho: I think west hand is stronger than 28-30 bal|pg||
nt|twcho: so maybe she can take the lead to jump to 7|pg||
nt|twcho: as her counterpart in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @DQx is lucky, but is it lucky enough for this to make?|pg||
nt|petergill: @CAQ lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D would complete the shape nicely, but wuld it be forcing? (It should be)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tif So, West has to decide whether to try 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q empty oposite a singleton isn't great|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China (1) - Japan (3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: At non vul u don.t risk anything if u stop under 3NT. Max 1IMP. But at vul it cost. The reason 3NT bidded by the 24HP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the luckyest lead I,ve seen at a color partscore.|pg||
nt|twcho: now she is hoping for bad break so that 7NT will fail|pg||
nt|patricck: looks difficult to me|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: but declarer seems might be one trick short, unless two spades can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: The duck is an attempt to avoid the fatal @d switch|pg||
nt|petergill: A very clever attempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the problem is, from West's point of view, that if he has to ruff @H, it will be with good trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 North - 8 South now, after the @DQ and @DA are removed|pg||
nt|patricck: K@C is a much better lead than a singleton when holding 4 trumps as West has here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Y. Need to find the @CQXX and % for that might under 30|pg||
nt|patricck: If that theory became too widely followed then people would stop leading trumps so readily against a grand slam|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now for shure E need to find the @CQ.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why E didn't sat the slam at @C by a 4@C bid?|pg||
nt|patricck: the defence always know they are in with a good chance when declarer takes this long at trick 1 :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
nt|offthebend: H lead predicted by Nick Fahrer and there it came :)|pg||
nt|patricck: ruffing a club in dummy will bring an unpleasant surprise|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: NS play high to encourage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit cloudy that 1IMP. U loose and win if u are correct, but at long term u loose only 1IMP pr. board if 50% fail etc 50% in.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|twcho: and she will find it out very quickly|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  2@h opener here looks like super refined flannery|pg||
nt|jcwla: Fairly common to use 2@H these days.|pg||
nt|twcho: and claim|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: I might was a bit hard by the NT with 9 auto. Can loose 3@H and 2@D.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: North (whose @D pip at Trick 2 suggested 5 @D's) is known to have 5 @D and 3 @H (no 1@h bid), thus some risk of club and @d overruffs. |pg||
nt|petergill: thus the playing off of @CA from dummy was premature|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Wang Hongli is the number one ranked female player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3828|pg||
nt|andyv:  for 6@h?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: .|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: alas @D4 was not high enough - what bad luck in the @D pips|pg||
nt|petergill: though S probably should have worked out that continuing @d had to be better than playing clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: as it was impossible for E to duck Trick 1 with anything other than a singleton club|pg||
nt|andyv:  or is that 5 or 6@h that they were showing?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 or 6|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3-trick difference if W tries to make.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, I misread the %- symbol|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 5-6@H :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Chayes:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: As the cards lie, the only line that might work is !J not covered, one more @D, then a heart ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: !!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi specs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Trick 1: @HQ play from dummy would make it harder for W to duck and retain transportation - a play worth remembering |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: There is grace in going down 1 here, it feels right even without the VG goggles.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: wow, making six|pg||
nt|petergill: this play could promote her up the world rankings, but  1 is as high as you can go|pg||
nt|petergill: with Qx under dummy's !AK, there is no reason not to cover @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South reasoned that @CA lead was the act of a person with a possible trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: If @H are 3-3, playing @H now is OK, and if @H 4-2, then must ruff @h now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: If u like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php |pg||
nt|petergill: makes no difference on this hand|pg||
nt|offthebend: actually it is not such a bad lead trying to beat the contract |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|patricck: down 2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: B22 OR ended as here 1NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: South plays North for !Axx in spades, e.g. @SAJx|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Anyway might happy that EW stopped.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: hence her @D play, playing West for @DQ due to non @d play|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  you've changed your tune, Jordan.  You used to think down one was bringing shame to the family|pg||
nt|patricck: the defence won't discard anything helpful, even the kibitzers at the next table know what the problem is on thsi one|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: as a few overruffs in the minors would only hold 2@s to 110, and the aim was to beat 2@S|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: A woman named Nadia explained to me the other day that the main reason we all find bridge so hard to play is that our education systems do not teach us much logical thinking, we ...|pg||

nt|rodal f: I just asked Chayes if any running scores. All results after the maths|pg||
nt|rodal f: match|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR 3NT aas here|pg||
nt|rodal f: *as|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a interesting on the last. Didn't E have a clear 3@C bid?|pg||
nt|jcwla: NS is such a tough pair that you can easiliy just get into that go-for-broke mode where you go down 4 there.|pg||
nt|jcwla: My family told me I was adopted, so that made it easier.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: if South was trying to beat 3@S, she would have played clubs not spades. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 OR also 4@H.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@H and 6@C both make|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new funny board|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be same result. Started @SQ and swiched to @C Tempo for the @D now|pg||
nt|twcho: so Philippines has got their first +imps in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: or if @H 4-2, then @S finesse |pg||
nt|petergill: Precision|pg||
nt|twcho: a bit conservative not to open a weak 2 with west hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7: Normal 3@H opening at other table yielded a dividend when North chose to Dbl instead of bid 3NT over 3@H|pg||
nt|patricck: North will open 2NT, but nothing good happens after that|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: 4@S might get doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new interesting board up|pg||
nt|jjsb: this one interesting also , its not that frequent u should play a slam on a 7 card fit rather than on a 8 card fit |pg||
nt|kerasidis: not tough to guess this auction will end in 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding them is another question|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 OR got @DA as the lead and found @CQ. for 6@S= Well done 13IMP to China.|pg||
nt|petergill: Ignore me, I was not quite with it then|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|offthebend: Spades OVER hearts |pg||
nt|twcho: can NS stop short of game?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wasted values at E|pg||
nt|patricck: would still have been OK for 4@H if the AQ@S were not both offside|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h is the limit|pg||
nt|twcho: is 2@c capp?|pg||
nt|twcho: showing any one suiter?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: so declarer preferede to play for @S fiensse (50% chance) than for person with short @H to have short @D (less than 50%)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are probably on our way to 3@D here.|pg||
nt|patricck: cards are VERY friendly for EW|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Park fints the solution to partners who open weak balanced hands : INVITE game|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1NT weak, Dbl pen, Rdbl = long minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: But how can E bid it now. Exlution blackwood the onliest.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, tks operator for confirming my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: but this is the time you would have wanted to be there :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: sadly, true|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but even though the @S are great, I can;t see myself forcing to game|pg||
nt|patricck: indeed, was not seriously suggesting East should do more|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: basically on a strong club|pg||
nt|jjsb: u try to overcall as far as poossible |pg||
nt|rodal f: Tapei made 710 at 4@H at OR and 2IMP|pg||
nt|patricck: I think it highly unlikely they will get to slam'|pg||
nt|woozle: I am suggesting East drive to game - AJTx worth about eight points on this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: this has a chance, but it is still possible that it may go down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: But what are N gona lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: Q@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7: with poor spade texture for 4@S, perhaps 3NT is the better choice over 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D artificial enquiry|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = long suit not clubs (would bid 2@C with clubs)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Presumably XX was forced and 2@d showed @d and a major|pg||
nt|henryb:  you see, sorry, Peter and I disagree|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the @C became more important|pg||
nt|twcho: I don't like such strategy as west|pg||
nt|twcho: I will like to bid my suit first instead of coming later|pg||
nt|twcho: of course this is personal style|pg||
nt|petergill: Bad breaks make this hard to amke, but @S9 lead brings dummy's @S65 into play later|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have given no clues in bidding to help declarer navigate this one|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
nt|patricck: goes down easily if the defence find their diamond ruffs of course|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|twcho: if their partnership can handle this, it is fine|pg||
nt|twcho: good job for NS to stop at the par contract|pg||
nt|twcho: now let's see whether she can make it|pg||
nt|twcho: she has danger of losing 3 trumps|pg||
nt|patricck: but even when they don't declarer has some work to do|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4 lavental as I play it|pg||
nt|patricck: The spades are a bonus but the rest of the hand looked limp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: slam was only a moderate proposition.... basically needing both @H and @C to be 3-2, which is about a 50% chance when combining both suits together|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: That looks more like it. |pg||
nt|twcho: probably she shd lead a small trump from hand now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Other table: normal @S4 lead to same bidding to 3NT, then Patrick Huang played @CA and CK, so surely he will go down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|hK|nt|patricck: hmmm, maybe that is too harsh|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I wondered why Pass was (possibly) not alerted|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well,I guess with AQTx you'd go; this is not much worse|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: @CK, then @DJ, then @S10 then @S6, but no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ ducking, playing for 3-3 @D, looks like a possible play now|pg||
nt|petergill: North's @D3 discard might be from 3 cards, but more likely from 5 or 6 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: @SQ play suggests to E that S has !J, so must have @SJ98x(x) and 5 clubs, thus not many red cards|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  Playing "DONT" runouts has become fairly common|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinks: As North did not bid over 2@C with long red suits, @HA is more likely to be in South's hand|pg||
nt|woozle: There's a lot of imps in bidding and making tight games on upgraded holdings|pg||
nt|patricck: I was disliking the lack of intermediates in the other suits, but I guess you can't have everything|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: even she goes down, there will still be a small gain for them|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jcwla: It is a light-looking 10 but I'm with you, Andy, this seems Milquetoast.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||
pc|c3|nt|tejjyid: 5-3 major fits are a real problem for the Precision 2@C opening|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|patricck: they lost one defensive ruff, there was 50 points chucked away|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: Was a safetynes but, ....|pg||
nt|petergill: North knew East had @S10 from @S9 lead, so N knew @S65 was in danger of setting up, so might have played nonspade then|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, i forgot, it was E not N who led @S|pg||
nt|petergill: S had better play @H now, or he will be re-endplayed in clubs |pg||
nt|petergill: S wondering whether to play @HA then @H9 to clear himself from being endplayed, or play @H9 or @H3 (putting himself in danger of later endplay)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|woozle: making two, but without that dreadful heart play, prospects were good for nine tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|offthebend: running the C10 to throw a D can not cost or finessing now |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: plenty to think about, since South has no idea what the @H layout is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jjsb: so +1 it is |pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhh not yet |pg||
nt|jjsb: have ti tap @d first if u play @s ruff its not working |pg||
nt|twcho: the moment of truth|pg||

nt|rodal f: Grand an d no comments|pg||
nt|petergill: About two years ago, superstar Patrick Huang sent about 2,000 emails to the other five players in his team to train them up to become champion players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: as a broad general principle|pg||
nt|patricck: I didn't know diamonds grew on vines :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kerasidis: i apologize for my many mistakes during typing |pg||
nt|rodal f: Not much to say here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h for NS although EW should go to 4@s despite the vul|pg||
nt|jcwla: Indonesia did bid the @H game on 6 so 10 more to them and NZ just hemorrhaging IMPs at this point.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part but where?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 OR also 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: wonder why OR will play in 3@s|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C to set up GF auction |pg||
nt|woozle: 4S here beaten by an early heart play; 4H beaten by a well-placed early club play|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: NT at W I hope, but will they be taken by NS activity?|pg||
nt|twcho: after they have found fit in @c|pg||
nt|woozle: If nobody bids game, whoever buys this hand will do well|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  matter of style here|pg||
nt|patricck: The members at my bridge club would be complaining that N/S are getting no cards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: both sides could make part-scores in a major, but EW will be satisfied with beating 1NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, and being dealer, would tempt me to open the North cards with a weak 2@S (normally 6 spades), but that is too random to be the French style. |pg||
nt|rodal f: By wich lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: 7@S is a good contract, 7NT is a bad contract which happens to be lucky|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: B21: 3@D+1 here and 2@S-1 at OR and one IMP for Tapei|pg||
nt|andyv:  those who play drury, would bid 2@c (one way) or 2@d (two way) with N hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: That is one heavy 2@H raise.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jjsb: rigth |pg||
nt|twcho: HK is the leading team after 6 rounds|pg||
nt|woozle: Kim might have done better to pass over 1NT; defending 1NT on a heart lead looks promising|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry about that, someone kicked the table over, but we're back now :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: I guess the aim here is to stop in 6@S and not reach 7@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: @h is best for defense as i see it |pg||
nt|twcho: probably south means 3@s to be forcing but north is taking a different view|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@c is cold|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: with short spades, it is often better to bid 2@H a bit light than to neg dbl, as the inevitable (in 2011) spade preemption might make a 2@H bid lead to easier continuations in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: competitive bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C from A no|pg||
nt|jjsb: not at all impossible to lead @c |pg||
nt|jjsb: yes |pg||
nt|jjsb: reasonable |pg||
nt|rodal f: Is to defancive normaly|pg||
nt|petergill: South might have acted over 3@C. With Axx in partner's preempt suit, an expert named Michael Courtney once told me you cannot pass ever. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Passing 3@c seems strange to me. I would surely bid 4@c, and possibly 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR at the road for 6@C and bidded it|pg||
nt|petergill: Their most common line-up is the older pair Jonky and Herstein, and the veteran star Patrick (who has won this event between 10 and 20 times, I think) plays with one of the three ...|pg||
nt|petergill: younger looking team members at the other table. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: Sun Ming is ranked  4 women player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3827|pg||
nt|jjsb: migth as well simply lead small @d |pg||
nt|jjsb: ok ..|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hoped for a @H9|pg||
nt|jjsb: so this one is making it a coffee board |pg||
nt|jjsb: not that it wasnt making but this one "simplify |pg||
nt|andyv:  W will pass as he is clueless as to where his tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|twcho: so another pick up by Philippines|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|offthebend: No way to go down in 3NT here -- lose 3 aces |pg||
nt|rodal f: If standard carding|pg||
nt|jjsb: brb so :) |pg||
nt|twcho: 6 imps would be|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H (no cue) = very minimum|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: 2nd is Macau, 3rd Malaysia|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South no unreasonably oping for 6@C tricks, 2 Aces and a @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  N gave S a lot of room on this auction|pg||
nt|jcwla: As it happens, they're not getting there no matter what unless N just drives them there.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B7. Here 6NT - some|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: When the diamond is led, East does best to duck smoothly|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: No free trick even if it seems so|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|twcho: China is picking up and back into the chasing field|pg||
nt|jcwla: But in the scheme of things, this may be one of NZ's best chances for a pickup.|pg||
nt|petergill: With trumps 4-1, a good decision|pg||
nt|woozle: Pele takes advantage of the second chance to bid her spades|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: North sould probably trust SOuth; the contract wasn't without chances|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps their fav vul 3@C preempts as dealer are normally 6 card suits?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: But tempo for the @H|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand, N-S will probably go plus here as West is unlikely to guess hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Sun Ming usually only plays international bridge every 2nd year, so being ranked  4 in the world is particularly good|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: surely they can find out that @DK is missing and stop in 6@S, e.g. 5@H asks about @SQ, 6@H response shows @HK and @SQ and denies @DK and denies @CK|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: A trump lead was best too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Free Willy. A and a new @C passive|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: +1 and next|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: At match I would have liked the 3@C opening but not at team. Ok. Style.|pg||
nt|patricck: I probably would have opened 3@C, but some of my partners are less forgiving if it goes wrong than others|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR open 1@C here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|twcho: it is difficult to reach game once north hasn't opened her hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jjsb: east knows now 4@c 2@d and 2 aces thats 8|pg||
nt|petergill: Compared to "Pass", in my opinion 3@D, 3NT, 3@S, 3@H, 4@C and 5@C are all better bids by South after "3@C Pass" |pg||
nt|patricck: A good win to Japan in this match will make an interesting battle for 2nd place, but will allow China to break away to a big lead|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: West can see he's giving up a @H trick by giving partner the ruff, but how does he know partner does't have 4@D?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Time enough for test the @C before a @D hook and 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: W not happy after see dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jjsb: so he knowes is partner need to have K of @h to make it interesting to defend|pg||
nt|kerasidis: other table is playing b5....5 clubs|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if he did have only 4, the @D K would be a 2nd ruff...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: *entry for a 2nd ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Yanhui Sun at the other table is ranked only  46 women player in the world - she was in China's winning team in the world championship in Philadelphia last year but not in their ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009 world champion team in Sao Paulo|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodal f: +@SA make 9 so minimice the board|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: so South's two aces were good for defence|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is straightforwardly 1-down; set up a @H for a @S pitch after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: perhaps 6@s showed @SQ but no useful king in one of our bid suits? I'm only guessing|pg||
nt|petergill: Having 8 trumps for slam is often thwarted by 4-1 break. 9 trumps for slam is so much more comfortable|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|petergill: With same hand and 5th @H, North would cue, and slam would be reached. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: B5 OR at 5@CN and here 1@SSX=      Need correct timing it seems |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|cQ|nt|patricck: since there are only 2 clubs out they must be breaking|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php Look at more than one board.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR are in the same troubble after 1-2-3@S from W|pg||

nt|twcho: declarer has little choice but to finesse the K|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if West had allowed him 2 entries could have got @c wrong|pg||
nt|twcho: so the actual hold up of trump A did not do the defense any favor|pg||

nt|twcho: in @c|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|twcho: so the holdup may backfire|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dT|nt|ianmcc: opportunity lost - but no standout|pg||
nt|twcho: defense is almost the same at the other room|pg||
nt|twcho: dummy is also being limited to one entry only|pg||
nt|twcho: given the point count|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d3|pg||

nt|twcho: did he really play out his last trump?|pg||

nt|petergill: might have to cash a heart before playing trumps in the scenario I was describing|pg||
nt|petergill: then +100|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
nt|jcwla: NZ on the board with 1 on 7 (130 vs. 100)|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3@C P 5@C doesn't cost much, even if 4@S fails - especially if East leads a @D to 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: or East might lead a club to 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some fun to come|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, the defense has founded the uppercut|pg||
nt|petergill: Patrick probably wrote something like that in email 1,673 of his 2,000 emails, but I'm only guessing|pg||
nt|woozle: At least EW are cashing out accurately, but the  board represents a plus position for australia|pg||
nt|woozle: EW may attempt a game here, but I can't see how they'll make it|pg||
nt|patricck: yes 25 points, but nothing like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: that was down 1 for 50 to EW|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so this must show something besides @s:)|pg||
nt|twcho: so sorry for all my previous comments. Game is not there with this defense|pg||

nt|rodal f: Spot to come? But might hard to stop early enough.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
nt|petergill: 11C Precision |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S balanced, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: North won't be denied bidding 4@H, hopefully West doesn't think about doubling|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang has also coached Chinese Taipei youth teams - they won U26 Championship last year|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D inverted, forcing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows stopper, hardly even alertable in the modern era, as it is so normal|pg||
nt|rodal f: B20 will become a =|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 1 IMP for China|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS have any agreements in place, 2@s, 3@s and 4@s should all be natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  and use the @d suit for cue bidding purposes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @H, 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|patricck: The 2@S opening is 5@S and another 4 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele didn't Really need to keep the bidding open with that poor 12 points and non working QJ in spades |pg||
nt|offthebend: max 8 tricks again on a natural D lead |pg||
nt|woozle: Kim bids as though she has a bus to catch. This could have been ridiculous opposite a singleton heart (but perhaps ok opposite a singleton spade - how could east know the ...|pg||
nt|woozle: difference?)|pg||
nt|offthebend: but accident may happen here if Pele puts up the Q |pg||
nt|patricck: declarer could finesse twice against the QJ@C and lose 3 @C tricks and the contract|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
nt|twcho: not everyone will open east hand with a bal 10 pts|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding looks normal to me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR might at the line now. Let's see|pg||
nt|patricck: If double was takeout from South I would do that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@H? Whay not 4NT if that road?|pg||
nt|twcho: and she is red|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been from me.|pg||
nt|patricck: will try to keep up the commentary hear, but have just been served dinner|pg||
nt|patricck: for that reason West wold do well to allow declarer a 2nd entry by way of the 10@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
nt|henryb:  6 of either red suit is not the worst contract ever seen|pg||
nt|patricck: wow|pg||
pc|c2|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR EW are out bicikling but S helped by 4@C and E bidded 4@D. Than W made it 5. Pass around.|pg||
nt|petergill: Will his hearts tempt him to try 3NTt now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S denies Hxx (H = A, K or Q) support, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: over the heart bidder|pg||
nt|petergill: Very well bid by NS|pg||
nt|patricck: did declarer really duck that?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite normal thees days|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural, 3@H = xxx support without top honour|pg||
nt|twcho: but still NS has founded the best contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  but won't make because of the bad @d break. and even 4@h needs careful play|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue as slam try, 4@H signoff|pg||
nt|twcho: even 3@s is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table is in 3@C after Patrick opened 2@D as dealer|pg||
nt|woozle: I dislike Paula's choice of the diamond jack (compared to a low diamond), like Pele's unblock, but Kim plays this hand as though all cards below jack are the same|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I agree, but you never know when a pair might have a different agreement in that area|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice value at @D now, but is it enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D3|pg||
nt|petergill: the imps seem to go to the side which strike the first blow|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||
nt|patricck: West is going to force declarer to take the winning line in clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|offthebend: oops - why did she throw the S |pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was good contract except for lack of tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Agree u there:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|nt|petergill: Nice play - @CJ was best, only because all other options looked bad|pg||
nt|twcho: west has founded the safest return|pg||
nt|twcho: but this is not adequate for defeating 2@s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Good @H play - devastating defence |pg||
nt|petergill: You ruff the 2nd club, play 2 top hearts to find the bad break, stop trumps perforce, and play @d by|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25. 4@CN-1 here and 5@DW-1 at OR made 4IMP for Malaysia|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do Fong feel him self inputted? |pg||
nt|patricck: very tight, low-scoring match so far|pg||
nt|rodal f: At this board OR ended 1NTE|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jjsb: and that contract is all about @c so |pg||
nt|twcho: with such good hand and good suit quality|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Like having the serve at tennis, you can strike first blow and ace the opponents, that perhaps was in email  849, but I'm only guessing|pg||
nt|patricck: Welcome Kursat|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|patricck: Help out these poor people, they have only had me to listen to for an hour or so|pg||
nt|patricck: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and a @H ruff to come|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: With the 16HPs Y. Agree u|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: So a presission where Weiwei should have had some lessons for some?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Only 2@Ds|pg||
nt|vbman: doubt if l can match you|pg||
nt|vbman: so this makes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kerasidis: or by north even if its not stronh|pg||
nt|petergill: leading low to king then low through the person with long trumps so a top @d doesn't get ruffed.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  somehow something seems amiss in the play of that hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jjsb: and = it is |pg||
nt|patricck: yes, the defence had the chance to allow declarer two entries to the South hand so that he could play 109x opposite K8x wrong, but they forced him to get it right|pg||
nt|vbman: checking again|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer could play low and then try to smother the other honour, but that seems far fetched|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: then concede a @D |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Had two nice free cards. Small @S or @D9 with the nice @D3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  a good play by Wang to tell partner not to ruff declarer's losing @d|pg||
nt|petergill: then pitch a @d on the club, to retain control|pg||
nt|henryb:  or ruff and play @sK, @sA and ruff a @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: Sorry, North is in danger of being squeeed - not good defence at all!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: u mean clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a good alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: North has pitched clubs, so the contract is safe, no matter what happens now|pg||
nt|petergill: If North pitches 2 spades instead of 2 clubs, 4@h would still have made |pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 3NT at OR. Will cost as here I belive. Was -2 at vul|pg||
nt|offthebend: so , NZ may pay for this overcall and keep opps out of a possible 4S contract |pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR at 5@S and here 5@H-1|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 10: West's duck of the @H at trick 2 was very good defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  a decent 6@s for N-S|pg||
nt|patricck: 12 tricks available in No Trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer play safe to get 8 tricks by refusing the finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D is hard to bid, but an excellent spot|pg||
mb|1S|nt|patricck: there are two important things West needs to know, the K@C and the @S singleton|pg||
nt|vbman: jump fit in sp will clear 1 doubt|pg||
mb|3N|nt|offthebend: 5H-1 had to be a loss bec 5S was cold |pg||
nt|rodal f: The Viking Club made by: Aa - Grøthein - Tundal are only by relays if for a natural bid comes up some few times.|pg||
nt|twcho: slam|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR now start B9. The grand slam.|pg||
nt|patricck: basically just needing 4 tricks from the @D suit|pg||
nt|twcho: 3N on for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Chinese Taipei Trials Final in 2010 and 2011, Patrick's team (oops, this Chinese Taipei team, I should say) beat a very strong team, most of whom which won the World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Transnational Mixed Teams in 2007. |pg||
nt|patricck: The North/South bidding might tell him partner is short in spades, but finding out about that @C honour is difficult|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but EW have a cheap sacrifice over NS red slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 1@S? 2@S? 3@S? much too strong for 3, IMO|pg||
nt|patricck: a chance if they bid it for Japan to take a commanding lead|pg||
nt|twcho: but of course it is almost impossible to reach such contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: not now :)|pg||
nt|twcho: not any more. :)|pg||
nt|woozle: paula will doubtless drive this hand to game, and it will probably be made|pg||
nt|vbman: if he feels to gamble|pg||
nt|vbman: must bid 4nt|pg||
nt|vbman: or even 5dia|pg||
nt|vbman: then west knows east has cl royal|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rodal f: Many specs who send me SMS now. Can't answer u all. Sorry.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT is a game forcing raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 5@C will end -1|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing to stop east from introducing his suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR E interruped with 2@D|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm, a surprising bid by East|pg||
nt|vbman: i think it may be ok|pg||
nt|vbman: sometimes u make|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe that will do the trick and get to 6@D|pg||
nt|vbman: sometimes u save|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: when the heart finesse wins declarer can duck a spade, so would make on a spade break then as well|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jjsb: 1@h P 2@h and probably 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: 280 make 7IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: The bomerange?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: ther rest of the defence was fine, but the outcome for NS was very poor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 180 minus 100 ake 2IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round China Hong Kong - China|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT has 9 top tricks, 4@H might be harder with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: But non vul so a 9IMPer for KIWI it seems.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3NT may be bid on this hand . 17 hcp and a 5-card suit is too good for 1NT opening |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision, 2@C clubs plus major|pg||
nt|petergill: when Precision was invented in the ealry 1970s or so and Chinese Taipei stunned the world by coming 2nd (or 3rd) in the world I think, Patrick Huang was a young star in that very ...|pg||
nt|petergill: first Precision team.|pg||
nt|woozle: Park doubles 1S, probably thinking that her lack of shape is compensated for by her minimum high cards|pg||
nt|offthebend: If paula bids game after this bidding --- hmmmm |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: well. almost top tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: 'make|pg||
nt|jcwla: A few choices for S on the rebid - anyone pick anything different?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW 28HP and all contracts down.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now by a @C lead|pg||
nt|twcho: OR North perhaps psychic|pg||
nt|twcho: and buy the contract cheaply at 3@d|pg||
nt|vbman: this is even ok|pg||
nt|patricck: would East bid that with no honours at all in the minor suits? Probably not, so 6@D may have been a possible punt at that point|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 2@S Smolen |pg||
nt|petergill: GF with 5 @H and 4@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Will W see the big value at @S8 or does it matter?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tempo on and home by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as here. @DJ drop. 2+2+4+4=12|pg||
nt|woozle: Perhaps not. I forgot this is the women's field....I'd be shocked to see that double in another field|pg||
nt|patricck: well let's face it game is no bargain on the NS cards, quite lucky really|pg||
nt|vbman: 5dia wd indicate a cl royal|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|woozle: 4H needs three out of four: heart break, DA onside, spade ruffing hook, spade break|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jjsb: North decided enough of discussion i want to play 4 @h and i guess this has no play |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the X from W K Lai noted to E?|pg||
nt|andyv:  rebidding AQxxx suits has never been a favorite...I'd rather raise @ss|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @h, 8+ HCP, GF|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner had either missing @S honour they could have doubled 3@S|pg||
nt|twcho: east is bidding to much|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: for west, her partner is showing a powerhouse and she has ace and 3 trumps to support her|pg||
nt|petergill: AKQ109xx is not 9 points - it is 7 tricks, hence must jump to 3@D - rebid of 2@D is only for pointcounters, not for good bidders |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: @CK lead leaves declarer with some work to do, to make 41H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Good stop by NS, but will the 5-1 break cause problems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: west said sorry sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him:) Clear quebids|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no|pg||
nt|twcho: I think they play with screen, right?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd try and keep the @H support a secret|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
nt|petergill: I would win @CA at Trick 1 and play @H, hoping they duck. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|twcho: so the 6@c is understandable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
nt|patricck: so if all those things were 50/50 propositions (I know they aren't) that would make game 31.25%|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|patricck: with only one entry in the K@D maybe a @C lead is a reasonab;e shot|pg||
nt|petergill: Will he try @h after @CA?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wel, that's a good start for NOrth and he can x-ruff his way home|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
nt|patricck: finding the good news straight away|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rodal f: B9 The wrong side made the ask but not finnished.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: oh claim 8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|offthebend: she ain't making 10 tricks any more |pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@HX at OR -300|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
mc|12|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
nt|patricck: now cash the diamonds and clubs and hope that East is squeezed in clubs and hearts|pg||

nt|vbman: machine dealt hands always have some kind of safety in them----- if u have a fit bid|pg||

nt|andyv:  strong xfer preempts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the askes W showed @S color.     3A - @HK, but never the nice @C AKQ9|pg||
nt|vbman: if e bids 1 h it will be lot easier|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: i wish i could hear them:)|pg||
nt|twcho: should S introduce his 2nd suit after 3S or the double?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: 1@d Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT might be a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part score to come again|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@c opening is precision style of course |pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 also 4@S as here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I usually don't have a 4 loser hand when I preempt but maybe I should try it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will not go gently|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might end in 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E didn't bid game, S must assume that N has some values|pg||
nt|twcho: actually if east opt to pass 4@h, it is not without chance|pg||
nt|petergill: My slip - i didn't notice South has void in hearts - sorry about that|pg||
nt|woozle: played with great diplomacy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 3@H som S? Pre emt|pg||
nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|rodal f: P|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If playing Stayman that can be weak, East would have bid 2@C directly over 1NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: 2@D ask|pg||
nt|twcho: if so, they may be able to push the opponent to one level higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and collect more money|pg||
nt|patricck: A quiet moment after all those games and slams and grand slams|pg||
nt|rodal f: As often at part score trumh lead again is right.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C is often weak, so NS have some work to do now, to reach 4@H|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rodal f: S are missing @DJ for have fynny cards here as well, but @DA10 can be droped|pg||
nt|offthebend: 10 card H fit but you can ONLY make 1H |pg||
nt|rodal f: Payout for some|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@C+ and 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: This can be -2|pg||
nt|patricck: I would have been happy with a simple negative double by East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same here, but there system might|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: To save or not to save?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max was 3@C|pg||
nt|offthebend: it was hard to get to 3NT by EW on this bidding |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could ...but N could not imagine it is 6 card|pg||
nt|vbman: sp set as trumps quickly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||
nt|twcho: this contract is destined to fail|pg||
nt|petergill: South should raise to 3@C, then 3@H by N?|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C just 4th suit, not agreeing @S i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so I add a "may". :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N would not be among my choices with two small @d|pg||
nt|petergill: A triumph for the weak 1NT here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: 4@S makes as long as declarer does not lose trump control|pg||
nt|rodal f: A two IMPer came as exspected|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D and 3@S|pg||
nt|vbman: next round maybe|pg||
nt|vbman: just imagine 1dia-2cl sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last round for today|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pele uses fourth suit, presumably to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rodal f: No relay so color. 2NT=relay|pg||
nt|jjsb: let see if they can find a better minors game |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||
nt|petergill: Good dbl by N, avoids the trap of bidding 5 over 5 with too few trumps (even though 5@S might make on perfect play)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 China made 1IMP|pg||
nt|jjsb: nice lead |pg||
nt|rodal f: Now E will hook once more for 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|vbman: no way to go wrong in sp|pg||
nt|patricck: well, actually I could go wrong in spades|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to take two finesses with this holding by leading to the 10@S and then running the Q@S from dummy|pg||
nt|vbman:  6 or 4 better?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|offthebend: why not a practical 3NT with S hand instead of 4th suit  ? 5m/6m looks awfully distant on that bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, NS play non-leaping michaels as one noted commentator speculated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure Patrick by a @S lead:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner might raise 2@S to 3@S; now 5/6 minor more interesting|pg||
nt|patricck: I get two finesses which is as good as anyone else, but when the cards are like this it is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, they don't play it (didn't see the dbl)|pg||
nt|twcho: now they may make|pg||
nt|twcho: finesse @s to discard the @h loser|pg||
nt|twcho: this is a serious mistake by east|pg||
nt|twcho: she has the @hJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 2@C=5@C+4M this time and a vul game lost|pg||
pc|c2|nt|patricck: because although that line should fail with the cards like this when the small @S is led from dummy it is very hard for South to duck smoothly with Kx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Or a auto after the bidding?|pg||
nt|woozle: What would that be? North can't have spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can have 3 of them, surely?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: I think N can be endplayed for 300 instead of 500|pg||
nt|twcho: so no way for south to misguess|pg||
nt|twcho: and her low @h return is of no plus side|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|woozle: I notice that she heard about a 5/5 shape and still just bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Look like play for Ax@D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 150 or 100 to NS. |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here. Normaly +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now a @D and small|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d would have been effective also in shutting out the @c suit|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just one more @D from here to make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|patricck: sirry @D and @C for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|petergill: Even underleading the spade at Trick 2 to @SQ would not have stopped the endplay for 300|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you prefer 3@H, Pass or 4@d on the East cards, Henry?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S always 7 but easy for OR to end an other place. Don't know there CC|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: Reasonable for N to run. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: -1 and not -2|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer was taking two finesses through North, he will be successful today|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: the lead has given declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Fav vul preempts as dealer can be very weak, and xx is not great support for running tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Not reasonable is South not raising to 3@C in my opinion. |pg||
nt|vbman: what does suitplay say for this combo?|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass 3@d as smoothly as possible, hoping South balances?|pg||
nt|patricck: lol, I don't have the excuse that English is a 2nd language :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so let go the impossible game|pg||
nt|twcho: it is really hard to predict the result. :(|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes N can be short in Hearts biut still needs very good minors and S card to explore a slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: again i admit i have some problem to open that hand 1@c but well systemic so.. no choice .. here thougth nto causing problem |pg||

nt|petergill: guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B23 at OR is 2@S W. Can be hard. Here it was 2@D+1|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Malaysia - Singapore (Open)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 ended 1NTN where this room played 2@D-1. Might a double score.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: Perhaps 3@C by North, or 2NT by North (playable in 2 or more strains, else would pass 1NTX) after the Dbl?  |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some system chec and next?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe 2C didn't deny that, but for me to be persuaded by a sequence I'd have to see how they can tell the difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any for 2/1 and 1NT by W?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 at other table: Patrick bid a direct 2@C over 1NT at the other table (despite memories of the -1100 hand in the Daily Bulletin a few days ago) and NS at other table are on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: their way to game|pg||
nt|woozle: Park doubles 2D, and she's right - it's not making|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: 1NT one round force minimum|pg||
nt|patricck: at least that allows the @S ruff, so there are 3 tricks and 1 @D before declarer thinks about trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes, that's reasonable - immediate 3NT (previous board) definitely pregmatic on South minimum-ish hand|pg||
nt|vbman: will balance and reach 2sp|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Does any lead beat 3NT?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope 4@D is forcing...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|offthebend: IS Kim going to Bid on -- doubtful opposite a passed hand !! East had to bid it |pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't think so|pg||
nt|woozle: EW don't diagnose the perfect fit, but to digress and examine NS's auction - I can't see why anybody would bid 2D if the most that your partner will bid with all working points, ...|pg||
nt|woozle: working singleton and a double-fit is give a simple preference|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, but I'm not a big fan of 3@C - I think Pass is OK. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR N in 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C guided South to 3NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: Might look at what the result could be if 1NT was 2/1. At @D contract u have some tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Patrick pass or bid 3@C over 2@s at other table - any takers? Please guess. |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Too late - he just bid 3@C|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but if you bid the value 4@H, the opponents might be shocked into bidding their @D game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vbman: blew a few tricks|pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||

nt|andyv:  and I think this is the last hand of this set.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A 2@S end NS?|pg||
nt|petergill: and South has merely bid 3@S over 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: so the 10 imps lost on Bd 12 is coming back to Taipei on Bd 13|pg||
nt|woozle: today the EW cards are freakishly distributed and 5D is making, but with more sedate breaks it could be a routine NS game|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula was a passed hand so Pele knew she would be playing opposite 8-9 points at most - and may push opponents into 5D  |pg||
nt|woozle: All of these arguments make me wonder - if you're going to take this ultra-negative competitive position, why bid at all?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzek: after lunch |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u. but 5@D could been bidded if the system was on. Anyway 150 and no looser comared 1@H pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems so|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1s 4 @s and next one ! :) (1@s is limited so i dont see slam there ) better not to give some help for defense (thouth it wil be the dummy) |pg||
nt|jjsb: now alternative of coruse is what North made |pg||
nt|jjsb: a splinter |pg||
nt|jjsb: well maybe im too pessimitic not to see slam there , my bad ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 NS tryed a slam by 4NT ask and ended 5@H . Here it was 4@H+1|pg||

nt|patricck: West won't pass that|pg||

mb|5C|nt|rodal f: Full press for nothing?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok, I'll stick around and ty later:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H is OK. Ain't strong enough for 3@D=revers|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 13: Excellent 3NT bid by Herstein, now that I think about it. He hit a minimum hand and cold 3NT on low HCP - the game is about tricks, not HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S or 2@C or Dbl now?|pg||
nt|vbman: might reach 6|pg||
nt|vbman: no make off course|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: E wants to bid something, but what?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|rodal f: he 15 ruul is a good one to use. If ure HP+@Ss make 15 u have for a opening.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula apparantly is an aggressive bidder - so Pele can hold back a little |pg||
mb|5S|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr all. 2@D obli|pg||
nt|rodal f: But might a CC variant by them?|pg||
nt|patricck: then it would need an alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|tejjyid: You should bid the value of your cards as you see them; partner's aggression is THEIR problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
nt|patricck: bridge has many recipes for disaster|pg||
nt|vbman: east hand is golden|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C artificial game try, playing Two Way Checkback|pg||
nt|offthebend: good and lucky part score bidding by NZ |pg||
nt|rodal f: 140 contra 300 ain't good|pg||
nt|offthebend: can collect 500 now on good defence otherwise 300 for sure |pg||
nt|twcho: the 1NT is a miniNT|pg||
nt|twcho: 10-13|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, where are we going here?|pg||
nt|petergill: If Dbl is t/o by East over 2@S, that would be nice, but is Dbl here t/o or penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@S=4@S+or 4@S and a longer color?|pg||
nt|rodal f: E have 11HP + 3@S = 14 Not a opening hand.|pg||
nt|vbman: 6cl|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Non know. But 4NT ain't bad if u find the @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: S need to pitch a bit by the @D. Still it's hard.|pg||
nt|petergill: 140 will be the outcome|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: on the previous board, Pele had 4! great cards opposite the 2 suiter; simple preference there cannot be a questions of "style"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: 3@H=4@S+and invit it seems.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: How I love minisplinter and splinter at team. 3@D from N=singel and @S support. 4@D=renonce|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make about 9 tricks in @D, perhaps 10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzek: 1@S = 4@S 10-14 may have longer minor|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E does not Open the bidding , the hand can easily get passed out |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 5+ clubs, 8+ HCP|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D asks |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jjsb: u can play on @h to discard a @c or play on @c to discard a @h :) i have more better card in club so im making +1 here :) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 2@D was forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h probably minimum|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should bid 2@D over 1NT - it'|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: 2@S showed 5+ spades and invitational, denied 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ened 2@SN. So might a new gain for Japan (L)|pg||
nt|patricck: declaarer won't be keen to finesse a club into the long spade hand|pg||
nt|patricck: What is an opening bid may be affected by the rest of your system. Another suggested offering is the rule of 20  which suggests that the HCP + the length of your 2 longest suits ...|pg||
nt|patricck: being at least 20 is a good indicator|pg||

nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: of all the recipes, 2nd guessing partner is the most dangerous|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  with A@c onside, this hand becomes even easier|pg||
nt|petergill: it's virtually always best to rebid your 4 card lower suit over 1NT |pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: For profile of China Women's team of 2009, with photo of N and S, scroll down at http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/equipechine09.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: and probably has @SQ to make up her 8 + HCP|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|jjsb: i think im making +1 also on playing @h thougth :) |pg||
nt|petergill: That allows EW to compete effectively |pg||

nt|rodal f: Esther in good mood?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told me 3@H was @S and invit by no shortage|pg||
nt|offthebend: In my opinion , NZ have bid and played better so far and scores show that|pg||
nt|jjsb: another 1@c this one the balanced hand |pg||
nt|petergill: The Results page has a Summary (overall scores) Page, and also the scoresheets and datums for each pair under each Round number|pg||
nt|henryb:  or @hQ. Which makes 12 even with only 6 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S failed on Bd 13, so 3NT rightsiding the hand was a much better bid than 3@S. Points schmoints. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B12 OR NS at 2@H. Here 4@H+1|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes over 1H , 3D is limit or better and I think over 1S , 3H is limit or better without shortage |pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 ended=|pg||

nt|patricck: wow, I have just played it through and I find it hard to believe|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Tapei can gain a bit here|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, possible to bid, but not so easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. There are some different rules made up. Which to be the best I will not argue abought. For me I drive the 15 ruul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: should be a pedestrian 4@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: *rule|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: This time funny card EW. Net's see if they bid the slam in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: 110, not 140, I should have written - I cannot count very well. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT good raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Puppet?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: % for it is bad 33-35% cirka|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT range is?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 22 and a solid 5-card suit -- no chance of a grand slam now -- at least I doubt it |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: Happy driving then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Heading towards 6@H, which is a lucky make with friendly @D position|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H is a bit less than 50%, needs @DK onside and 3-2 break, or bare king or maybe bare minor honour in @D |pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 14 at other table: I don't understand North's Pass of 1NT - it's a bidder's game, and nil vul is the best vul to compete on (only 50 + 50 = 3 imps out if you're wrong)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Could we check Paula McLeish is still at the table.... did she really pass on the North hand over a 1@H opening?|pg||

nt|twcho: don't understand why N hasn't supported south's @s?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: There's a good case to bid something on the East cards, especially if 2@S shows spades and a minor. The argument is that if you don't bid something, partner will surely lead the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: For any NZ fans out there, datums for NZ Open Team's pairs in Rounds 1-7 are: B-C +19, +14, +8 and -30, T-W -19, -13, -5, +24 (vs P Huang) and -18; B-L -51, -31 and -23. |pg||

nt|petergill: How should 6@h be played?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|patricck: I tracked down the system card. 2@S was a 5-5 hand with 5-6 losers|pg||
nt|petergill: Strip black suits then play @D how?|pg||
nt|petergill: how about low @D towards queen, so that bare king has to give ruff and discard?|pg||

nt|robbroy: if michaels as in other room can be weak or strong - East has a free bid of 3@H to show a better raise in one room but cramped here|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|petergill: or should you cash @DA earlier, then if West drops bare @D king, use preserved @CQ to endplay West if West has @CK?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||

nt|robbroy: tight defence required|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
nt|robbroy: bad start for Singapore|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2NT here? System faul? 1NT by 15 and....|pg||
nt|robbroy: they play a version of blue club|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|alok_daga: NV VS V North did not enter the auction?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps this sort of thing - attention to detail - explains why Australia and China are at the top of the leaderboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Patrick Huang would have played it right|pg||
nt|woozle: whether you win or duck the spade, you'll need the diamond finesse for the contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
nt|robbroy: open 1@S with weak hands or 4 card suits I believe|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes for his usual great job as operator. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|by: eh, ok, likely a dull board, but not flat ... |pg||
nt|petergill: Still on Bd 15: Given no !J lead from J109x, best play is @d8 towards dummy, duck if bare king appears, else rise with ace and elad low towards queen. I think.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rodal f: Not as I've seen but u're might right.|pg||
nt|robbroy: 3@S to ask for @C but count was preferred so a guess for N now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|robbroy: they have been playing a canape system for about 25 years - they may have changed but I think not|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: There were 4 matches today, so players are allowed to be tired and miss best play. |pg||
nt|by: more like 1 to INA, I miscounted.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||
nt|woozle: This club ruff line looks shaky - hard to reenter dummy|pg||
nt|patricck: this table has been quite fast, they still have several boards to go in the other room. The next match starts approximately 1 hour from now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|petergill: If played by North, same inference applies of "no J109x lead", so best play switches areound a bit if North declares 6@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
nt|kerasidis: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|twcho: so all the errors add up to a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||
nt|twcho: then he will be able to establish his @c before defenders establishing the @s|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an intriguing hand|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|robbroy: thank you all for your good comments and viewership (is that a word?)|pg||
nt|twcho: possible for a throw in to get 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
nt|patricck: We have certainly had some interesting cards, let us hope that the next match (in about 2 hours) is equally interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
nt|robbroy: a moral victory for Singapore|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok see u all guys in 45 minutes !! thanks again ! |pg||
nt|petergill: Lucky I wasn't declaring 6@H, - we'd still be waiting for me to decide how to play it. :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 3NT play = @D , @C9 to king, 2nd @D. Cannot play small club to ten in 3NT, as West can insert jack to block clubs. So @CQ, @CA, @C10, spade up. East has to give you a @H or @d ...|pg||
nt|petergill: trick = 9 tricks. So this is bad for China, perhaps|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
nt|henryb:  they made 3N in the other room|pg||
nt|twcho: should be possible as east open red vs white|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: See u all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Director here|pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhhh |pg||
nt|jjsb: well 3 @h bid migth be the problem |pg||
nt|jjsb: i was about to point that aspect that normally if the defense bid a 2 suiters u cue the bid to say u cotnrol that suit |pg||
nt|jjsb: so im not sure if the explanation was same at both table |pg||
nt|jjsb: South migth point out if he know that there is no @h cotnrol he would have lead a @h ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|patricck: was down if that was ruffed|pg||
nt|patricck: well if it was ruffed an don the diamond exit South didn't cover|pg||
nt|woozle: Sad as declarer - you can make the rest on a squeeze, but the defense can't help but break it up|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: When are we to see Faith and GEO at mix in the aeria?:)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  if dummy every comes down with an AKQxx of side suit after opener has bid a strong @c, it's cash out time|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: Spec told that 2@S is 6@S+ and a opening hand at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: See u later a time. Non know when:)|pg||
nt|granguru: es la otra patty|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: 6-4 shape is as good as a 7 card suit, just as 7-4 shape is as good as an 8 card suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round start in 20 min |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: French Polynesia - Chinese Taipei (Open)|pg||
nt|woozle: now a stepping-stone squeeze|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you All :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: See you tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: other table: a Minus 1100 result from a weak NT on Bd 13 has added more relief for French Polynesia|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 18 imps the margin|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
nt|woozle: as long as the last trump is played off|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: B14 here 4NT-1    At OR 5@H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  save the brain work for the tougher hands|pg||
nt|petergill: West sensibly tried to beat 4@S (e.g. if partner has @SA instead of @CKQ), but might have cashed @HK first |pg||
nt|patricck: wrong order|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: The last board at OR ca be a push but belive a gain for the Kiwi|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass around|pg||
nt|rodal f: Next segment start in 40 min|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lots of mistakes (big) but a few less by NZ|pg||
nt|super nova: With the Grand slam in D hand it would have been possible to bid 5nt saying we have all the key cards and the Queen, what do you think of 7.|pg||
nt|super nova: With solid clubs would have been an easy decision.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: with Lusje Bojoh, an excellent player from Sumatra, playing 3NT as recommended here|pg||
nt|petergill: Last board, thanks Chayes, thanks all, that's all the bridge today from Kuala Lumpur, play resumes tomorrow|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Bulletins 1 to 4 at http://www.2011apbf.com/Bulletins.htm|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: in case a heart from dummy can be pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: next round start in 30 min|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty everyone and ty peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Indonesia - China (Ladies)|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Chayes, bye everyone, until the next match in about 30 minutes I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty specs for joining us and making this a lot of fun.|pg||
nt|petergill: that last board might have been 480 (not 450) on the red suit squeeze - it doesn't matter, the official scoresheet at http://www.2011apbf.com/ will tell you eventually|pg||
nt|petergill: Not like Eddy Manoppo to miss an easy squeeze play|pg||
pc|h5|mc|8|nt|patricck: this is the last board, thx again to Chayes for the Vu-Graph, I hope you have all been entertained.|pg||
nt|vbman: bye|pg||
