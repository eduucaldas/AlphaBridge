mb|p|nt|vbman: quantitative will save this hand or will end the auction|pg||

mb|3N|nt|p m g: As a spec asked: EW need to do thing. They did at last board.|pg||
nt|dslee: good bid by  S- this would open dooors for sure|pg||
nt|dslee: lots of players fumble with these hands in a red vs white position|pg||

nt|hawe45:  One @S more than promised|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: dint like 4333|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|eamongall: Is'nt BBO great ... I remember when we used transparencies and projectors for vugraph presentations |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|p m g: For them h don't know. At 2/1 1NT is force by one round |pg||

pc|s2|nt|dslee: good sac|pg||
nt|dslee: @H lead is mandatory while @D lead is tempting :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  @D-lead is OK - with a switch|pg||
nt|dslee: shoud lead @H , since S has a singleton @H|pg||
nt|dslee: not much of prospect for a @D ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzgz: stirbu said it isnt forcing|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|edmunte1: a @c return could have been more usefull|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No big difference, but better play to let the first @S go to hand - and then ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|edmunte1: Ghigheci thought that double should mean a @d lead, but str is @s lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I will sit back and think about, WHEN a lead from Q x x x x x x is good...?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|blum1956: Maybe it were better to play the @cQ before trumps|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe not so strange ... 1@D is @H transfer .. and Pass is no fit .. but I would not think of it |pg||
nt|dslee: these leads are effective when Kxx is on Table and declarer has the J and ptr has the Q :) and of course Jx with declarer :) here I guess the assumption of the lead was to see ...|pg||
