nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S from England/Scotland|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Paula Leslie has been living in London for about 10 years|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: The Russia team is packed with big names. The England team are not so well known (although all good players). They have done well to be within 1 IMP at the half-way mark. |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: King asking for count|pg||
nt|brolucius: The East hand is a nightmare for those who say that they play 2@C as a forcing rebid.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pretty normal approach in UK|pg||
nt|brolucius: What, to play 2@C as forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, read above. King asking for count|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: This Russia team beat another England team yesterday (Duckworth, Callaghan, Stockdale, Cope).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Comprehensively even|pg||
nt|brolucius: I know some players who refuse to read anything about playing in a 4-3 fit, since they claim they would never end in such a spot.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is also the contract in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: I think we would all get there|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brolucius: This prepares a cross-ruff for the defenders, if declarer should fail to draw trumps (going for heart ruffs).|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Some claim that the mood of a set is established by the first board. But I don't know if that applies to some part-score. |pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: now a possibility for a twrow in on N|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an| |nt|mwigor: i see i missed the first lead change of the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an| |nt|mwigor: i will admit to my bias and tell you that i am hoping for an even number of lead changes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|brolucius: Eight tricks in the majors, plus three diamonds and the club ace, would give you a slam. But justice will be done if anyone strays that high. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 20 opposite 11 and two 4-3-3-3 hands. That does not add up to a good 6NT. |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many of us may have discovered this the hard way in the past.|pg||
nt|mwigor: 20 opposite 11 rarely yields slam even if both hands are 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has nine tricks on top and might, possibly, end with no more.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: If there is a fit, yes|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mousheen - re-double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: zero unuseful card|pg||
nt|davpro: They hit the right spot|pg||
nt|lml: the double may have given away the show|pg||
nt|mareczek: East - Frnaces Hinden is regarded as one of the best women player of Great britain, but never playing in women competition, only in open|pg||
nt|psyck: W may have shown about 19-20 HCP after that strong @c auction, so easy stop in 3|pg||
nt|psyck: aaah, W seems to have devalues with 4333|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Operator, EW are from Norway (you have Netherlands flags)|pg||
nt|davpro: At the other table htey bid a limit 3@s. One step to high|pg||
nt|lml: I think they still cant quite make it though on the spade lead|pg||
nt|lml: I dont like the double much|pg||
nt|lml: it may be that they play that Cope was required to bid or double|pg||
nt|lml: the "forcing pass"|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: S still thinking...|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled suggesting a heart lead but got a spade instead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S asks W about auction...|pg||
nt|lml: prehaps he wants to see if the double was "forced"|pg||
nt|lml: then it wouldnt necessarily show heart length|pg||

mb|1H|nt|brolucius: If the spade trick had not been ducked, South would have had a spare card in his hand and would not have been squeezed. Ducking a spade 'rectified the count', as it is called.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S looks good, but it can't make on best defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|mwigor: "her" hand|pg||
mb|3D|an| |mb|p|nt|brolucius: East views her hand as (much) too strong for a 4@S overcall.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I agree with only four losers at these colours|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now, surely, 4@S.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Although 4@S has a pre-emptive effect, which can be quite useful on a different layout|pg||
nt|mwigor: if the defense are careful this should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you are always guessing when you have long suits like that.|pg||
nt|brolucius: !K lead is dangerous, but could be right on occasions. Perhaps a heart is best.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The hand was played by West at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Gromov had an easy heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: These are very short matches and a big swing out (whether by luck or a mistake) is hard to get back.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: the downside of having west as declarer is that the contract is very easy to beat if that east hand is on the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade 10 lead would give an entry to dummy for a club cash. But if you lead a trump, you should lead low.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Good girl, leading partner's suit|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: I hate that LOW diamond switch. How can South know which ace partner has. A, UNDO to correct to the 8. That's better.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, and @D8 even|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: To deny interest|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Exactly. There was a famous misdefence for a top German women's pair, when they switched to a low diamond from x-x-x and partner continued the suit.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|mwigor: i hope they're not playing reverse count|pg||
nt|mwigor: if so that @c5 looks like a poor choice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why? She is giving count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low-high odd number|pg||
nt|mwigor: if natural count then @c5 is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We saw that earlier when @SK was led|pg||
nt|brolucius: North can probably read declarer's shape in diamonds, after South refusal to continue the suit.|pg||

nt|blum1956: you have 4+ clubs|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mwigor: although if that restriction is not placed upon it then it seems a better bid|pg||

nt|brolucius: It was not such a bad game to attempt, particularly when vulnerable, but the cards have not been kind.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West knew it was likely to be borderline when he bid game.|pg||
nt|mwigor: if @d10 had been doubleton it would have made in comfort|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  4@H bid courtesy of strong @C system|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|lml: I would|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: but I agree it is borderline|pg||
nt|jkotor: and one can expect finesses to work after opening "before" 1nt overcall|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|lml: and with bad heart spots maybeyou are right|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|davpro: still makeable though|pg||
nt|lml: today players are opening weaker hands because it is such an advantage to open the bidding|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: every plan works but the current one(|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  might be another IMP for Pony|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42:  nope , also +1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|pelu: in OR West play small in @S - and A from N ???|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
nt|blum1956: If West will not open the bidding, 3@h is a possible contract for NS. Also 1 down|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  any ruling on the wrong explanation of 2@C on 20?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  that suddenly seems very important|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  other two ties still exist with 2 to play|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: Mixed Teams - Round of 4/1 should begin at 15:30|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|lml: East-West can certainly catch up... they need to regroup at the break|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so barring a score correction by declarer, it seems Pony is through to the QF|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  thanks all!|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: thank you all!|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer tried to use the only adverse distribution giving a chance - @sK with W, @s10 with E|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Pony won with 1IMP!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think that there will be no correction - after 2@D it was clear to east what S had|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Please remember about the next round, which should begin tommorow at 10AM|pg||
nt|blum1956: Anyway some TDing possible after the innocent team looses with 1 imp|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: TD give 3IMP to WildGriffin|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: gave*|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Pony will appeal that I will assure you|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Yes, Gotard askes about appeal|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: asked*|pg||
nt|blum1956: an appeal coming? Or that was just a procedural penalty?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so we must wait|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: it was a adjusted score|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so there will be an appeal|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: probably of course|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I figure not probably|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: but I must close this room|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so goodbye all!|pg||
nt|blum1956: bye|pg||
