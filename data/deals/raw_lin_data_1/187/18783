mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psyck: this barrage will make it difficult for NS to find 6@h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4 NT by W - 5@H by E ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5h is a decent contract but i suppose e has good defence|pg||
nt|sharkey: trump lead best for off 3 - else -1|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||

nt|jcomyn: mousheen - re-double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: zero unuseful card|pg||
nt|davpro: They hit the right spot|pg||
nt|lml: the double may have given away the show|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Operator, EW are from Norway (you have Netherlands flags)|pg||
nt|davpro: At the other table htey bid a limit 3@s. One step to high|pg||
nt|lml: I think they still cant quite make it though on the spade lead|pg||
nt|lml: I dont like the double much|pg||
nt|lml: it may be that they play that Cope was required to bid or double|pg||
nt|lml: the "forcing pass"|pg||
nt|lml: but it would be an unusual treatment since Cope preempted|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
nt|lml: they have reached 6@c in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: there North made a nice bid over 4@S|pg||
nt|lml: I think Gromov was thinking about it too ... he bid 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S still thinking...|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled suggesting a heart lead but got a spade instead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S asks W about auction...|pg||
nt|lml: prehaps he wants to see if the double was "forced"|pg||
nt|lml: then it wouldnt necessarily show heart length|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Crouch|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Teasing Simon Cope is Peter's speciality|pg||

pc|s7|nt|sharkey: I know - Used to live in the 2nd largest Polish city|pg||

nt|benjy:  so 2@S actually shows 9-12?|pg||
nt|lml: if they did then east probably would have bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but 2@D shows it was not|pg||

nt|jcomyn: that 3rd d is a nuisance|pg||
nt|benjy:  why?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|an| |nt|pitiful:  they might well do but 2nd seat the suit is weak and playable in @h|pg||

mb|4D|nt|vugraphpl2: so we have intervention of TD|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 5 IMP for DeBotton if N make 1NT - but not easy|pg||
nt|pitiful:  neither would I|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
nt|blum1956: If West will not open the bidding, 3@h is a possible contract for NS. Also 1 down|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  that suddenly seems very important|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: Pony won with 1IMP!|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I think that there will be no correction - after 2@D it was clear to east what S had|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: Please remember about the next round, which should begin tommorow at 10AM|pg||

nt|blum1956: an appeal coming? Or that was just a procedural penalty?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so we must wait|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: it was a adjusted score|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: so there will be an appeal|pg||
