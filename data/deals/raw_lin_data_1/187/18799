nt|brolucius: Jeffrey Allerton and Frances Hinden (who is playing at the other table) are a couple, and have won the prestigious Gold Cup (Britain's top knock-out) together.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So far as I know, Hinden has never played women's bridge. She is a top executive for an oil company.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do we know about their systems?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W were playing straightforward stuff against Russia. I assume that the French play the standard French system, near enough. It will be good kibitzing.|pg||

nt|brolucius: We thought, in the match against Russia, that they seemed to be playing reverse suit-preference. So, maybe she has asked for a club.|pg||

nt|dburn: another almost-slam|pg||
nt|dburn: but these key cards are real ones|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The losers in the semiinals will win a bronze medal. They do not play off for third place; excellent idea if you ask me|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|danilo1: y ... thk should be made so in all sports|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|blum1956: I do not agree - they should play if the schedule of the championship permits|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p!|an| |nt|danilo1: just 2@S is intro to 4NT later :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe E did not have a systemic 2@d opening available|pg||
nt|peachy: East either does not have a weak two in diamonds available or it maybe falling into too strong gfor weak teo and too weak for one level|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg: S's initial is F, not H. her name is Frances|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 3@H showing 5+ @H, 4@S obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: The idea came from box where it looks strange to fight for bronze putting your health under pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Normally, one should play this 5-4 hand inversed, jumping in the 4-card|pg||
nt|hedyg: in France the 2@d opening is a strong bid and if not it is multi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and she is from England (not France)|pg||
nt|peachy: Frances in one of England's finest players and as far as I am concerned, the best hand analyser I have seen|pg||
nt|Walddk5: all well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: She is also one of our regular vugraph commentators. Finch is her user ID|pg||

nt|psyck: *will now|pg||
nt|peachy: Nice club spots. help bring this home|pg||
nt|hedyg: same contract, different bidding in OR|pg||
nt|peachy: Another hand where the value of big spot cards is a factor of make or go down|pg||
nt|psyck: while winnin in hand to play @c 1st has the risk of W playing @d putting the contract in danger|pg||
nt|hedyg: E opened 1@D there, double by S and 3NT by N|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|danilo1: surprised ... but do ot know agreement ... usually, Dble and than @S should be stronger than just 3@S|pg||

nt|peachy: West does not need suit pref signal on what to return, looking at the spades and clubs  on the table, normally the next diamond is suit preference|pg||

nt|rcerreto:  with 2@d?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Closer to 3@S than 1@S, perhaps.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  1@s looks a little timid to me|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|ralfwil: a 6-card suit @hK and a stiff @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spade game needs to be bid.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  good sacrifice in 5@d|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I don't know that 1@H was right when East had indicated the majors.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe it was also meant to show real @c|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  unsure though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me a strong 3@s rise and an invite to 4@s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: Allerton may have misread 3@H but East can correct.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, this is the sort of board we were looking for, after so much drab stuff.|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  he has a pretty good hand, in context|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but you agree with the strong rise David?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Presumably intended as that. Since 1@S shows very little, as I see it, East might also consider 3@S.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but the best with this bidding is that W has shown his @h honour|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  maybe their standard for free bids is higher than yours and mine|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Although we may quibble with the odd bid or two, it seems that the players have judged it very well around the table. |pg||
nt|rcerreto:  anyway, they succeeded in bidding the par|pg||
nt|brolucius: The term 'free bid' was responsible for a lot of awful bidding many decades ago.|pg||

nt|400 volt: but 3 NT has the chance opps not leading @D, too|pg||
nt|400 volt: What's better? ;)|pg||
nt|psyck: The previous session played by the Badger team started with a 2 imp score after the 1st handful of deals too|pg||

nt|hedyg: though surely 3@D by a passed hand would not be strong here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|400 volt: 4@H is fore sure not the best choice - especially at this layout|pg||
nt|psyck: E hoping 2N will be interpreted as minors & W will figure S has majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lets try again, 5@S + 4+m OR 4@S+5@h, not just @ss|pg||

nt|hawe45:  This lead should bring you the NOBEL Peace Award|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 imps where?|pg||
nt|chmitty: I was commenting in private that I believe the scores are wrong for board 15 /16 in closed room|pg||
nt|psyck: many play system on after intervention & 1@s=4+ cards, & x denies 4 cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: probably just 9 tricks after this lead (provided that West does not discard @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: records from Poznan show that Badger accumulated 6Imps and not 4 on these 2 boards|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@h-(x)=support|pg||
nt|hedyg: since we did not see the play we have no idea|pg||
nt|chmitty: so "my" (unofficial) scoring at this stage is 27-18|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: ah ok , so the difference is 9 then|pg||
nt|ritong: ok  ty pierre for the input|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a thirs hand opening, but I can take 170 extra if declarer makes|pg||

mb|4S|nt|danilo1: good score for NS in OR (minor game is usually good score) ... but 4@S and 4@H work as well|pg||

pc|d3|nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|danilo1: guess North should not pass 4@D ... he is strong|pg||

nt|blum1956: The @hA and the @dQ with South looks enough for 5@d|pg||
nt|psyck: N showed extras after the non forcing 1NT, S could just bid 5@d if 3@s denied 4 card @h|pg||

nt|psyck: N contemplating slam maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: in case S has single @c|pg||
nt|danilo1: since denied 4-card hearts already .. North may propose 4@H (true - I would prever Hxx for that)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Better to risk a double in the first place.|pg||
nt|Walddk3: An excellent 6@D now|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer could have the singleton king of clubs only if she had about ten cards rather than thirteen|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  can declarer have one more @d one less @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on NS - a nice contract|pg||
nt|rcerreto:  N was declarer, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk3: In theory, there is a club ruff, but fortunately for declarer, the defender with the singleton club also has @DA|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||

nt|brolucius: West did not open on the 10-count at the other table, and N/S then shut them out for two down NV in 2@H. But more IMPs away, since 3NT failed.|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, the match has drifted away from the gallant Badger team. Well, I think they have played excellently and I salute their triumph in reaching the semi-finals. Well done, indeed!|pg||

nt|brolucius: The stuffing was knocked out of them in this second half by the events on the two 'slam hands'. Of course, it might have gone differently but that's bridge.  |pg||
