nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||

nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||

mb|4H|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||

nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||

nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||

nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||

nt|newmoon: 7@C - no finessing - ruff a spade in West after getting pitches on @Hs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

pc|hA|nt|glensa: i think on this auction a double by south of 3d should show a better hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin:  here is a good example of declarer being able to take advantage of defensive carding|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that she rose ace of diamonds, seems like she wants to be in dummy to either lead trumps or high clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tec123: My choice would be a @H as well - I tend to attacke againt 3NT, but would lead a @S against 1N say where defense can take their time to look for tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||
nt|gavin:  not sure I like unblocking the Ten, EW are going to get their hearts in|pg||
nt|gavin:  at some point in the trump drawing process|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||
nt|gavin:  but its a purposeless entry once the opponents play hearts|pg||

nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||

nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: ignore me|pg||
nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|gavin:  so with 5 boards to play the 84 imp lead will be enough for Joel to capture the 2nd USA birth in the Venice Cup|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|newmoon: good defense.  The trump split also complicates matters somewhat    looks like -1|pg||
nt|tec123: South must discard a @H if declarer ruffs high or it can still be made double dummy|pg||

nt|glensa: Now an odd form of restricted choice applies. |pg||
nt|glensa: Given that south led from the queen of hearts 3 or 4 times instead of a diamond, it is much more likely that north has the diamond queen|pg||

nt|newmoon: Egypt is in 5@C in OR on 17|pg||
nt|jjsb: cute hand |pg||
nt|glensa: if north passes this hand I'm leaving|pg||
nt|jjsb: i will follow u :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: thougth not sure where u go :) |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jjsb: he will open that 1@h thougth i guess |pg||
mb|1N|nt|newmoon: after 3@S by South opening, 3NT by West, North 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 2@H shows 7-9pts and 3 card support in @S|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@H = trf = good raise, Tim?|pg||
nt|glensa: I prefer a 4club opening showing a strong 4h hand myself, but 1 heart is certainly not wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: I don't know what east is thinking. The shape and high card positioning is wrong for a double|pg||
nt|glensa: the inspired heart lead was found at the other table, after which the double club finesse leads on down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 4@s migth be as strong as that glen ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|jjsb: 4@c|pg||
nt|jjsb: sorry |pg||
pc|c9|nt|tec123: This is a need help try in @H|pg||
nt|tec123: I agree 3rd in hand at white 3@S looks right - its a bidders game these days|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT = max and 2 stoppers in @S.   Presumably 2@C stayman shows values |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|glensa: it is always subject to partnership agreement, but I play this as 9 tricks with some defense|pg||
nt|jjsb: patrice cant bid 3@c cause its showing a 55 but i really dont like the 2@c rebid he has to do ... |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|newmoon: was 4@S unilateral?|pg||
nt|tec123: I see 5@C made - looks like there was never a @H switch when in with A@C - 3N a better contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tec123: Very difficult lead for South = a club may let it through though declarer can always make by dropping the K@S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|glensa: thanks for pointing that out. I would have rebid 4 hearts instead of 2 clubs, just on the risk it got passed out|pg||
nt|jjsb: i mean Jxxx K xxxx 10xx what her partner will do... |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|glensa: declarer should elope with 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|newmoon: Bosie hoping the "good raise" shown with 2@H has helpful cards elsewhere|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|glensa: nice surround play, declarer erred by playing the ten, but east erred by not overtaking the seven|pg||
mc|8|nt|newmoon: now, kibs... how did Bosie know to play @SA?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|tec123: With spades 4-4 and club right 3N can make EW - 5@C down as @H finesse loses|pg||
nt|newmoon: A-K-J-10 7th is solid?   today it is, with Qx dropping!    LOL|pg||
nt|jjsb: P P 1@d x P and..  i guess actualy not much choice and u have to bid 1@s |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: oh ok .. see patrice like to overcall solid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||
nt|tec123: With 2 quick tricks East should pass rather than bale out to 4@C despite lack of @S stopper - potentially a very good result for Tunisia|pg||
nt|glensa: this might end the auction|pg||
nt|jjsb: can we considere that "solid"?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jjsb: i am a doubler Glen , am i wrong?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|glensa: that is defintely solid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glensa: I am with Patrice on this one. I don't much value the q of diamonds, and don't want to play a 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|jjsb: good point |pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: an ace is the std. lead against a gambling 3NT... gets encouragement|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry trouble with connexion...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|newmoon: West made a "state of the match" bid... knows that up to now, they have had a good session in this room|pg||
nt|tec123: 4@H should make as well though as @H are 3-3 and the same club suit is equally useful|pg||
nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
nt|tec123: The 4-3 fit will play well here though I would have chosen 3@C rather than 2@S as the 1@H bid rather than double denied spades|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|tec123: Maybe 19 & 20 will be swingy - still not a flat match as 66 IMPs have changed hands already|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jjsb: ok so just made it will be as far as i see |pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|glensa: this is ping pong play and defense. Donde asked for a spade, got a diamond, which Patrice should have discarded a spade on|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|newmoon: a lucky make here as South and not North has the dbleton @C|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|glensa: this should be just in, another good result for egypt as ns can make 2s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tec123: running the 81S would have worked better, but with N having J@S this will still come home|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jjsb: 4@s will be reached here i assume |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|newmoon: both rooms are playing fast now... seems that there was a time warning.   Both operators couldn't keep up with play|pg||
nt|newmoon: as we said before 1@h maybe with 4 cards and 1@s relay|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: the spade split is very rude for declarer|pg||
mb|2N|nt|newmoon: and yes, Tim, bd 16 could have been a wash in 3@Dx both rooms.    Really, was that a 3@D bid, vul, 1st seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: surprised she did not opeen 1nt as they are playing that weak vulnerable ... |pg||
mb|3C|nt|jjsb: they migth change ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: well ok maybe they changed... |pg||
mb|3H|nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|glensa: sylvain, is this reunion style to rebid 1nt, i am a raiser to 2 spades|pg||
nt|glensa: 2nt must be conventional|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, South 1NT, North 3NT, swish|pg||
nt|tec123: A spade lead can beat 3N provided E snatches his aces when a minor suit is played|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: possible dble-swing now.   200 here + 100 from OR = 300 = 7 IMPs to Tunisia             provided they get 3@H here -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: we are french .. so i guess we are not "used" to that 3card fit ... i like also 2@s here |pg||
