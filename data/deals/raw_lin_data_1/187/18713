nt|jcwla: So here we go with a big @C opening, what is the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  this would explain S taking so long over 2@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would have thought so but in that case what is p/c by the 2@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weak|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  ok, don't know because hand doesn't match what I would expect for p/c|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Wonder if neg X ain't better to use at the long term over 2@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @D in hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: The first costful one?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  since 4@h wasn't making, this may not be a great save|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
nt|petergill: when China lost the 2008 World Championship final by one imp, excellent Chinese people like Jack Zhao consoled them by telling them that he would help them become champions in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009, correctly as it turned out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: N with a sure trick is there to wield the ax and bidding 5 over 5 is not in the picture at this level so W has elected to "take insurance" and although not a winning decision the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: cost will not be too dear.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|pg||

pc|d3|nt|patricck: declarer cashing up the spades in case east can pitch one after 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer of course doesn't know about the favourable position of the J@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|jcwla: Let us say, it would take exceedingly friendly defense to bring home 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h dbld can go for 300-500, the cost isn't that cheap|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||
nt|petergill: West now hopes @HQ drops doubleton then @CJ drops singleton under @CQ, about a one in a million chance. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: Paula a bit lucky after the @D try?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: This is an improtant match between the teams that are 2nd and 3rd, at the moment China is in the lead|pg||

pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
mc|7|nt|petergill: @CK play at Trick 1 was too revealing to declarer. Better to play small on the club lead, then the king on the 2nd round of clubs might be from Kxx - less revealing to declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: China are overwhelming favourites to win the Women's ABPF Championship for the umpteenth time is a row|pg||

nt|petergill: His coach Patrick Huang would be proud of his play. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim*|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly 4@H also would be home. Only a @D lead from E to beat it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the problems with the weak hand making a decision at the 5 level|pg||
nt|petergill: No double, so only 50's = no big deal|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Regardless of the level S chose (and made a choice here that worked out great), showing the majors and then bidding @H's did show the nature of the hand well.|pg||
nt|patricck: Current scores are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT from East will make with the favourable @D break. 6NT from West can be beaten with a @S lead|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||
mb|2D|nt|petergill: Suci Amita Dewi and Kristina Wahyu have been regulars on BBO for the last 5 years, practising a lot on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: But if you were playing6NT from East you might well go down even playing it reasonably|pg||
nt|rodal f: S aint gona give up here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: 2@h kind wild i thing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Chayes, can u exsplain 1@H - 3@D?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C a nice spot and on for 500 at wourst now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ns vul prevented north no show some values|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C probably shows clubs and @D, at least 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|patricck: South had better run or this will be expensive|pg||
nt|patricck: possible expenive even if she does run|pg||
nt|patricck: That is because if you play 3 rounds of diamonds you have no real chance to recover if they do not break|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@D has guaranteed that they will reach 6@D or 7@D|pg||
nt|patricck: So best line may be 2 rounds of diamonds(in case doubleton J@D and then if nothing appears take the 50% chance of the Q@S finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: If the @D didn't break but the Q@S was onisde then everyone would say 6NT could be made with the spade finesse, unfortunately declarer doesn't know which option works|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_O.pdf|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Got there income it seems.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Hi Gupta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...usually 1@D does not include a 5-card M, no?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 1@D showed spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps they are playing negative free bids.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh OK.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Steve.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Steve:)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@S is fairly safe, but still down after the defence starts with 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no alert all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: Wang Hogn Li worked out that her very bad heart pips would make 2@H difficult to play, opposite a void or singleton @H.|pg||
nt|petergill: Hong Li|pg||
nt|patricck: ast won't pass tho|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, famous last words by the commentator there :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  would 2@h over 2@c have been forcing or not?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: as suits are less likely to break when opponents bid vulnerable on low HCP|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: called commentator's curse,, |pg||
nt|patricck: so, this is interesting, declarer may pin everything on the @D and be lucky, or he may try to combine the chances as I have suggested and then he will fail|pg||

nt|petergill: Antonio Rosario is very experienced, has played for Macau for decades|pg||
nt|alok_daga: a likely push|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's good to watch good players|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|petergill: It might be worthwhile to correct his name from Kosai to Rosario|pg||
nt|alok_daga: at best 2nt 4nt ppp|pg||
nt|petergill: Consideration of "which opponent is dangerous hand to put on lead" etc make my comments about @D suit correct in isolation only|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 top tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: poor 4333 11 count = worth 4NT quantitative? or just 3NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: If 4NT, South will pass, being minimum|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT over any natural NT bid should be quantitative, not ace asking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: depends on 2N range|pg||
nt|alok_daga: agression may tempt for a 4nt as if p as a 5carder 12 maybe there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if 20-22 then I always bid 3 unless it can have a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my 2N is 21-22 NO 5 card suit so in this case a simple raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Although China, Australia, Chinese Taipei and perhaps Japan are the favourites for the medals in this event, both HK and Macau are contending strongly for a medal. |pg||
nt|alok_daga: Gary,range usually is 20 21 do some play it as 20 22?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4333 11 with no tens and no plus features is more like a 10 count = 3NT is likely to be bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I and many NZ play it as 21-22 NO five card suit and we play 20-22 WITH a 5 card suit included in the multi 2@D|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Derek goes for the quant which will be passed|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: no samuel shows aces|pg||
nt|petergill: South should pass 4NT, being min. 7 points locked up in the doubleton being a bad feature|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C seems to be natural, exploring for slam|pg||
nt|petergill: He must like his lack of jacks and good aces and 1098 in a long suit|pg||
nt|alok_daga: well then they seem 2 be on the way 2 dropping 11|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North should bid 5NT, signoff|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4th highest Club lead gives 12 tricks in NT |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we'll never know as conv bids seldom alerted here and never explained|pg||
nt|petergill: which is safe enough |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|petergill: If North had a 5th @D, they would reach 6@D or 6NT, needing @D 3-2, so perhaps this slam exploration is worthwhile |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@D natural|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5NT natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: North surely will pass, being minimum for his bidding|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|offthebend: looks like suits upthe line |pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: certainly used up a bit of time :)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excuse, but if all those bids were natural, they would be making them at the 3 level not the 5 level|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: The BBO-TV if any like it: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|jcwla: A third-seat weak 2 perhaps for those playing them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: another interesting hand - 6@D being very aggressive, 3NT being normal|pg||
nt|petergill: China's losses to Japan and Thailand might be explained by China not being at full strength this year|pg||

mb|1N|nt|petergill: 11-15, can be very short|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: I expect NS to reach 3NT and with the well placed @H suit that shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|petergill: as 2@D would be like a 2/1, 10 or 11+ with @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
nt|patricck: I am not a fan of doubling on hands like West's, seems to me that I am in the minority though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|patricck: 4333 you either have enough to overcall 1NT (on 15-18) or you simply pass and await developments|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  that treatment over NT seems to be losing favor|pg||
nt|sybarra: some might recommend overcalling 1 sp  (but not me)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|patricck: 1@S on such a good suit is better than the takeout double, but pass is still the best choice|pg||

nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East gets a 2nd chance - I prefer to save my 2nd chances for more importtant things :)|pg||
nt|patricck: with the vulnerability it looks like E/W will be a well deserved -200 unless declarer can guess the @D suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: S lead is also possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Domes for -1 anyway.|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: After 9 rounds, China leads the Women's event by 31 VPs from Japan, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia, who are all close together|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  if they can unscramble their tricks, 2@h should have gone down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it looks like it's making|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Careful with the @S10 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was NF as exspected and drurey by 2@C no fit - 2@D with fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  E lead looks pretty natural though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: If East had ovecalled 2@D the first time; West would find the raise to 3@D more easily|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodal f: *see|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H weak, as 2@D would be a 7+ raise, an increasingly common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, not stopping at 3NT, fortunately the cards are friendly enough to allow other possibilities|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|offthebend: shouldn't take too long to claim  |pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer does know that south has Q@H and AK@C, but that shouldn't be enough to help|pg||

nt|andyv:  W, looking at that @s suit in dummy, might have thought about taking the A@d and switching to @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim time|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have doubled 1@D on the East cards, but some experts prefer to bid their 5 card major |pg||
nt|patricck: Thx Chayes, we wouldn't have been able to guess at the meaning of all those bids otherwise|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pc|cK|nt|kiwi_joker: I note that with 9-6-3 Trevor gave (upside-down) count with the 6. I must say I like loud signals, when loud cannot cost. (ie, the 9 here)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|patricck: hmmm, 4@S could be interesting|pg||
nt|patricck: One thing is certain, declarer won't be happy when he sees dummy|pg||

nt|jcwla: So Indonesia with 9 early IMPs.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: but not much there at present - Participants are there|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's a lot of work for South, but he should make 8 tricks without much trouble...the 9th, well, we'll see|pg||
nt|patricck: with the 2 trumps to come 200 will be quite acceptable to NS as they could only make a part-score their way|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|petergill: Only about 100 to 200 bridge players in Malaysia, so not many volunteers to do the hard work, so do not expect instant updates of websites|pg||

mb|1S|nt|petergill: Splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi. Sorry that I'm late.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 6@H is not a great contract, and of course would fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the worst S hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|patricck: the operator decided board 3 wasn't esciting enough :)|pg||
nt|patricck: EXciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after this board :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: B1 sold at the mol. 4@HN= here and 3@DW at OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And one more overtrick IMP on 2.|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D will be some sort of 3 suiter, I don't have the system details|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: rather sensible contract on a 9 card fit on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3-card raises are awkward after a X for most pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: It would be a major triumph to reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter? |pg||
nt|petergill: South ranked  1 female in the world, North ranked  4, and Gu at other table ranked  2 female in the world, in WBF rankings|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid again as S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
nt|petergill: Gu Ling's partner took a break of about 10 years from international bridge, then won the World Championship in Philadelphia last year, so is ranked "only" about  46. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yet again S treats the hand as both M's despite the large discrepancy.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Guess was old fashioned treatment of "double for the majors" over the big club, so an easy 4@S call for N|pg||
nt|petergill: North follows the Kit Woolsey approach of getting in and doubling early with 12+ and 4333 shape|pg||
nt|patricck: EW will get at least a couple of chances to beat this with a @C ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kerasidis: or maybe jumbing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it worked the first time so why not?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: In order to know how sympathetic to be with West's decision we would need to know how clearly penalties the double was or whether it could be just 'values'|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rodal f: E bid his colors and don't care the 2@S from S?|pg||
nt|patricck: no, I don't bid 5@S with Jx and Qxx in the opponent's suits|pg||
nt|patricck: expensive lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to make now |pg||
nt|patricck: wasn't it likely that West would have a void @S here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the X gives the @D suit away|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kerasidis: even if the dont lead dia i can not see 5 making|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  it's not a horrible treatment as long as the dbler has about equal majors or a stand along major (like the previous auction)..here, dbld has simply a good hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl 10+, then East's Dbl take-out (a non-standard treatment), converted to penatly|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of too many lead-directing doubles - they tend to advise the opponents that their values are in the right places, as here |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by French Polynesia|pg||
nt|rodal f: A natural lead from E|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rodal f: May we say that a 3NT might is lost. Bit hard for EW here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: they will have chance later also|pg||
nt|kerasidis: sure|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  stand alone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, not that good.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not great....just good|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the call better on 1 than here though it hit paydirt as far as N is concerned.|pg||
nt|patricck: can't pick up the @D suit and take the pitches on KQ@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: This looks to me like 500|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Last year, Chinese Taipei won this event on 401 VPs, Australia 2nd on 399 VPs. French Polynesia finished 12th out of 13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: cross-ruff on the way, and the high heart ... leading to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: so all roads lead to 11 tricks I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to thinking about the lead |pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|offthebend: if the leads are 3/5 , clubs must be 5-5 and N should be marked with doubleton SK for her opening|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows West has only 3 hearts - with 4 hearts, West would play a low @h (not a high @H) at trick 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: Any deep hook to come in @S? N have opened.|pg||
nt|patricck: how can declarer not take any club pitches?|pg||
nt|patricck: I was apparently wrong about the opening bid. Not sure that I would want to play a 2@D opening that is 18-19 balanced, but apparently that is what it was|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: EW want to take @DA then cash @h, but cannot tell that South has singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: - 200 is easy for South now, via 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: West thought East might have Jx in @D, hence the duck|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW was max -2 at non vul|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: Not the world's greatest contract but will make as the cards lie|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|petergill: and NZ lost to Malaysia 13-17 here on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: well not low on that @D lead :)  but the J@D also allows an easy 10 tricks if declarer was in 4@S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  whatever it is, NS will do very well defending|pg||
nt|jcwla: Andy, I can understand forcing to game with just a king over a powerhouse opening, but even being aggressive in not requiring the usual combined high-card strength, it usually ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: plays poorly when the values are all in one hand.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Once against, I would double 1@H on West cards (along with a majority of experts, surely), but the Indonesian youngsters prefer to overcall their five card suit. |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and @S for a glue? Belive not|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: I think I would have passed as North and hope S reopens with Dbl, which I would expect S to do|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||

nt|rodal f: Quite a nice spot in @H here|pg||

nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||

nt|rodal f: Or @C?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kerasidis: considering|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Now that is some lead directing X|pg||
nt|jcwla: E totally devaluing the hand b/c of @SK - almost worth the raise just on trumps.|pg||
nt|patricck: this contract might have been more interesting with some 4-1 breaks in the red suits, but on this layout everyone makes at least 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
nt|petergill: in case East has Qxx|pg||
nt|petergill: Let's see what Sun Ming does|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Quite a funny board. EW as well as NS kave nive fits, but whome do bid as W do here?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Obvious if u have a invome or two.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *income|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: Sun Ming rarely (almost never) lets you down |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, I'm not in love with this sequence.  This sounds like a very big @H hand that's one-suited in @H's.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|offthebend: everybody UPGRADES these days 14 into 15 , 15 into 16 :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: My sister (npc of Aus Women in Kuala Lumpur) says that Sun Ming would be ranked much higher than  4 women player in the world, if she played more often|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: on a diamond lead 3 rounds of hearts and 5 rounds of diamonds pitching spades, then with the club finesse there are 12 tricks, maybe even 13 if south pitches a club|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: @C5 from East was bottom card, showing originally 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: there is a very real danger that she will play West for @DKx|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: If you're going to emphasize the @H's, then I think you start with 2@H and double back later.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: The U26 and U21 fields are combined into one 16 team field, and in the early matches the U26 teams are beating up the u21 teams, ref http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_J.pdf|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Y. Need to find the @CQXX and % for that might under 30|pg||
nt|patricck: If that theory became too widely followed then people would stop leading trumps so readily against a grand slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now for shure E need to find the @CQ.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why E didn't sat the slam at @C by a 4@C bid?|pg||
nt|patricck: the defence always know they are in with a good chance when declarer takes this long at trick 1 :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: NS play high to encourage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit cloudy that 1IMP. U loose and win if u are correct, but at long term u loose only 1IMP pr. board if 50% fail etc 50% in.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|andyv:  2@h opener here looks like super refined flannery|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: I might was a bit hard by the NT with 9 auto. Can loose 3@H and 2@D.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h2|nt|petergill: North (whose @D pip at Trick 2 suggested 5 @D's) is known to have 5 @D and 3 @H (no 1@h bid), thus some risk of club and @d overruffs. |pg||
nt|petergill: thus the playing off of @CA from dummy was premature|pg||

nt|patricck: 6@H and 6@C both make|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new funny board|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be same result. Started @SQ and swiched to @C Tempo for the @D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: or if @H 4-2, then @S finesse |pg||
nt|petergill: Precision|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 4@S might get doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new interesting board up|pg||
nt|jjsb: this one interesting also , its not that frequent u should play a slam on a 7 card fit rather than on a 8 card fit |pg||
nt|kerasidis: not tough to guess this auction will end in 4@h|pg||
nt|patricck: bidding them is another question|pg||
mb|d|nt|jjsb: a really weird situation|pg||
nt|rodal f: B3 OR got @DA as the lead and found @CQ. for 6@S= Well done 13IMP to China.|pg||

mb|r|nt|offthebend: Spades OVER hearts |pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wasted values at E|pg||
nt|patricck: would still have been OK for 4@H if the AQ@S were not both offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so declarer preferede to play for @S fiensse (50% chance) than for person with short @H to have short @D (less than 50%)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still an ok sac in 5@H|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes wd|pg||
nt|twcho: one may have to discuss whether transfer is still on here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 2nt attacking bid ..wild|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are probably on our way to 3@D here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1NT weak, Dbl pen, Rdbl = long minor|pg||
nt|rodal f: But how can E bid it now. Exlution blackwood the onliest.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petergill: West knows East has less than 3 hearts, so unless North has 5 or 6 hearts (unlikely?), West has 4 top tricks to 41S|pg||
nt|petergill: to 4@S I mean|pg||
nt|offthebend: They can make 5S on S finesse and by playing D towards the J |pg||
nt|rodal f: By that long thinking if no screens W have problem to bid. |pg||
nt|rodal f: But can tey take the safe income?|pg||
nt|jjsb: some in the audience  point out 1nt can only be made if junior :) not sure about that :) |pg||
nt|jjsb: basically on a strong club|pg||
nt|jjsb: u try to overcall as far as poossible |pg||
nt|rodal f: Tapei made 710 at 4@H at OR and 2IMP|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: But what are N gona lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: Q@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = long suit not clubs (would bid 2@C with clubs)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Presumably XX was forced and 2@d showed @d and a major|pg||
nt|henryb:  you see, sorry, Peter and I disagree|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the @C became more important|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4 lavental as I play it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: slam was only a moderate proposition.... basically needing both @H and @C to be 3-2, which is about a 50% chance when combining both suits together|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: That looks more like it. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|petergill: I wondered why Pass was (possibly) not alerted|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  Playing "DONT" runouts has become fairly common|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcwla: It is a light-looking 10 but I'm with you, Andy, this seems Milquetoast.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: Was a safetynes but, ....|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: B21: 3@D+1 here and 2@S-1 at OR and one IMP for Tapei|pg||

nt|offthebend: why pitch the D :)  |pg||

nt|petergill: might have to cash a heart before playing trumps in the scenario I was describing|pg||
nt|petergill: then +100|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 at OR: 3NT as here Here was 9 tr|pg||
nt|jjsb: i guess if u ask what to open with East u will have a lot of options|pg||
nt|jjsb: depending ur style |pg||
nt|jjsb: im personally a 2@h opening |pg||
nt|jcwla: NZ on the board with 1 on 7 (130 vs. 100)|pg||
nt|petergill: but 3@C P 5@C doesn't cost much, even if 4@S fails - especially if East leads a @D to 5@C|pg||
nt|petergill: or East might lead a club to 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: Some fun to come|pg||
mb|1D|nt|offthebend: likely 4S contract here UNLESS West overcalls 1S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so this must show something besides @s:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Completing the @D-@S inversion.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: but i am pretty sure a lot will find pass or also 1@h |pg||
nt|petergill: 11C Precision |pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|petergill: and her (relative newcomer, compared to Wang Hongli and Sun Ming) partner Feng Xuefeng is ranked  48 woman in the world due mainly to the win in Philly|pg||

nt|rodal f: B20 will become a =|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr 1 IMP for China|pg||
nt|andyv:  if NS have any agreements in place, 2@s, 3@s and 4@s should all be natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  and use the @d suit for cue bidding purposes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @H, 16+ HCP|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Often u will drop for 2-2 if u miss QXXX as @C here|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 ended =|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C shows stopper|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 13-15|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Good lead!|pg||
nt|petergill: I like it - go for the good 4 card suit ahead of the weak longer suit with no entries  - a very sensible thing to try, especially in a match in which your team is the underdog |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT should fail now - on a heart lead, the bold 3NT had some chance. |pg||
nt|jjsb: i am afraid im not sure of there system on 1@c i just that 1@d is expressing a number of point |pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: 5@D and 3@S both are safe|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: S think 3@S is suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as I was wrong when I belived NS to paly 15-17NT. This is precission and relay or only @D from N|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR might at the line now. Let's see|pg||
nt|patricck: If double was takeout from South I would do that|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ended 5@C|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@H? Whay not 4NT if that road?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: N will bid and show the adwanced que in @S I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ohh|pg||
nt|rodal f: S can't pass since 2/1 is made|pg||
nt|rodal f: Would have been from me.|pg||
nt|patricck: will try to keep up the commentary hear, but have just been served dinner|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
nt|henryb:  6 of either red suit is not the worst contract ever seen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR EW are out bicikling but S helped by 4@C and E bidded 4@D. Than W made it 5. Pass around.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S denies Hxx (H = A, K or Q) support, I think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite normal thees days|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural, 3@H = xxx support without top honour|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  but won't make because of the bad @d break. and even 4@h needs careful play|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue as slam try, 4@H signoff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I agree, but you never know when a pair might have a different agreement in that area|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice value at @D now, but is it enough?|pg||
nt|rodal f: @D3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||
pc|h7|nt|offthebend: oops - why did she throw the S |pg||
nt|andyv:  3N was good contract except for lack of tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: South has a difficult time getting off lead now|pg||
nt|offthebend: still OK |pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: 600 to EW, after an exciting auction|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u there:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: Nice play - @CJ was best, only because all other options looked bad|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: Good @H play - devastating defence |pg||
nt|petergill: You ruff the 2nd club, play 2 top hearts to find the bad break, stop trumps perforce, and play @d by|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25. 4@CN-1 here and 5@DW-1 at OR made 4IMP for Malaysia|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do Fong feel him self inputted? |pg||
nt|patricck: very tight, low-scoring match so far|pg||
nt|rodal f: At this board OR ended 1NTE|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jjsb: and that contract is all about @c so |pg||
nt|twcho: with such good hand and good suit quality|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and a @H ruff to come|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: With the 16HPs Y. Agree u|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: So a presission where Weiwei should have had some lessons for some?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Only 2@Ds|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kerasidis: or by north even if its not stronh|pg||
nt|petergill: leading low to king then low through the person with long trumps so a top @d doesn't get ruffed.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow something seems amiss in the play of that hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jjsb: and = it is |pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: then concede a @D |pg||
pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Had two nice free cards. Small @S or @D9 with the nice @D3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|henryb:  a good play by Wang to tell partner not to ruff declarer's losing @d|pg||
nt|petergill: then pitch a @d on the club, to retain control|pg||
nt|henryb:  or ruff and play @sK, @sA and ruff a @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: Sorry, North is in danger of being squeeed - not good defence at all!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: u mean clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, a good alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: North has pitched clubs, so the contract is safe, no matter what happens now|pg||
nt|petergill: If North pitches 2 spades instead of 2 clubs, 4@h would still have made |pg||

nt|rodal f: OR now start B9. The grand slam.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but EW have a cheap sacrifice over NS red slam|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|s2|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||

pc|s9|nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||

nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
nt|patricck: finding the good news straight away|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||

pc|d7|nt|rodal f: B9 The wrong side made the ask but not finnished.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@HX at OR -300|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
nt|patricck: now cash the diamonds and clubs and hope that East is squeezed in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
nt|petergill: With spades 3-0, entries to the South hand are a bit limited in 6@S, and one might have to overtake @HJ (if @H ace is ducked), use @H as "replacement trumps" to make 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, RKCB would keep one out of 6@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7@S |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
nt|patricck: for the overtrick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  A kibitzer points out that RKCB keeps modern players out of these 50% slams|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely because East already known to hold 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Now -1?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||

nt|henryb:  3N would not be among my choices with two small @d|pg||

pc|c3|nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||

nt|rodal f: EW|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rodal f: Any for 2/1 and 1NT by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1NT one round force minimum|pg||
nt|patricck: at least that allows the @S ruff, so there are 3 tricks and 1 @D before declarer thinks about trumps|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|4!D+6!C+|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||

nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR N in 3@S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might look at what the result could be if 1NT was 2/1. At @D contract u have some tricks|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might be possible, but who knows how the bidding would go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 OR ended as here. 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: all on the lead against 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||

nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||

pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Non know. But 4NT ain't bad if u find the @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: S need to pitch a bit by the @D. Still it's hard.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|rodal f: 3@H=4@S+and invit it seems.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: How I love minisplinter and splinter at team. 3@D from N=singel and @S support. 4@D=renonce|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzek: 1@S = 4@S 10-14 may have longer minor|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E does not Open the bidding , the hand can easily get passed out |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 5+ clubs, 8+ HCP|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D asks |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjsb: u can play on @h to discard a @c or play on @c to discard a @h :) i have more better card in club so im making +1 here :) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: 2@D was forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h probably minimum|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: 2@S showed 5+ spades and invitational, denied 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ened 2@SN. So might a new gain for Japan (L)|pg||
nt|patricck: declaarer won't be keen to finesse a club into the long spade hand|pg||
nt|patricck: What is an opening bid may be affected by the rest of your system. Another suggested offering is the rule of 20  which suggests that the HCP + the length of your 2 longest suits ...|pg||
nt|patricck: being at least 20 is a good indicator|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  with A@c onside, this hand becomes even easier|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: For profile of China Women's team of 2009, with photo of N and S, scroll down at http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/equipechine09.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: and probably has @SQ to make up her 8 + HCP|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d9|nt|jjsb: i think im making +1 also on playing @h thougth :) |pg||

nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||

nt|patricck: we woldn't be here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||

nt|robbroy: tight defence required|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
nt|robbroy: bad start for Singapore|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2NT here? System faul? 1NT by 15 and....|pg||
nt|robbroy: they play a version of blue club|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|alok_daga: NV VS V North did not enter the auction?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
nt|robbroy: open 1@S with weak hands or 4 card suits I believe|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Not as I've seen but u're might right.|pg||
nt|robbroy: 3@S to ask for @C but count was preferred so a guess for N now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|robbroy: they have been playing a canape system for about 25 years - they may have changed but I think not|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||

nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||

nt|patricck: We have certainly had some interesting cards, let us hope that the next match (in about 2 hours) is equally interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
nt|robbroy: a moral victory for Singapore|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok see u all guys in 45 minutes !! thanks again ! |pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: 3NT play = @D , @C9 to king, 2nd @D. Cannot play small club to ten in 3NT, as West can insert jack to block clubs. So @CQ, @CA, @C10, spade up. East has to give you a @H or @d ...|pg||
nt|petergill: trick = 9 tricks. So this is bad for China, perhaps|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
nt|henryb:  they made 3N in the other room|pg||
mc|8|nt|rodal f: See u all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Director here|pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhhh |pg||
nt|jjsb: well 3 @h bid migth be the problem |pg||
nt|jjsb: i was about to point that aspect that normally if the defense bid a 2 suiters u cue the bid to say u cotnrol that suit |pg||
nt|jjsb: so im not sure if the explanation was same at both table |pg||
nt|jjsb: South migth point out if he know that there is no @h cotnrol he would have lead a @h ?|pg||
