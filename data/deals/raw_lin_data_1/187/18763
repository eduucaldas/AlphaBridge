mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Lavazza 7  Balti  30|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: A bit of a surprise|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Tim Bourke sent me a wonderful trump squeeze, played by Versace yesterday. He will need a couple of those now, to close the deficit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The displayed bidding is wrong, it seems.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The bidding does not match the cards we see|pg||
nt|brolucius: South must have opened 1@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then the rest is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Perhaps this is standard Acol bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is that what you teach in your Acol lessons, Roland?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: Yes, do you like it?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Excellent contract|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: I may call you...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can only be reached if they bid like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: Raising to 3@D is always risky when it is doneon shape and few points, since 3NT is a likely target and partner may think that you have more than 6 points.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually an advance from 3NT to four of a minor is forcing. It is clearly not so on this auction, since North made a limit bid on the previous round. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing Acol (Roland's version or otherwise), it would be normal to pass 2@D on the North cards. Although game is just about possible, it is much more likely that a raise will ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: carry you too high.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: test|pg||
nt|brolucius: The fact that 1@H - 1@S - 2@D has a very wide range used to be thought of as a big advantage for playing strong 1@C systems.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|brolucius: The Gazzilli convention (where South rebids 2@C to show11-15 with 4 clubs or 16+, means that 2@D is limited to 15 points.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|brolucius: In that case North would not have to raise.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think she could have made it at some point but not any more|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still 4@D is a good sacrifice against 2@C the other way.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South held 10 points and a spade stopper, they might have been in 3NT with less than half the pack. |pg||
nt|brolucius: These are necessarily very short KO matches (28 boards), so you have little time to recover from any indiscretions in the first half.|pg||

nt|brgpro: pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: she denied 5-5 , 5@H and 4@S would show 5-5 and singleton in bid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I think the club suit should be stronger for her action over 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either 4NT or 6NT i you don't want to invite|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brgpro: actually, with @cK on side doubleton, he doesnt need the fall of the @s8|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to just bash into 6NT with a singleton @s, no?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brgpro: for sure he would do something, not 4NT...|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: It is the sort of slam that they may bid just because they are behind. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is not a bad slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c?|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|brgpro: Versace will bid 6...but 6NT or 6@C?|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is asking pd to choose a slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why play a 5-2 fit?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has very poor clubs in context.|pg||
nt|brgpro: why it is not Grand try? because 2NT is limited and pd signed off in 5@c, so normally N doesnt have the right to ask for grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: she never cuebid @ds|pg||
nt|brgpro: what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It must be a case of 'You play it, Alfredo'. Oh, she has passed. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT is perhaps the only contract that never makes much sense|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think after all 4 level cue bids, 5NT has to be P-a-s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: It does if 6NT is going down. South's hand is not so great opposite a possible 20-count. There would then be 8 points missing.|pg||
nt|brgpro: pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might perhaps have bid 6NT, if uncertain that 5NT would be interpreted as intended.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ever noticed how many misunderstandings there are after 2NT openings?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT in the other room|pg||
