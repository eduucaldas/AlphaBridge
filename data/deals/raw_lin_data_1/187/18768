nt|ralfwil: a bad decision from E , not to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule :)|pg||

nt|dburn: he may intend that as pick a slam, rather than the grand slam force in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: but it will be pretty opaque to his partner|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well can west find the heart lead?|pg||
nt|jbgood: a lightner x now?|pg||

nt|lml: clubs is going to do better I think but it seems unlikely they can get there|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|psyck: this barrage will make it difficult for NS to find 6@h here|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: not that it would be easy to find with EW silent :)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: zero unuseful card|pg||
nt|davpro: They hit the right spot|pg||
nt|lml: the double may have given away the show|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: Operator, EW are from Norway (you have Netherlands flags)|pg||
nt|davpro: At the other table htey bid a limit 3@s. One step to high|pg||
nt|lml: I think they still cant quite make it though on the spade lead|pg||
nt|lml: I dont like the double much|pg||
nt|lml: it may be that they play that Cope was required to bid or double|pg||
nt|lml: the "forcing pass"|pg||
nt|lml: but it would be an unusual treatment since Cope preempted|pg||

nt|vugraphpl2: schedule www.poznan2011.pl/schedule|pg||
nt|lml: they have reached 6@c in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: there North made a nice bid over 4@S|pg||
nt|lml: I think Gromov was thinking about it too ... he bid 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S still thinking...|pg||
nt|lml: East doubled suggesting a heart lead but got a spade instead|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: S asks W about auction...|pg||
nt|lml: prehaps he wants to see if the double was "forced"|pg||
nt|lml: then it wouldnt necessarily show heart length|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Peter Crouch|pg||

pc|h5|nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|ritong: contract is bulletproof, so south tries to work out the best chance to optimize overtricks|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: that did look like an odd card|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: i would have to double 2@d first to make my double of 2@h a penalty x|pg||

nt|jcomyn: i prefer transfer rather than reveal weakness|pg||
nt|blum1956: whatever does 3@h mean it is a good preemptive this time - some Wests will keep silence (not this one)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: currently result for this table with the result from the last segment is 25 for Couples and 17 for GreenEyes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe michael, but let em guess|pg||

mb|2C|an|!H + other|nt|roswolf: a firm 3nt may be the bid here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is Astro rather than Landy, I think|pg||
nt|dburn: so North has shown hearts, which may dissuade East from bidding a direct 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: 3@H then|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4D|an| |nt|dburn: North hasn't shown spades, so East may want to keep those in the picture|pg||
nt|roswolf: the firm male 3nt|pg||

nt|jbgood: an even firmer male occupies the N seat:)|pg||
