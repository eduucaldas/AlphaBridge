nt|chick: I agree with John, if you are going to bid at all, should give partner 2 suits to work with, not just one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the most obvious bid of the week-end - 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Then put me in Mark's camp; I think 1@S is perfectly normal|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 1@S is at least less likely to get a double. And gives the partner a clue for a lead.|pg||
