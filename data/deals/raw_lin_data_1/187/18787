mb|p|nt|oosb: We've had very exciting sets so far, lets hope we get more of that today|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosb: Decent contract to end up in|pg||

nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

nt|riccho:  round <sgh>|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  Hi Kit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: Boyd chose to make light response|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hey Andreas|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Double is support double|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ... - not now|pg||
nt|stc: Most E will open 2@s, giving the good lead|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome to the quarter finals of the european mixed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Round of 32 rather|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hi Baard:-)|pg||

nt|tihana: hi everyone, fast start!|pg||
nt|ntmon: welcome to last set of Swiss stage of Mixed Teams, Euro 2011, Poznan|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  and pass is "I don't have much"|pg||
nt|ntmon: X show 15+ with @c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: N believes in 7 @C quick tricks, an Ace and trick in dummy for her free bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Markku|pg||
nt|tihana: hi everybody!|pg||
nt|ntmon: 5th and 6th team of actual standings meet here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 2 segments o 14 boards|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
nt|baardolav: The bidding is near the limits now all ways and ended in 3@d NS|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andreasw:  5 @d makes but not to bid:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Two single red kings onside|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|baardolav: yes 5@d make doubledummy, find the single @d king|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a cold 3NT.  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should make easaly, prob +1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hajru:  Is east mrs. Duboin?  |pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we need to shut down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we will back in the moment|pg||
nt|blum1956: the best lead by Anna Gulevich, the contract must go 1 off|pg||

nt|oosb: We'll have some action this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/qfrunda1.html|pg||
nt|oosb: 4@S NS seems ok|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|oosb: will it be bid though, North rather flat |pg||
nt|oosb: and doesnt know about 7th @S|pg||
nt|oosb: South, downgraded the bad suit to 2@S |pg||
nt|oosb: Very reasonable|pg||
nt|timb: I'm not a fan of preempts at the two level on 7-card suits|pg||
nt|timb: I'd probably bid 1@S|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|oosb: Me too, because KQx outside is nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S!|nt|oosb: the other room had a nicer auction, but somehow South didnt raise to game, inspite of a cue bid and a 3@S bid by North|pg||
nt|oosb: I think we'll reach 4@S here now|pg||
nt|oosb: If the "free bid" has any extras implied|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|oosb: oops|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosb: Maybe its still a decent save|pg||
nt|oosb: on non @h lead especially|pg||
pc|s3|nt|timb: Wow! That is an amazing bid of 5@H. I would never have found it. On a non-trump lead it is down only one.|pg||
nt|oosb: Actually its always a good save, so I apologize. -3 will still gain imps|pg||
nt|timb: Needed the trump lead to inflict real damage here.|pg||
nt|oosb: Or @D and trump switch|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|oosb: cronier will be delighted with the lead|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||
nt|runnerup: bad slam ,but makes -so should be 4 @h +2|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is Euro 2011, Mixed Teams, Swiss stage, Rd  3|pg||
nt|ntmon: teams corrently 5th and 6th met here |pg||
nt|riccho:  a simple board to start with; at the tabel I always appreciate this :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ntmon: 1 IMP for Lavazza|pg||
nt|tihana: slamish hands on NS|pg||
nt|tihana: and unfortune break in hs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here close 28-29|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
nt|baardolav: pony 29, calandra 28|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2 nt showing - 15-17?|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure, they might play strong club too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
nt|riccho:  NS are two wellknown players from france; both of them winning numerous national and international titles. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibbitzers told me - they play Polish club|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|baardolav: Sementa hit the best lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  EW are not known to me, but hopefully michael can held here ...|pg||
nt|riccho:  help; sry IÂ´m a typomaster ... :(|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||

nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: am I in the right room:)?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: Yan on money|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|oosb: WD to reach 4@S in the other room!|pg||
nt|oosb: Playing standard methods it might get passed out?|pg||
nt|oosb: But arent there 4 losers?|pg||
nt|oosb: 1 in each suit|pg||
nt|timb: It looks like East needs a diamond led to make 4@S; otherwise he loses a trick in each suit.|pg||
nt|timb: (except on a misdefence)|pg||
mb|1H!|mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|oosb: Declarer got a @c lead in the other room, and did very well to catch 10xx @C and promote her 8|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "there must have been a better way to do that" Weichsel: "lead A of @hs earlier" Robinson: "if you lead it earlier, I'll probably make another trick - you can't ruff in with ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good contract obviously hands too flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  30-28 now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the now-normal 4-1 break. seems to me these days you have to cater for a 4-1 break and bid accordibly|pg||
mb|1C|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
nt|riccho:  interesting to see, that at bd1 N opened with 1@H. An opening that even in a limited system would be hardly everybodies choice|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s now for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S - for the lead partner|pg||
nt|baardolav: Very light overbids|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not my style... |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to finesse the @d Q to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: and get rid of one club from the closed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
nt|baardolav: Calandra have some thoughts about this... Spade need to be 2-2 or H single|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 from s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  Bd2: 4@s would have been a fairly good contract; I would expect the other tabel to be in 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: aggressive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, Dble by Guido was expected ... but not sure about the lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: making now with good guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: I still rather beleieve in down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why the long pause when the j is mandatory|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  anyone has an idea whcih system EW play? |pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tihana: hm|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  truth and concequences|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||

nt|blum1956: Ìàõ Êhven played for Russia many times, including the 2004 Olympiad (3th place). His partner (and wife) Anna Gulevich is 36-th rated in the rating-list (which includes men) and has ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: a Russian mixed teams wins to her credit|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW play the "Beriozka" system (based on Polish club) which is rather popular in Russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  typical polish style is that the 1NT rebid after the neg. 1@d is  a 18-20 BAL type of hand; with 12-14 in polish club they regularly are faking with 1@h or 1@s even with lesse than a 4carder|pg||

pc|c9|nt|runnerup: so miss guessed -1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|danilo1: West bid 2@C ... so he has 4 ... East who reopened therefore only 2 @C (possible single/double Q) - so @CJ has not been absolute mandatory ... however, good guess|pg||

nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|riccho:  how comfortable to commentate french players. every bid is cristal clear here |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|riccho:  In Bd. 2 I was wrong with my prediction (they reached 4@s but they didnt play it) because EW found the "sacrifice" in 5@h |pg||
nt|riccho:  put away the "" from last sentence... |pg||
pc|hK|nt|danilo1: not good guess in @S|pg||

pc|d2|nt|danilo1: but logical ... after 1@C and 1@H by north and 2@S pass by South, more probable South has 3@S than North|pg||

nt|baardolav: Gotart is not intending to do any mistakes and cashes the tricks|pg||

nt|ntmon: N/s again off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Michaels cuebid - promising both Majors, not my style with only an 8 count vulnerable|pg||

nt|riccho:  agree with 1@c? I find it peculiar that a french player opens v-vs this hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I'm surprised Weichsel didn't bid 3@S, unless he feared that would show 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||
nt|tihana: 2N by W would be scrambling?|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ntmon: i would say|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happend the tried and trusted longest and strongest|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||

nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
nt|baardolav: well even easier... now I would like +2 |pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||

pc|h4|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|ntmon: 7 tricks only becauseof 2 @D S entries - well defended|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|stc: but think at @d 4-3 and @c 4-2, loosing 3@d 1@s 1@c|pg||

nt|henryb:  Steve would have done better to return a @s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: just part of the reason of course...|pg||

nt|jbgood: this may well be a push|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@h relay probably|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-35|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: okay, now he is cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially, if E/W duck another @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: well north wked up -is it right ? -perhaps -200 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  4 NT quantitative ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|runnerup: jump in clubs doent look the way to desripe this hand all thought it make it easy to bid 6--but is it forcing even|pg||
nt|chmitty: next door, it will start 1@c 1@d 1@s but what next ? 2NT 3@d 3NT ... or 2NT 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  and the lead of the @sJ is sth I wouldnt have found either|pg||
nt|chmitty: in any case I suspect they will end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|henryb:  How do you prevent 3 heart tricks, Kit?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - wasÂ´nt ducked|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs now - but why not bid 4 @d?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 750 on stake... pass or 6@c|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what is 2@c on 1 @c??|pg||
nt|baardolav: natural I belive|pg||
nt|chmitty: I like @sJ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT is just too weak for the hand of that type, the few-pointed 3NT will be often missed|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: so 10 very badly needed IMPs for Lynch|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says it will make :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: pos 8+HP and 5+ @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess EW play 1@c-2@d as GF|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: I guess you really can't|pg||
nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||
nt|runnerup: nt -not really sensibal|pg||
nt|danilo1: good @CK position ... so EW need to cash @H to hold declarer on 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - but points? nevermind - slam is on:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-37|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibb told med - 2 clubs is game force|pg||
nt|baardolav: Natural gf yeah|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me|pg||
nt|chmitty: the theory is : against limited hands (2NT shows that) your lead should be neutral|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ntmon: looks -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|tihana: shit|pg||

nt|tihana: ok, at least we will have a swing|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: EW will negotiate @H ruff but not much more|pg||
nt|andreasw:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1370 it is should be made in one flash when the @c finesse make... and K drops. There is not a play for 1390 because of single @d in east|pg||
nt|riccho:  the lead is interesting in a positive way. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ntmon: this may not be good - defensive ruffs available|pg||
nt|baardolav: @d lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  youre right Baard!!!|pg||

pc|c7|nt|riccho:  the 2NT is interesting in a negative way (at least thats my feeling about that...)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tihana: hmm|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jbgood: a clever return - now it is at least 1 down|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hJ|nt|chmitty: agree|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a nervy one, needs 4 tricks from Majors so must finesse, @H more dangerous and @S a 2 way guess - on the theory of vacant spaces - trusting W for longer @Ds than E, it ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks right to play E for the @SQ - which works|pg||

mb|p|nt|chmitty: a beautiful 7@d here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: on 26 N started on @c and finished -1 :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcarroll: after all that allegedly knowledgable stuff, def solve the problem :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: most people think that there should be a free seating  - not by gender|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why bid at all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|stc: W ducked @s twice, very well played|pg||
nt|runnerup: minor game -so avoid 3nt is the name off this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Oosman|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosb: Hi again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "I think that is a constructive jump" Robinson: "I think it's just to play"|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess 4@s is easier than 3N|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns slam zone in @s but ew can then bid 7 clubs -ok not here and perhaps only teoria|pg||
nt|ntmon: trump lead indicated|pg||
nt|ntmon: my yesterday fellow commenator - a lady - told: we are going to see a lot of contract played by W and N|pg||
nt|danilo1: if 1@D 4 (looks like), why not?|pg||
nt|riccho:  Yesterday Id seen a russian pair which bid 1@c (p) 2@d with sth like x Axx KQJx Qxxxx (AFAIR)|pg||
nt|chmitty: actually 7@d may be not so great|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can't ruff a Spade AND cash the 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: so you are down to the @s finesse more or less|pg||
nt|riccho:  so u have to rely on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|riccho:  :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: or some king of squeeze|pg||
mb|6N|nt|ntmon: but EW might doubled at 5th level  already if they find clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now 5@C completes the picture|pg||
nt|tihana: i was spying the other room, they are in 7@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hasnt n already bid his hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello Oosman|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  although both are simple|pg||

mb|p|nt|ntmon: from any holding :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|danilo1: y mean North? ... Dble is OK ... he has max and M 4-cards|pg||
nt|riccho:  thats the simple way of avooding grand slam... |pg||
pc|s5|nt|stc: don't be surprised by E bidding, the delayed X shows shortness in @h|pg||

nt|ntmon: now 2@S ?|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe ... North, East or South may open|pg||
nt|blum1956: Willard's overcall helps to stop in 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  true|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  I'm a crawling Stayman bidder|pg||
nt|stc: and the ideal lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another Hamman hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 4@D ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: form East point of view that 2NT shows @h ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1@S already implied @D ?|pg||
nt|ntmon: bid in the same second|pg||
nt|tihana: is 4h by Sabine an option?|pg||
nt|mareczek: better to stay silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with the object of either going down or scoring 90|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Switch to the @D King...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 @H alerted - transfer, 2@C not alerted bur cannot be natural, |pg||
nt|chmitty: which is not good news for a @c slam|pg||
nt|riccho:  vs a WK NT hand the E hand doesnt look like a slaminviter anyway|pg||

nt|chmitty: we can see there are some good reasons to do so from East's perspective|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: 4@D might well make|pg||

nt|riccho:  5@d can be a very expensive save|pg||

nt|blum1956: Max may expect that Anna has not that long diamonds (she seems to keep 4 spades|pg||

nt|riccho:  with the S Hand? boah...|pg||

mb|4D|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||

nt|kit: right -- declarer would (should) never have played that way with ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  after ruffing out the heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "you might have something - might have some distribution - might have the J of @ss. I had an opening bid, you had an opening bid, why should we defend 4@d. I don't know if we ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: beat 4@d"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "we haven't discussed what that means in balancing seat" Lair: "I thought we played better minor for Majors" a little more discussion|pg||
nt|ntmon: lst hand of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 27+5 qualify for the Round of 32 tomorrow after five rounds of Swiss today. 27 from Swiss A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|runnerup: 1 @c -etc..|pg||
nt|jbgood: these teams are of course safe to go on to the round of 32 |pg||
nt|blum1956: Anna could use Blackwood (normally we play 14 30 responses in Russia)|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S should have lead @cA to "have a look"|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: OR also played the lucky 3NT, 11+12=26|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: Weischel has choice of declaring 2NT or 1@C it looks like|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N does better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson: "did you have a diamond stopper?" Boyd: "I had K doubleton ... I had a stopper from my side, not from yours"|pg||
nt|ntmon: last hand of Swiss |pg||
nt|oosb: Its going well for Pony so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: finally a turnaround board  18 - EW allowed to 5@D|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s lead (as a kib mentions) was certainly not very well thought|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: last one now - hope you have enjoyed as much as I have:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes, calandra needs a swing|pg||
nt|chmitty: in these situations, lead the @c Ace seems to be an obligation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks about the lead: "standard from feser than 4, or promises the J if from 4 or more"|pg||
nt|kit: he has down 1, but may take heart finesse trying to make and go down many|pg||
nt|tihana: tiny 3N?|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw ... both rooms played 4@S |pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosb: In other scores .. Brogeland trailing De Botton 22 imps to 60 !|pg||
nt|oosb: Heres the link to live scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  3 nt is on...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|runnerup: here ns must avoid 4 @s 4 @h or 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they declare a @H contract, E will have a nasty surprise for them|pg||
nt|ntmon: even in 4@S a lot to do for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 3NT has good chance to be bid after 3@C from S|pg||

nt|baardolav: A little bit lucky 3nt:)|pg||
nt|oosb: after that lead, you're all in|pg||
nt|chmitty: another difficult hand to bid here|pg||
nt|riccho:  E promised the @sA already; so the danger of a @s lead should have been obvious|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: At this point, Weichsel has in essence exposed his entire hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|tihana: bi|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@h sounds like : I have a stopper problem|pg||
nt|chmitty: but in which suit ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d being 100 % artificial forcing|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ntmon: 3NT isn't pretty|pg||

nt|baardolav: Have to see if @c q drops first|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|oosb: He will play it out for @C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
nt|riccho:  S needs a successful @C guess now; this is espec difficult after such a bd just before|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
mc|7|nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: terrible set for Multon Willard so far : 4@s made by opps, a frightening 50% grand slam not bid, 6cx made, and now 3NT 2 off|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|oosb: how's 5@H though I wonder, West cant lead @C, best lead is probably @d, but that just sets up declarers suit before they can get @C trick established|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: Back now.|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|timb: It makes because East can't gain the lead twice, allowing a club to be thrown on a long diamonds|pg||
nt|oosb: might as well try a @c now|pg||
nt|oosb: on a @D lead, and J@C back?|pg||
nt|oosb: the point is, declarer can win A@D and not let East win ofcourse|pg||
nt|timb: Declarer plays @DA and goes about his business|pg||
nt|oosb: but it was the only defeating chance for defence|pg||
nt|oosb: @c now is still interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: Zimmermann is thinking:)|pg||
nt|timb: West is marked with 5+clubs and, on the bidding, is the favorite to hold @CK|pg||
nt|oosb: True|pg||
nt|oosb: It doesnt cost to let it come to the Q anyway, as you would only play A if you think @D will come in in which case the free finesse wont cost contract anyway|pg||

mb|1H|nt|oosb: and I said that just looking at West.!! look at Calandras hand!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 @h|pg||
nt|oosb: have to avoid the 7-1 fit and play in the 5-3. that's all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6nt north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  west|pg||
nt|oosb: that is safest|pg||
nt|baardolav: I wonder what system makes the NT bid for West:)|pg||
nt|oosb: but I dont think it likely|pg||
nt|oosb: 7501 wont want to bid 6NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope 6 @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: 6@S made???????|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a real biggy n after p opensd 1s|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@D or @C should be -2 (@H surcoup) ... but more important for NS is to avoid 5@S ... may be difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think very difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4D?|pg||
nt|danilo1: As North, OI would bid 2@H rather than ev. splinter|pg||
nt|oosb: Does the BOA system allow us to get there? |pg||
nt|baardolav: A 6nt from east might be lightnerdoubled for spade lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  that reminds me of a team tourney long ago; heard from the neighbout table; we only had one bad board: first number : -2200... |pg||
mb|2S|mb|4S|nt|kit: That looks impossible.  We are about to have a virtually tied match.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: both wrong|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4NT is too risky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is now one dowen in 5s|pg||
nt|chmitty: and the show continues : opps in 4@s in 2 bids |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: still possible @H lead |pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes true|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@h = specified minor? |pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfb: Apparently S pitched a club against 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  3@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Boa will not make 6nt for west I am sure of that:)|pg||
nt|oosb: can be 5@S 4@H no?|pg||
nt|oosb: hehe :))|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|kit: South wrongly discarded a club, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can't tell from the play. they certainly played 6@s on a trump lead|pg||
nt|kit: only 11 tricks even on favorable lead -- 6 spades, 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  the club pitch is not shown but that is the only possibility|pg||
nt|kit: 5th diamond sets up, but still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: diamond pitch could never happen from 4 looking at dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "3rd & 5th?" Weichsel: "yes, 3rd and low"|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and he did|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|oosb: 6-4 now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands should be bid slowly|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not 4 @h|pg||
nt|oosb: E might be forced to bid NT at this rate|pg||
nt|baardolav: Difficult hands are always bid slowly|pg||
nt|oosb: that would be 5-5 |pg||
nt|oosb: and sementa is planning to show 6-5 next|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or 6-5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|oosb: i guess sementa feels he can play 6 opposite a singleton too?|pg||
nt|oosb: perhaps singleton Q or A|pg||
nt|oosb: Very tricky hand to bid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently Chambers did pitch a club|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosb: whoops|pg||
pc|s3|nt|baardolav: well... better than 6@s down one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not a good decision:-(|pg||
nt|oosb: I was thinking, maybe 5@H instead of 4@S ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes Baard.|pg||
nt|baardolav: Or 6nt X|pg||
nt|oosb: I wouldve bid that I think, suggests slam interest and 65?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|chmitty: will declarer guess the @c ?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|oosb: So a chance for Pony to finish off the match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosb: if they get to 6@H|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lets see|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: that is the only possibility I can think of, since North didn't duck ace of diamonds according to play record|pg||
nt|chmitty: will south smoothly duck the Jack ?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pc|s7|nt|ritong: he shifted to the @h 2|pg||
nt|chmitty: if declarer plays the Jack, he can't put the king|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|oosb: Meanwhile they picked up 11 more|pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosb: in the last board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andreasw:  63 37|pg||
nt|oosb: where Thomas right sided 3NT and avoided 5@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: maybe south had wrong count|pg||
nt|oosb: But 24 might be some imps back, if 3NT is missed|pg||
nt|baardolav: 5@d can make double dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|chmitty: so easy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|henryb:  1 imp left. 4 boards|pg||
nt|kit: those of you looking at movie see:  Passell claims 12 tricks.  That is not a real claim.  It is the operator entering that 12 tricks were made|pg||
nt|henryb:  break?|pg||
nt|kit: we are pretty sure South must have discarded a club, unless operator just misentered number of tricks taken.  We don't see any other possibility.|pg||
nt|jpes: the hearts are already exposed|pg||
nt|kit: I am getting confirmation -- South did pitch club.|pg||
nt|kit: so we suddenly have a real nailbiter here -- 1 IMP difference, 5 boards to go.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind all kibitzers that I do not respond to people who do not have the courtesy to fully identify themselves on their profiles|pg||

nt|kit: no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Don't know, Henry, sorry|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chmitty: the logic of the @c lead is that South must have some points to have a chance ... as she did not bid over 1@s, the probability she has good @h is limited|pg||
nt|blum1956: There are different possible agreements. One of them is : 1@d - 1@s - 1NT means the @h 4-card|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m told that 1@d is UNB from start. So 1NT showy 4+@c at least|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  I thought Kit might|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh I see|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be Multon did not realize that|pg||
nt|chmitty: can't be1453 for instance ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not from the start of course (1@d may be, say, 4-3-5-1)|pg||
nt|riccho:  the operator told that 1NT = 4@d; I took that to explain the bidding to myself|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|kit: if 3@D artificial, double is just diamonds I think|pg||
nt|kit: This certainly won't make, the question is how much will it go down|pg||
nt|henryb:  easy to lose control|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Boyd isn't trying to hold his losses -- he is playing to make.|pg||
nt|baardolav: now 3nt is down... making the @d finesse directly|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes, no safety play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||

nt|henryb:  He has not played to the next trick, though|pg||
nt|kit: was revoke established?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Revoke was definitely established - Boyd has called the director, who has ruled that there is a 1 trick penalty|pg||
nt|kit: anyway, probably around 5 IMPs for Kasle|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: so 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So he actually took 8 tricks, but I|pg||

nt|oosb: 7 lucky imps|pg||
nt|oosb: (needed @D 2-2 and K onside)|pg||
nt|chmitty: The french in 6@c also at board 9 ... :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|oosb: But sementa really needed to make the last 3NT to keep a fighting chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  yes it almost free to take A@d first trick|pg||
mb|d|nt|blum1956: That is the name of the hotel near Moscow where the bridge players who invented that system tooc their vacancies in 1970-s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jpes: these uncharacteristic errors indicate how tired these players are|pg||
mb|2N|nt|danilo1: looks like another calm board ... probable 3NT (matter of ev. overtrick(s)) |pg||
nt|chmitty: lead @s 10 ...|pg||
nt|chmitty: made, but undoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: ty :) I learned something today|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Nobody will have more to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: should make provided don't take spade finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like another sifnificant swing to Kasle|pg||
nt|kit: and won't, since West known to have at least 4 spades, so finesse doesn't help.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a finessers paradise apart from sk|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: this is getting scary|pg||
nt|oosb: comfortable contract|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes nice and safe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: Declarer will go after hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|oosb: lead helps too|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|andreasw:  @d to 9 now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Nothing for defense to attack|pg||
nt|henryb:  after another low club, declarer will certainly not make more than 1|pg||
nt|kit: but he will make 1|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: phew|pg||
pc|h5|nt|danilo1: Interesting to see, board 13 in Open room 4@H (not 6@H) down |pg||
nt|danilo1: It is possible to see play in MOVIE|pg||
nt|blum1956: But at the same time "Berioza" is the name of the tree which many of us consider as a symbol of Russia|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  but he will make 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Had the 4 of @ds out but put it back and thinking|pg||
nt|oosb: a recurring theme this set, @D 9 :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d6|nt|chmitty: may be Willard could try and pass 2@hx ... but 670 not very far :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  an opp from yesterday from EW just told me that 1@d is a definite UNB Hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|kit: hand is over -- declarer gets 1 diamond, 2 hearts, 2 spades, 2 clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|kit: defense gets 3 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|kit: so 9 IMP lead, 2 boards to go|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  no|pg||
nt|blum1956: It depends on the agreement, different pairs having different approach to the 5@d332 hands|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: East known to have ace of diamonds and at most 2 spades, so no problem|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m not sure if this is a good idea, when opp is in an A+-mode|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d7|nt|kit: will just pitch spade on last club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "this is what, your 4th trick?"|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oosb: cash outttt|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|danilo1: well ... SOS (@H to Q) will work|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and thanks to kibitzers for good comments|pg||
nt|oosb: oh wow|pg||
nt|oosb: 7@h -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|danilo1: another swing for German team board 10 ... slow bidding and as expected, it has been difficult to avoid 5@S ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry thought it was over|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: Don't anybody leave your seats -- there may be a big swing on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and a small swing on this one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: need to keep my eyes open|pg||
nt|andreasw:  close now- calandra might get an little on board 27|pg||
nt|chmitty: last board already :( tx all players, operators, my fellow commentators and kibs for their input|pg||
nt|chmitty: see you soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|henryb:  2N is Lebensohl|pg||
nt|oosb: how costly will that trick 1 be now!|pg||
mb|r|nt|riccho:  same here :) |pg||
mb|2C|nt|oosb: NS were probably hoping for a nice simple board right now, but they've got another monster|pg||
nt|blum1956: thx all the next segment promices to be an exciting one|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: big plus score for E-W, which will be enough to protect them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd wrote a long note about what it would mean if Robinson did something - I couldn't read it and then Robinson didn't do anything so it was irrelevant, but that's an interesting ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: way to save time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a foul misfit|pg||
nt|danilo1: strange bidding EW ...looks like not agreed Dble on 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|chmitty: it definitely will|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  what to lead???|pg||
nt|oosb: but once again, a comfortable 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  In bd 10 at the other table; @sA lead vs. 3NT contract is cold now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andreasw:  only 4 imps now|pg||
nt|oosb: oops that will help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  63-59|pg||
nt|oosb: Had they made 6@H instead of 4@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|oosb: they'd be tied|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|riccho:  big bd for russia +800 = 13 Imps |pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosb: By oops I meant it just makes declarer's work easy, NOT that it was a mistake|pg||
nt|oosb: perfectly natural @h lead|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Robinson might have bid 3N if his KQJQ were two aces or some duch|pg||
nt|henryb:  such*|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andreasw:  what willl board 28 give us?:-)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  think Pony is the winner and will go on|pg||
nt|oosb: Might be flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|oosb: but maybe some overtricks in 27|pg||
nt|oosb: 1-2 imps possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not enough|pg||
nt|oosb: hows 3 then?|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andreasw:  board 25 will be haunting Sementa and Calandra|pg||

nt|oosb: It's down to the wire now!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|jcomyn: note on the 5s hand the right lead was found|pg||
