nt|hajru:  If you have a bad board, forget about it, and play the next one as you'd play the first board of a match|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hajru:  This does require a bit of practice but it really helps your game|pg||
nt|ugis: 4h was optimistic, I agree, but I also dont like 2h by W|pg||
nt|ugis: i would bid 1nt with W hand|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|hajru:  I'd go for 2@h as well and make it as hard as possible for NS to enter the auction, but then again, my partner is aware of this|pg||

nt|hajru:  Going back to my earlier comment: the dutch team even hired a psychologist at some point to help the players forget about bad boards during a match.  Park the bad boards, as they call it.|pg||
