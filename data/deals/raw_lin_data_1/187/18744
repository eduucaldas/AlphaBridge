mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|sharkey: 6@H probably more likely|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|eggy: Though South's H discard was a little strange I thought - would have made me think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what about that 4-4 h fit |pg||
nt|sharkey: @D may not be bid...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: here we go again interferin with strong c|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Polish Club, to be honest|pg||
nt|sharkey: West at favorable vul being very active..|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: 4h or 4s?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @D keeps N/S out of the bad 4 @S, maybe - into 3 NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wow thats a brave one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and probably keeping them out of h|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: 6@D no make either as will lose a @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: If EW didnt interfer may bid salm - now may stop in game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still like to be in it|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Only @H-lead defeats 3 NT|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jcomyn: odd that 2c is that right|pg||
nt|jcomyn: true but strange with a 5-4 s fit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you have to be sure of the 7-card-@D...|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But 600 is better than minus 200|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree John|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be signoff I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4 NT "to play"|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dfont think so|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: may be INV, too|pg||
nt|sharkey: If N insterested wud think 4@S the bid|pg||
nt|jcomyn: after all looks as if s right|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@H cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|robbroy: both are good|pg||

nt|jcomyn: lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: looks like 4NT was inviting after all|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|sharkey: so EW interference backfired this time - kept NS from bidding slam|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is that right - i never knew that|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good judgement? or what|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|eggy: if a club is strong (maybe 2C is a destructive 2 suiter) then why not rebid 2NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i am all for interfering but with a 2-count?|pg||
nt|sharkey: a little luck too|pg||

pc|c6|pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|eggy: often a difficult situation to work out when the leaders partner holds 5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jcomyn: yes but surely easy to find the 4-4 h fit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: when dummy came down N wanted to be in slam - not anymore - very pleased with contract|pg||

nt|hawe45:  No 600 - not even for E/W|pg||
nt|sharkey: As we see EW didnt interfer OR and ended up in slam|pg||

mb|2H|nt|famus: gr8 bid--|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I think that is an awful bid by S even if that is what it says on the tin|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 3NT is not terrible as you can usually keep the preemptor out of the game - but not this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and 4h wont make|pg||
