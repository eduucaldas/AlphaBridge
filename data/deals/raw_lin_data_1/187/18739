nt|jcomyn: and at what level|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|eggy: I wonder what 2NT is - limited t/o?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: I'd say they are just upsetting the strong c wsith anything|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes, North played @S Jack to the Ace and took his nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: so nobody knowsd any more whether it is a suit or not|pg||

mb|6H|nt|chick: a Michaels type of bid might have made more sense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: what i dislike most about the 1s overcall is p mighnt well have 4-card h suit and one spade and cant do a thing|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Facing a passed partner there is less reason to tell the opponents both majors are breaking badly|pg||
nt|chick: in that case, why tell the opponents that spades are breaking badly :)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: you are never playing this contract so why help opps|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S is 100% normal|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: W is deeply in thoughts. That might as well last even longer.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: u serious mark|pg||
nt|chick: I agree with John, if you are going to bid at all, should give partner 2 suits to work with, not just one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: the most obvious bid of the week-end - 2D|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Then put me in Mark's camp; I think 1@S is perfectly normal|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: 1@S is at least less likely to get a double. And gives the partner a clue for a lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am not going to show a two suiter with such weak hearts and a passed partner|pg||
