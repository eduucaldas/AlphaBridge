mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: very well bep :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hajru:  2nt is forcing and that makes a lot of sense, with a balanced 11 or so, just decide to bid game or not yourself|pg||
nt|ugis: would you bid 1d over 1c with W cards?|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, I would not. The suit is way to weak and most of the time, I find myself on lead anyway.|pg||

nt|ugis: y, rather impossible|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hajru:  Hmm, I guess this is why he is playing and we are commentators|pg||
