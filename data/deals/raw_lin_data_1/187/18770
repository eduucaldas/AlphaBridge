nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: wlc  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gavin:  west's distribution makes her hand a comfortable texas transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  when both bids are jumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not enough to explore for slam, so looking for best game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|newmoon: a normal @C-lead gives the overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: Nice choice |pg||

nt|gavin:  more difficult when west is dummy|pg||
nt|gavin:  as T, J, Q, A doesnt really expose norths singleton|pg||

nt|newmoon: the "t" was silent|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||

pc|h3|nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||

nt|newmoon: many play bergen 3@C, personally I play 3@C as wjs|pg||

nt|newmoon: need extra @S to go 2@S in 5th seat|pg||
nt|newmoon: I will post the transcript of the VUgraph of this match also on www.sabf.co.za|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|newmoon: 3rd seat 1@S or 2@S (5-4) ?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|tec123: I agree, After 1@H P 1N I like to use 2@S as any GF and 3of a suit as 4/4 Invitational, but that problem has disappeared now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|newmoon: he went 2@S... I am more conservative, in 5th seat, vul|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4th seat|pg||
nt|tec123: I would open a weak 2@S at these colours in 3rd seat opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, esp at white v/s red|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|4C|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||

nt|newmoon: Tim - u were right - 2@S makes on bd 8, and sure enough gave Tunisia a dble-swing = 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|glensa: Hi kibitzers, they have asked me to commentate|pg||
mb|1N|nt|newmoon: Bd 9, Egypt push to 3NT in OR, and lose another 3 IMPs|pg||

mb|2C|nt|glensa: 4 hearts makes, but will they get there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: Good small slam and better 7@C contract here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|newmoon: the first slam... 6@C / 6@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gavin:  west needs to come in here |pg||

nt|gavin:  the initial pass over 1S|pg||
nt|gavin:  was a sound pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: yes.... and 7@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  now there is a risk of your opponents bidding 3NT having never got your heart lead|pg||
nt|glensa: well done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gavin:  the risk of overcalling is quite large the 2nd time around|pg||
nt|gavin:  as n-s havent found a fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and now norths double would be penalty|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|newmoon: 7@C - no finessing - ruff a spade in West after getting pitches on @Hs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gavin:  but it feels ugly to never bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|tec123: May get there now as Blackwood transferred back :)|pg||

nt|glensa: i think on this auction a double by south of 3d should show a better hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin:  here is a good example of declarer being able to take advantage of defensive carding|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that she rose ace of diamonds, seems like she wants to be in dummy to either lead trumps or high clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tec123: My choice would be a @H as well - I tend to attacke againt 3NT, but would lead a @S against 1N say where defense can take their time to look for tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||
nt|gavin:  not sure I like unblocking the Ten, EW are going to get their hearts in|pg||
nt|gavin:  at some point in the trump drawing process|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||
nt|gavin:  but its a purposeless entry once the opponents play hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: just checking my brain :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: this is not going well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newmoon: OR bd 9, bidding stopped   4@C by South|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: Paretner asks you to choose between @H & @D so you choose @S - may worry West|pg||

nt|glensa: should be a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wygbe1: are ns playing polish 2 bids?|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Taymour El Henawy (Egypt) has just joined him as commentator|pg||
nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||
nt|tec123: agreed|pg||
nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||
nt|glensa: 6 diamonds has a play, but is a bad contract on a spade lead.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|newmoon: AJxx, xx, KJx, 10xxx   = 3@D (just)|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops          AJx, xx, 10xxx, KJxx   I meant|pg||
nt|newmoon: transposed @C and @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: ignore me|pg||
nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|gavin:  so with 5 boards to play the 84 imp lead will be enough for Joel to capture the 2nd USA birth in the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: no|pg||
nt|tec123: Declarer can be held to 4 trump tricks and 2 clubs on best defense|pg||
nt|newmoon: easy pickup of 12 IMPs in that case, if West passes now|pg||
nt|newmoon: what has West got that he hasn't already shown?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: Agreed, but always worth taking some time to ensure that you are passing a Penalty double - probably discussion over some bids meaning|pg||

nt|tec123: Looks likw 3NT again - though it takews a spade lead to stop 6 with hearts 3-3|pg||
nt|newmoon: 1@S = relay|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|nt|newmoon: 2@S = suit (4+)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|tec123: At least 7 tricks here, and can make 8 on @H finesse (which would be risky if @D 5-3)|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H is interesting.  As Tim said, a @S lead beats it... but @C10 lead looks more appealing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|glensa: This is an easy 10 tricks now, as only the ace and another diamond can beat this hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tec123: One might Dbl 6@H to ensure @S lead|pg||
nt|newmoon: North surmising whether South can have AQJxxx @Hs, or even if @Hs 3-3 if only AQxxxx.   |pg||
nt|newmoon: OR in 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: in OR @D9 was led, so +2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tec123: Again the delays are probably for system explanations |pg||

nt|tec123: Choices for West - 4@H, 2@H or a fit jump of 3@S - personally the lattermost - North now has room to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa - why didn't South open 2@D, I am asked|pg||
nt|newmoon: not with 4 cards @h  one says;   Mostafa says 2@D may be weaker|pg||
nt|glensa: the same 3d contract will be reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@S is a transfer to 3N (as they play 3N as both minors|pg||
nt|newmoon: good interaction between kibs and panel.   If u see +++ in profile by commentators, that means you CAN chat to person|pg||
nt|tec123: Much discussion on whether to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major - I do , but you need a system where is pard is good enough to proceed you can show the 4 card major so a fit ...|pg||
nt|tec123: is not lost|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|glensa: in the old days, east could have checked for a 4-4 heart fit and reached a decent game (just reverse west's hearts and spades)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|newmoon: next VUgraph = 15h20 Cairo time, 14h20 Tunisian time|pg||

nt|newmoon: wash = 0 swing|pg||
nt|tec123: Boards running out for Egypt to eat into a big Tunisian lead|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|newmoon: opening by West?   3@D vul?|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@D is multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: another fairly dull board with 3nt on ns and no reason to get higher|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tec123: This could be abit of blood if Neville opens 3D - maybe 500|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Bosie wants to defend....|pg||
nt|tec123: 3N is easy, but 500/800 is better|pg||
nt|newmoon: helloooooooo, what is happening, Operator?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Bathroom break?|pg||
nt|tec123: Its tough - he can pass, bid 3H or 3N - if partner has made a shaped double this could be tight, but any cards pard has are likely to be lying well, so pass looks right at these ...|pg||
nt|tec123: colours|pg||
nt|glensa: vugraph, do you have the auction correct?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: A spade partial for EW - danger is getting too high|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@S, even if a max pass, may still by it|pg||
nt|newmoon: buy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 2@d is 4 @s and another |pg||
nt|jjsb: so yes|pg||
nt|glensa: thank you, an astro use|pg||
nt|jjsb: another 5+ that is |pg||
pc|h6|nt|tec123: I assume 2@S shows a maximum passed hand with a @C fit, but no reason for E to proceed with a minimum opening|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jjsb: we call it "reunion jacoby" :) just dont laugh too much pls :) |pg||
pc|h8|nt|newmoon: now South thinking "I could have had a shape 11-count for my dble.  Is there a slam?"|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c6|pc|h3|nt|tec123: I think only a spade towards the J works now - a second heart means they can set up 4 tricks|pg||
