mb|p|nt|p m g: = Ups Calin|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: I hope so too as what will I do this afternoon :) |pg||
nt|grebrof: many dbl with Ns hand - over ps 2@c - 2@d nonforcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|oosb: Hi Everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hello again - welcome back|pg||
mc|8|nt|dslee: Welcome all :) for the next 14 deals, we would bring in analysis of the hands, results and also would look forward to hear from the specs their opinions - my name is debgiri and I ...|pg||
nt|dslee: am commentating from Sao paulo, Brazil, welcome to this match|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Some comments from Copenhagen as well - Hans|pg||
nt|dslee: welcome Hans :)|pg||
nt|lml: hello from Canada|pg||
nt|oosb: Two fantastic semi finals for you|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Linda!|pg||
nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
pg||

nt|eamongall: However he won't be happy as McGann grabbed the hand in EW at the other table nd is losing 3 50 point undertricks |pg||
nt|lml: always nice to make your first contract|pg||
nt|lml: relaxes the nerves a bit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: i still have a problem, numers of boards are incorrect|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Trup-lead will NOT do 4 @H any good|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Trump|pg||
nt|dslee: Will NS reach 4@S :) likely no|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vbman: quantitative will save this hand or will end the auction|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess any score in, is happy at this moment in the match|pg||
mb|d|nt|p m g: As a spec asked: EW need to do thing. They did at last board.|pg||
nt|dslee: good bid by  S- this would open dooors for sure|pg||
nt|dslee: lots of players fumble with these hands in a red vs white position|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Now South has a hand for 4 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One @S more than promised|pg||
nt|dslee: surely - 3@H is good raise or more|pg||
nt|oosb: Part game in @S |pg||
nt|bobholl: possible 4@S but they won't bid it i guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vbman: dint like 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Is'nt BBO great ... I remember when we used transparencies and projectors for vugraph presentations |pg||
nt|lml: 4 looks tough to me|pg||
nt|oosb: 4 seems ambitious|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|p m g: For them h don't know. At 2/1 1NT is force by one round |pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  The lead - 100 or 500...!?!|pg||
nt|lml: they can beat it off the top actually|pg||
nt|vugraphpl7: now everything it's ok, sorry again|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might make excatly, losing 3@s 1@h 2@d|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess we will see who are playing this last set og this exciting semi final too:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Julian, Jon and Marek|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dslee: good sac|pg||
nt|dslee: @H lead is mandatory while @D lead is tempting :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  @D-lead is OK - with a switch|pg||
nt|dslee: shoud lead @H , since S has a singleton @H|pg||
nt|dslee: not much of prospect for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|oosb: infact 2@S seems high enough, in 3 you might struggle to ruff all the @H|pg||
nt|oosb: and might have to resort on @c finesse|pg||
nt|lml: 3 is possible if you take the finesse now|pg||
nt|oosb: resort to*|pg||
nt|lml: and it really seems okay to me to do it|pg||
nt|lml: you need tricks and even if it loses it produces an extra trick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: stirbu said it isnt forcing|pg||
pc|s4|nt|p m g: If so here is a TD work.|pg||
nt|p m g: I will always recall TD now. AND E pressed to bid as it was no force|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosb: I dont know about that|pg||
nt|oosb: in 2@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East's X will help declarer to place the cards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|oosb: only way to go down is to lose @c or @s|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Seems better|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|edmunte1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|p m g: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1nt is semiforcing 6-12 hcp|pg||
nt|edmunte1: can be passed with a balanced minimum hand|pg||
nt|p m g: Like ure CC. Learning every day in Galatsi?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think its kettle time as both rooms declaring 3NT |pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont remember that - but I agree - BBO is great :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dslee: was wondering :) so -1 now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|p m g: :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi all from Poznan|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  East did not want the @h switch but declarer would have placed East with the king anyway|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|edmunte1: a @c return could have been more usefull|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  No big difference, but better play to let the first @S go to hand - and then ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosb: but I guess even if it loses you hope not to lose @S|pg||
pc|h6|nt|edmunte1: Ghigheci thought that double should mean a @d lead, but str is @s lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I will sit back and think about, WHEN a lead from Q x x x x x x is good...?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: there is a risk that you could lose 2 diamonds 2 hearts a club and a spade|pg||
pc|h8|nt|grebrof: @h?|pg||
nt|oosb: OR A@H onside so its safe|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yorkbeach:  3@h 1@s 1@d 2@c = 7 so no need to take any chances|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d8|nt|lml: but you might need go down anyway in that case|pg||
nt|oosb: yeah but you do gain 2 tricks from finessing|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Daniel Gulyas|pg||
nt|oosb: and ruffing @h otherwise might be cumbersome|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|nt|edmunte1: still declarer didn't found the way home|pg||
nt|dslee: West is more or less void in @S - so this @S lead would not had been fetching a lot - if there is a @S trik, it wont go anywhere|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hawe45:  At the other table, South led @C King|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: after the @H ruff    is declarer guesses the @Ss   he will make|pg||
nt|daman: if*|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer plays J@S on first round of trumps  may lose 6 tricks   2 hearts and a ruff 2 spades and A@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|daman: now the threazt of a @C ruff by East|pg||
nt|ady: also west can play A@S on 1st round and give east a club ruff and get a heart ruff|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|7|nt|ady: nice safe defence by west   |pg||
nt|daman: Vriend have score 9 IMPs on 15 and 16|pg||
nt|daman: and this was a push|pg||
nt|daman: whoops   even that has changed|pg||
nt|ady: seems hands 15 and 16 were played in our absence   good results for Vriend|pg||
nt|daman: they have now scored 6 IMPs|pg||
pg||

nt|eamongall: heres a good one ...who will win the auction ... probably @Ss but how high|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi Daniel|pg||
nt|oosb: E has a monster hand|pg||
nt|oosb: almost have 6@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice hand, looks like @H slam is on the finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: you need a little more, so its not a good slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another unexciting deal :(|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT again?|pg||
mb|p|nt|p m g: 20-20 and no Roland. Swich JS to W|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: NS play 1nt 14-16, so with 17-19 they open 1 minor|pg||
nt|dslee: a  part score hand at the best for EW|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2 @s? :D|pg||
nt|bobholl: strong @C easier otherwise you have to open 1@C and hope for the best|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|edmunte1: 2@c=majors|pg||
nt|vbman: difficult to dbl with 8 solid|pg||
nt|eamongall: in the other room Brown bounced quickly into 4@S |pg||
nt|lml: anybody know what 2@C is?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C the Dutch gadget: wk2 in @D or str any|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep (vriend) will bid 3@D i guess|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  maybe 2@s NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: thanks |pg||
nt|oosb: nice preemption|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: via a double and some opps bidding and a small noise from McGann |pg||
nt|lml: east-west could end in spades now if East reopens with 4@D|pg||
nt|oosb: have taken away alot of space|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am not a fan myself, but it works against weak opps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S contract has some interest|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: opening 2@D weak would have much the same effect|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: Axxx of cl is xtremely dangerous for 3 h l think|pg||
nt|eamongall: they can get this but need to keep @DK @DQ in pocket |pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: 2@d ask which is longer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - declarer needs to avoid losing two trumps & a ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  or possibly two ruffs - @h West and @c East|pg||
pc|cK|nt|edmunte1: disciplined pass by Ghigheci|pg||
nt|lml: but if you use that bid for other purposes like multi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: max pressure is my style too - sometimes weak|pg||
nt|vbman: must be careful with exit cards|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice bid by W|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if I were a betting man, I would bet on down 1|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: rusinov leads|pg||
nt|edmunte1: knowing that points are badly placed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dslee: target reached |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @H-ruff, there should be 110|pg||
nt|lml: east-west did get to the right place|pg||
nt|lml: and maybe the preemption kept them out of the slam they wouldnt make|pg||
nt|oosb: well done|pg||
nt|gulyas: limited values, but E knows he cannot have much since he passed over 3@D|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hawe45:  Strange - but good - lead!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eamongall: maybe not so strange ... 1@D is @H transfer .. and Pass is no fit .. but I would not think of it |pg||
nt|dslee: these leads are effective when Kxx is on Table and declarer has the J and ptr has the Q :) and of course Jx with declarer :) here I guess the assumption of the lead was to see ...|pg||
nt|dslee: whether N has a Kx in the suit :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  MUst be the @D 3 instead...|pg||
nt|vbman: just fine but trapping pard?|pg||

pc|cT|nt|gulyas: Bd2 Pepsi did go down in 3@S, so first blood to Vriend|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Wake up call just told me, that North with 3 @H might have bid 1 @H - which explains the lead. BRAVO - and good morning|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DidÂ´nt see the ALERT over 1 @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vbman: that happens to all of us|pg||
nt|eamongall: sure ..|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess S thought the small @d shift was invitational|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|vbman: seems so|pg||
nt|jbgood: safe bet |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|sQ|pc|c3|pg||
mc|7|nt|hawe45:  Christmas presents not accepted here|pg||

nt|eamongall: happened me as well less then 7 months ago ...pard with @D94 switch @D4 ... |pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ was a nice play, retaining trump control|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes indeed|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|p m g: A nice agressive one from CR.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: i believe that 2@c was a littile bit too agressive|pg||
nt|eamongall: 3NT rewound for equals -1000 |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chance of game this time 24 HCP & three tens|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: this should be fairly straightforward|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: 1@c is 2+, can have 4+@d if @d is a bad suit|pg||
nt|dslee: what system is NS playing? Precision ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: another 11-trick game for EW|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: 3 pushes - surely a lowscoring match so far|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North will like the @dJ in dummy|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  on @d lead, 2@d 3@c 3@s 1@h = 9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has other ideas|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 2@d tricks but 4@s possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same here a little slower|pg||
nt|jbgood: lead often from a doubleton with known length in S|pg||
nt|jbgood: but....|pg||
nt|jbgood: must be a record low scoring semifinals so far, were the cards in the first set that flat?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dslee: but in any case, this 3NT would be bid now|pg||
nt|dslee: bang on|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1@h showing @s and 2@s 12-14 or so|pg||
nt|eamongall: however maybe Hanlon play bigger @D but on vugraph is @Dx|pg||
nt|grebrof: could be|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: operator? |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|edmunte1: this is an easy maker|pg||
nt|p m g: And here as at CR opps lost the sac.|pg||
nt|edmunte1: Stirbu would lead one Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D are forever|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|oosb: No problems here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|edmunte1: not a good sac|pg||
nt|dslee: EW is rich this time :)|pg||
nt|dslee: hans, do you see a very outside chance of 9 tricks now?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: it happened anyway|pg||
nt|vbman: and the spot wont matter l suppose|pg||
nt|grebrof: only 37 behind|pg||
nt|eamongall: it happened and is 10 imps no matter |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vbman: just need some work and chance for -40|pg||
nt|lml: I guess north thought the vul was wrong to open the weak 2 diamond gadget|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult situation for the defence: @H K and a small @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East might be endplayed then|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphpl7: it didn't happen|pg||
nt|eamongall: I recall one time there was discussion among Irish Open team mates about some hand and Hanlon says "I am going out to talk to the ducks in the pond , they talk more sense " |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability and lie of cards more favourable to NS this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|grebrof: 53 is still possible :P|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  can make 3@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: either diamonds or spade game is fine|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW might make 4@h|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|edmunte1: in this board knowing that partenr had 5@h and 8+ hcp made it easy for Ghigheci to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@S is very nice in pairs but i guess they will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@s doubled is thus a cheap save|pg||
nt|jbgood: but this time NS will save|pg||
nt|jbgood: (or S)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: fine spot really|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dslee: any chance of anymore bidding :)?|pg||

nt|edmunte1: 2@h|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i.e. pretend to have singleton club|pg||

nt|bobholl: 4@S has got 4 losers but can they discover that in time ?|pg||
nt|oosb: Would be excellent bridge if they avoid it|pg||

nt|gulyas: red suits are somewhat softish, but what can you do|pg||
nt|bobholl: bid 21/2 @S :)|pg||
nt|lml: I think players are a bit too aggressive NV at imps.  NV game should be close to 50%; V 33% is ok|pg||
nt|lml: South has a limit raise and she pretty well has to bid it|pg||
nt|lml: it will be up to Maas|pg||
nt|oosb: possibly a bergen raise if they play it|pg||
nt|oosb: in which case North will be even more likely to bid game|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  @s force on dummy may trouble 6@c|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Double should logically be for the RED suits here|pg||

nt|oosb: Actually 3NT not that bad, wouldve probably got a @H lead you're right|pg||
nt|lml: I thought of that too but they can find the diamond shift after a heart lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we think 2NT = transfer to @c?|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think so - but not Maas...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cashing 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: this was too much upgrading by anton (maas) but you may prevent a vulnarable game :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||

nt|oosb: AK@D with E for example|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: yes, E has a problem, wont lead @D for sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H vulnarable too much for my stomach :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: of course, overcalling on a 9 count, or preempting with a 6c suit is not everybody's cake|pg||
nt|gulyas: its too balanced|pg||
nt|oosb: I dont think they'll try for slam South will put the brakes on|pg||
nt|bobholl: exactly :)|pg||
nt|pelu: if S could bid 2@S forcing easy way to slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we will find out from South's reply whether the 1SK counts as a key card|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh for sure since 4NT implies spade fit|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|dslee: this is an interesting twist I guess - |pg||

nt|vugraphpl7: E has a problem and director try to solve it|pg||

nt|oosb: serious 3NT?|pg||
nt|oosb: seriously?|pg||

nt|oosb: That makes sense :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  nice thing about this auction is that North declares|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so if @d were 4-0, West would need the @cA entry|pg||

nt|gulyas: 5@D somewhat lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: NS can make upto 5@H  in this hand as the cards are|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good spot here is 3 NT - with the hand with @C King on lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: last board looked like 10tricks, but I guess its not important|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 in a red is on - but what does N do in 6@h with a @d lead?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not such a good slam here - would not want to bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|oosb: Jx = 0 no?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S 4@S ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not bad after the overcall|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s3-2 looks like a better chance than the @dK onside|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerable overcall chanegs teh odds a bit|pg||
nt|jbgood: but on a non dia lead you can try the spades first in 6 @h..|pg||
nt|pelu: u would never have a @D lead from West :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East will ruff the second @s|pg||
nt|jbgood: Peter - you know the rule: @d ag  small slams|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict 6@H will be made|pg||
mb|4C|nt|oosb: 5@D is what 20% or so?|pg||
mb|p|nt|p m g: Ne problema Ed. Galatsi ne stress:))|pg||
nt|gulyas: around there, yes|pg||
nt|lml: they are in 4@S in the OR|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but do you predict they will bid it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bid may be another matter|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry , Jon, I forgot :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@C is going to make it hard to reach hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@C down 1 - unlucky for Mahaffey|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h should show 3 - so ...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pelu: yes Jon 4@H by S|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 4@s = 2-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: you're right|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|jbgood: going plus at least (or at last?)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|edmunte1: 12 tricks with endplay|pg||
nt|dslee: why not 5@H?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Depends all on - where is the @C King???|pg||
nt|dslee: eases a lot of tension since the hand which did micheals is on lead with whatever picture he holds- @C K is more likely to be with W|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: @D 22 is 40 half for the @C finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

nt|bobholl: 150 is not much :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: its ok if you were not bidding game anyway|pg||
nt|lml: it wouldnt be bad against a diamond partscore but that is not what is happening|pg||
nt|gulyas: but this may be the first decent swing of the match|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they make 4@S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on a low scoring match luck can play a big part|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the swing on 23 could easily have been the other way|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: I think they will as the cards are pretty good.  But it is still not clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: yes a 25 IMP board|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: the great card dealer has exchanged his/her silk gloves with boxing gloves this set|pg||
pc|d2|nt|edmunte1: 4@s goes down on a @d lead|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 5@c intended as a Pas/corect to your suit bid|pg||
nt|p m g: A bit fight now:) 1NT=11-14 2S=S + a minor|pg||
nt|oosb: 5@D just 35% or so, but 3@HX was probably always a good score? atleast -2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - heard our moans about the first few boards :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oosb: But neither player really had a hand that could dbl|pg||

nt|grebrof: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxp/qu.html|pg||
nt|oosb: There's the weak @d bid again|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you trust pd to have a decent hand for opening a wk2 in 2nd pos, you could whack 3@H with E|pg||
pc|hT|nt|grebrof: mixed pairs qualifications - Betong currently at 19th, being 10th earlier today|pg||
