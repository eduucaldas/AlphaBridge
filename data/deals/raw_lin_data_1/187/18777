nt|newmoon: Splinter by West, anyone?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gavin:  sprung making a little move|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: she did well, since ew can make 3c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: only intermediate vul|pg||
nt|gavin:  with 2 sure heart losers and 2 sure club losers this contract hinges on not losing 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|newmoon: unlucky trump break, but on a normal 2-1 split, slam is cold IF YOU CAN TELL PARTNER ABOUT YOUR @c SHORTAGE|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h6|nt|newmoon: Jedidi will smile when he finds out about trump split|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin:  by finessing through east twice|pg||
nt|tec123: 2@D is only forcing to suit agreement not game. Now just need to find Q@S for overtrick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gavin:  you avoid losing 2 diamonds whenever east holds at least one honor|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|gavin:  north isnt strong enough for a competative 2/1 bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this is always an uncomfortable spot because souh will never really find out that north has 5@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|gavin:  a reopening double will earn a 2NT bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: we play negative free bids for hearts, but jtxxx?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Welcome to Tim Cope from Cape Town  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this auction shows "a hand not strong enough to bid a direct 2@H"|pg||
nt|newmoon: these matches last 20 boards...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|newmoon: hmmm "does 4@H make"  Bosie muses...|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  would typically have more hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: fearless 3h bid - can make by guessing h suit|pg||
nt|gavin:  but sprung hits a bullseye|pg||
nt|tec123: Can go down on a club lead in 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: good stop, and event 2NT is precarious|pg||
nt|newmoon: even not "event"|pg||
nt|newmoon: the "t" was silent|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tec123: I think he will struggle without help to find the 8th trick as there is no entry to dummy for the @H finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: I am lost with this bidding...  conventional meanings|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|tec123: This will be a good slam to bid, making when there is only 1 possible heart loser and all the clubs disappear on the AK @D and the established 5th @D|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H available here - even on @C lead - he has to smother @H10 dbleton on his right|pg||
nt|newmoon: on North's left, i.e.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|newmoon: in -practice, @C-lead is difficult to find against 6@H|pg||

nt|newmoon: Egypt beat SA yesterday - we saw it all on VUgraph - here is the transcript:  http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/bb1.htm|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|gavin:  you must begin the suit by leading low from Axx|pg||
nt|newmoon: @CA intact, @Ds blocked...  exit a diamond now|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the fullness of time, the @C9 makes!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|gavin:  leading the jack has the added bonus of being able to pick up KQx in east and 9x with west|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|newmoon: kib said:  "egypt player play a system called gandofli and 1 @d opening means 11-22 pts and no 4 cards in @s or 4 cards in @h"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfk: ????????????????????????|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  south could decide to overcall 1NT or double , I like double much better|pg||
nt|gavin:  since their partner is a passed hand the likely hood of game in NT isnt great|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: i said 1nt recently, paid with my life almost :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  as a passed hand sprung has a max|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i agree, with the dblton diamond - with 3 or more diamonds, it is closer to a nt overcall|pg||

pc|s4|nt|gavin:  then were down 55 imps at one point in the semi finals of the USA 2 bracket|pg||

nt|newmoon: yes, esp at white v/s red|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry, trouble with the Internet connexion...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||

nt|newmoon: bd 7:  3 IMPs to SA    gap is closing|pg||
nt|newmoon: Tim - u were right - 2@S makes on bd 8, and sure enough gave Tunisia a dble-swing = 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|glensa: Hi kibitzers, they have asked me to commentate|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: Bd 9, Egypt push to 3NT in OR, and lose another 3 IMPs|pg||
nt|tec123: This looks like a routine 3N with possible overtricks if we find the Q@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: 4 hearts makes, but will they get there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: Good small slam and better 7@C contract here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|newmoon: the first slam... 6@C / 6@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|gavin:  west needs to come in here |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: y|pg||
nt|gavin:  the initial pass over 1S|pg||
nt|gavin:  was a sound pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: yes.... and 7@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  now there is a risk of your opponents bidding 3NT having never got your heart lead|pg||
nt|glensa: well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  the risk of overcalling is quite large the 2nd time around|pg||
nt|gavin:  as n-s havent found a fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and now norths double would be penalty|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|newmoon: 7@C - no finessing - ruff a spade in West after getting pitches on @Hs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|tec123: May get there now as Blackwood transferred back :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|glensa: i think on this auction a double by south of 3d should show a better hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gavin:  here is a good example of declarer being able to take advantage of defensive carding|pg||
nt|gavin:  there is no way that west would lie about her club count |pg||
nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||
nt|gavin:  interesting that she rose ace of diamonds, seems like she wants to be in dummy to either lead trumps or high clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tec123: My choice would be a @H as well - I tend to attacke againt 3NT, but would lead a @S against 1N say where defense can take their time to look for tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||
nt|gavin:  not sure I like unblocking the Ten, EW are going to get their hearts in|pg||
nt|gavin:  at some point in the trump drawing process|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||
nt|gavin:  but its a purposeless entry once the opponents play hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: just checking my brain :)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|tec123: Paretner asks you to choose between @H & @D so you choose @S - may worry West|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9, loss to SA of 3 IMPs (or 5)     playing still in 4@C by South in OR|pg||
nt|glensa: should be a routine 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: are ns playing polish 2 bids?|pg||
nt|newmoon: and Taymour El Henawy (Egypt) has just joined him as commentator|pg||
nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2 soft Js in his raise... I like 2@S|pg||
nt|tec123: agreed|pg||
nt|newmoon: AJx, xxx, KJx, 10xxx  = 2@D raise  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: That looks wrong...maybe 3@C|pg||
nt|glensa: 6 diamonds has a play, but is a bad contract on a spade lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: AJxx, xx, KJx, 10xxx   = 3@D (just)|pg||
nt|newmoon: woops          AJx, xx, 10xxx, KJxx   I meant|pg||
nt|newmoon: transposed @C and @D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: ignore me|pg||
nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  so with 5 boards to play the 84 imp lead will be enough for Joel to capture the 2nd USA birth in the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: no|pg||
nt|tec123: Declarer can be held to 4 trump tricks and 2 clubs on best defense|pg||

nt|newmoon: what has West got that he hasn't already shown?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tec123: Agreed, but always worth taking some time to ensure that you are passing a Penalty double - probably discussion over some bids meaning|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|newmoon: 1@H was alerted as 4+|pg||
nt|tec123: Looks likw 3NT again - though it takews a spade lead to stop 6 with hearts 3-3|pg||

nt|newmoon: 6@H is interesting.  As Tim said, a @S lead beats it... but @C10 lead looks more appealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|glensa: This is an easy 10 tricks now, as only the ace and another diamond can beat this hand|pg||

nt|tec123: Choices for West - 4@H, 2@H or a fit jump of 3@S - personally the lattermost - North now has room to bid 4@H|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa - why didn't South open 2@D, I am asked|pg||
nt|newmoon: not with 4 cards @h  one says;   Mostafa says 2@D may be weaker|pg||
nt|glensa: the same 3d contract will be reached|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@S is a transfer to 3N (as they play 3N as both minors|pg||
nt|newmoon: good interaction between kibs and panel.   If u see +++ in profile by commentators, that means you CAN chat to person|pg||
nt|tec123: Much discussion on whether to open a weak 2 with a side 4 card major - I do , but you need a system where is pard is good enough to proceed you can show the 4 card major so a fit ...|pg||
nt|tec123: is not lost|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: dunno which match will be featured|pg||

nt|newmoon: helloooooooo, what is happening, Operator?|pg||
nt|newmoon: Bathroom break?|pg||
nt|tec123: Its tough - he can pass, bid 3H or 3N - if partner has made a shaped double this could be tight, but any cards pard has are likely to be lying well, so pass looks right at these ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|newmoon: In the CR East led a small @S... equivalent to ducking first @S if West lead... and 3NT is down there!|pg||

pc|c8|nt|timmy5: hearts|pg||
nt|timmy5: 3nt = spds so he bid 4spds|pg||
nt|newmoon: over 3@D, puppet stayman bid = 4@D surely with 4-4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: 4@s will be reached here i assume |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|newmoon: both rooms are playing fast now... seems that there was a time warning.   Both operators couldn't keep up with play|pg||
nt|newmoon: as we said before 1@h maybe with 4 cards and 1@s relay|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|newmoon: and yes, Tim, bd 16 could have been a wash in 3@Dx both rooms.    Really, was that a 3@D bid, vul, 1st seat?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jjsb: surprised she did not opeen 1nt as they are playing that weak vulnerable ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: they migth change ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jjsb: well ok maybe they changed... |pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|glensa: sylvain, is this reunion style to rebid 1nt, i am a raiser to 2 spades|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|newmoon: in OR, South 1NT, North 3NT, swish|pg||
nt|tec123: A spade lead can beat 3N provided E snatches his aces when a minor suit is played|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: possible dble-swing now.   200 here + 100 from OR = 300 = 7 IMPs to Tunisia             provided they get 3@H here -2|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jjsb: we are french .. so i guess we are not "used" to that 3card fit ... i like also 2@s here |pg||
nt|glensa: I would give north 80% of the blame for not reaching game and south 50%|pg||

nt|glensa: When teammates come back with a bad result, I usually give out more than 100% of the blame as it stops them from asking in the future. :)|pg||
nt|glensa: last board, thanks all|pg||
nt|newmoon: Gower's 3@H didn't cost, as 2@S makes (@CQ was right)    |pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: well defended both rooms.   10 marks to West in OR for finding the @S lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: thanks Glen ! |pg||
mb|2N|nt|glensa: thanks sylvain|pg||
nt|jjsb: this looks like a no brainer last hand as i see it |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glensa: 1 club is any blcd hand not in 14-16 range, 1 spade is no four card major, less than 11|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tec123: A daring 6H contract making when @D are 3-3 and @H 2-2 ?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tec123: 4@S possible here (on spade finesse) - will it be bid?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|newmoon: There will be one VUgraph match shown in each session.  Tomorrow's time is 11h30.  South African time.    http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/bbo.html|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|newmoon: 1@D - 1@H, 1@S - 2@H  (same there)  but then WEST BIDS 4@c (SPLINTER)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h5|nt|tec123: After only bidding 1@S over 2@H a splinter to 4@C may have got them there|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tec123: West must discard a @H in order to make now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|tec123: Very good lead, and nice play of K@C confusing the issue - excellent defence|pg||
nt|newmoon: snap|pg||
nt|tec123: lol|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|newmoon: and luck favours the brave... trumps 2-2 and @Ds are kind|pg||
nt|tec123: So this should be 13 IMPS back to Egypt making the match score 51-29 - a good win for Tunisia and well deserved on their play at this table|pg||
nt|newmoon: thx to Tim Cope for commentating and for his presence, and thx BBO for giving us this wonderful VUgraph|pg||
