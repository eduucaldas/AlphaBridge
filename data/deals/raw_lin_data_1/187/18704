nt|vugraphzek: Chinese Taipei (3) - Japan (2)|pg||
nt|patricck: I like double over the 1@C opening rather than 1@D|pg||
nt|patricck: gets 3 suits into the picture rather than just the A9742 of @D|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Re Chayes and specs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Welcome :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any undo or tru?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W wont pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  but question whether to dbl as take out or bid suit|pg||
nt|jcwla: So here we go with a big @C opening, what is the double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looked like majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  this would explain S taking so long over 2@s|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would have thought so but in that case what is p/c by the 2@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S weak|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  ok, don't know because hand doesn't match what I would expect for p/c|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: and the 3 card @H suit is AJ10 after all, not too shabby|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@S 1@H 2@C = 6 tricks. Declarer will struggle after that|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Dennis|pg||

nt|rodal f: Here timing must be correct|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Dennis and Roland.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: South doesn't double, in case giving away the heart position gives West her 10th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: China, World Champions in 2009 and 2010 and |pg||
nt|rodal f: Are we to see a 4@H at the end.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not now.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kerasidis: @c KQ in favour side|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Wonder if neg X ain't better to use at the long term over 2@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: @D in hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: The first costful one?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  since 4@h wasn't making, this may not be a great save|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Over for cross ruffs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By @H as the start|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: The bidding and play (@CK unblock = doubleton) indicate that clubs are 7-2. Thus declarer expects some bad breaks in other suits. |pg||
nt|petergill: when China lost the 2008 World Championship final by one imp, excellent Chinese people like Jack Zhao consoled them by telling them that he would help them become champions in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2009, correctly as it turned out|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: N with a sure trick is there to wield the ax and bidding 5 over 5 is not in the picture at this level so W has elected to "take insurance" and although not a winning decision the ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: cost will not be too dear.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|petergill: If club ruff, then @HQ should be ducked by South|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are young, played youth events in 2008 I think|pg||
nt|patricck: welcome to this match in the Asia Pacific Championships between the Ladies teams of Japan and Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer cashing up the spades in case east can pitch one after 3 rounds of @D|pg||
nt|patricck: Declarer of course doesn't know about the favourable position of the J@D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c8|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Let us say, it would take exceedingly friendly defense to bring home 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since 4@h dbld can go for 300-500, the cost isn't that cheap|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: I can see 9 tricks, but declarer needs friendlier spades, I think|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|petergill: A good general principle is: never overruff with ace from Axx or Axx in trumps, usually ok to overruff with bare ace or Ax in trumps. |pg||
nt|petergill: West now hopes @HQ drops doubleton then @CJ drops singleton under @CQ, about a one in a million chance. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Paula a bit lucky after the @D try?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: This is an improtant match between the teams that are 2nd and 3rd, at the moment China is in the lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: cliam time|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|nt|petergill: NS are one of the highest ranked female pairs in the world, if not the highest ranked|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could easily be 7 imps|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|petergill: @CK play at Trick 1 was too revealing to declarer. Better to play small on the club lead, then the king on the 2nd round of clubs might be from Kxx - less revealing to declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: China are overwhelming favourites to win the Women's ABPF Championship for the umpteenth time is a row|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei and Indonesia are good medal chances, not good gold medal chances though|pg||

nt|petergill: His coach Patrick Huang would be proud of his play. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: claim*|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly 4@H also would be home. Only a @D lead from E to beat it.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  one of the problems with the weak hand making a decision at the 5 level|pg||
nt|petergill: No double, so only 50's = no big deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Ns better be caredul.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Regardless of the level S chose (and made a choice here that worked out great), showing the majors and then bidding @H's did show the nature of the hand well.|pg||
nt|patricck: Current scores are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT from East will make with the favourable @D break. 6NT from West can be beaten with a @S lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Jed and C Wu are Defending Champions in this event - they won last year, after much training by Patrick. |pg||
mb|4D|nt|rodal f: All with a good color exsept N who will become the boss|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: Suci Amita Dewi and Kristina Wahyu have been regulars on BBO for the last 5 years, practising a lot on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: But if you were playing6NT from East you might well go down even playing it reasonably|pg||
nt|rodal f: S aint gona give up here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kerasidis: 2@h kind wild i thing|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: Chayes, can u exsplain 1@H - 3@D?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I might have rebid only 2@D, not liking my Jx in RHO's suit nor my bare ace, but I think most people would rebid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 3D must be a Limit raise or better Bergan raise |pg||
nt|rodal f: A coffe anyway by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@C a nice spot and on for 500 at wourst now|pg||
nt|kerasidis: ns vul prevented north no show some values|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C probably shows clubs and @D, at least 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|patricck: South had better run or this will be expensive|pg||
nt|patricck: possible expenive even if she does run|pg||
nt|patricck: That is because if you play 3 rounds of diamonds you have no real chance to recover if they do not break|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: 3@D has guaranteed that they will reach 6@D or 7@D|pg||
nt|patricck: So best line may be 2 rounds of diamonds(in case doubleton J@D and then if nothing appears take the 50% chance of the Q@S finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: If the @D didn't break but the Q@S was onisde then everyone would say 6NT could be made with the spade finesse, unfortunately declarer doesn't know which option works|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Got there income it seems.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this must show a strong sequence for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Gupta:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 1@H 10-14 may have long minor|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hmm...usually 1@D does not include a 5-card M, no?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 1@D showed spades, 9-13 hcp|pg||
nt|jcwla: Perhaps they are playing negative free bids.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh OK.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Steve.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Steve:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|petergill: 7@D, needing 4-3 @H's or short @HK, is a good spot if NS are silent, but not quite so good once NS have bid  |pg||
nt|petergill: This contract looks likely to fail, but you never know|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@S is fairly safe, but still down after the defence starts with 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no alert all|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Wang Hogn Li worked out that her very bad heart pips would make 2@H difficult to play, opposite a void or singleton @H.|pg||
nt|petergill: Hong Li|pg||
nt|patricck: ast won't pass tho|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, famous last words by the commentator there :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  would 2@h over 2@c have been forcing or not?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: as suits are less likely to break when opponents bid vulnerable on low HCP|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: called commentator's curse,, |pg||
nt|patricck: so, this is interesting, declarer may pin everything on the @D and be lucky, or he may try to combine the chances as I have suggested and then he will fail|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwi_joker: sry I dont really know the continuations|pg||

mb|1S|nt|petergill: 1Nt will be East's bid|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: I expect NS to reach 3NT and with the well placed @H suit that shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: as 2@D would be like a 2/1, 10 or 11+ with @D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like to bid here, as East, because I hate balancing|pg||
nt|patricck: I am not a fan of doubling on hands like West's, seems to me that I am in the minority though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 13 count|pg||
nt|patricck: 4333 you either have enough to overcall 1NT (on 15-18) or you simply pass and await developments|pg||
mb|2S|nt|offthebend: and most likely a C lead and 11 tricks |pg||
nt|rodal f: 1NT forcing for a round Chayes?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: defenetly it wins|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6-4 is always a good shape, even if the texture of the 6 card suit is a bit shaky|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NOrth could try 3@C here, if that's invivtaioal and South has confirmed a @C suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  that treatment over NT seems to be losing favor|pg||
nt|sybarra: some might recommend overcalling 1 sp  (but not me)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 1@S on such a good suit is better than the takeout double, but pass is still the best choice|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|sybarra: agree,  I  would pass and see if pard can come int|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: he not arert|pg||
nt|rodal f: OK|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East gets a 2nd chance - I prefer to save my 2nd chances for more importtant things :)|pg||
nt|patricck: with the vulnerability it looks like E/W will be a well deserved -200 unless declarer can guess the @D suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|offthebend: S lead is also possible|pg||
nt|rodal f: Domes for -1 anyway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: They talked convention before match start 10 min|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As u presumed.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf  updated after round 6. Hong Kong leading now, Thailand 10th|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thailand killed from a slam? Let's ee what OR will do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gives the opponents an extra round of room to maneuver.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: After 9 rounds, China leads the Women's event by 31 VPs from Japan, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia, who are all close together|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I agree with Sun Ming - @H10 (the great heart suit) makes 3@H a better rebid than 3NT (only one stop in @C) or 3@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  if they can unscramble their tricks, 2@h should have gone down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it looks like it's making|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Careful with the @S10 now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was NF as exspected and drurey by 2@C no fit - 2@D with fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  E lead looks pretty natural though|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: If East had ovecalled 2@D the first time; West would find the raise to 3@D more easily|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: *see|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H weak, as 2@D would be a 7+ raise, an increasingly common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|patricck: OK, not stopping at 3NT, fortunately the cards are friendly enough to allow other possibilities|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: claim time|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have doubled 1@D on the East cards, but some experts prefer to bid their 5 card major |pg||

pc|c3|pg||

pc|s2|nt|patricck: hmmm, 4@S could be interesting|pg||

nt|tejjyid: There's a lot of work for South, but he should make 8 tricks without much trouble...the 9th, well, we'll see|pg||
nt|patricck: with the 2 trumps to come 200 will be quite acceptable to NS as they could only make a part-score their way|pg||

nt|kerasidis: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: D partial for EW if they can find it |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
mb|1D|nt|petergill: Only about 100 to 200 bridge players in Malaysia, so not many volunteers to do the hard work, so do not expect instant updates of websites|pg||
nt|rodal f: At B1 OR are playing 4@H and not 3NT= as here.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT was also made in the Open Room, no swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Splinter|pg||
nt|rodal f: Re hi. Sorry that I'm late.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: 6@H is not a great contract, and of course would fail|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the worst S hand for the auction so far|pg||
nt|patricck: the operator decided board 3 wasn't esciting enough :)|pg||
nt|patricck: EXciting|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after this board :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B1 sold at the mol. 4@HN= here and 3@DW at OR.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And one more overtrick IMP on 2.|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@D will be some sort of 3 suiter, I don't have the system details|pg||
nt|patricck: rehi :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|offthebend: rather sensible contract on a 9 card fit on board 1 :)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3-card raises are awkward after a X for most pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: It would be a major triumph to reach 6@D here|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C splinter? |pg||
nt|petergill: South ranked  1 female in the world, North ranked  4, and Gu at other table ranked  2 female in the world, in WBF rankings|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you bid again as S?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tejjyid: I don't like XX in case the auction gets pre-empted, but in practice i vaery rarely does, so you get to bid the hand this way|pg||
nt|petergill: Gu Ling's partner took a break of about 10 years from international bridge, then won the World Championship in Philadelphia last year, so is ranked "only" about  46. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@SX costs 500, but EW probably would bid on to 5@H. |pg||
nt|offthebend: any EXCUSE to open or overcall these days |pg||
nt|kerasidis: so the only forcing bid over overcall is double?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc is very convenient|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yet again S treats the hand as both M's despite the large discrepancy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S, bidding around the singleton, is preferred|pg||
nt|petergill: Now 4@D?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Guess was old fashioned treatment of "double for the majors" over the big club, so an easy 4@S call for N|pg||
nt|petergill: North follows the Kit Woolsey approach of getting in and doubling early with 12+ and 4333 shape|pg||
nt|patricck: EW will get at least a couple of chances to beat this with a @C ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|kerasidis: or maybe jumbing|pg||
nt|andyv:  it worked the first time so why not?:)|pg||
nt|patricck: In order to know how sympathetic to be with West's decision we would need to know how clearly penalties the double was or whether it could be just 'values'|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: E bid his colors and don't care the 2@S from S?|pg||
nt|patricck: no, I don't bid 5@S with Jx and Qxx in the opponent's suits|pg||
nt|patricck: expensive lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to make now |pg||
nt|patricck: wasn't it likely that West would have a void @S here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the X gives the @D suit away|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kerasidis: even if the dont lead dia i can not see 5 making|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  it's not a horrible treatment as long as the dbler has about equal majors or a stand along major (like the previous auction)..here, dbld has simply a good hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl 10+, then East's Dbl take-out (a non-standard treatment), converted to penatly|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm not a big fan of too many lead-directing doubles - they tend to advise the opponents that their values are in the right places, as here |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by French Polynesia|pg||
nt|rodal f: A natural lead from E|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: May we say that a 3NT might is lost. Bit hard for EW here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: they will have chance later also|pg||
nt|kerasidis: sure|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  stand alone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, not that good.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not great....just good|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the call better on 1 than here though it hit paydirt as far as N is concerned.|pg||
nt|patricck: can't pick up the @D suit and take the pitches on KQ@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: This looks to me like 500|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Last year, Chinese Taipei won this event on 401 VPs, Australia 2nd on 399 VPs. French Polynesia finished 12th out of 13. |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: cross-ruff on the way, and the high heart ... leading to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|patricck: so all roads lead to 11 tricks I think|pg||
nt|sybarra: back to thinking about the lead |pg||
nt|rodal f: Find the @C ruff and -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 3@C Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: in CC|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: plopping down the ace just seems dangerous to me|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|patricck: ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|offthebend: if the leads are 3/5 , clubs must be 5-5 and N should be marked with doubleton SK for her opening|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows West has only 3 hearts - with 4 hearts, West would play a low @h (not a high @H) at trick 2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: Any deep hook to come in @S? N have opened.|pg||
nt|patricck: how can declarer not take any club pitches?|pg||
nt|patricck: I was apparently wrong about the opening bid. Not sure that I would want to play a 2@D opening that is 18-19 balanced, but apparently that is what it was|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: EW want to take @DA then cash @h, but cannot tell that South has singleton @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: - 200 is easy for South now, via 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|petergill: West thought East might have Jx in @D, hence the duck|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: I wonder also|pg||
nt|rodal f: But @H would made problems.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kerasidis: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: seems have a chance :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  my adage, I always make the right bids, pd has to make sure she/he has the right hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Wang Hong Li follows best procedure of taking extreme care, and plenty of time, in all doubled or slam contracts at imps, as plenty of imps are at stake, so take all the time ...|pg||
nt|petergill: needed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I wonder if anyone watching can help me find out why the scores from the other romm aren't coming through? Maybe the operator knows?|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :(|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|h7|nt|petergill: South did well to retain @C2, so that @C3 switch by West was harder for East to read|pg||
nt|patricck: BIG opportunity for Chinese Taipei that has got away from them|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: she surely will play a club now, but there's no harm in taking her time|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: the risk of boring us spectators is not her highest priority |pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: and down 1 - the 6331 is a sterile shape & East probably has theworst possible hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|jcwla: In the open room 3, the NZ South did elect to open that "third seat weak 2" in first seat, failing by one.|pg||
nt|jcwla: So 4 more to Indonesia.|pg||
nt|petergill: so North's decision to enter the auction looks like a good one, though risky. It's a bidder's game. Defence is harder than declarer play. |pg||

nt|rodal f: Pass for pun or 2@C. Make the last|pg||
nt|kerasidis: first pass roads me to pass again|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: and again|pg||
nt|patricck: all the black cards onside for N?S are enough to give them a chance for 10 tricks in @S, but entries to the North hand may be a problem|pg||
nt|patricck: The hearts can be ruffed good so the defence needs to cash their 3 tricks or they won't get them|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: As predicted at B1. Could be a swing it magistern. And happend Aussies 10|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: N hoping to beat it in his side's high cards .. nothing promising to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not a fan of "I have 5 tricks in my hand" doubles.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c almost looks like DONT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: @D seems promising if the double is not penalty.|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW was max -2 at non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Not the world's greatest contract but will make as the cards lie|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|petergill: and NZ lost to Malaysia 13-17 here on BBO|pg||
nt|patricck: well not low on that @D lead :)  but the J@D also allows an easy 10 tricks if declarer was in 4@S|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  whatever it is, NS will do very well defending|pg||
nt|jcwla: Andy, I can understand forcing to game with just a king over a powerhouse opening, but even being aggressive in not requiring the usual combined high-card strength, it usually ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: plays poorly when the values are all in one hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Once against, I would double 1@H on West cards (along with a majority of experts, surely), but the Indonesian youngsters prefer to overcall their five card suit. |pg||
nt|petergill: and thus they miss their spade fit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|rodal f: 2@Ds and @S for a glue? Belive not|pg||

mb|d|nt|petergill: Australia  would be very happy with 25-5 win over Japan Yamada who won World Seniors in 2008. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Michaels, both majors|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H and double back later if needed?  Or double originally?|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|patricck: very straightforward 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: second double should get them there|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|offthebend: danger if they find 4-4 C fit and start exploring slam |pg||
mb|4N|nt|petergill: I think I would have passed as North and hope S reopens with Dbl, which I would expect S to do|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@SX is worth only 500, not 800, for NS|pg||
nt|petergill: and 3NT is easy, so the difference is negligible|pg||
nt|rodal f: So 15-17NT for NS and a easy push|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like watch more than one table: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite a nice spot in @H here|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: and if S does not reopen with X of 3@S, then 4@H, not 5@D, needs to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: women's Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: Korea beat NZ 16-14 - a huge upset, and a mild upset was hosts Malaysia over Thailand 19-11|pg||

nt|patricck: Open Team placings before this match are at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
nt|rodal f: @S K and get a lavental or a shot in the sky?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|offthebend: short and sweet -- who bothers about showing second suit |pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H=longer @S than @C? No idea. But remember the 1@H opening by 10XXXX|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1C was artificial strong ( 15+ )|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@H maybe trf after 1NT|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice contract cinsidering that 4@s can be down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: or 3@H   :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or @C?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|kerasidis: considering|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Now that is some lead directing X|pg||
nt|jcwla: E totally devaluing the hand b/c of @SK - almost worth the raise just on trumps.|pg||
nt|patricck: this contract might have been more interesting with some 4-1 breaks in the red suits, but on this layout everyone makes at least 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: yes 2H showed 5 cards in S |pg||
nt|tejjyid: and East couldn't find a raise? Maybe East's @C's were so good he thought the X meant something else|pg||
nt|petergill: in case East has Qxx|pg||
nt|petergill: Let's see what Sun Ming does|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: OK. So not 16+ as I wait for at 1@C prec variant|pg||
mb|7C|nt|kiwi_joker: Yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Here there's a useful card and a ruffing value to go with the four small.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Just a question of how many 50's this contract fails by, given the misfit|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Declarer's @D's will serve as trump substitutes, and the @S pips prevent the defence getting 3@S tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Quite a funny board. EW as well as NS kave nive fits, but whome do bid as W do here?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: In Round 1, Board 16 contributed to some upset results, with a good slam bid by the good teams failing due to a bad break|pg||
nt|petergill: At some point, perhaps on the 2nd round of @d's, I expect her to hook @DK and make 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking . .  .|pg||
nt|petergill: though there is a big worry that at the unfav vulnerability, West may have @DKx or bare @D king|pg||
nt|petergill: but Japanese women tend not to worry all that much about vulnerability and bid 3@S anyway, no on 2nd thought, Japanese players are very disciplined in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: surely Sun Ming knows this EW better than I do|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a well-known fairly famous player, but I don't know much about West|pg||
nt|rodal f: Obvious if u have a invome or two.|pg||
nt|rodal f: *income|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Sun Ming rarely (almost never) lets you down |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: It's a vul game, after all. Big payout chance vs small chance of -1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: the heart break will lead her to count West as 7123 shape|pg||
nt|jcwla: Anyway, I'm not in love with this sequence.  This sounds like a very big @H hand that's one-suited in @H's.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|offthebend: everybody UPGRADES these days 14 into 15 , 15 into 16 :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: My sister (npc of Aus Women in Kuala Lumpur) says that Sun Ming would be ranked much higher than  4 women player in the world, if she played more often|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|patricck: on a diamond lead 3 rounds of hearts and 5 rounds of diamonds pitching spades, then with the club finesse there are 12 tricks, maybe even 13 if south pitches a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: @C5 from East was bottom card, showing originally 4 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: there is a very real danger that she will play West for @DKx|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: you have to be a very good player to do things like that - the mundane average players just take the @D finesse, in their innocence |pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit strange that they want the contract over to the weak hand?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i do see an other swing here for ew|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: If East plays a spade, West has to duck|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s7|nt|jcwla: If you're going to emphasize the @H's, then I think you start with 2@H and double back later.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: The U26 and U21 fields are combined into one 16 team field, and in the early matches the U26 teams are beating up the u21 teams, ref http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_J.pdf|pg||

nt|petergill: Does @DJ (not @D10) sway her decision?|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@D both majors, Michaels|pg||

nt|offthebend: If N opened !NT , they would have been in 5C or 3NT -- now we wait |pg||
nt|patricck: The declarer play by West on board 4 cost Chinese Taipei 20 imps  ... they lost 9 imps when they could (and should) have gained 11|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: If W got 2@H from E. What to bid? Can't bid 3@C, to weak|pg||
nt|patricck: while 7@C can be made, the best contract is 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|andyv:  after 3 rounds of bidding, NS wound up in 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by East to compete - Dbl was a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT about 8-11|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer will play out all the diamonds hoping for a @H discard, time to quickly make a coffee|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still 4@S are only -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT fast arrival in GF auction|pg||
nt|petergill: Seniors Round 1 results at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf - no upsets|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still a healty contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So I always open 1@C with 5-5 in black when I cant revers and @S +@S from W show the hand. 5@S and 5 or 6@C|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: so West can place the NS HCP as "8 N -12 S or so" as a starting point for her declarer play|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: In the Seniors, Indonesia, Japan Yamada and Australia all have classy teams |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT must have shown 4414 minimum or perhaps 4!+ @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = various, then 2@H = both majors|pg||
nt|patricck: There is a theory that bidding grand slams on a hand such as this is a good idea missing Qxxx. Because trumps are so often led against a grand slam you either get a trump lead or ...|pg||
nt|patricck: you finesse against the opening leader for the queen of trumps|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: @DQx is lucky, but is it lucky enough for this to make?|pg||
nt|petergill: @CAQ lead helps declarer|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3@D would complete the shape nicely, but wuld it be forcing? (It should be)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tif So, West has to decide whether to try 3NT or 5@D|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Q empty oposite a singleton isn't great|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China (1) - Japan (3)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rodal f: At non vul u don.t risk anything if u stop under 3NT. Max 1IMP. But at vul it cost. The reason 3NT bidded by the 24HP|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't the luckyest lead I,ve seen at a color partscore.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: but declarer seems might be one trick short, unless two spades can be ruffed in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: The duck is an attempt to avoid the fatal @d switch|pg||
nt|petergill: A very clever attempt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so far, nice bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the problem is, from West's point of view, that if he has to ruff @H, it will be with good trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: 6 North - 8 South now, after the @DQ and @DA are removed|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: South needs to play a red suit now|pg||
nt|offthebend: easy 8 tricks here |pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: Y. Need to find the @CQXX and % for that might under 30|pg||
nt|patricck: If that theory became too widely followed then people would stop leading trumps so readily against a grand slam|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so I think he has to bid 3NT - unless he decides this isn;t forcing. We have to say "nice stop" - although, I think East might be surprised|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now for shure E need to find the @CQ.|pg||
nt|patricck: 6NT is a terrible contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wonder why E didn't sat the slam at @C by a 4@C bid?|pg||
nt|patricck: the defence always know they are in with a good chance when declarer takes this long at trick 1 :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: Good deduction by South about the reason for East's clever play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: S hand lacks entries for 2 spade ruffs in dummy, so might have to rely on @H break (no good) or @s hook ( no good)|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like -1|pg||
nt|petergill: even if @DJ is led and not covered, 6@D still seems to fail - perhaps I'm mistaken?|pg||
nt|petergill: expect a very long tank by Wang Hongli|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps a better auction is 4@D by N over 3NT, then if 4NT by S is signoff, then even 4NT might be hard work to make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: NS play high to encourage|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit cloudy that 1IMP. U loose and win if u are correct, but at long term u loose only 1IMP pr. board if 50% fail etc 50% in.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  2@h opener here looks like super refined flannery|pg||
nt|jcwla: Fairly common to use 2@H these days.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|rodal f: I might was a bit hard by the NT with 9 auto. Can loose 3@H and 2@D.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: North (whose @D pip at Trick 2 suggested 5 @D's) is known to have 5 @D and 3 @H (no 1@h bid), thus some risk of club and @d overruffs. |pg||
nt|petergill: thus the playing off of @CA from dummy was premature|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Wang Hongli is the number one ranked female player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3828|pg||
nt|andyv:  for 6@h?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: .|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: alas @D4 was not high enough - what bad luck in the @D pips|pg||
nt|petergill: though S probably should have worked out that continuing @d had to be better than playing clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: as it was impossible for E to duck Trick 1 with anything other than a singleton club|pg||
nt|andyv:  or is that 5 or 6@h that they were showing?|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 or 6|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3-trick difference if W tries to make.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, I misread the %- symbol|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 5-6@H :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Chayes:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: As the cards lie, the only line that might work is !J not covered, one more @D, then a heart ruff|pg||

nt|petergill: this play could promote her up the world rankings, but  1 is as high as you can go|pg||
nt|petergill: with Qx under dummy's !AK, there is no reason not to cover @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: South reasoned that @CA lead was the act of a person with a possible trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: If @H are 3-3, playing @H now is OK, and if @H 4-2, then must ruff @h now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: On for a new push it seems.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tommy:)|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Rodal|pg||
nt|twcho: NS is probably the top pair of HK|pg||
nt|kerasidis: about a weak ago ...i saw a very expeirienced pair misunderstanding their bid upon overcall on 1nt opening|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 16 imps lost|pg||
nt|twcho: and they are very aggressive bidders|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hi tommy|pg||
nt|twcho: hi dennis|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|rodal f: B4 OR ended 3@HN. Here it was 5@DE= IMPs for Thailand.|pg||
nt|twcho: so one have to agree explicitly with partner when the transfer is still on  or not|pg||
nt|twcho: sell out to 3H with 7411?|pg||
nt|twcho: too cheap indeed|pg||
nt|kerasidis: of course...but there are some many difficulties yet to deal with|pg||
nt|rodal f: Cheep or cheap. I love the speciality made by cheep's:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E can dbl here?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: But what are N gona lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: Q@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: so I think the odds massively favour a penalty dbl of 4@s on the West cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any like the BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php    = til B20|pg||
nt|jjsb: a pass folloxed by a bid is normally stronger than initial overcal |pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes cheep endeed especially when partner showed values|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = long suit not clubs (would bid 2@C with clubs)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Presumably XX was forced and 2@d showed @d and a major|pg||
nt|henryb:  you see, sorry, Peter and I disagree|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now the @C became more important|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4Sx in a limited system and a known 10 card H fit is a bit surprising |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: sceen|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: screen|pg||
nt|jjsb: i still admit , i can see with that hand why i dont want to play a strong club ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  S's hand a bit difficult to evaluate but a 10 count does deserve more than a suit preference|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_O.pdf|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: +3 and next|pg||
nt|jjsb: the idea if opening 1@c with N is kinda scaring me ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4 lavental as I play it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: so I was unfair to South - her line of play is perhaps best|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have played @HK at Trick 2, in case partner's heart was singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: then switched to clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: The low heart play shows that they have 100% faith in partner's count card at Trick 1|pg||
nt|jjsb: but of course not saying its bad !!! of course it can be more than helpfull in a lot of situation |pg||
nt|rodal f: Good news. Not at the @H trap. Sad news, could get some more income.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_L.pdf|pg||
nt|patricck: slam was only a moderate proposition.... basically needing both @H and @C to be 3-2, which is about a 50% chance when combining both suits together|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: If no screen and pass from NS the TD should be called after the board is finnich.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: That looks more like it. |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|offthebend: 5H can be made by playing Clubs early and guessing the C J otherwise one down |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Then might harder for call the TD.|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite the sterile nature of his hand, 3@d was a reasonable alternative|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|nt|petergill: I wondered why Pass was (possibly) not alerted|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|petergill: with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr1_S.pdf|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: so all the bids after 1@S were forcing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: tough problem for West; I would have made a pre-emptive @C raise on the 1st round & Perhaps X is better than 2@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: @CK onside  so no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  Playing "DONT" runouts has become fairly common|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jjsb: will play AK of @h now i guess|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: I'm sure East is expecting the @H suit to be 6 cards long|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: It is a light-looking 10 but I'm with you, Andy, this seems Milquetoast.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jjsb: and then +1 or = depends of where he will try to throw the @c |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tejjyid: 5-3 major fits are a real problem for the Precision 2@C opening|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was a safetynes but, ....|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|offthebend: running the C10 to throw a D can not cost or finessing now |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jjsb: so +1 it is |pg||
nt|jjsb: mmhh not yet |pg||
nt|jjsb: have ti tap @d first if u play @s ruff its not working |pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: B7 OR S opened 2NT=minor and N direct 5@C. Here 1NT+1NS|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will at least never go down.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|offthebend: didn't do any of those PLUS hearts spots were all blocked up by west |pg||

nt|jjsb: rigth :) |pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: So a new gain for the Aussies it seems|pg||
nt|offthebend: 5C would have made on a likely S lead|pg||
nt|jjsb: ok ... |pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Spec said bl w is ok. What if the two A is @S an @H or @S and @D? 6 is down. Exlution bl wood then u bid a unnatural @S bid and ask for A in the other colors. Hopeless here as long ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: as W bidded 3@S as well|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: On reflection, I think S's line of play in 6@S was right. The other table failed in 5@D.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: NT at W I hope, but will they be taken by NS activity?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  matter of style here|pg||
nt|patricck: The members at my bridge club would be complaining that N/S are getting no cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The suitable vulnerability, and being dealer, would tempt me to open the North cards with a weak 2@S (normally 6 spades), but that is too random to be the French style. |pg||
nt|rodal f: By wich lead?|pg||
nt|patricck: 7@S is a good contract, 7NT is a bad contract which happens to be lucky|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: B21: 3@D+1 here and 2@S-1 at OR and one IMP for Tapei|pg||
nt|andyv:  those who play drury, would bid 2@c (one way) or 2@d (two way) with N hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: That is one heavy 2@H raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: rigth |pg||

nt|jjsb: @h is best for defense as i see it |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with short spades, it is often better to bid 2@H a bit light than to neg dbl, as the inevitable (in 2011) spade preemption might make a 2@H bid lead to easier continuations in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: competitive bidding|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C from A no|pg||

nt|jjsb: yes |pg||
nt|jjsb: reasonable |pg||
nt|rodal f: Is to defancive normaly|pg||
nt|petergill: South might have acted over 3@C. With Axx in partner's preempt suit, an expert named Michael Courtney once told me you cannot pass ever. |pg||
nt|henryb:  Passing 3@c seems strange to me. I would surely bid 4@c, and possibly 5|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR at the road for 6@C and bidded it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Sun Ming is ranked  4 women player in the world ref http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3827|pg||

nt|jcwla: But in the scheme of things, this may be one of NZ's best chances for a pickup.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: North sould probably trust SOuth; the contract wasn't without chances|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps their fav vul 3@C preempts as dealer are normally 6 card suits?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: But tempo for the @H|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the other hand, N-S will probably go plus here as West is unlikely to guess hearts|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Sun Ming usually only plays international bridge every 2nd year, so being ranked  4 in the world is particularly good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: surely they can find out that @DK is missing and stop in 6@S, e.g. 5@H asks about @SQ, 6@H response shows @HK and @SQ and denies @DK and denies @CK|pg||
nt|petergill: so only 6@S|pg||

nt|rodal f: OR open 1@C here.|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jjsb: east knows now 4@c 2@d and 2 aces thats 8|pg||
nt|petergill: Compared to "Pass", in my opinion 3@D, 3NT, 3@S, 3@H, 4@C and 5@C are all better bids by South after "3@C Pass" |pg||
nt|patricck: A good win to Japan in this match will make an interesting battle for 2nd place, but will allow China to break away to a big lead|pg||

nt|rodal f: Would have been from me.|pg||
nt|patricck: will try to keep up the commentary hear, but have just been served dinner|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Declarer might still come to 9 tricks if he plays a heart to the ten|pg||
nt|petergill: which is not impossible|pg||
nt|petergill: only "might" = more likely is -100 or -200|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent; East's subsequent 2@H bid will say 6 cards & too weak to open|pg||
nt|jcwla: Query whether N is really ever going to find out information to play somewhere other than 4@S opposite pd's vul 2-level overcall?|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, little gained by the convention here as NS easily bid their hands.  Would a 3@d opener have been more effective?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think all roads lead to Rome on this hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  but took a long time to build those roads|pg||
nt|henryb:  6 of either red suit is not the worst contract ever seen|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|offthebend: good stop - this should come to easy 8 tricks unless Heart suit is attacked |pg||
nt|tejjyid: whihc, these days, is pretty weak|pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR EW are out bicikling but S helped by 4@C and E bidded 4@D. Than W made it 5. Pass around.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: E thinks that 4@D is strong, slam try. West just bid 4@D as not so strong|pg||
nt|petergill: If @d is trumps, before bidding 4NT, always check if 5@H response takes you past your last safe haven|pg||
nt|rodal f: UPS. THIS CAN COST|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S denies Hxx (H = A, K or Q) support, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: 1@D can also be controls if they use it for 0-2|pg||
nt|petergill: West would have raised a 3@D opener to 5@D.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite normal thees days|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rodal f: U meam u have underbidded by ure 16HP? |pg||
nt|twcho: strange not to introduce his 2nd good suit  by south|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South sould have bid that @S suit at some stage though|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, over the 1@H; later for the tightrope walkers|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D natural, 3@H = xxx support without top honour|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: I think E failed to do so - or perhaps 4NT does not mean what I think it means|pg||
nt|jjsb: with the @c situation this one seems to be an ok contract |pg||
nt|jcwla: On 8, where NS here played 2@D making 4, their NZ counterparts failed by 3 in 3NT, so 7 more to Indonesia, up 35 through half the comparisons.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb:  but won't make because of the bad @d break. and even 4@h needs careful play|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S cue as slam try, 4@H signoff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: anyway, West worked out that this is not a slam auction - else East would bid 4NT earlier - and thus had the commonsense to signoff with her poor hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, I agree, but you never know when a pair might have a different agreement in that area|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|offthebend: and paula better overtake the second spade in case west ducks twice :)|pg||
nt|jjsb: i am been told its a 0 to 7 |pg||

nt|rodal f: @D3|pg||

nt|jjsb: i think @d looks like the only possible considering the dummy ? |pg||

nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||

nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||

pc|sA|nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
pc|s5|nt|patricck: with only one entry in the K@D maybe a @C lead is a reasonab;e shot|pg||

nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
nt|patricck: finding the good news straight away|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: B9 The wrong side made the ask but not finnished.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@HX at OR -300|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
nt|patricck: now cash the diamonds and clubs and hope that East is squeezed in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
nt|petergill: With spades 3-0, entries to the South hand are a bit limited in 6@S, and one might have to overtake @HJ (if @H ace is ducked), use @H as "replacement trumps" to make 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, RKCB would keep one out of 6@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7@S |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
nt|patricck: for the overtrick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  A kibitzer points out that RKCB keeps modern players out of these 50% slams|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely because East already known to hold 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Now -1?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rodal f: Same bidding (seen away from the hard 2@D) til 3@H. Then the roads splitted. Endstation at OR 6@CN |pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|petergill: Sorry, he doesn't know that - North could have @SJ or 1DQ|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Or a auto after the bidding?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: I think N can be endplayed for 300 instead of 500|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Look like play for Ax@D|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here. Normaly +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now a @D and small|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d would have been effective also in shutting out the @c suit|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just one more @D from here to make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|patricck: sirry @D and @C for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|petergill: Even underleading the spade at Trick 2 to @SQ would not have stopped the endplay for 300|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you prefer 3@H, Pass or 4@d on the East cards, Henry?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S always 7 but easy for OR to end an other place. Don't know there CC|pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass 3@d as smoothly as possible, hoping South balances?|pg||
nt|patricck: lol, I don't have the excuse that English is a 2nd language :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: again i admit i have some problem to open that hand 1@c but well systemic so.. no choice .. here thougth nto causing problem |pg||

nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Malaysia - Singapore (Open)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 ended 1NTN where this room played 2@D-1. Might a double score.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rodal f: Any for 2/1 and 1NT by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1NT one round force minimum|pg||
nt|patricck: at least that allows the @S ruff, so there are 3 tricks and 1 @D before declarer thinks about trumps|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR N in 3@S|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might look at what the result could be if 1NT was 2/1. At @D contract u have some tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d8|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might be possible, but who knows how the bidding would go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 OR ended as here. 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: all on the lead against 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@S = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Must say that 3@S often is a heltier contract than 4@S, but it work and they need it.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: perhaps this is the better line, in fact|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@d+1|pg||
nt|twcho: only +1|pg||
nt|twcho: still a trump to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: but with 9 points for the 3 @H stoppers and only 6 points elsewhere in 3433 shape, West's hand is more like a 14 count than a 15 count|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@H=4@S+and invit it seems.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@S showed 5+ spades and invitational, denied 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ened 2@SN. So might a new gain for Japan (L)|pg||
nt|patricck: declaarer won't be keen to finesse a club into the long spade hand|pg||
nt|patricck: What is an opening bid may be affected by the rest of your system. Another suggested offering is the rule of 20  which suggests that the HCP + the length of your 2 longest suits ...|pg||
nt|patricck: being at least 20 is a good indicator|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||

nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||

nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||

nt|patricck: we woldn't be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||

nt|robbroy: tight defence required|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
nt|robbroy: bad start for Singapore|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2NT here? System faul? 1NT by 15 and....|pg||
nt|robbroy: they play a version of blue club|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|alok_daga: NV VS V North did not enter the auction?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
nt|robbroy: open 1@S with weak hands or 4 card suits I believe|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not as I've seen but u're might right.|pg||
nt|robbroy: 3@S to ask for @C but count was preferred so a guess for N now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|robbroy: they have been playing a canape system for about 25 years - they may have changed but I think not|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|nt|twcho: but declarer was also wrong in covering @cJ with @cK|pg||
nt|twcho: but if south refuse to go up with his @c honor and north win the 1st @c with ace, defense willl prevail|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: Thanks to our excellent operator Chayes Luang-On for good work. |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||

nt|vugraphzek: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|twcho: so all the errors add up to a tie bd|pg||
nt|twcho: tks all for watching|pg||
nt|twcho: actually declarer can win the battle by ducking the 1st @s|pg||
nt|twcho: then he will be able to establish his @c before defenders establishing the @s|pg||
nt|twcho: quite an intriguing hand|pg||
nt|twcho: bye now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|robbroy: thank you all for your good comments and viewership (is that a word?)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Good smooth duck of @S10|pg||
nt|patricck: We have certainly had some interesting cards, let us hope that the next match (in about 2 hours) is equally interesting|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: Any telltale hesitation on @S10 would have been fatal for the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: Although 6@H makes, there's no advantage, looking at NS's 26 cards, from being in 6@H rather than 6@S, so that was unlucky for NZ |pg||
nt|petergill: A great start for Malaysia to beat one of the stronger teams in the event|pg||
nt|petergill: APBF event's website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round Start in 3o min|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Japan - China (Lady)|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the defending champions Chinese Taipei are probably marginal favourites in the Open field, with China not at full strength.|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Women's, China are of course the favourites, though their team roster has changed a bit since their World Championship win|pg||
nt|petergill: See you in about 30 minutes for the next match|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: but the website does not have any results, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: You have to take into account that Malaysia has only about 100 bridge players, so results might take a little while to appear, with a small number of people doing a lot of work. |pg||
nt|robbroy: a moral victory for Singapore|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: B26 by same press as here, 4@H and N bidded 4@S as here.|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: and that's all today from Kuala Lumpur - there will be 3 more matches tomorrow |pg||

nt|petergill: trick = 9 tricks. So this is bad for China, perhaps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: 4@S is a good save, so perhaps the first approach is the better one? Or perhaps, South, with 6-4 shape being as good as a 7 card suit, should at fav vul overcall 3@S over 1@H, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: allowing North to take the 4@S save? |pg||
