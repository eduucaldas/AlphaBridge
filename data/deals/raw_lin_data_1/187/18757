nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
pc|h8|nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 2@S but i dont like it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: north reluctantly passes|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she is long time champ:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: ok 1 imp loss|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|jaapfr: would any of us:)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hedyg: that N hand is not really worth 17 hcps, is it?|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not, but then again, I usually play a system where 1H is limited to about 17, rather than the 21 in |pg||
nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then never 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you had to bid, what would you bid then?|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|teckh:  well bid, I think|pg||

nt|spooky: with this lead she has enough entries to misguess it... |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hajru:  Opposite SQxxx and a red ace, 6S has a chance, and it is not clear if N would cooperate over 4D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pls check operator if N will say afterwards as sweet as possible: sorry pd:)?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|d8|nt|roswolf: by e/w certainly - 3@D seemed to confuse the opps|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok so South sees 14 HCP opposite 15-17, and shortness in hearts - East having most of the opposing honors, South knows there is a minor slam if North has a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  landy, garozzo, woolsey, multilandy or something|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has an interesting problem -how high to bid?|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably worth a double!?|pg||
nt|granguru:  5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the real man's bid:)|pg||
nt|hajru:  Weak NT by north, probably all pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: good lead|pg||
nt|granguru:  no more blackwood, redwood, voidwood, roman KCB, etc..|pg||
nt|djneill:  I still think South should rebid 4@c, get a fit, and bid 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass is the mouse's bid|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: north risks a large penalty|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: we dont know if 2@H could be with @s and 2@s would be p/c then|pg||
nt|roswolf: but escapes with a scratch|pg||
nt|roswolf: the light shines on the lady|pg||
pc|dA|nt|granguru:  4@H should have been  the minimum...problem is that it might lead to a wrong lead|pg||
