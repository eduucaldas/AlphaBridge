nt|riccho:  hi everybody :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: looks like 4@h makes with the @c double finesse, but EW have a cheap 4@s sacrifice.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: can n/s avoid anything stupid -perhaps not|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double as south if i was to do anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s system is steam age ACOL (4CM) + many gadgets|pg||
nt|roswolf: a simple 4@S TO BID|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|hajru:  Did we just get new players?|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hajru:  Declarer will win the 2nd trick, knock out the HA and end up with 9 winners|pg||
nt|riccho:  no idea where they come from, but the names sound bulgarian|pg||
nt|hajru:  Well, yes, they sound south-east european to me too|pg||
nt|arno11: NS are from russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´va been told that that NS come from russia :) thatÂ´s why I hate guessing :) |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|psyck: in 4@h by winning @hK 1st round|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|hajru:  We start with an easy contract|pg||
nt|hajru:  Does anybody know where the NS team is from?|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes, but with this short matches here (28 bds) every imps can be decisive|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|hajru:  losing an imp or two against the 4H contract at the other table|pg||

nt|roswolf: -2 for 6 imps to the norwegian team|pg||
nt|roswolf: no it didnt actually:)|pg||

nt|riccho:  so finland quadrupled their lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|djneill:  push|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, don't think so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: will north bid his own suit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|hajru:  Not sure what happened here as it appeared that EW had 7 tricks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3@c can be weaker for them...generally stronger game forcing hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
pc|d6|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 2@S but i dont like it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: north reluctantly passes|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes looks a bit weird; |pg||
nt|riccho:  but as bad as the play was; the bidding in the other room was even worse|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from top|pg||
nt|psyck: other table got to 6@c after a similar 3@c rebid, another reason not to jump with W's hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she is long time champ:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|spooky: this lead didn't scare North|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 3cl...mimimum....3nt stiff spade|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|riccho:  finesse is wothout risk |pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: ok 1 imp loss|pg||
pc|s4|nt|djneill:  3-2@h split slam cold, even 4-1@h onside may be ok, is that a good slam? but 5-0 offside not going to work|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|pbmarstr: Ja, er nok noe bedre enn hjerter|pg||
nt|psyck: they could be using 2N for stronger hand types here...of course that does not explain the bidding in other room|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|ralfwil: difficult to defeat 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|rcerreto: that's what I was wondering|pg||
nt|dburn: strongish weak two bid in fourth seat, I guess|pg||
nt|rcerreto: very difficult|pg||
nt|dburn: or they may play 2@d like a Precision 2@c|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very probably|pg||
nt|rcerreto: I also thought about a very sound weak 2|pg||
nt|rcerreto: but then, 3@d?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rcerreto: more likely an opening in @d , yes|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wont be long playing this one|pg||

nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|riccho:  is there a tiebreaker rule in the unlikely event of a draw? |pg||

nt|granguru:  landy, garozzo, woolsey, multilandy or something|pg||

pc|d4|nt|roswolf: yes the norsemen (and women) have sprung into a big lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: personally i play that 2@h can be weak with ANY suit, incl @s|pg||

nt|hajru:  And another 1NT contract :)|pg||
nt|riccho:  probably claimed for 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  will they try for game in spade or clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: a possible slam here but not one you would wish to be in:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra could have a punt here|pg||
nt|teckh:  S thinks she know where N singleton is|pg||
nt|spooky: this 6@S is making|pg||
nt|roswolf: finis|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, Benedicte spoils it.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: the second singleton is more relevant|pg||
nt|hajru:  12 tricks, I guess|pg||
nt|hajru:  And 1 imp can be important here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: clubs is my guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: an educated try|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: now it is 33-24 for finland|pg||
nt|eamongall: there appears to be only 9 tricks in @Ss but doubt @Ss will ever be trumps at this tage |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: for herself:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: stage|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe Hanlon will bid them now |pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru:  buy willing to share with you nice people|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @SJ is golden|pg||
nt|psyck: if EW get to 4@s now, @d's need to be attacked at the earliest|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 5 of a minor here - i trust no slam adventure|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Thank you. It is always nice to share|pg||
nt|psyck: Which will not be difficult with that dummy|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes Krishna you are very right ... but I doubt they can reach 4@S here |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  pretty disappointing here, for East, but at least the @dK is onside, and @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even -1 is a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and mb mb she makes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|teckh:  she has to play for the lone KJ in heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|spooky: EW could sacrifice in 7@C here, impossible to find tho|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice judgment by Gunn|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes getting weaker by the minute..|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 7-2 to the CR|pg||
nt|hajru:  2@c is 11-14, 6@c or 5@c with a 4 card M|pg||
nt|hajru:  Giving north a problem what to bid|pg||
mb|2C|an|.|nt|spooky: another 3rd hand Light opener|pg||
nt|roswolf: different tempo to this auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: doubt whether they will get close to a slam|pg||
nt|arno11: teams full of star players like Lavazza, Brogeland or Gottlieb on their way out |pg||
nt|hajru:  3@d probably invitational with a good 6 card suit|pg||
nt|hajru:  I guess it will end there|pg||
nt|psyck: he will be more dissaponted when he finds they made 4@s other table that deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now that is a preempt which only a young man can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: of course|pg||
mb|2D|nt|granguru:  undisciplined opening by W|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably reach 5@D|pg||
nt|psyck: they got the same trump lead in 4@s other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: support with support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: this is action bridge - where will the music stop?|pg||
nt|djneill:  example of how usually the weaker hand with a long suit plays better - honors from the strong hand are still relevant, but not if West declares - East's @d not so hot then|pg||
nt|hajru:  In the other room, west tried 1@s, not sure what that meant, but it got them to a playable contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  both major and 11 is an opening allways these days |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup the courtesy raise|pg||
nt|teckh:  i didnt think Tor opened partnering his wife|pg||
nt|granguru:  -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: surely he is allowed to even in a liberated scandavian household:)|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, Lebedeva has other thoughts.  |pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|riccho:  rehi sry was dropped by my interent conn|pg||
pc|cT|nt|spooky: a lack of aces here...|pg||

nt|roswolf: west will/should pass now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D6-4-K might seduce N|pg||
nt|hajru:  Welcome back|pg||
nt|hajru:  This gives the contract a chance|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: I think E is very tired she forgot about lead..|pg||
nt|psyck: unavoidable to get to game here if you play light openings, unfortunately no chances as cards are here|pg||
nt|psyck: even if he contrives to endplay W, that will only push his trick total from 8 to 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: and a lack of a double:(|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Gunn bid once to much|pg||
nt|hedyg: push EW to slam?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: west decides now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11 more imps to goldcat|pg||
pc|h8|nt|spooky: 3@C was quite a lot indeed...|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vul penalty may be good compensation|pg||
nt|granguru:  or -2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|roswolf: club switch looks attractive|pg||
nt|teckh:  I think Tor is too lucky now, 23 and a bunsch of J, and hte only value worth talking of is his spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: luck follows the big battalions|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: he is a BERMUDA BOWL winner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but we see but E and N can not know that|pg||
nt|riccho:  still difficult to collect enough tricks here|pg||
nt|hajru:  Goldwater's rule: always accept a lead out of turn.  If they don't know who should lead, they probably don't know what to lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hajru:  If you take the @d a in the first round, you better know what to return|pg||
nt|jaapfr: doubt N was thinking much:)|pg||
nt|psyck: a tight match with very swingy boards so far|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: should make an overtrick now|pg||

mb|3D|nt|hedyg: some might go for 3NT|pg||

nt|hajru:  I'm still not sure why east rebid 3NT.  It looks like there are 2 ways to bid the north hand: stayman, then|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N|pg||
nt|hajru:  3@s (or 3@h smolen) over 2@d, or transfer, then 3@h. In both cases, south picks the right contract from |pg||
nt|hajru:  3nt, 4@h or 4@s. |pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: one of them is south is unlikely to have 5 cards in her suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hajru:  That is not the way to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E hopes are that pd has @DJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good thinking but wrong result|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: declarer will be disappointed when she sees the heart break|pg||
nt|hedyg: on her way down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it will break her heart?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i hope not 2 matches to go:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a good win for goldcat|pg||
nt|hajru:  I still don't quite understand the ew carding.  Would he really lead the @d6 from J6xx(x)?|pg||
nt|hajru:  With all those soft values, I don' think that N will go slamming on 23.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: bye all for today see you all tomorrow|pg||

nt|vugraphpl1: second place have Renata Dancewicz - polish actor.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Dificult to imagine that N-S will make 3NT if they are in it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|hajru:  this looks like 3nt for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
nt|hajru:  1@c polis, 1@s, 2N, 3N?|pg||

nt|eamongall: this hardly right |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is unreal|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: I don't think South bid 3@C|pg||
