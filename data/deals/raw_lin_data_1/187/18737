nt|Walddk3: uncheck  invisible before you re-enter|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well maybe we can start|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many would open 1H maybe  but I prefer 1C|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like we are almost ready, Wold Bates play Precision Club, Std approach for NS|pg||
nt|baldfriede: Detroit even*|pg||
nt|baldfriede: In the other room E/W were a bit too enthusiastic about the hand|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 31  not 46??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Kit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi kit -- sorry to see you here as commentator|pg||
nt|ady: 5-0 spade split spoils a reasonable 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ady: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@S might survive the 5-0 split -- not sure|pg||
nt|ady: yes possibly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still think it is strange to play board 31|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that's what's at the other table too|pg||
nt|kit: didn't the play 1-30?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php or http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh  this is 3rd set not 4th|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Al is thinking about the civil war I just heard   thats to much at the same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 teams were decided last set   USA1 Seniors   Schwartz-Finkel Wolff-Morse Hamilton-Fisher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 Women  Moss-Radin Stansby-Campanile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: congrats to both teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of our match will play 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch to determine Senior USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 Women Final has already started - it is 96 boards |pg||
nt|friggi: hi all|pg||
nt|kit: hi|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: wrong boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while we wait    EW play a form of Precision  NT strength varies 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  "multi" 2@D, Flannery 2@H   transfers over 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ady: thx Al|pg||
nt|ady: hand 31 looks interesting|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes sure|pg||
nt|007 joosth: S should play the diamonds before E can discard 1 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in 4S|pg||
nt|ady: yes    but not easy to work that out at the table|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well tr 1 haert  tr 2 spade  then you see it?|pg||
nt|friggi: nothing is easy to work out at the table:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  carding upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well the coffe sometimes|pg||
nt|007 joosth: coffee:)|pg||
nt|friggi: right, mist that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Steve Robinson used to have card that announced upside-down facial expressions  but that was before screens|pg||
nt|ady: but playing diamonds early   losing to the king and cashing 2 more before ruffing a heart high is very difficult|pg||
nt|kit: I think once declarer sees the 5-0 split he is forced to assume East has 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure but I think he can work it out|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: basically lose spade hook, win return, lose diamond hook, win club hook, and crossruff|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|kit: Danger if defense can get East in with jack of clubs for third round of spades|pg||
nt|ady: but cash diamonds beffore ruffing a heart|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW play a form of Precision  1N opener's 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS high tech 2/1   2@D=weak 2@H/@S  2@H=flannery  2@S=constructive|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude     |pg||
nt|kirp:  Here we have Lynch-Passell with precision Club, Boyd-Robinson are 5-card majors with Multi 2 @D|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hi Kit and Al|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: yes indeed that J may be the winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of the USA2 "SemiFinal"  loser goes home  winner plays 60 boards tomorrow against Lynch who lost in USA1 final to Schwartz|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS also play Flannery 2@H with intermediate 2@S bid|pg||
nt|kit: Over 1@H opening, Passell might bid Michaels if available, or just overcall 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=10-15 HCP, 6+@C|pg||
nt|007 joosth: precision I suppose?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6+@C 10-15 |pg||
nt|ady: would not wager on making|pg||
nt|kit: they will certainly get to 4@S now -- Robinson will show Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i hear other table began to bid,  then the auction disappeared|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H overcall may help a little|pg||
nt|007 joosth: rubensohl or lebensohl maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is showing now as 1N-2@D[one major]|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S i the destination|pg||
nt|friggi: is|pg||
nt|kit: they play transfer Lebensohl -- I forget the exact coding which shows Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice board to start with if you make 4@s|pg||
nt|ady: is this 14-16 no-trump?|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome back everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and yes   hi all:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk3: we can't have a broadcast with invisible operators|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw last set that side 5-card major isn't a deterent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S max of 15 HCP  [ew play a form of precision]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might start with DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong again al|pg||
nt|kit: this is Stayman without a stopper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahh  3@D=4@S, no stop|pg||
nt|kit: will be interesting if Bates overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 45 boards remain in this battle to determine who will be USA2 at the 2011 Senior Bowl in October|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2H at east i think 2S   south?|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S a little rich on Boyd's hand with no aces, kings, or queens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed  but psss?|pg||
nt|puncher99: do u play any conventions here kit?|pg||
nt|kit: It works because it happens to hit 4-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Now or we shall have to boot you|pg||
nt|irwinbo: hello  all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: a side 6-card major isn't a deterent...  clubs just have to be the primary suit|pg||
nt|friggi: sameo:)|pg||
nt|barnets: a bidding misunderstanding in open|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w bid to 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: I think Robinson should have gone for the throat and passed|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C probably some 1-suiter, same as they play over opening 1NT maybe?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kirp:  2@C would have been sort of takout, maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably right Martin   very common to use same convention after 1N overcall as over 1N opener|pg||
nt|kirp:  why not open 3@C to begin with?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less common to have a 3@C bid over 1N overcall when you couldn't open 3@C|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry n/s in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: D  ?  !|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you type faster :)|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Commentators are Al Hollander and Martin Kirr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Precision so the 4@H is much wider range than for standard players|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator Kathy Newman|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is a transfer -- system on over 2@C call|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk1: Hi    e     missing in Westheimer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo, south opened|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no something else wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The boards in the Vugraph are wrong.  Bear with us a few minutes.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: (bare)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry -- have to restart|pg||
nt|barnets: little better but notmuch !|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H looks like decent spot for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I used to play this structure, but it has been a while so I forgot the exact coding|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: pass pass|pg||
nt|kit: Here Robinson will bid 3NT I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: once in a while they make this  but not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|ady: may  well need to play a club early|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: other room 5@CX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think Peter had a way to offer COG  [i.e. show 4@S AND good @H stops]|pg||
nt|007 joosth: knowing 5 or 6 hearts left makes it easier to play for diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: has been warned the heart position|pg||
nt|kit: I think it will go heart lead, spade hook, spade back, club up, and key will be if Bates ducks|pg||
nt|friggi: club early is auto play|pg||
nt|kit: Although East can pitch a diamond on third heart, and that will defeat contract|pg||
nt|santyclz: The expected response to the balancing x.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kirp:  Dbl was probably negative|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Fortunately Robinson with 6 hearts pretty much had to bid 3@H, so the balance worked well|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe big swing?|pg||
nt|kit: so it looks like down 1|pg||
nt|ady: must wait  before ruffing a heart|pg||
nt|kit: defense can play 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: so must play diamonds before losing lead|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Chip Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS standard carding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: with that singl of clubs  a spade may be better but N can have the diamond ace|pg||
nt|friggi: @C 10 now|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5 possible trix on defense|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: and that is pretty double-dummy|pg||
nt|kit: And a winning opening lead -- club lead would have let the contract make|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All. Certainly a close match. (unlike the women's right now)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|ady: very difficult contract  needs almost to play double dummy  playing a low diamond from hand early|pg||
nt|friggi: but no need to play trump, full control in all suits|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when W is in with ace of clubs will he know that E has a 3d heart?|pg||
nt|friggi: the key is @C Aces on side|pg||
nt|kit: He might not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room same contract and lead from internal sequence|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: hi|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: so play @C as early as possible|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will win and lead a club -- and Bates will have to do something right|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  cool...more commentators than specs:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  This will make, I think, 3@C might have been down 4|pg||
nt|kirp:  doesn't look like N can set up a squeeze position, tho W may not be sure of E' distribution|pg||
nt|kit: squeeze would be possible, but critical entry has to be wasted for the heart play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfe: I've lost the play.  Will just enter results on this board.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the halfway point  [48 of 96]   Womens USA2 Final    Joel leads Sprung by 39|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: take 10 and run or is there a chance for more?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started typing that BEFORE Chip's comment|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|nt|kirp:  actually 3 down on best defense|pg||
nt|007 joosth: hello all   |pg||
nt|kirp:  no squeeze now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this is nog good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he needs 2 high ruffs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|sK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: hi got his diamond play early, but I think he needed to save his high spade spot|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: I am just pointing out all things eaq...play @C as soon as possible-basta|pg||
mc|7|nt|ady: I think once playing a trump early could not make|pg||
pg||

nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ntmon: this match brings 5th and 7th team in actual standings|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ntmon: assuming both pairs use Polish club as a base system|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  Hi Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Boyd chose to make light response|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Double is support double|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ... - not now|pg||
nt|stc: Most E will open 2@s, giving the good lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: hi everyone, fast start!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  and pass is "I don't have much"|pg||
nt|ntmon: X show 15+ with @c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: N believes in 7 @C quick tricks, an Ace and trick in dummy for her free bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Markku|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||

nt|ahollan1: playing Puppet  does Robinson bid?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other tables visible using http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||

mb|1H|an| |nt|ahollan1: this is last set for USA1 Seniors    2 more sets tonight for USA2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal   [3rd vul 1N=15-17]|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D is single-suited major|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: sort of micheals cuebid showing both majors  |pg||
nt|kirp:  EW eschew 2D as a pre-empt|pg||
nt|007 joosth: many play 2C as natural here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice word Martin   eschew|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  King's English|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hoped to learn some english here:)|pg||
nt|kirp:  how many spades by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some take it a step further  after nebulous 1@D [like precision]  2@D=nat  2@H=weak michaels|pg||
nt|kirp:  after cashing 1@D and 1@H, Passell could have played one black suit and still had time for the 2nd try|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will be thinking about slam when Boyd shows spade support|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 viewgraph tables running now, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|kit: 1@H response shows spades|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|kit: if Bates makes neg response, will be played by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Kit   i should have left that to you :)|pg||
nt|kit: However the Gods of Puppet will save him, as 1NT is fine even with the 4-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs please note   there are Gods [plural] of Puppet|pg||
nt|barnets: you can beat thuis double dummy|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps they don't save him this time -- the defenders are 1 step ahead in the race|pg||
nt|barnets: by east shifting to the @DJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike has a nice hand for this auction|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson needs 3 keycards plus queen of clubs to make slam -- too much to hope for with minimum opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might get to 3NT again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H probably inv+ @C|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows minimum opener with 4 spades|pg||
nt|santyclz: What do you respond to the x of 2@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: guess not :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: in other room, bates led trump|pg||
nt|007 joosth: H seems ok 2 me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just reporting the fact  --   i'm positive i'm not sure which is better/best|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but ot here with that singl of clubs may be. |pg||
nt|kit: I have no idea why Passell bid 3@D instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe they treat dble as takeout of 1@S, |pg||
nt|kit: assuming it is takeout of spades, why wouldn't he bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming x shows @hs, perhaps 3@d is a mixed raise.|pg||
nt|kirp:  thinks he is setting up a save possibility?|pg||
nt|warrens:  Chambers wants to bid if he can find a fit, but too dangerous with a singleton club|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Cindy Bernstein and Sally Wheeler sitting EW|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not|pg||
nt|baldfriede: operator, what was the result in board 1?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 4 s by north down 2--cant enter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both of opp suits known [michaels for @H & @S, unusual NT for 2 lowest]  you have 2 cue bids to show the other suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 18-19|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps as a safety play -- if doubled, can run to hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Lynch can seriously consider saving with that hand at favorable|pg||
nt|kit: But Robinson will compete to 5@S then, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: certain to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 2 chances to shift |pg||
nt|kirp:  6 is a good save|pg||
nt|chip: yes, even if N invites only, S likely to accept.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  they play a 12-14 NT |pg||
nt|ady: south may not lead a heart|pg||
nt|warrens:  a little aggressive doubling with only 3 trumps, but the nice thing is, it isn't game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely chambers double is takeout, although perhaps convertible|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  neither side can attack @ds, so 3 rounds of @hs may allow declarer to bring this home|pg||
nt|007 joosth: looks nice but H lead still to expect?|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd willlikely lead club, and Robinson will have to guess which red suit to return|pg||
nt|kit: However, East may duck 2 rounds of spades, and then if declarer shifts to hearts I believe he will make|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will probably double with his square hand, but Robinson should pull I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Mike was trying to buy this hand at 5|pg||
nt|007 joosth: good switch|pg||
nt|kit: looking at that dummy it is pretty automatic|pg||
nt|puncher99: there are no greeks bearing gifts in this match|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=21&task=list|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for players list and system summary forms|pg||
nt|kirp:  Wonder if they will go to slam, dont think it makes without help|pg||
nt|kirp:  And knew he had a dble fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW don't play Smith     wonder if that will be a factor|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm, this may not be better...|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, now trouble|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: good evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there are 2 ways to play    low for 4th suit or low for lowest suit    [1st better theoretically,  latter more common]|pg||
nt|kirp:  methods vary as to strength, some Qs are GF, others are invit|pg||
nt|kit: Wold did very well to not be ducking|pg||
nt|kit: But the diamond shift will have to come from him, and that may not be so obvious|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D may be a good save, but they won't take it|pg||
nt|kirp:  Excellent for EW|pg||
nt|kirp:  ame thought i had|pg||
nt|chip: If N had Txx of spades that would improve things considerably|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "can"  better read as "should"|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead is screaming|pg||
nt|kit: and 5@D is a much better save|pg||
nt|warrens:  no double?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andyv:  this may not prove to be a success|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Another value of having strong hand declare|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer needs to take 2 club finesses without losing 2 diamond tricks -- won't be easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: once a double converted to penalty, subsequent double penalty for me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: oops -- that ends the defense|pg||
nt|ady: thats torn it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no double after 2H  so that lead is nor probabble?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but not all play that|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: they continue doing the impossible:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, neither side SHOULD....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems after the lead  kit had a lot of options -- all bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: best switch would have been a @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @d entry, it seems that declarer can just go after @ss now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like that will lead to 2@S 2@H 2@D for -1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kirp:  no argument from here, just pointing out how dble fits work for a lot of trix|pg||
nt|warrens:  and isn't KJxxx enough?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  I don't understand this sequence chosed by EW so can't comment on it|pg||
nt|chick: I just checked the summary card and there is nothing there either|pg||
nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing invite with 5 hearts|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like on Bd 1, O'Rourke picked up 5 imps|pg||
nt|baldfriede: maybe a combination of stripsqueeze and endplay to makeslam|pg||
nt|kirp:  Possible if S pitches a H|pg||
nt|baldfriede: I would at least make another try with East's hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  No @C Q-bid by W should slow him down|pg||
nt|baldfriede: at other table a @c lead helped making 6@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: needs moderate care to make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bidding in OR suggested a @C lead!|pg||
nt|warrens:  after partner has made a vul 2-level overcall and converted 2@D X?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now i bet on defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: 9 tricks almost no matter what |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|sybarra: trying to find 3/3 clubs first|pg||
nt|friggi: ??? W @H was transfer - so the rule is lead the othe M if no other info tells you other wise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: chambers opened 2@C!!      against 4@S  Ferguson led @C but Drew Casen played the @C7|pg||
nt|ady: may be a swing for Orourke|pg||
nt|kit: but he did have info -- no double of 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: hardly likely to double 2@H with QXXX|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i think q as game force too small of a target |pg||
nt|kirp:  This is a pick up for EW, as 4@S dbled in CR|pg||
nt|friggi: @H lead was obvious|pg||
nt|kirp:  Actually @ds is 1 trick better than @Hs|pg||
nt|kirp:  N can get a @D ruff|pg||
nt|kit: had some chance if ducked the first diamond, but good defense would still have prevailed|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|007 joosth: small H  I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can elope some trumps now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kirp:  Focus on S, good lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: I cannot agree heart lead obvious|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i had a $ for every point lost after making an obvious lead|pg||
nt|friggi: bad def|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think club lead is obvious -- needs less in partner's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson hoping opponents will have discarding problems|pg||
nt|kit: Bates dumped his worthless hearts -- that should be the clue for Wold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone having some problems   except dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: right -- really huge result for Lynch|pg||
nt|puncher99: would of done better ducking both diam and spade|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|kit: but he must shift while his partner has club entry|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kirp:  Dont think he can make it after this start|pg||
nt|kit: declare will now take a double club finesse and make|pg||
nt|ady: there is no obvious lead |pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: ask Kanter:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Lynch dumps one of her @S   Passell will have no trouble pinning the @SJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: And Bates better continue diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: He should, since he knows declarer has queen of hearts when Wold won the king|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: just kidding -- of course no lead is obvious|pg||
nt|kit: so only hope is Wold has jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope specs paid attention as kit described the inferences|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

pc|s4|nt|warrens:  looks like he'll make it now|pg||
nt|warrens:  trumps get eloped twice because of North's stiff Ace|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: O'Rourke gets credit for her 4@C bid|pg||
nt|friggi: works well|pg||
nt|kit: I'll remember that when playing you -- will know when to stretch to a marginal game :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excdept when it doesn't|pg||

nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||

nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looks like it would have been reasonable here too  but Chambers didn't like 4333|pg||

nt|007 joosth: well 2H  maybe at E|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: different NT range allowed the open room to diagnose the @s weakness and reach 5@c|pg||

nt|007 joosth: is this 1D  today?|pg||
nt|ady: led a club in OR last hand    north played the 7|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd can go for 1-level penalty, or just get to 3NT|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: looked like 9 tricks for the taking agree specs|pg||
nt|kirp:  except had Axx in @S, opponents had 8 or likely 9 of them|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3NT should be in N then pls|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like more action possible|pg||
nt|santyclz: Trump lead might have worked out better.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  nobody wanted to play a simple 4@h:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl probably 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they might play a penalty double over 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands|pg||
nt|baldfriede: well done :)|pg||
nt|kit: And now, does Bates lead his partner's suit?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: however will not be made anyway?|pg||
nt|kit: Even if he does, defense has to get a second chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time too good for 2@D opener??|pg||
nt|kit: They will likely get to 4@S down 1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Yup, 3N is cold|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is the winner|pg||
nt|007 joosth: D = only choice I think|pg||
nt|kit: It's going to be difficult for N-S to avoid doomed 3NT contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Joost and Jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was flip a coin country|pg||
nt|kit: possible swing here, as fortunate 4@S makes -- I think|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@C works better than double|pg||
nt|chip: I like to play that DBL by N here is 3-suit t/O since 1D didn't show D's.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pass = 0-2@S  [else support dbl]|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: heart queen lead if cindy passes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen 5@C North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like his chances either|pg||
nt|007 joosth: d lead and spade switch  I will give applaus|pg||
nt|kit: on diamond lead, East will not win the trick|pg||
nt|barnets: rather lucky though|pg||
nt|kit: Now Robinson has a difficult problem|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S isn't forcing.  He might double, but that is risky.  Or he might find winning 3NT call.|pg||
nt|kirp:  N knows S has at most 2 @S?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andyv:  their card confirms 4 card major and longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  E guessed the N's major was not @ss|pg||
nt|007 joosth: dull as long they are not in 5 again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  N here prob. cant redble as that shows honour in @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't be expecting his partner has a 5-card major and didn't bid|pg||
nt|kit: therefore, he leads his partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: could have been though, S had 4|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|friggi: duck is manadatory|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so does Boyd try to sneak thru a @S?|pg||
nt|kit: right, and Boyd might have singleton spade, so Robinson not too keen on playing in spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson means this as choice of games apparently, but I think Boyd will think it is RKC for diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Now 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: 10 tricks in nt so it's not too late.|pg||
nt|kit: So I predict Boyd will bid 5@D, 2 with the queen|pg||
nt|kit: that will happen regardless of queen play on first round|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson has chance to make winning pass here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: pass would pruduce very good score|pg||
nt|kit: And really no reason not to IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: yes, 2C will work better, though always a bit scary to do when clubs may be E's real suit.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|007 joosth: difficult lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of defensive tricks in the 2 suits bid by NS|pg||
nt|kirp:  S also now has more easy non-@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or RDBL is transfer   but don't think anybody plays it as days of old  where RDBL=points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does he lead @D or @C?|pg||
nt|kirp:  pick me for points on rdble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Bates PASS|pg||
nt|kit: 1 spade thru doesn't do the job|pg||
nt|kit: I think his best bet is to run the clubs -- if he does something else, the hand will be a readout|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: how did E signal?|pg||
nt|ady: Q@D  still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: if he doesn't lead clubs the defense will know the clubs are running and will know what they have to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Zia play a @H?|pg||
nt|kit: they play udca, so East discouraged in diamonds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: <heavy sarcasm>|pg||
nt|friggi: Q@D in case 9x|pg||
nt|kirp:  I dont like 4H bid by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs standard carding|pg||
nt|kirp:  dont think there is much to the play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|irwinbo: was 3 d really three clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead other room|pg||
nt|kirp:  spade is my pick!|pg||
nt|kit: 5 tricks are easier than 9|pg||
nt|warrens:  oddly I think the best lead might have been a @d, then on the clubs south can throw the rest of his @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: come to think of it -- in context of limited 1@D -- would you make neg dbl with west hand??|pg||
nt|kit: Or maybe he was just choosing diamonds -- he had both bases covered|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what went wrong here|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: i suspect we see Cohen work diamonds next|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i was going to vote for the @C4...  but i think i'll change to the @D6 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: was the result as we see it operator ?|pg||
nt|kirp:  not worth it|pg||
nt|kit: no need to play a heart -- could blow contract if ace is onside|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N rated to be better, let them cash 5@C if they can|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@Hs and a @S loser|pg||
nt|warrens:  up 34, take a more cautious stance?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfe: yes, forgot to cash heart|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays Q@D    thats 8 tricks   wont make a 9th   defence obvious|pg||
nt|friggi: low @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention of Smith for EW|pg||
nt|kit: defense can now count declarer's tricks -- so they will play for what is necessary |pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kozlove didn't opposite unlimited opener|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  looks like E can make this easily on cross ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may be playing transfers where 3@D would be stayman|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shift will beat it 2, but I think Passell will shift to heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but should start with @S shift before more @H  [i think]|pg||
nt|kit: what is more cautious?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kirp:  really is a poor neg dble|pg||
nt|kit: I still think running clubs is best -- West might not hold enough hearts|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the wholle problem began with a diamond overcall which i dont like|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer has stiff diamond that may be necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imagine Passell 5@S 2@H  then @H @H @H endplays|pg||
nt|santyclz: S counting points rather then winners/losers?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: an interesting switch|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kirp:  ill-judged maybe is more polite|pg||
nt|007 joosth: wow|pg||
nt|friggi: low|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: this is makeable from here, but unlikely at the table imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diplomatic   as all bridge players are|pg||
nt|kit: in addition, down 1 less at worst|pg||
nt|warrens:  switch the J of @S to W and it makes 3|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room, they played 2@s when south chose to raise instead of bidding 1NT: a very plausible alternative|pg||
nt|kit: -150 instead of +300 doesn't seem so cautious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hackenbush: ah, EW one of few pairs to have submitted a convention card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense needed to shift to spades after second heart ducked|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/docs/2011uswbc/acblcards/PollackBjerkan.bmp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however disa should not have discarded a diamond, if in fact she did|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i wonder if east's 2nt would be the winning bid in the bridge world   many would double|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks still hard to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about  neg dbl got what it deserved|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately, dummy had partner's 5-card diamond suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or not opening 1NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely finesse |pg||
nt|warrens:  a J away from -530|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2@c may have been an overstatement.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: but no thought to leading @S?    North figures to have exactly 4 [pull w/5]  and South exactly 2  [pass w/3]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: very nice start from Chambers|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: don't like leading from broken 4-card suits...  to costly in the long run|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest: Bates covered in case Cohen only had 10x of spades and Wold had 8xx left|pg||
nt|kirp:  got the ruff anyway, another strong result|pg||
nt|chip: or play 4 rounds of hearts.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  NS have no response to final 3 tricks for EW.  In hindsight, S probably wished she'd led a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't like leading     period|pg||
nt|kirp:  That does beat it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bigtrain: aint that the truth (says the president of the overbidder club)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just ask partners     no good can come from having me on opening lead|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: now a club back but Mark Cohen has nine tricks|pg||
nt|joest: the club pitch suggesting that perhaps Bates wants hearts returned|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: In the other room e/w were in 3N and west removed to 4@D wisely|pg||
nt|kit: still, the 3NT call cost at least 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: on defense it isn't always bad to get endplayed -- if it happens often enough|pg||
nt|kirp:  best here is a club back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on previous board, instead of running @D  Lair is trying @H toward dummy at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chip: But even if he steals that, only 8 tricks.|pg||

pc|hT|nt|007 joosth: an endplay is possible now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i think down 2 instead of 3 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Wold must clear @D for down 2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  trying for the up trick en passent|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a bare J in S is not always 9 tricks |pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm just trying to avoid resulting him and give Steve the benefit of the doubt|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room still playing 32|pg||
nt|kit: give Robinson the benefit of the doubt?  No way :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: even a spade lead wouldn't have helped, could do the same thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on opening lead i was designated as   person to get drinks|pg||
nt|kirp:  club back would have been best|pg||
pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: but risky|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||

pc|s8|nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|joest: this could be a swing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2NT maybe|pg||
nt|joest: if north-south play puppet stayman, they might land in 4@s|pg||
nt|joest: that should still fetch it looks like but its a bit harder than 3NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: guess the @d lead worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and/or @S switch    and/or   sunspot activity|pg||
nt|bigtrain: interesting implications for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 180 the hard way|pg||
nt|chip: EW defense did a good job of speeding up the play in 3C.|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 2@C, but not 4@S, too much of a rush|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: i wonder where other room lost 4th defensive trick|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S doubled at other table, so actually Kasle will pick up IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what if fly !AH and NOT cash @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: E will never be on lead. so Kx of clubs stay protected|pg||
nt|joest: treating his hand as too big for an initial 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  Jacobus opened 1N|pg||
nt|barnets: 28 card suits unusual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: am i counting correctly   TWO 8-card suits|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H opening is Flannery|pg||
nt|chip: rather silly to fly if not planning to cash.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another nebulous @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true -- but given them a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|kirp:  speed is good, especially after the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  on board 34, 5@c was made in OR, slicing the lead to 13 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16   [1st/2nd and not vul 3rd]|pg||
nt|friggi: red cross:)|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd has difficult problem -- how high does he go?|pg||
nt|santyclz: And led the @d so he later got a ruff and his trump promoted for -2.|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: was a very poor effort|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h probably shows 2 controls|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i can understand it with so many controls|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will certainly double|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson will bid 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder if they have a bid to show both minors  -- nope|pg||
nt|chip: perhaps they do, but only with weaker hands.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: quick attack on transportation|pg||
nt|kit: This will be a normal 2@H contract, which is probably down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duplicating other room auction|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can sutherlin possibly pull this double|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hackenbush: i'm guessing East bid 2@d instead of North|pg||
nt|sybarra: suport X |pg||
nt|kit: this is an asking bid -- not sure of the coding of the responses they are using|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  good guess Howard:)|pg||
nt|kit: Lead-directing 3rd seat opener by Passell|pg||
nt|kit: and it may make it difficult for N-S to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|warrens:  2NT by North?|pg||
nt|warrens:  1@S must show values or why not just pass|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure  but 1NT will also show extra's?|pg||
nt|kit: but he doesn't have a diamond stopper!|pg||
nt|warrens:  East has a 6-card suit to pull to, but he also has 3 Aces for defense and he knows Qx of @S will make 5@C's play poorly|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bit of a hand hog|pg||
nt|007 joosth: true|pg||
pc|dA|nt|007 joosth: J of diamonds may be the entry for club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter  do you use coded 10/9 leads in this situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  a hand where almost all finesses are off|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not sure that was best choice, reasonable but @S also possible|pg||
nt|kirp:  However this looks like it should go down 2 trix at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you're right Kit   1@D-1@H//1@S-2@H//end|pg||
nt|friggi: kit is alws right:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, picky picky|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: so they are playing puppet|pg||
nt|kirp:  probably 4513, so best chance is 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer DID fly @HA   Chambers followed with 10 [Smith ??]   so @SK and a push|pg||
nt|kit: silly compromise though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: suspect we missed a pass|pg||
nt|kit: Passell has difficult lead -- diamond lead may let declarer make|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hackenbush: could be gazilli but nothing much on their system summary form|pg||
nt|hackenbush: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=838&pid=607|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm guessing that 2@d was xfer to @hs showing a better raise than 2@h directly|pg||
nt|hackenbush: that's more likely, if 2@c and 2@h not alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Two diamonds was alerted by West but not by East.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: referring to Stewart's @S shift|pg||
nt|007 joosth: might be 1/3 lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  we use something thats referred to as foster returns|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd from garbage?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no...  when dummy has small cards we lead second highest unless we want partner to do some high banging|pg||
nt|baldfriede: the @s suit of N does not look very inviting though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe that's a documented rule|pg||
nt|kit: Bates will probably try to cash ace of clubs, hoping it is his partner with the singleton|pg||
nt|kit: But leading from AJxx when declarer has suit stopped is pretty poor IMO|pg||
nt|kirp:  W knows S had Â¨Ds covered, what else, @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should lead a spade, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking maybe 2@S would be INV+ with @D & @C|pg||
nt|chip: Since S has no entry, no reall chance for NS.|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like only 4 losers, wonder if @H lead is best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|007 joosth: as in other room no puppet here|pg||
nt|kirp:  Bit undervalued by N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you like 2N over 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think declarer should take quick pitch here -- I would win (not with ace) and lead a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which hi level bidder more likely to be short?   |pg||
nt|warrens:  I would have overcalled 1nt (against Precision)|pg||
nt|kit: And now they are in wrong game.  Never show support you don't have.  If Robinson wanted to show a good hand, he could have simply bid 2@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe N should bid 2D   or after 2S  south can bid 2NT?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kirp:  NV game so maybe not worth the push|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: actually you can't determine that by a 3@s rebid :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed:)|pg||
nt|joest: so this presents the ninth trick but the contract is always cold just by keeping east off lead, for overtricks even|pg||
nt|007 joosth: seems strange  but the possible entry has gone|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be a push around the room |pg||
nt|kirp:  Just that someone needs to push, not both|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is part of why i play big club|pg||
nt|kirp:  good chance pard has 4@S so why not|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will be going after hearts|pg||
nt|chip: Declarer can manage 4D, 3C and 2H.|pg||
nt|kirp:  yup, nothing should hurt this|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kirp:  I play bigger club|pg||
nt|kit: now he might try a spade -- not clear|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson now has to decide between stiff club lead and 4-0 trump split|pg||
nt|kit: now he has a claim -- 8 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at Kozlove's hand   i can't tell if  @SA was the power lead [for unblock/count] or asking attitude|pg||
pc|d8|nt|irwinbo: 4 spades may even make 5   she will probably make 4 hearts here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|007 joosth: not the lead at 4S  :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  True, except it does not give up anything, club lead might|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: could have doubled 3@D, 3@H was a bit much|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 9 tricks for the taking|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kirp:  why would you want S on lead, with N's hand?|pg||
nt|kirp:  @H is actually safe|pg||
nt|kirp:  dummy has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @Dx real killer|pg||
nt|kit: But Lynch will be returning 8 of diamonds -- then 6 of diamonds will save the defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: So the 1@D opening really had the desired effect|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: this hand does not merit much thought, are we still here|pg||
nt|irwinbo: i think she is worried about a 4-1 heart break andbeing tapped in dummy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: duck one heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the club players who automatically false card here with @DA   that's actually a give away   by winning Q  south doesn't know who has @DK|pg||
nt|kit: very difficult for defense to find the club shift, but they will have enough time since North has doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|kirp:  still looks like 1 down, assuming W is careful in @ds|pg||
nt|kit: Passell knows hearts aren't running, so he doesn't need to panic|pg||
nt|kirp:  may even lead @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: not may -- will lead hearts.  He knows that with 3 hearts Boyd wouldn't have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|kirp:  i have learned never to say 'will'|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kirp:  still 5 trix|pg||
nt|kirp:  that blocked him up a bit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: are we stuck or is S thinking?|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N here was pretty easy, though 3@d trix available to defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this may soon turn into NT play |pg||
nt|kirp:  so in theory, 3n can be beat|pg||
nt|kirp:  in OR, played by N, it would have been harder to beat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can defense take 3@D if they play the suit?  looks frozen to me|pg||
nt|kit: you gotta believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  i agree, Mike knew S only had 1 @d stopper, with 3@Hs no question of which game|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|ady: heart play looks against the odds|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe S will play a diamond?|pg||
nt|friggi: right but you have to be creative|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of spades shows not much in spades, but Boyd doesn't know for sure where king of diamond is -- he may think Robinson has that and Wold the club strength|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  west on lead|pg||
nt|kirp:  meanwhile, 2s is playing well, i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer doesn't know if @CK doubleton or singleton    probably the former|pg||
nt|kirp:  so what, cross to 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's what i'm thinking   but i'm in a loop|pg||
nt|kirp:  cant make more than 4, 3 or 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so working on not making 1 :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kirp:  2 is virtually assured|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it did  and @H continuation is death knell|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: not necissarily bad however, EW can make 4@H|pg||
nt|kirp:  this is for 4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: it can become a tough match this way|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kirp:  EW communications are messy now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kirp:  could be down 3 now i think|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no risk  with clubs open|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: Also, 9 of spades might have been from K109|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|andyv:  you loosened them up, Cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: guess so :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack was thinking.|pg||
nt|kit: will Passell cash out, or go for more with spade shift?|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he could have safely gone for more|pg||
nt|kirp:  knows his client, take your trix|pg||
nt|kirp:  K@C then @H exit!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  W still has @c loser so making 2 seems to be the most likely outcome|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, make that a @h loser now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 trick swing compared to other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: dreww played this one really nicely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now just have to figure out who did good/bad|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to this point anyway|pg||
nt|kit: declarer disappointed not to make having gotten this far|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you play 9 or 10 from that holding 2nd hand?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: no more club loser, but now a heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might never score @HA|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I do play 10 or 9 = 0 or 2 higher in middle of hand, and so do Boyd-Robinson|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  that play doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|chick: not unreasonable play, since there was a ruff, entirely possible the J will fall now-doubleton|pg||
nt|chick: the club was a sure loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought W would finesse for J@h|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  the play I was talking about was the Q@d off dummy|pg||
nt|kirp:  went down 3 in OR|pg||

nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||

nt|hawe45:  There is a rule: Only ONE opponent can have @S Ace...|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a common convention helps to bid if partner doesn't delive that south bid his cards allready  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|tihana: looks like missunderstanding on board 2 in other room|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|stc: and the other the Q¨h|pg||

nt|ahollan1: specs who get bored when contract is 1N --  keep that hand in mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus led @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: +100 honors|pg||
nt|kit: impossible declarer could have 9 tricks|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when you can bid 4S  you can also bid 2NT I would say|pg||
nt|kit: Likely pickup for Lynch, tightening the match|pg||
nt|santyclz: May be a duplicated board.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: knowing south holds 3 or 4@S a very reasonable choice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can i retract that last raving?|pg||
nt|friggi: I like 9 from nothing or 9 from 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and now 5@C from Stewart|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he must have some spades mixed in with his clubs :)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey has the same thought i think|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=0/1 controls  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
nt|kirp:  NS can make lots of @Ds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not without the 1NT opener though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: NS play precision|pg||
nt|joest: third seat a good four card major is a possibility|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 5C as expected|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S liekly to be reached   should be down 1 with diamond wrong|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has normal neg double -- Boyd will raise -- not clear how high|pg||
nt|kit: But Boyd knows Robinson has at least 3 spades and 5 hearts, so a doubleton in one of the minors.  So why would 3NT be right?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: tons of pressure now.  Rosenberg could just grab it with 3NT but that's a big statement|pg||
nt|joest: but if he makes a 'responsive double' or some such they are probably headed to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: 5@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  solved a tuff hand with invit raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wish USBF could require submission of Convention Cards for their trials -- not sure how many @D promised by Schermer's 1@D :(|pg||
nt|kirp:  3@D bid is intersting, would you play this as weak?|pg||
nt|kirp:  1@D gets a workout in this system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=min, not 6!(322)|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C shows some minimum|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently 6 vg sessions running, to watch multiple tables:  www.bridgebase.com/mobile  Open 1 browser window/table.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H is 5 spades, 4+ hearts, 9-11 i believe|pg||
nt|warrens:  what other than 3NT, maybe a forcing 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 3NT seems best|pg||
nt|friggi: J from nothing else from 2|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd won't introduce his heart suit now|pg||
nt|kirp:  how about sneaky club suit, E pitched a low club, not a high spade on 3rd @h|pg||
nt|kit: 2@C call pretty conservative -- looks more like 3@C call to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but burns no calories|pg||
nt|chip: 6D is excellent, and makes easily.|pg||
nt|kirp:  its on constructive hands like this where it causes problems. Better to rebid 1N with W and take it frm there|pg||
nt|kirp:  in my opinionÂ¨|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: wonder what Casen would bid over  3@C-4@S-5@C-?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: an 800 point gift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus in action again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N rebid 11-13|pg||
nt|kirp:  3N anyone by S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT by south i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they must play this forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: takes teh pressure off partner which is always appreciated|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|kit: And 4@S will be reached, which should go down on decent defense|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess not opposite passed pard|pg||
nt|kit: If Robinson passes Lynch can try 3@D, and then auction will liven up|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after 2 or 3NT  Robinson can correct to 4S with some singleton,  but I agree  it starts with the 2S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: club finesse is needed  after that at least 9 tricks|pg||
nt|joest: Wold knows where the spade king is (or thinks he does)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well  he may be right:)|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing Eddie leads a @d|pg||
nt|chip: I like that style better also, though there was a hand earlier today in the women's where it was a big loser when EW lost their spade Fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this lead and auction should help Wheeler pick up trumps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: both partners seem to have been ticketed for speeding here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe 5 down even?|pg||
nt|kirp:  he counts points|pg||
nt|kit: Down 2 on stiff diamond lead, as declarer must finesse to try to make|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  would you ever consider bidding NT instead of the neg dbl with that awful @H suit?|pg||
nt|kirp:  guess they need more machinery|pg||
nt|chip: or be willing to use it.|pg||
nt|kit: Kasle rooting for 25 more deals like this one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: i dont understand 4@D bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can he get out for 800?|pg||
nt|kirp:  maybe 2@D inverted but can have  major, gets he suit across|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think using inverted that way is worst of all permutations|pg||
pc|s9|nt|007 joosth: N can change tactics now by not finessing clubs but diamonds  to protect his sp K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: such as swap @CK and @Sx|pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|kirp:  That may steal the board|pg||
nt|santyclz: Didn't anticipate that!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joest: now with the heart queen found Rosenberg may work diamonds, trying to keep west off play and not betting the whole hand right away on the location of the club king|pg||
nt|joest: Wold's failure to lead a spade marks him with the ac3e|pg||
nt|joest: ace|pg||
nt|joest: eventually though he will discover he has no alternative but to take the club hook|pg||
nt|007 joosth: and according the opening it seems to be safe|pg||
nt|joest: Wold may well be light but even the scroungiest of opening bids rates to have the club king|pg||
nt|joest: but there is no harm in working diamonds right now just in case.|pg||
nt|joest: 4 hearts + 4 diamonds + 1 club = 9|pg||
nt|007 joosth: when it's about avertricks he can better start clubs immediately|pg||
nt|007 joosth: overtricks    i think:)|pg||
nt|kit: big swing on opening lead here |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: South and West having lengthy discussion about 4D bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director has been called.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Bernstein, Westheimer, and director have gone off for a long discussion on other side of room.|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with nebulous @D  you can NEVER unscramble @D length that way|pg||
nt|kirp:  you can, if responder can say this is my suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|007 joosth: but it was only a 3d hand opening......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 68 of 96   Womens USA2  Joel leads Sprung by 32|pg||
nt|kit: Can play 3 rounds of clubs and pitch spade to avoid spade ruff and make overtrick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|friggi: declarer must play for the fin - if he want to make the game:)|pg||
nt|friggi: wants|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  4@S   open room   diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer-Chambers 2@H/@S openers are intermediate  10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Bates "knows" the lead is likely a singleton, but he will still finesse just in case|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: not much here so i'm wondering if 6@D can make after @H @H|pg||
nt|kirp:  client happily raised to 5@Ds using point count methods|pg||
nt|kirp:  only via a backwards finesse in @S|pg||
nt|kit: No kidding -- difference between making and down 3|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|baldfriede: no way to reach W's @s, hence it will make|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: and he should|pg||
nt|friggi: just in case|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: could be right|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: cute since Robinson couldn't win with @C8  Wold knows Robinson's exact shape|pg||
nt|kirp:  N has work to do, not any more|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson isn't 100% sure -- he may lay down king of hearts and get a signal|pg||
nt|kirp:  Meanwhile 5@Ds is cold|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|stc: on 23(5@c) NS never entered the auction !!|pg||
nt|stc: and let EW play 3@s|pg||

mb|1H|nt|runnerup: now  @h slam|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Dont think it makes?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: Ugly misfit -- will probably get to 3NT, but might arrive in 4@S|pg||
nt|tihana: why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  6N by N is cold on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT by Lair seems clear|pg||
nt|runnerup: par looks like 9 in ! ,but |pg||
nt|ntmon: N/s again off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Michaels cuebid - promising both Majors, not my style with only an 8 count vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  both minors 3-3, @dK onside, @s suit can't be misguessed if led|pg||
nt|stc: NS will play game here|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to bid ,but now known to be in rigth hand if bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lair looking for more it seems|pg||
nt|ntmon: pass over 2@D and X later will be for penalty|pg||
nt|tihana: only a heart|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I'm surprised Weichsel didn't bid 3@S, unless he feared that would show 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it will depend on whether they play in a minor or NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think they are in slam after this Q-bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting - on the previous hand 3@H went down one in OR|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|stc: friendly @s and blocked @ds help a lot|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: people are talking 6NT, but they aren't getting there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bu @C might be 3-3|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes can be rigth to x some caises,but north passed hand so pass looks ok|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|stc: playing on @s looks better, the 10 may be short|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Lair went conservative|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are looking at 4 hands, Kit. I am surprised they got pat 3N|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ntmon: W in other rooms was more dynamic|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|ahollan1: to expected 1@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Schermer to bid 1st|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we know  Jacobus would open 1N|pg||
nt|warrens:  would anyone have bid 3@S over 3@C with West?|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not been dull so far|pg||
nt|kit: I wouldn't have -- 8-card fit, compete 3 over 3?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: board is turned|pg||
nt|kit: However, I would have tried 3@D instead|pg||
nt|warrens:  right, the other option|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 imp every board add up also|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: weak 2 maybe|pg||
nt|barnets: some chance here e/w as 4@H can be beaten|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kirp:  Should be quick auction|pg||
nt|kirp:  opposite limited opening bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  he's the dealer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's not fair|pg||
nt|kit: very possible swing here, as N-S could easily get to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kozlove bid the same opposite unlimited 1@D|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, 4@s would be almost automatic for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Flannery  4@S  5/6@H|pg||
nt|friggi: if it fails... try again|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes I already was looking why they did not make 4....|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd will bid game|pg||
nt|kit: probably played ace and a heart for safety in other room|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 2@D call|pg||
nt|kit: Which presents problems to N-S|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|007 joosth: thats better:)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S can be beaten|pg||
nt|barnets: If the defence can lead or switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: auction will look funny|pg||
nt|chip: well, we seem to be stuck on 1D openings.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the hand where Passell went down in 3N  Hayden continued @S10 at trick 2  that really slowed down Schermer|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a hand that could have had some fireworks put quietly to bed with the 3@d preempt|pg||
nt|kit: Wold has a chance to be a hero with king of diamonds lead -- |pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: playing in a 6-1 minor instead of a 6-2 major seems like a hole in the system|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps @D and a major |pg||
nt|kirp:  almost any system except mine, where I played Texas after 1 D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen a plethora of 8/9 card suits  and 11/12 card fits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: texas over 1@D   very cool treatment Martin|pg||
nt|kirp:  it was a strong club system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow haven't seen that in long time   old fashioned raise of minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this rebid totally a matter of style|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: dubious 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR 3N was bid quickly, here more science|pg||
nt|barnets: In the other room a heart was led|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H call shows 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 shape (raise)|pg||
nt|barnets: the 8|pg||
nt|barnets: west had to win and shift a dianond|pg||
mb|3S|nt|007 joosth: a rather dull board 9 tricks  maybe defenders dont take their 4 tr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D game force checkback  [a guess]|pg||
nt|kit: So this will be 10 IMPs for Kasle|pg||
nt|friggi: sur eit will|pg||
nt|friggi: good biddng|pg||
nt|friggi: bidding|pg||
nt|barnets: but he duched the first heart|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like N has S's hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  same, but no 2 passes to start|pg||
nt|ritong: just enter the final result, please|pg||
nt|kit: Good save, and E-W must double|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I would not preempt with S's hand, too much chance partner has spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  but they will survive this one as there is no game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised Casen didn't either bid 2@S or make Support DBL??|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I think he is confident with this 2H  Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes, i know  @HAJ9x  screams defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 nt from N? |pg||
nt|kirp:  yup|pg||
nt|kit: I think king of diamonds lead is quite reasonable personally -- just need ace or queen in partner's hand, and if he doesn't have it, probably won't cost|pg||
nt|barnets: and then had no chance|pg||
nt|kit: and here, partner didn't double 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: actually pointed out dec can duck the diamond switch|pg||
nt|kirp:  S says thank you|pg||
nt|kit: Passell ducks since he has no entry|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: This will be down 1, and should just about tie up the match|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 5@C goes 4 down|pg||
nt|kit: the save got a plus score -- that makes it a good save|pg||
nt|kirp:  A great save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I will enter final result when they finish|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C can go down 4 if defense cashes everything and exits with a trump -- otherwise, there will be an endplay|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so this should go down 2|pg||
nt|chick: sounds about right|pg||
nt|kirp:  Note that 6@D s depends only on finding the Q and double finesse in @Ss|pg||
nt|barnets: that would cut communications|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: 3@S may have clarified @H weakness|pg||
nt|ritong: surprise|pg||
nt|kit: did this really make???|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  how?|pg||
nt|kit: can you describe what happened?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wrong-sided the nt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I understand you should not always pass,  but do we get a serie of kamikaze-bids from here now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok will play the 4/3 |pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|sybarra: a real challenge |pg||
nt|sybarra: in fact not sure it can be made|pg||
nt|kirp:  I am guessing, also no 5th @D or shape |pg||
nt|friggi: Q@H is the card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for all of the grief that the convention gets  there are times when it is very easy for responder|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like he may make this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meaning the lead is easier for east|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  S is still trying, N will check out|pg||
nt|kit: king-doubleton leads are very underrated -- people lead away from kings all the time, so why not lead from king doubleton when you have additional upside of a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: schermer being forced to re-confirm  minimum balanced hand 3@S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kirp:  Its possible that S could have only 4@S with @D fit|pg||
nt|barnets: so it had to be a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not sure likely to fly K  |pg||
nt|kirp:  Nice safety play against 40 spli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't get kasle in for  @C underlead, misguess AND @C for trump promotion|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chick: she'll take 6 diamonds and the @SK, not much chance of anything else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can make all the rest|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not greatest auction but well judged in the end to pass 4N|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Pollack has called the director.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry that the connection keeps dropping.  It has been happening all day.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sorry.  Don't have that info.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: other table misdefended against 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Director is here.  East exposed a card.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so possibly 5 more imps to NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, maybe not now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be interesting if Bates ducks the 10|pg||
nt|kirp:  dont know how they made only 3 in CR|pg||
nt|kirp:  continuing @Ds would have been best|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will have to lose 2 tricks in every side suit for down 2.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|kit: right to start with low heart -- if East has stiff king, may need to conserve spots|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: so now down 2 for sure and maybe 3  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but "only 50's" |pg||
nt|kirp:  11 trix looks easy|pg||
nt|kirp:  think Passell would get @Cs right on the auction and lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but needed to start with diamond ruff i think|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfe: Declarer is cross-ruffing the hand.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes but had she ruffed a diamond immediately would have scored all 6 trumps in hand|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe drawing trumps was a better chance to make more tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: does he just take double finesse in @S or can he combine chances in @D & @S|pg||
nt|kirp:  even diamond to A works well|pg||
nt|kirp:  Q@D dropping is extra chance in favour of @S finesses|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room 1@S West|pg||
pc|h3|mc|12|nt|ahollan1: so maybe @DA @S finesse  and when that works he's set|pg||

nt|henryb:  but it would only have turned a quick hand into a slow one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ntmon: something N has to have finally|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam zone -this time  @c easyest|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: Tough choice for Robinson on opening lead, particularly in light of 1@C opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 or 8 tricks doesn't mean a difference|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew has to stay low 1 nt looks ok|pg||
mb|3H|nt|tihana: strange bid 3cl, should south show strong balance?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: game should be reached|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: misfit but enough points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good lead - for declarer|pg||
nt|stc: and the most friendly lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: multi-purpose club and transfer responses in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: now many tricks|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: okay, now he is cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially, if E/W duck another @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: well north wked up -is it right ? -perhaps -200 |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|runnerup: jump in clubs doent look the way to desripe this hand all thought it make it easy to bid 6--but is it forcing even|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  How do you prevent 3 heart tricks, Kit?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - wasÂ´nt ducked|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: so 10 very badly needed IMPs for Lynch|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I guess you really can't|pg||
nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ntmon: this may not be good - defensive ruffs available|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: nice 7 of diamonds play if he really did it, which he might well have done|pg||

mc|11|nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a nervy one, needs 4 tricks from Majors so must finesse, @H more dangerous and @S a 2 way guess - on the theory of vacant spaces - trusting W for longer @Ds than E, it ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks right to play E for the @SQ - which works|pg||

nt|ahollan1: are you sure claim wasn't DOWN 1?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: i thought I scored it down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope  +1|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 3N by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 9 to score in the USA1 final   Schwartz over Lynch by 35|pg||
nt|friggi: correto kit|pg||
nt|kit: is the North hand too strong for a 1NT opening?  We shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  if A@D is with N, then need to pitch Q@D|pg||
nt|007 joosth: its just a button:)|pg||
nt|kit: Multi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kirp:  Best by W|pg||
nt|kirp:  Not good enuff for 1N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D opening  that's the theme of this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|007 joosth: diff to reach 3NT now,   but thats not really bad:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  exactly!|pg||
nt|chip: Perhaps E has a different range.|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is really bad|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: Rosenberg with a disciplined pass but at matchpoints I can assure you some folks would enter with a lead directing 2@s|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C majors   same as if  1N opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: it was down one|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice 2C if it is majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another hand  IF in slam, can you make|pg||
nt|kit: note light opener in Precision|pg||
nt|kirp:  to avoid end play, but ???|pg||
nt|007 joosth: indeed|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is pass or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well I guess at IMPS too!|pg||
nt|joest: at favorable I guess anything goes|pg||
nt|joest: but Milt is usually pretty disciplined|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without peeking at all 52 cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: steve cashed club then another ace|pg||
nt|kirp:  Okidoki|pg||
nt|kit: Double is takeout double of hearts I assume|pg||
nt|007 joosth: here you can play lebensohl|pg||
nt|kit: Sutherlin may be thinking of passing -- won't be good idea this time|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he might try 2S ?|pg||
nt|kit: He will probably bid 3@C, which is top spot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: reading the notes and def|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S will survive also I believe|pg||
nt|kit: N-S can make 10 tricks in diamonds, but they aren't going to find the fit.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  6@c or 6N will be disappointing with the 4-1 @c break|pg||
nt|andyv:  the OR managed to stay out of trouble|pg||
nt|joest: this catches Cohen with a big hand though|pg||
nt|joest: here come the police|pg||
nt|joest: Bates has to double what is under his nose it seems to me|pg||
nt|joest: of course his partner is 3rd seat but still..|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only 7 tricks i think|pg||
nt|007 joosth: very light opener  that R|pg||
nt|007 joosth: E|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT is relay to 3@C -- immediate 3-level call stronger|pg||
nt|007 joosth: so lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: and there they are|pg||
nt|007 joosth: but a diamond lead is not nice|pg||
nt|joest: no way does Rosenberg sit this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: n0--sorry--|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kit: 2@S probably 4-card support|pg||
nt|friggi: must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I dont think  such a bid has to be strong.  so 3S seems some rough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen liked his pure holdings in majors  -- and i'm sure not a high card invite -- that would be 2N|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nice double fit,  but a doubtful K|pg||
nt|andyv:  Drew basing it on the dbl major suit fit|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade lead gives it away|pg||
nt|andyv:  and seems impossible to keep N from gaining lead if you don't lead a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat  and  3rd vul  1N=15-17|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have pinched it|pg||
nt|kit: 1@S not the best contract, but it will make|pg||
nt|warrens:  duck this?|pg||
nt|kit: I would win and go right after diamonds|pg||
nt|kirp:  Did 1@S gtee a weak hand, pass looks timid by N|pg||
nt|kit: no, normal -- North just made a good decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N did eventually make 3N on 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ach  Schermer|pg||
nt|kirp:  Even if E opens 1N, S may enter the auction with 'Majors'|pg||
mb|4C|nt|chick: it does seem that they should have considered a slam at least|pg||
nt|joest: ok so I have misguessed Rosenberg at every opportunity|pg||
nt|joest: Mark used to be a pretty harsh partner.  I played with him.|pg||
nt|joest: I would NOT have wanted to table this dummy in 3NT doubled!!! :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  Hard to find @C lead now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with small doubleton H   i can imagine a reasonable 3card spades|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson can definitely consider balancing with xx in spades -- passing risks losing a double-part-score swing|pg||
nt|ady: now see if they can make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may -- but would he?|pg||
nt|chip: consider 1C-1H-1S-2m-2H  |pg||
nt|santyclz: No lead looks even halfway decent.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: when in doubt lead a jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: right now, pollack is praying for a bad club split :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  as they did here...1N is 8-13 and game forcing|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a heart lead seems obvious   the Q or K   according to what agreement you have|pg||
nt|007 joosth: asking unblocking a J|pg||
nt|joest: although that will cost her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wasn't sure about 3@H  and that also applies to 4N and 5@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Have no idea what 4N was, key-card?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S might fit  keycard  or    5@S 6@D  [but didn't 4@S show that?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H weak jump shift -- just weird for that hand to ask KeyCards|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice bid by N if thats the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here's a twist  4@S=keycard for @H|pg||
nt|kit: it looks like headed down 1|pg||
nt|friggi: yes but what if they dont ?|pg||
nt|friggi: still suitable |pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe he can do something nice with the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 4th club with east will come into play|pg||
nt|kit: defense may have to get diamonds going in time|pg||
nt|kit: N-S unable to diagnose the fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Works well this hand.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kirp:  5@D is also a nice contratc|pg||
nt|kirp:  thats also possible!|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks here after this lead|pg||
nt|kit: well, might only take 9, since if led this lead ride, the suit will be blocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: 8-11 opposite passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus opened north hand 1@C  so O'Rourke had no trouble leading @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lasts random guess  4N pick-a-game|pg||
nt|ady: needs 10@D switch early|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chip  please tell me that is referring to a different hand/conversation|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hackenbush: *as|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace lead was a good bet with no raise by partner|pg||
nt|hackenbush: new leader after this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Yes, goes down every 4-5 minutes.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: should get diamonds right after West shows up with lots of black cards|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well Jack,  maybe he just wanted to visit the toilet?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: no unbloch here  thats strange|pg||
nt|joest: Bates proceeding on the assumption that, having not seen the jack from partner, Cohen must have it|pg||
nt|joest: at least I'm guessing so|pg||
nt|007 joosth: y|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 1 more mistake and its only -100|pg||
nt|joest: but it doesn't matter much what he does since Cohen has only six tricks that I can count|pg||
nt|kirp:  May find @C lead after this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: one thing is sure --- this auction hasn't come up before|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andyv:  true, ty:)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Limited by the failure to open 1@c.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: assuming that Wold switches to the @Dj when he gets in|pg||
nt|kirp:  Rise with @C K to block the suit|pg||
nt|kit: This hand hasn't made yet -- 3 spades, 3 diamonds, 1 club are all the sure tricks declarer has|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi howard|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: hi Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and South will win @D with no @C to continue|pg||
nt|kit: they are playing standard, not strong club|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: that is the kay in def|pg||
nt|kirp:  Are NS a Strong Club pair?|pg||
nt|kit: no -- standard|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh, sorry thought they were playing precision, they're not.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no--they claimed five and was accepted|pg||
pc|h7|nt|friggi: @D 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is yet another hand where backward finesse works -- but won't be taken at the table|pg||
nt|kit: declarer doesn't really gain by going after hearts, but it deflects the defenders from what they need to do|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kirp:  i dislike too many blackwood versions|pg||
nt|kit: to make 10 tricks, he had to trust lead -- win in dummy, draw trumps, and take third round spade finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: i dislike not knowing   What's Trump?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice|pg||
nt|chip: sorry, that was refering to whether to rebid 1S with 4 or 1N on a balanced hand (and not distinguishing 4-3-3-3 from 4-3-1-5)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  or trust the lead now and cash 2 spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this continuation was confusing|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  time to claim|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you need to allow one ruff, well done|pg||
pc|dT|nt|007 joosth: first they should discard 5 times|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will play continue @S to King @D to 8?|pg||
nt|friggi: Al is right ...sadly:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: or  does he think South is danger hand|pg||
nt|kirp:  in the olde days, i played 4N as the only Black and alwys Black|pg||
nt|ady: south may have been a too passive|pg||
nt|kit: And it worked -- now declarer will get 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Diamond shift far from obvious from Boyd's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H  went down in OR   so Wold needed to make this|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|kit: right -- that works also now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chick: she can set up a spade trick before clearing clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Upon getting bad news, will lead diamond to dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|007 joosth: I think NS should have a little talk about intervening and bidding after that|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like it|pg||
nt|kit: Good club play by Robinson -- gives declarer a losing option of 9 of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which was tough for Wold as dummy|pg||
nt|friggi: it is makeble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing 3 suiter instead of 4 suiter|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: queen of spades is very thoughtful, showing Qj|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we used to call that  Lublin's Law|pg||
nt|kirp:  Glenn Lublin?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i see that Glenn has been doing some commentary lately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm absolutely sure that both sides of that argument are right  except when both sides are absolutely wrong|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kirp:  nice 2 imp win!!!|pg||
nt|kit: or at least should I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|joest: no way would Wold duck the spade 10 off dummy then (even though he would probably hop anyway)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|kit: Wold careless there -- he should know his partner has natural trump trick|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, surprising he didn't play the Jack on the second round|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3 off  indeed as you said now|pg||
nt|joest: like I said, no way does Wold duck the spade :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kirp:  all's well that ends well|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|joest: Bates overtakes and cashes out since he knows what to do|pg||
nt|007 joosth: claim already?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh    should have known that    can i claim formative years in chicago public skool?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: and he was bornin Stratford.on-Avon|pg||
nt|kirp:  spelling bee?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like Lynch will just get to 4@S|pg||
nt|kirp:  Enuff|pg||
mb|3N|nt|joest: 2Nt might be the 'value call' but it could be Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|friggi: -1 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N game force raise |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C min, not 6@H|pg||
nt|kit: why is 6@D by West better than 6@S by west?|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to get to|pg||
nt|kirp:  @Ds|pg||
nt|santyclz: The open room wrong-sided the 3nt as well, but w had overcalled a @h so e led one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: partnerships differ about whether 2NT is Lebensohl after a 2@d opener|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT gets the nature of the hand across well|pg||
nt|007 joosth: In the Netherlands almost everybody plays multi,  so I don't know|pg||
nt|joest: Bates may be asking himself: "do we play Lebensohl here"?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I hope he asked it before|pg||
nt|joest: of course it is possible that they do and that Wold follows up with 3@h over a forced 3@c rebid showing four hearts in a NT hand and offering a choice of games|pg||
nt|joest: his hand is pretty straightforward so the longer he thinks the more my money is on the issue of "what do we play here?" :)|pg||
nt|kit: but it does make -- 4 hearts, 1 club, 4 diamonds, 3 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless Wold bids 3@C  that means something completely different :)|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will ask -- not sure which coding they use from here|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after a club lead?....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: oh right -- West can lead a club --|pg||
nt|friggi: yes like joost said - open cards:) no problem, but.............|pg||
nt|kirp:  EW play Precision, so 6@S is unlikely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kasle the only one not to have opened 1@D at least once|pg||
nt|chip: I would add that almost 100% of those playing weak NT do rebid 1N on all the 15-17 hands balanced hands (so 1S promises a balanced hand)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Passell pass = 0-2@H   [support dbl situation]|pg||
nt|chip: sorry, 1S rebid promises an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ACBL defense database vs multi  http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|kirp:  2@S plays rather well here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4|pg||
nt|barnets: because you can pitch a heart on the fifth spade|pg||
nt|barnets: and lead a heart towards the k|pg||
nt|barnets: giving yourself 2 50 percent chances|pg||
nt|kit: oh, I see -- okay|pg||
nt|kit: I think Bates will just blast it into 6@S with RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not   i think Wold is allowed 3@S  so  will go thru 2N to get full distribution|pg||
nt|kirp:  Guessing A, then @C|pg||
nt|kirp:  dble now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that's where i first picked up the habit Chip   and  invention of checkback schemes just made it easier|pg||
nt|kit: East hand all primes -- if Passell makes any move at all, Sutherlin will accept|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: it is only fair -- if some open 2@H with 5  someone has to balance by opening 2@H with 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and can't blame him with 222 in other suit    YUK|pg||
nt|007 joosth: he is vuln   and has just seen the result of doing it with 5 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 5 card suit at 3 level is a different disease|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: what about a diamond now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest: 3@c = "I think we play Lebensohl" :)|pg||
nt|kirp:  9 trix methinks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a standard treatment of DBL after interference of Jacoby raise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C to show 4252|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S in open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF they use same responses as other Wold partnerships|pg||
nt|barnets: the lead of the @HQ speeds play up|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room north was on lead|pg||
nt|kit: And Passell will make a move, so 6@H should be reached|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this raise by chambers has to do with the fact that they open 4 card heart suits|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: and led @HQ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Option 2  uses DBL = 13-15 bal or strong hand|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl;)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hope they're on same page   in one partnership 4@D = 4441@C|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: treacherous contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think win heart in hand club king and ten|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ty N|pg||
nt|kit: And there is the move -- Sutherlin should drive to slam now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surely not pass?|pg||
nt|warrens:  this can't be right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|007 joosth: some magic will be needed|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C doubled would cost plenty|pg||
pc|d9|nt|007 joosth: again.... the strong hand should play the hand...:)|pg||
nt|kit: won't matter -- he would bid slam opposite that also|pg||
nt|007 joosth: East has a powerhouse  for the bidding up to now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: passes get me every time|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|friggi: that goes without saying|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or it did at one time|pg||
nt|kit: Now queen ask 5@H|pg||
nt|kit: If he thinks he is losing the match, he might not bother with queen ask -- I'll bet that is what he is trying to estimate.|pg||
nt|santyclz: You are encouraging all the men in the audience...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: funny|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Boyd shows pretty bad hand with 4@H I believe|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S is RKC I think -- 5@D 2 no queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|joest: even with that lead, I still don't see how this makes|pg||
nt|kit: And Robinson doesn't like his Ax of clubs -- well judged|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: but nothing looks very good|pg||
nt|friggi: hoping for godd layout|pg||
nt|friggi: good|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe safetyplay in hearts now?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: something must have gone amiss in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: no need for safety play in 4@H|pg||
nt|kit: in 5@H, would take safety play|pg||
nt|kit: And he didn't ask -- either just judged he would guess it, or was looking for swing at about 50% odds|pg||
nt|barnets: same lead would have been interesting on a trump|pg||
nt|barnets: to see what dec did|pg||
nt|kit: Good slam -- needs heart pickup or club finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: declarer would have taken a long time :)|pg||
nt|kit: Passell looking for safest line -- remember, he doesn't know trumps are splitting|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it ever possible to punish the 3@C call after finding 9 card @H fit?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, depending on your agreements|pg||
nt|kirp:  some handling to do, but looks like should make it,|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|007 joosth: Wold was bidding with nothing    IF he has only 5card?    lol|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well done by Disa, now don't need a 3rd club trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|007 joosth: 1 more sp ruff i think|pg||
nt|kit: Some play double by South penalties -- I think Boyd-Robinson play it shows shortness|pg||
nt|kirp:  the overtrick comes back|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Now with trumps 3-2, he can safely ruff club, draw last trump, heart to ace, heart -- making unless North has QJxx of hearts which is impossible|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's not very much to the play of this hand despite the bad trump break and the K@s being off side|pg||
nt|007 joosth: some pressure on D now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|007 joosth: on S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: i don't see it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slim chance that Kozlove has @SQ   but not sure if there's any way to benefit even from that |pg||
nt|kit: there is an existing double squeeze, but he will just take club finesse.|pg||
nt|warrens:  if Lynch is going to have a chance to pull this out, Sutherlin will need to find a way to make this|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not yet:)|pg||

nt|ntmon: huge lead, 25:4 so far|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  This is the board, where you can - bis mistake - bid 3 NT. Easy make|pg||
nt|ntmon: five push boards in a row|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  I'm a crawling Stayman bidder|pg||

nt|ntmon: bid in the same second|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 1 @H alerted - transfer, 2@C not alerted bur cannot be natural, |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|kit: Should Lair pass 2@D?  I think so.  4 diamonds more likely than 2.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|runnerup: well found -minors are not easy to be found because they can be sorter than 4 when opened|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: this would not work if W had anything in @Hs|pg||
nt|tihana: if Jacob switches to !J after club holds?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  Its a question, I think, of how likely opener is to have two major suit doubletons|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tihana: diamond jack|pg||

nt|007 joosth: d|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in USA1 Final  thru 67 [of 90]  Schwartz leads Lynch by 22|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps, 15 to go.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: actually it was suggested to me after drawing trumps to cross to a diamond and lead a heart to the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: I like to play pass = a control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|kirp:  They have upgraded to 15-17 looks like|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that looks like 17     they must have changed the card|pg||
mb|1N|nt|joest: north-south witha preposterous result in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 11-15, 5+@S|pg||
nt|kit: may see multi here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is consistent with Lynch not opening 1N earlier|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|ahollan1: loser of that match gets the night off then tomorrow plays 60 boards against winner of our match to become USA2|pg||
nt|friggi: what is the point to show penalty?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force  as you see could be balanced with [i think] 2+@C|pg||
nt|barnets: North if he has the ace may not play one back|pg||
nt|barnets: or less likely may duck |pg||
nt|kit: 2NT overcall, then either 3NT or Stayman which will get to 4-4 heart fit. |pg||
nt|kirp:  Gerbers??|pg||
mb|2N|nt|007 joosth: i dont understand 2NT|pg||
nt|joest: sanity returns|pg||
nt|kit: not sure what restrictions of 2@C are -- but he has to bid something, and 2@H would show 5|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine Bates has 3@H splinter here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alway FG   either nat or bal|pg||
nt|ady: flat result with little interest|pg||
nt|ady: unless e/w get too high|pg||
nt|kit: a splinter will cause Wold to go low|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a splinter will discourage E completely|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: little interest?     i think interesting to see how top partnerships handle these bidding situation|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds like  a slightly better shot than 50-50|pg||
nt|kirp:  best to play all your methods after 2N opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: South may think about offering NT with so much secondary values|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt is excellent, 4@H is down|pg||
nt|007 joosth: oops  I can stay|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Woolsey was not desparate at this moment with a double:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roman responses  so 4@D=0/3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps would be 03, 14, 2  and some add 4th step of 2 + extras|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D now makes it tough|pg||
mb|3D|nt|friggi: 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: I agree.  Almost no such thing as hand with little interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decided NOT to splinter -- that can be dangerous|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: yes|pg||
nt|kirp:  easier to remember that way, since you dont know his suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force  2@H=6+|pg||
nt|ady: kib pointed out 4@S might go down on a heart lead   and club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  a @s lead may make this 3NT contract very awkward|pg||
nt|007 joosth: this will promise a stopper  so 3NT comes closer   again an ugly game|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can see a lot of of hts will make for e/w |pg||
nt|kirp:  OK who can find a @H lead after that auction|pg||
nt|kit: Wold will bid 3@S, of course, and then we will see what Bates does|pg||
nt|friggi: lack of Aces should trigger 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well it might make|pg||
nt|joest: both north-souths have hit a rough patch these last two boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 3@D denies 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker referred to "shirley doubles" a character he had who often doubled with trump void|pg||
nt|barnets: would you bid 3@H or pass ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass seems like large position to take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 aces, 1 king   but is that the info that Lynch needed?|pg||
nt|kirp:  I suppose with 3A's and no K's you might stop in 5N!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and regret missing some excellent minor suit slams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it would have been reasonable to bid 1N-6N  or  1N-4@C//4@D-6N|pg||
nt|kirp:  along with Texas, i use 4S as balanced 44 minors slam invitation at least|pg||
nt|kirp:  which fits this hand perfectly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but why invite?|pg||
nt|kirp:  invite or better, maybe to a grand if key-cards are there|pg||
nt|kirp:  not sure what the hold up is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point they should be in slam force   so there should be a way to investigate minor vs nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the key is  --   when you ask for aces/kings  you have to have a plan   or don't ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but N won't find that|pg||
nt|kirp:  Made 5 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hands like this make me wonder how game would change if we counted honors|pg||
nt|kirp:  Would u overcall with E's hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to play in Women's USA1 final   Moss leads Sprung by 37    Women's USA2 "SemiFinal"  Joel now leading Westheimer  by 6  with 7 boards to play|pg||
nt|kit: This is non-serious slam try I believe|pg||
nt|kit: Spades are definitely set as trumps|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sure|pg||
nt|kit: Everything works on this hand, but declarer may have nervous moments|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: this was not exactly how i thought it would work|pg||
nt|joest: ok now this is REALLY ridiculous!|pg||
nt|joest: I mean there is no other word for it|pg||
nt|007 joosth: sorry i think i'm commentator of a different game.   i dont understand 2NT nor 3H if thats natural|pg||
nt|007 joosth: Lawrence advises that 2H maybe only 5card   clearly a different school|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only by 1 card|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kit: On spade led he will play 9, and Boyd will have to work out not to play queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  now it's easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Howard...good to see you surviving this roller coaster:)|pg||
nt|hackenbush: pretty tame set so far|pg||
nt|hackenbush: after bd 34|pg||
nt|007 joosth: thats better|pg||
nt|kirp:  this should be fast|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT would have been in jeopardy on diamond lead -- declarer would have to guess which ace to knock out first.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should be diamond lead, heart shift|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like -1, but I would prefer to be in 3nt by W.  sometimes they lead their suit.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|007 joosth: although....2Nt is crazy in my opinion|pg||
nt|joest: AKQ may all go on trick 1!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not    4@D did not say anything about serious/non-serious slam interest -- just a cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quick claim???|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N was still a possible contract|pg||
nt|007 joosth: i think my grandma can make this|pg||
nt|kirp:  looks like @C ruff holds it to 4|pg||
nt|kit: Not too difficult -- playing queen is right only if Robinson has AK, which is impossible|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: lead right for defence to have a chance|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, on heart lead and club shift, could easily go down -- and that is the logical defense|pg||
nt|friggi: after 3@S slam was not the case|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: a kib suggested ducking the 10 of hearts!|pg||
nt|ady: played the other way up in OR   diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe too obvious, but worth thinking about|pg||
nt|friggi: good point|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: 5@H is Smith -- says doesn't like spades|pg||
nt|kit: Play really snail's pace in other room -- on board 34!|pg||
nt|warrens:  or a @s from the Ace|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: Here it comes -- but which club will Boyd shift to?|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer ducks 10@H  cannot south still play the ace and switch to a club?|pg||
nt|friggi: still 11|pg||
nt|kit: And will Bates believe it?|pg||
nt|friggi: no|pg||
nt|puncher99: lo  club lead best|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but defender doesn't know that third heart trick might be needed|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|007 joosth: spade 6:  but I like them?  :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: but south may well smell a reat if declarer ducked the 10@H|pg||
nt|friggi: def has to be creative Kit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hackenbush: not sure desperation was called for on lead when they're getting a bad trump break|pg||
pc|d2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|007 joosth: why does N not lead a suit that will be possed by S?|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer might not be sure spades are 4-4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kirp:  please, lets have some fun and run trix|pg||
nt|kirp:  club/heart squeeze in case, wont take long|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: why a rat?  All they would know is declarer has a stiff heart.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest: presumably Roger is thinking about following suit :)|pg||

nt|henryb:  Many of us are not convinced of 3N gambling as a good bid, because if 3N is right the wrong person will be playing it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I open 1@c with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weichsel is thinking -- maybe of raising, maybe wondering if 4@D is conventional|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and rebid 2@c and 3@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@c if indicated|pg||
nt|henryb:  to show the solid suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and that must have been what|pg||
nt|stc: S noticed that all cards are good for declarer in this match|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||

nt|007 joosth: though thefence will not win prizes  this must be a big swing for NS|pg||
nt|joest: I am shocked at the open room result I must admit|pg||
nt|joest: 33 highs and they don't get past 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: and with both kings offside that was the winning move|pg||
nt|joest: not to mention spades 4-2|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would expect some more discipline at this age|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps the players are taking a break|pg||
nt|joest: anyway I am betting that Wold and Bates bid a slam her|pg||
nt|joest: here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably|pg||
nt|kirp:  Many would|pg||
nt|barnets: south had to follow to 2 spades allowing dec 2 pitches and his ruff|pg||
nt|kit: they will speed up a bit probably -- some easy hands coming up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 72 of 96   in Women's USA2   Joel +40  over Sprung|pg||
nt|fabsayc: robinson opened 3NT now in 5@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  pretty lucky to make 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: time to play in the worse trump suit?|pg||
nt|baldfriede: yes, in round 1|pg||
nt|kit: So that boring hand wasn't so boring after all -- many interesting features, both in bidding and play|pg||
nt|friggi: p|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 6Nt looks great  but very unlucky|pg||
nt|sybarra: like to hear 2 @S, constructive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW 2@C opener = 6+@C|pg||
nt|kirp:  that seems to be the Precision fashion these days, 2@C maust have 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike original Precision and current Polish Club players who can have 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are transfers on after 1@H overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table still on 23|pg||
mb|1S|nt|007 joosth: 2 loosing finesses,  spades 42  and no squeeze|pg||
nt|007 joosth: with open cards even 4S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Asian Zone & New Zealand Precision players still include 5@C 4M|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow  the other room got the @C ruff|pg||
nt|kit: Boyd better pass -- if he bids, they will get too high|pg||
nt|kit: Another slam -- but this one is just too easy to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yes you might survive in hearts|pg||
nt|hackenbush: open room led trump vs 4@s|pg||
nt|kirp:  Puts too much pressure on 1@D opening, in my opinion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but makes 2@C opener a much more powerful tool|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|kit: 1@D response will show hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|007 joosth: maybe with open cards an endply?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok,  he may be getting ready to bid 3 sp,  3 card limit raise |pg||
nt|friggi: he took you advice|pg||
nt|kit: Robinson will bid 1NT, and Wold might or might not bid 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: And I think Boyd bid 1@H showing 3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this type of auction is the biggest flaw in standard, and they could have avoided|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  thats exciting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice BAM result|pg||
nt|friggi: forcig now|pg||
nt|kit: guess 4-card spade suit has priority|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@d=singleton somewhere, not a minimum?|pg||
nt|kit: probably -- I don't know their coding|pg||
nt|kit: Sutherlin likely to just bid RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|kirp:  made only 4|pg||
nt|friggi: negative|pg||
nt|barnets: a heart was led v 3N in the open|pg||
nt|kit: although I don't understand why|pg||
nt|warrens:  neither do I|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: they had both 1@H and 2@C opening available|pg||
nt|warrens:  that should mean another 3 imps for Lynch|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this will still be an excellent result for Sprung|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 4NT looks pretty automatic|pg||
nt|kit: very lucky 3NT make in other room -- 3-3 in both red suits and king of diamonds onside -- all needed to get 3 diamonds, 4 hearts, 2 spades|pg||
nt|ady: how can they get too high if Boyd responds   3NT unbeatable   and bid in OR|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT by Boyd takeout|pg||
nt|warrens:  since if partner were 4-4 in the majors, couldn't he bid 1@S over 1@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not much change in womens  thru 57 of 96   Joel over Sprung by 37|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hackenbush: yes when partner showed values|pg||
nt|sybarra: chose to be conservative |pg||
nt|sybarra: on the lay out that works |pg||
nt|kirp:  Wrong sided this one|pg||
nt|kirp:  Still has 9 trix, as @Hs are 4 4|pg||
nt|friggi: poker bid|pg||
nt|ady: I agree lucky|pg||
nt|kit: well, too high in theory :)|pg||
nt|barnets: when dec finessed diamonds east won and cleared hearts|pg||
nt|kit: it would seem that way Warren|pg||
nt|kirp:  In my style I would rebid 1N with S hand, 1@S with more unbal shape or weal dbleton |pg||
nt|kit: I guess this shows a singleton club, since that is what he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|hackenbush: this was beatable on an unlikely @c or @dA lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Declared gets the lead she needed to make this|pg||
nt|hackenbush: bye for now, hope the internet connection gets better!|pg||
nt|andyv:  a club lead would have set this|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye Howard|pg||
nt|007 joosth: even that I dont believe|pg||
nt|kirp:  Thoughtful lead, hoped to find 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier on their auction|pg||
nt|barnets: thats not best for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: on this hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  if this shows a stiff @C, surely RKC now|pg||
nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: down 5?|pg||
nt|kirp:  weak dbleton in 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many show the shortnes with special coding  and sometimes there's room to clarify void vs singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this may have been a mixup here -- not sure|pg||
nt|kit: So now Boyd has bid 3 suits, perfect way to describe 4-3-3-3 :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@c was precision|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 3S seems right    even with the good clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: comes from spending time with Kit Woolsey  --  essentially  if you can't lead your 5 card suit -- try to find partner's|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson would have chosen 3@C on xx if 2NT offered a choice.|pg||
nt|barnets: still not home though |pg||
nt|barnets: yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 1@h was probably artificial|pg||
nt|007 joosth: only an agressive diamond lead will bring the slam?|pg||
nt|joest: when I firrst started bridge the auction would have gone 2NT-6NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 23 was also then to much for 2NT?|pg||
nt|joest: 22-24|pg||
nt|007 joosth: ok|pg||
nt|joest: old old days|pg||
nt|007 joosth: lol|pg||
nt|007 joosth: at least you made it|pg||
nt|kirp:  intersting theory, always attack with 5-card suit|pg||
nt|kirp:  In CR, the splinter sort of gave it away|pg||
nt|friggi: 2NT was out of touch|pg||
nt|santyclz: The presumed @d shortage makes n's hand look like gold.|pg||
nt|kirp:  @D lead would be better aganst 1N, even tho declarer rates to have some|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: They did well enough to stay out of game, but even 3@H looks like it will fail|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, he convinced Passell that he only had 1 @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and which one would you lead?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: This lead gives them a chance -- transfers do help sometimes|pg||
nt|kit: I'm told that 3@D is any non-min, 3@H asks, coding is balanced, some void for first 2 steps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: However, it does look like 3@C will power home-- still a 7 IMP loss|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|joest: the slow boat but they got there|pg||
nt|joest: one of the black tens|pg||
nt|007 joosth: club is best i think|pg||
nt|kirp:  Cant trust these guys|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest: not if dummy has AJ8x and declarer has Kxx|pg||
nt|joest: spade is safer|pg||
nt|007 joosth: not when you change the 7 and 8?|pg||
nt|joest: i guess a straightforward line is jump, hook the heart, test the spades and fall back on the diamond hook|pg||
nt|barnets: he may make 4@D 2@H a club and 2 spades now|pg||
nt|kirp:  4th best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: undoubled it is a good save|pg||
pc|c8|nt|007 joosth: 3C with Jxxxx  and now 2S on this very strong hand     how can partner guess it all the time?|pg||
nt|friggi: regardless Kit|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT call looks fine to me -- choice of minors|pg||
nt|friggi: after this action?|pg||
nt|friggi: still @Dðs|pg||
nt|friggi: no way|pg||
nt|friggi: as you call it in USA - a blind shoot|pg||
nt|ady: did 1@D opening promise this sort of strengh?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Robinson bid 6@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfe: pesky passes|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kirp:  Looks like 10 trix for declarer, unless we now strip and endplay N|pg||
nt|kit: Now club to ace, pass 10 of clubs, and no second diamond loser|pg||
nt|kirp:  See, no problem, its an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: I am informed that if Boyd had bid 1@H it would have denied 4 spades|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|kit: no -- but Boyd isn't selling to 2@S with a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: slow down guys  i'm still trying to decide if Wold should shift to @C at trick 3|pg||
nt|barnets: so this board was a triumphfor 4th from your longest and strongest|pg||
nt|eamongall: 0.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kirp:  Other possibility is to go for some sort of endplay on 3rd trump|pg||
nt|kit: wrong idea here|pg||
nt|kirp:  certainly gives N more problems|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense gets the diamond trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|007 joosth: 1S is ok i think.   no need to prempt here when you have both majors|pg||
pc|d8|nt|007 joosth: show up squeeze i think for -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  ignorance is bliss    in our auction  Bates KNEW  Boyd had @H stoppers|pg||
nt|007 joosth: maybe steal a club?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|barnets: big swing at this point in match|pg||
nt|warrens:  that works, but he might play for @S to come in and just play on trumps.  he doesn't know if Passell had Ax or not|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kirp:  Neither N or S knew E had 5@Cs|pg||
nt|ady: how can 2NT be a good bid  there is a good lay out to make a 3 level contract  and 18 hcp opposite  which he did not know?|pg||
nt|kit: he does know about the 18 HCP from the way the bidding went -- and if he can't make something, opponents can make 2@S|pg||
nt|kit: It is almost always wrong to sell out at 2-level with shortness in their suit|pg||
nt|ady: yes   1NT from north more like it   then Boyd can compet   I think as it went  a risky enterprise|pg||
nt|kit: particularly with none vul, when down 1 is only 50|pg||
nt|kit: passing 2@S riskier than bidding 2NT IMO|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: That is betting that 2@S and 3 of a minor are both down -- I don't like that bet|pg||
nt|ady: any chance of a stakc for a penalty of 300 or 500 when partner is weaker and cards not so well placed?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: yes. Bates will know he is down seconds before the hand is over|pg||
nt|kit: do you really think opponents will be able to double on this auction?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kirp:  now endplay coming up|pg||
nt|kit: But still chances on and end-play|pg||
nt|kit: He will try jack of hearts now, hoping for K10 doubleton in East hand|pg||
nt|kit: When that doesn't work, queen of spades, spade ruff, exit in hearts, and West is end-played|pg||
pc|s6|nt|007 joosth: then the match is very close again|pg||
nt|joest: Woolsey will take the lead here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|007 joosth: well  really unlucky for EW|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as long as east knew|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and very slim with them stopping in 2|pg||
nt|ady: where I come from yes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|kit: an overtrick appears, cutting loss to 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree Kit, that way he can find out if @S's break before @C's are played|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finding the endplay   rubbing salt in the wound?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks about the lead: "standard from feser than 4, or promises the J if from 4 or more"|pg||
