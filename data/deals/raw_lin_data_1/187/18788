nt|twcho: hi Ian|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|twcho: EW probably playing precision|pg||
nt|twcho: so 1NT is 13-15 likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: identical auction as CR|pg||
pc|h4|nt|twcho: Ian, what will you lead from south hand vs 1N?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Still wondering|pg||
nt|twcho: I am reluctant to lead a small @H from AK9x|pg||
nt|twcho: vs 1N|pg||

mc|7|nt|twcho: and 5 imps to Indonesia|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the largest pickup for Indonesia so far|pg||
nt|twcho: they have got a series of small gain in the past boards|pg||

mb|d|nt|ianmcc: good result for Indonesia in closed|pg||
nt|twcho: supposed to be strong NT|pg||
nt|twcho: Many don't play penalty double over strong 1N|pg||
nt|twcho: but seems EW are playing penalty double|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ianmcc: a form of suicide|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@h probably transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: south not sure about their agreement?|pg||
nt|twcho: why take so long thinking?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: or north may forget|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure about it|pg||
nt|twcho: anyway, they have landed in a sub-optimal contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: transfers are all very well in their place, which isn't everywhere|pg||
nt|twcho: they need to polish their partnership. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: luckily they still have 7 trumps all together|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: east shd know what is going on|pg||
nt|twcho: as he is the screenmate of north and he knows north holding @s suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: West a bit stuck after @cA|pg||
nt|twcho: and that's why he didn't lead his singleton @s|pg||

nt|rodal f: B23 3NT at OR. Will cost as here I belive. Was -2 at vul|pg||
nt|offthebend: so , NZ may pay for this overcall and keep opps out of a possible 4S contract |pg||
nt|rodal f: B8 OR at 5@S and here 5@H-1|pg||
nt|offthebend: 4S may have made on a non club lead though |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 10: West's duck of the @H at trick 2 was very good defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  a decent 6@s for N-S|pg||
nt|patricck: 12 tricks available in No Trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer play safe to get 8 tricks by refusing the finesse|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D is hard to bid, but an excellent spot|pg||
nt|twcho: It is good for bridge to attract more young ladies to play. :)|pg||
nt|twcho: it will make bridge more appealing|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: there are two important things West needs to know, the K@C and the @S singleton|pg||
nt|vbman: jump fit in sp will clear 1 doubt|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Chinese Taipei SHOULD pick up 8 IMPs on that doubled spade contract, Bd 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: 5H-1 had to be a loss bec 5S was cold |pg||
nt|rodal f: The Viking Club made by: Aa - Gr√∏thein - Tundal are only by relays if for a natural bid comes up some few times.|pg||
nt|twcho: slam|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR now start B9. The grand slam.|pg||
nt|patricck: basically just needing 4 tricks from the @D suit|pg||
nt|twcho: 3N on for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: In the Chinese Taipei Trials Final in 2010 and 2011, Patrick's team (oops, this Chinese Taipei team, I should say) beat a very strong team, most of whom which won the World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Transnational Mixed Teams in 2007. |pg||
nt|patricck: The North/South bidding might tell him partner is short in spades, but finding out about that @C honour is difficult|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: In the Women's, China having won world cahmpionships in 2009 and 2010 are the favourites, with Indonesia some mild danger I guess, and Japan are one of medal contenders. |pg||
nt|petergill: and North could have ducked @CJ|pg||
nt|twcho: but EW have a cheap sacrifice over NS red slam|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 1@S? 2@S? 3@S? much too strong for 3, IMO|pg||
nt|patricck: a chance if they bid it for Japan to take a commanding lead|pg||
nt|twcho: but of course it is almost impossible to reach such contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: not now :)|pg||
nt|twcho: not any more. :)|pg||
nt|woozle: paula will doubtless drive this hand to game, and it will probably be made|pg||
nt|vbman: if he feels to gamble|pg||
nt|vbman: must bid 4nt|pg||
nt|vbman: or even 5dia|pg||
nt|vbman: then west knows east has cl royal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Many specs who send me SMS now. Can't answer u all. Sorry.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT is a game forcing raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: B5 5@C will end -1|pg||
nt|twcho: nothing to stop east from introducing his suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: OR E interruped with 2@D|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm, a surprising bid by East|pg||
nt|vbman: i think it may be ok|pg||
nt|vbman: sometimes u make|pg||
nt|patricck: maybe that will do the trick and get to 6@D|pg||
nt|vbman: sometimes u save|pg||
mb|2H|nt|patricck: when the heart finesse wins declarer can duck a spade, so would make on a spade break then as well|pg||
nt|twcho: what is 2@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 1@h P 2@h and probably 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: 280 make 7IMP|pg||
nt|rodal f: The bomerange?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: How many just blast the 3NT with the East cards, opp a 15-18 NT overcall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: ther rest of the defence was fine, but the outcome for NS was very poor|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. 180 minus 100 ake 2IMP|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round China Hong Kong - China|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT has 9 top tricks, 4@H might be harder with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|rodal f: But non vul so a 9IMPer for KIWI it seems.|pg||
nt|offthebend: 3NT may be bid on this hand . 17 hcp and a 5-card suit is too good for 1NT opening |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision, 2@C clubs plus major|pg||
nt|petergill: when Precision was invented in the ealry 1970s or so and Chinese Taipei stunned the world by coming 2nd (or 3rd) in the world I think, Patrick Huang was a young star in that very ...|pg||
nt|petergill: first Precision team.|pg||
nt|woozle: Park doubles 1S, probably thinking that her lack of shape is compensated for by her minimum high cards|pg||
nt|offthebend: If paula bids game after this bidding --- hmmmm |pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: well. almost top tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: 'make|pg||
nt|jcwla: A few choices for S on the rebid - anyone pick anything different?|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW 28HP and all contracts down.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Now by a @C lead|pg||
nt|twcho: OR North perhaps psychic|pg||
nt|twcho: and buy the contract cheaply at 3@d|pg||
nt|vbman: this is even ok|pg||
nt|patricck: would East bid that with no honours at all in the minor suits? Probably not, so 6@D may have been a possible punt at that point|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Tough bidding problem for EW|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: 2@S Smolen |pg||
nt|petergill: GF with 5 @H and 4@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Will W see the big value at @S8 or does it matter?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tempo on and home by +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or as here. @DJ drop. 2+2+4+4=12|pg||
nt|woozle: Perhaps not. I forgot this is the women's field....I'd be shocked to see that double in another field|pg||
nt|patricck: well let's face it game is no bargain on the NS cards, quite lucky really|pg||
nt|vbman: 5dia wd indicate a cl royal|pg||
pc|c9|nt|woozle: 4H needs three out of four: heart break, DA onside, spade ruffing hook, spade break|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@c is DONT type overcall showing @c and another|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jjsb: North decided enough of discussion i want to play 4 @h and i guess this has no play |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the X from W K Lai noted to E?|pg||
nt|andyv:  rebidding AQxxx suits has never been a favorite...I'd rather raise @ss|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 5+ @h, 8+ HCP, GF|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner had either missing @S honour they could have doubled 3@S|pg||
nt|twcho: east is bidding to much|pg||
pc|d7|nt|offthebend: they have to find a way to cash 4 club tricks after winning a D - to beat 3NT |pg||
pc|dT|nt|twcho: for west, her partner is showing a powerhouse and she has ace and 3 trumps to support her|pg||
nt|petergill: AKQ109xx is not 9 points - it is 7 tricks, hence must jump to 3@D - rebid of 2@D is only for pointcounters, not for good bidders |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: @CK lead leaves declarer with some work to do, to make 41H|pg||
nt|twcho: but partnership has to agree on the relative length in two suits in order to find the best partial/game|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: Good stop by NS, but will the 5-1 break cause problems?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: west said sorry sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: after pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: I understand him:) Clear quebids|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: no|pg||
nt|twcho: I think they play with screen, right?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think I'd try and keep the @H support a secret|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if I didn't pass 2NT, then I would bid 4@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: now the defence has a blueprint of what to do|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not only did NZ not gain on 9, they lost 5, bidding 4@H but going down 1. So this one is all Indonesia.|pg||
nt|petergill: I would win @CA at Trick 1 and play @H, hoping they duck. |pg||
nt|petergill: West, being a passed hand, might risk 2@S over 2@H, at the suitable vulnerabiltiy for competing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|twcho: so the 6@c is understandable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|twcho: so NE are screenmates|pg||
nt|patricck: so if all those things were 50/50 propositions (I know they aren't) that would make game 31.25%|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: Perhaps declarer should set up the side suit first, which is usually a good policy?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|twcho: just one down and an excellent result for EW|pg||
nt|rodal f: So well pressed by EW by a possible lost slam for China.|pg||
nt|kerasidis: i dont know what would be the ended contract if Mak opened 1@d|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although, apparently the defence aren't architects|pg||
nt|twcho: a convention with just stated response is of no use without discussion|pg||
pc|s3|nt|patricck: with only one entry in the K@D maybe a @C lead is a reasonab;e shot|pg||
nt|petergill: Will he try @h after @CA?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: B21 ended as here 3NT|pg||
nt|jjsb: for down 2 . are we really suppose to bid 4@h rigth away Rodal?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wel, that's a good start for NOrth and he can x-ruff his way home|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't @CQ free there? Not the K|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had to dbl hook the @ds starting with the J from S hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  The interference made it hard for N-S to exchange enough information. I wonder whether S would have bid differently with @sK instead of Q, which would make slam excellent|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: A useful agreement could be for the delayed 2@S by East over 2@H to show spades and a minor, on the grounds that with only spades, East could bid 2@s directly over 2@D |pg||
pc|s5|nt|jjsb: oh well i guess yes ... EW are not playing badly in minors thougth so .. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Me. Never. 3@H always |pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: she seems to have 7 tricks even if she loses trump control|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: time to claim 9 and move on|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: the 590 will be just 5 imps to Fr Poly, with @DA the (unapproved, in my opinion) opening lead to 4@s undoubled at the other table|pg||
nt|offthebend: Yes CQ is better card and get the encourgement by west|pg||
nt|patricck: finding the good news straight away|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: The 2@D I'm unshure at. 2/1 and foring with color or rev drurey?|pg||
nt|jcwla: The third choice of course is 1NT but hard to think that could be best.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rodal f: B9 The wrong side made the ask but not finnished.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: oh claim 8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|offthebend: she ain't making 10 tricks any more |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: or squeeze S in spades and hearts, someone points out, for the overtk|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Chinese Taipei women's team includes two women who almost made their Open team, so they should do well too|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@HX at OR -300|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: B23 also at the table|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jjsb: i like to have some kind of shortness to play a 21-22 game contract even on 9 card fit ... |pg||
nt|rodal f: OK. Let them find it and take 1 IMP. 4 @H make risk as I feel it.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i would have double maybe showing some cards a good 3@h bid |pg||
nt|rodal f: Was the deal with ure mate. Cards or hart:)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: as long as east dare to introduce his @s suit, it is very difficult for NS to buy the contract|pg||
nt|kerasidis: would any one open this 1@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse the @ss and @hs, and 1NT is fine|pg||
nt|patricck: now cash the diamonds and clubs and hope that East is squeezed in clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|twcho: i would open 1@h|pg||
nt|petergill: With spades 3-0, entries to the South hand are a bit limited in 6@S, and one might have to overtake @HJ (if @H ace is ducked), use @H as "replacement trumps" to make 6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, RKCB would keep one out of 6@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: 7@S |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: @S ruff looks best, as East cannot have 6 spades on the bidding|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: Of course.|pg||
nt|patricck: for the overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|henryb:  A kibitzer points out that RKCB keeps modern players out of these 50% slams|pg||
nt|patricck: a bit unlikely because East already known to hold 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Now -1?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodal f: Same bidding (seen away from the hard 2@D) til 3@H. Then the roads splitted. Endstation at OR 6@CN |pg||
nt|twcho: lucky that south didn't double them|pg||
nt|twcho: so just a small minus for them|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Declarer is in dire danger. I think @S to queen and ruffing spades in dummy looks like a much better plan|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzek: =|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  This one was better than that after E shows clubs and hearts|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: East knows by adding N's points that N has @DAQ, so will exit in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, he doesn't know that - North could have @SJ or 1DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: or @DAQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West has discouraged @d and encouraged @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: K@D in Hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d4|nt|petergill: oops|pg||

nt|rodal f: B9 OR 3NT as here|pg||
nt|kerasidis: Rodal?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B6 will become a new swing. OR 4@SE and CR 3NTW+2|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: NS Talk about last board|pg||

nt|rodal f: A two IMPer to come for Singapore I belive.|pg||
nt|petergill: Happy to take 8 tricks - I might have settled for 8 tricks if vul, but not vul I don't mind -150, trying for @H duck |pg||
nt|vbman: machine dealt hands always have some kind of safety in them----- if u have a fit bid|pg||
nt|patricck: play the spades for 1 loser to make slam in spades|pg||
nt|twcho: it is unwise for north to balance|pg||
nt|twcho: First of all, they are vul and @d will be covered by any M and NS is impossible to buy the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: duly done|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so far no slam hands and this one headed for the 4 level in @hs and 5 level in @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong xfer preempts?|pg||
nt|rodal f: By the askes W showed @S color.     3A - @HK, but never the nice @C AKQ9|pg||
nt|vbman: if e bids 1 h it will be lot easier|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kerasidis: i wish i could hear them:)|pg||
nt|twcho: should S introduce his 2nd suit after 3S or the double?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 1@d Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT might be a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: yes|pg||
nt|rodal f: A part score to come again|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2@c opening is precision style of course |pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 also 4@S as here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I usually don't have a 4 loser hand when I preempt but maybe I should try it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will not go gently|pg||
nt|jcwla: Might end in 4@H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  since E didn't bid game, S must assume that N has some values|pg||
nt|twcho: actually if east opt to pass 4@h, it is not without chance|pg||
nt|petergill: My slip - i didn't notice South has void in hearts - sorry about that|pg||

nt|rodal f: Came|pg||
nt|rodal f: P|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If playing Stayman that can be weak, East would have bid 2@C directly over 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: 2@D ask|pg||
nt|twcho: if so, they may be able to push the opponent to one level higher|pg||
mb|3D|nt|twcho: and collect more money|pg||
nt|patricck: A quiet moment after all those games and slams and grand slams|pg||
nt|rodal f: As often at part score trumh lead again is right.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C is often weak, so NS have some work to do now, to reach 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: S are missing @DJ for have fynny cards here as well, but @DA10 can be droped|pg||
nt|offthebend: 10 card H fit but you can ONLY make 1H |pg||
nt|rodal f: Payout for some|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5@C+ and 4@S|pg||
nt|rodal f: This can be -2|pg||
nt|patricck: I would have been happy with a simple negative double by East|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same here, but there system might|pg||
nt|twcho: she shd just keep silent by passing 2@c quietly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petergill: To save or not to save?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Max was 3@C|pg||
nt|offthebend: it was hard to get to 3NT by EW on this bidding |pg||
nt|kerasidis: could ...but N could not imagine it is 6 card|pg||
nt|vbman: sp set as trumps quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B24 also 3NT but S to lead a @S and 12 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|jjsb: and we will probably play 3nt no @h fit and around 25hp thougth here its not the best contract |pg||
nt|twcho: this contract is destined to fail|pg||
nt|petergill: South should raise to 3@C, then 3@H by N?|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@C just 4th suit, not agreeing @S i think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: 2@H transfer|pg||
nt|twcho: so I add a "may". :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N would not be among my choices with two small @d|pg||
nt|petergill: A triumph for the weak 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S makes as long as declarer does not lose trump control|pg||
nt|rodal f: A two IMPer came as exspected|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D and 3@S|pg||
nt|vbman: next round maybe|pg||
nt|vbman: just imagine 1dia-2cl sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last round for today|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Pele uses fourth suit, presumably to choose between 3NT and 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: No relay so color. 2NT=relay|pg||
nt|jjsb: let see if they can find a better minors game |pg||
nt|petergill: Scores at http://www.2011apbf.com/Rrr2_S.pdf do not include the previous round ... Indonesia leading, Japan (Yamada) not far behind|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 2@D forcing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: the undertricks are only 50's, so no big loss compared to 2@S making|pg||
nt|petergill: Good dbl by N, avoids the trap of bidding 5 over 5 with too few trumps (even though 5@S might make on perfect play)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B22 China made 1IMP|pg||
nt|jjsb: nice lead |pg||
nt|rodal f: Now E will hook once more for 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|vbman: no way to go wrong in sp|pg||
nt|patricck: well, actually I could go wrong in spades|pg||
nt|patricck: I like to take two finesses with this holding by leading to the 10@S and then running the Q@S from dummy|pg||
nt|vbman:  6 or 4 better?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|offthebend: why not a practical 3NT with S hand instead of 4th suit  ? 5m/6m looks awfully distant on that bidding |pg||
nt|twcho: east found the good lead of @c although north has opened 1@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  so, NS play non-leaping michaels as one noted commentator speculated|pg||
nt|rodal f: Am not shure Patrick by a @S lead:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: partner might raise 2@S to 3@S; now 5/6 minor more interesting|pg||
nt|patricck: I get two finesses which is as good as anyone else, but when the cards are like this it is interesting|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, they don't play it (didn't see the dbl)|pg||
nt|twcho: now they may make|pg||
nt|twcho: finesse @s to discard the @h loser|pg||
nt|twcho: this is a serious mistake by east|pg||
nt|twcho: she has the @hJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rodal f: 2@C=5@C+4M this time and a vul game lost|pg||
pc|d8|nt|patricck: because although that line should fail with the cards like this when the small @S is led from dummy it is very hard for South to duck smoothly with Kx|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Or a auto after the bidding?|pg||
nt|woozle: What would that be? North can't have spades|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Can have 3 of them, surely?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: I think N can be endplayed for 300 instead of 500|pg||
nt|twcho: so no way for south to misguess|pg||
nt|twcho: and her low @h return is of no plus side|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|woozle: I notice that she heard about a 5/5 shape and still just bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rodal f: @C or @D to play?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3-3 in @C than that is correct. Drop the A@D than that is correct. We see it but declerer|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Look like play for Ax@D|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is in danger|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|twcho: although still makeable|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a club was the killing lead, almost impossible to find|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|petergill: 150 or 100 to NS. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25 3NT as here. Normaly +1|pg||
nt|rodal f: Best now a @D and small|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@d would have been effective also in shutting out the @c suit|pg||
nt|patricck: should lose just one more @D from here to make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 9 tricks, maybe 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|patricck: sirry @D and @C for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: Even underleading the spade at Trick 2 to @SQ would not have stopped the endplay for 300|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you prefer 3@H, Pass or 4@d on the East cards, Henry?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@S always 7 but easy for OR to end an other place. Don't know there CC|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: Reasonable for N to run. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodal f: -1 and not -2|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer was taking two finesses through North, he will be successful today|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h is a better contract but south didn't try (or didn't have the tools) to find their @h fit|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|twcho: the lead has given declarer the 9th trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Fav vul preempts as dealer can be very weak, and xx is not great support for running tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Not reasonable is South not raising to 3@C in my opinion. |pg||

nt|petergill: Hi Andy, Jordon|pg||
nt|henryb:  P, probably, because I have a lot of defense. But 4@d might be better to force the opponents to bid at the 4 level|pg||
nt|petergill: Pass 3@d as smoothly as possible, hoping South balances?|pg||
nt|patricck: lol, I don't have the excuse that English is a 2nd language :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so let go the impossible game|pg||
nt|twcho: it is really hard to predict the result. :(|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes N can be short in Hearts biut still needs very good minors and S card to explore a slam |pg||
nt|petergill: Kyoko Ohno knew from @SJ play that North had @S10, and expected only 3 spades for 2@S (not 3@S), thus played West for @HA|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jjsb: again i admit i have some problem to open that hand 1@c but well systemic so.. no choice .. here thougth nto causing problem |pg||
nt|twcho: while a @s lead will leave declarer finding for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is the South who just opened a 10-count and swindled a game...|pg||
nt|petergill: perhaps email 159 says that "Passing puts all your eggs in one basket, and raising to 3@C loses only when you can make exaclty 8 tricks in clubs" or something like that - I'm ...|pg||
nt|petergill: guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: B23 at OR is 2@S W. Can be hard. Here it was 2@D+1|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Malaysia - Singapore (Open)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 ended 1NTN where this room played 2@D-1. Might a double score.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: Perhaps 3@C by North, or 2NT by North (playable in 2 or more strains, else would pass 1NTX) after the Dbl?  |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some system chec and next?:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nope. Direct|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@D just on the @D finesse..... not making today, but 5@D is more likely to be bid anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@C didn't actually deny that though|pg||
nt|patricck: well diamond finesse and 2-1 break|pg||
nt|twcho: because defense has kept their communication in @c so whoever wins the @hA, they still have 3@c to cash|pg||
mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: perhaps he felt the gods were watching him|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that was the first significant card play error by NZ in the whole match - 40 of Indonesia's 41 imps have come from basic bidding errors by NZ players, such as when to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: game, how to compete etc|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should wind up in a thin 3N contract|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|woozle: Maybe 2C didn't deny that, but for me to be persuaded by a sequence I'd have to see how they can tell the difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Any for 2/1 and 1NT by W?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 at other table: Patrick bid a direct 2@C over 1NT at the other table (despite memories of the -1100 hand in the Daily Bulletin a few days ago) and NS at other table are on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: their way to game|pg||
nt|woozle: Park doubles 2D, and she's right - it's not making|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rodal f: 1NT one round force minimum|pg||
nt|patricck: at least that allows the @S ruff, so there are 3 tricks and 1 @D before declarer thinks about trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: so the only remaining possibility is finessing in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|offthebend: Pele may be getting excited and try the slam |pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 I didn't watch. OR 1@S NS and CR 1NT+1 EW. A doubble score to come.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D means that if South bids, you can start doubling, with confidence|pg||
nt|henryb:  If E had bid 4@d she probably would have had a chance to double 4@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Yes, that's reasonable - immediate 3NT (previous board) definitely pregmatic on South minimum-ish hand|pg||
nt|vbman: will balance and reach 2sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Japan (Yamada) team won 2008 World Seniors Teams Championship, beating this Indonesian team in the Grand Final. |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Sorry, maybe I have my South's mixed up...|pg||
nt|vbman: no balance|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 2@D forcing like a new suit at 2 level|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: For a photo of Wang Hongli, she's wearing the red scarf at http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/english/NewsEvents/NPUNews/84817.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12 was 300 to NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Does any lead beat 3NT?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hope 4@D is forcing...|pg||
nt|twcho: and this is also a deduction from this. Even if east tried @cA and another, declarer shdn't tried to force out @hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bad luck - @S5 lead works better|pg||
nt|petergill: @S( lead (0 or 2 higher) |pg||
nt|petergill: need to cover with jack right now|pg||
nt|petergill: would not be a good hand to play too fast from dummy at Trick 1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: That near slam for NS, where EW had there best at 5@C-2|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D still 0-6HP as u got from a spec Sylvian:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1@s is relay 2@c should shoulg a certain force ? 2@d is relay again |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 5@CX was a good save - 4@H would have made - declarer should play @HA then !J in 4@h, after West has shown 7-4 (and thus short @H) in the bidding|pg||
nt|twcho: because east is certainly the one holding it or else she won't play the @c that way|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Wang Hong Li would have passed 4@D, as @d length is a danger signal over 4@D - if partner cannot act with short @d, partner is likely to be weak|pg||
nt|offthebend: IS Kim going to Bid on -- doubtful opposite a passed hand !! East had to bid it |pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  not sure what 2@s was all about...maybe an invite (replacing 2N)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: What if N had 15HP with @Da and not J. Still 1@S and not 1@C=16+ I belive|pg||
nt|rodal f: Kiwi at the lead after B10|pg||
nt|petergill: Henky Lasut finds the right play, as he usually does|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jjsb: i dont know what will be bidding but pretty sure North will find ways to shows 6-4 and that kind of strength :) and pretty sure also this will ended up 4@h |pg||
nt|jjsb: ty operator :) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Have S forced for game now. Normaly Y, but....|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lost our commentator, ill take over|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will try to duck first @d to East (not West), in case @d honours are split - thus will lead @D from dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: @H switch beats it |pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Seems very likely|pg||
nt|petergill: E should be able to read the @s position|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|offthebend: Lucky for North but Prime AK and Ace -- did not cooperate , very timid bidding |pg||
nt|jjsb: i cant see any clear way not to loose the 2@s 1@d and 1@c (at least) |pg||
nt|rodal f: Right u are|pg||
nt|petergill: I don't think so|pg||
nt|woozle: EW don't diagnose the perfect fit, but to digress and examine NS's auction - I can't see why anybody would bid 2D if the most that your partner will bid with all working points, ...|pg||
nt|woozle: working singleton and a double-fit is give a simple preference|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time-saving lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, but I'm not a big fan of 3@C - I think Pass is OK. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|petergill: 4 rounds of clubs, ruffing with @HQ, would be great defence, but alas S was dealt an attractive @S lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jjsb: plus i have the impression the defense has a clear idea of North distribution |pg||
nt|rodal f: At OR N in 3@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C guided South to 3NT|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: Might look at what the result could be if 1NT was 2/1. At @D contract u have some tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Iexpoect Ace and anoterh @D soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Patrick pass or bid 3@C over 2@s at other table - any takers? Please guess. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: If a top sapde was led at Trick 1, then a club switch to lock declarer out of dummy would be great defence|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: Well, of course he cant see the hand as we can|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: South can do little else but continue @h and hope declarer errs later|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps, but when you have 6@s partner might not have been able to act because of lack of spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Too late - he just bid 3@C|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he's worried by the Kxx of @D possibility; then he'd need some black suit magic to get home|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but if you bid the value 4@H, the opponents might be shocked into bidding their @D game|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  on this hand it works well as W hand is too top heavy in @hs...but usually with 9 hcp and pd overcalling 1NT, 3N seems to be automatic (esp. when vul)|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that he knows from @H9 that @HQ is offside, N attempts to sneak @d past E|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jjsb: i take back the 4 loosers i see 5 now |pg||
nt|rodal f: B23 ended = ups. And 6IMP for China|pg||
nt|twcho: Indonesia recovers quite a bit by going only one down in 3H in bd 10|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: one way to find that defence would be that if declarer has a 2nd @H, the defence has little chance|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, I agree 100% with Andy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|twcho: good guess by north|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps a 3-4-1-5 ten count|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vbman: blew a few tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: always push to a vul game opposite a 1NT overcall|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: there must be some reason for east not leading his partner's suit|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@D might be possible, but who knows how the bidding would go?|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 OR ended as here. 3NT|pg||
nt|patricck: all on the lead against 3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|jjsb: East insure the down 1 and i believe rigth he is |pg||
nt|rodal f: U as me would have done the same at team.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 2@S = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jjsb: well not to be said u have to be a little "carefull" if east from that point ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: but i dont see any reason to play that Q @d |pg||
nt|rodal f: Must say that 3@S often is a heltier contract than 4@S, but it work and they need it.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|offthebend: 1S down 5 -- doesn't look very appetising to team mates :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: perhaps this is the better line, in fact|pg||
mc|7|nt|petergill: but it requires a (quite possible, not double dummy at all) top spade at Trick 1 to have a look at dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: so 2@d+1|pg||
nt|twcho: only +1|pg||
nt|twcho: still a trump to lose|pg||

nt|offthebend: Aussies may have to bid the grand slam on bd 15 to make up |pg||
nt|jjsb: coffee board?|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|andyv:  but have to applaud the result...good brakes by EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h seems routine for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think this is the last hand of this set.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A 2@S end NS?|pg||
nt|petergill: and South has merely bid 3@S over 3@C|pg||
nt|petergill: so the 10 imps lost on Bd 12 is coming back to Taipei on Bd 13|pg||
nt|woozle: today the EW cards are freakishly distributed and 5D is making, but with more sedate breaks it could be a routine NS game|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula was a passed hand so Pele knew she would be playing opposite 8-9 points at most - and may push opponents into 5D  |pg||
nt|woozle: All of these arguments make me wonder - if you're going to take this ultra-negative competitive position, why bid at all?|pg||
nt|petergill: shlould win first spade at Trick 1, shouldn't North?|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 1 !9 - J - K - A seems normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer was trying to safeguard against 5-2 spades perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 24 and non vul. Time for a part score as exsplained earlyer.|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next Round Australia - New Zealand (Lady)|pg||
nt|rodal f: B11 OR at 3NT and here 1NT+3. Need to find there @C tricks after @DH income at E. @CQ best resturn and not K as here|pg||
nt|andyv:  so thank you everyone for joining us|pg||
nt|henryb:  14 top tricks in NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or might LIM open. Y did|pg||
nt|twcho: the bidding by east last bd is strange|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzek: Next round Thailand - China Hong Kong (Open Team)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Agreed, you can;t (shouldn't) worry about what you can;t see|pg||
nt|offthebend: no no kieran -- depends on p'ship style |pg||
nt|patricck: 11 easy tricks on spades|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzek: after lunch |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree u. but 5@D could been bidded if the system was on. Anyway 150 and no looser comared 1@H pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems so|pg||
nt|jjsb: 1s 4 @s and next one ! :) (1@s is limited so i dont see slam there ) better not to give some help for defense (thouth it wil be the dummy) |pg||
nt|jjsb: now alternative of coruse is what North made |pg||
nt|jjsb: a splinter |pg||
nt|jjsb: well maybe im too pessimitic not to see slam there , my bad ...|pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 NS tryed a slam by 4NT ask and ended 5@H . Here it was 4@H+1|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to Chayes, our wonderful operator for doing a wonderful job|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: left 3 boards :)|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@H|pg||
nt|patricck: ?|pg||
nt|patricck: why not 2@D?|pg||
nt|vbman: bid 5c pls|pg||
nt|patricck: West won't pass that|pg||
nt|petergill: but with @SQ109xx, a top @d and either @HQ or another top @d, East might overcall 1@S, so I think best was to win @SA at Trick 1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: Three 16 board matches each day, just like the World Championships|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Full press for nothing?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok, I'll stick around and ty later:)|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H is OK. Ain't strong enough for 3@D=revers|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 13: Excellent 3NT bid by Herstein, now that I think about it. He hit a minimum hand and cold 3NT on low HCP - the game is about tricks, not HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S or 2@C or Dbl now?|pg||
nt|vbman: might reach 6|pg||
nt|vbman: no make off course|pg||
nt|petergill: No squeeze in 7NT, or is there?|pg||
mb|6N|nt|petergill: E wants to bid something, but what?|pg||
nt|twcho: after her pd responds 1@h, she shd simply raise to 2@h. That's it and you will leave the decision to pd|pg||
nt|twcho: the 1@s rebid is outright wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: he 15 ruul is a good one to use. If ure HP+@Ss make 15 u have for a opening.|pg||
nt|offthebend: Paula apparantly is an aggressive bidder - so Pele can hold back a little |pg||
nt|twcho: it describes a completely different picture to partner|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  should be a flat board with 4S, though possible for EW to get too excited if W makes a negative X of 1S|pg||
nt|petergill: If 2@s was a Range Probe, then 3NT would show max and a 4333 shape I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr all. 2@D obli|pg||
nt|rodal f: But might a CC variant by them?|pg||
nt|patricck: then it would need an alert|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Recipe for disaster|pg||
nt|tejjyid: You should bid the value of your cards as you see them; partner's aggression is THEIR problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: more could be said about the defence of the last hand, but perhaps silence is appropriate  |pg||
nt|patricck: bridge has many recipes for disaster|pg||
nt|vbman: east hand is golden|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: with @SK onside, 6@s plays well, but I think 6@s is a touch less than 50% chance, thus should not be bid. But I'm not sure|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C was splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: some (not me) say not to splinter with bare king|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C artificial game try, playing Two Way Checkback|pg||
nt|offthebend: good and lucky part score bidding by NZ |pg||
nt|rodal f: 140 contra 300 ain't good|pg||
nt|offthebend: can collect 500 now on good defence otherwise 300 for sure |pg||
nt|twcho: the 1NT is a miniNT|pg||
nt|twcho: 10-13|pg||
nt|patricck: oops, where are we going here?|pg||
nt|petergill: If Dbl is t/o by East over 2@S, that would be nice, but is Dbl here t/o or penalty?|pg||
nt|petergill: East can keep @HJ to stop any squeeze in 7NT. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodal f: 1@S=4@S+or 4@S and a longer color?|pg||
nt|rodal f: E have 11HP + 3@S = 14 Not a opening hand.|pg||
nt|vbman: 6cl|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Non know. But 4NT ain't bad if u find the @C|pg||
nt|rodal f: S need to pitch a bit by the @D. Still it's hard.|pg||
nt|petergill: 140 will be the outcome|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: on the previous board, Pele had 4! great cards opposite the 2 suiter; simple preference there cannot be a questions of "style"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: 3@H=4@S+and invit it seems.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: East, who did not open a 13-15 NT, decided he had a maximum, but 4@s should fail, with black kings offside and @DQ a useless asset|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rodal f: How I love minisplinter and splinter at team. 3@D from N=singel and @S support. 4@D=renonce|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|petergill: Website is http://www.2011apbf.com/|pg||
nt|petergill: EW make about 9 tricks in @D, perhaps 10|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzek: 1@S = 4@S 10-14 may have longer minor|pg||
nt|offthebend: If E does not Open the bidding , the hand can easily get passed out |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C 5+ clubs, 8+ HCP|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: 2@D asks |pg||
pc|c8|nt|jjsb: u can play on @h to discard a @c or play on @c to discard a @h :) i have more better card in club so im making +1 here :) |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D was forced|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h probably minimum|pg||
nt|petergill: I think West should bid 2@D over 1NT - it'|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: 2@S showed 5+ spades and invitational, denied 4 hearts. |pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 ened 2@SN. So might a new gain for Japan (L)|pg||
nt|patricck: declaarer won't be keen to finesse a club into the long spade hand|pg||
nt|patricck: What is an opening bid may be affected by the rest of your system. Another suggested offering is the rule of 20  which suggests that the HCP + the length of your 2 longest suits ...|pg||
nt|patricck: being at least 20 is a good indicator|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Still back to the splinter at NS contra minisplinter and splinter at team. Not match.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H response probably shows minimum, 3@C and 4@C natural, 3@C showing the 6th club |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430, 5@C one key card|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D asks, 5NT = @CQ, thus @CKQxxxx|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d asks trump Q, 5N = Q and no side K|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT also denies side king, thus no @DK, so 4@d cue must be singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they ask for queens below 6NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2|pg||
nt|henryb:  so to get to 8 HCP must have major suit Q|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: of all the recipes, 2nd guessing partner is the most dangerous|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|andyv:  with A@c onside, this hand becomes even easier|pg||
nt|petergill: it's virtually always best to rebid your 4 card lower suit over 1NT |pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: For profile of China Women's team of 2009, with photo of N and S, scroll down at http://www.clairebridge.com/textes/equipechine09.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is a fair contract, but will fail|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: 2NT natural, forcing, does not have to be balanced, asks partner to bid out her shape|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N at worst on @d finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Over 2NT, North would have bid a 4 card major, so South knows North is 3316 or 7+ clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: and probably has @SQ to make up her 8 + HCP|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jjsb: i think im making +1 also on playing @h thougth :) |pg||
nt|petergill: That allows EW to compete effectively |pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: Talking of "disaster", on Bd 8 Korea's North is in 3@CX on a small club lead, @d switch to East, another club. |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jjsb: its more "sexy" with the squeeze :) |pg||
nt|vbman: msut play for J10 cl tripleton first|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|patricck: and then again 26 ZARs is another possibility which is along the same lines, but counts 6 for an ace 4 for a king 2 for a queen and 1 for a jack as well as counting length and ...|pg||
nt|patricck: shortage points|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|twcho: a small pickup by Chinese Taipei|pg||
nt|petergill: and in 7NT, to find out that East has 7 black cards to West's five black cards, making @DJ finesse a vague possibility, the entries to the Sotuh hand would be used up, so making ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 7NT seems unrealistic |pg||

nt|rodal f: Esther in good mood?|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec told me 3@H was @S and invit by no shortage|pg||
nt|offthebend: In my opinion , NZ have bid and played better so far and scores show that|pg||
nt|jjsb: another 1@c this one the balanced hand |pg||
nt|petergill: The Results page has a Summary (overall scores) Page, and also the scoresheets and datums for each pair under each Round number|pg||
nt|henryb:  or @hQ. Which makes 12 even with only 6 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S failed on Bd 13, so 3NT rightsiding the hand was a much better bid than 3@S. Points schmoints. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round after lunch Chinese Taipei - Australia (Open)|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lots of imps exchanged this match with an unlucky 6D going down on bd 26 with a ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: S has to discard before W, so no squeeze|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rodal f: B12 OR NS at 2@H. Here 4@H+1|pg||
nt|offthebend: yes over 1H , 3D is limit or better and I think over 1S , 3H is limit or better without shortage |pg||
nt|rodal f: B24 ended=|pg||
nt|jjsb: on that kind of hand strong @c shows a big uperiority compare to natural system |pg||
nt|patricck: wow, I have just played it through and I find it hard to believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Tapei can gain a bit here|pg||
nt|patricck: a very good slam, possible to bid, but not so easy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. There are some different rules made up. Which to be the best I will not argue abought. For me I drive the 15 ruul.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|twcho: should be a pedestrian 4@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: *rule|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: This time funny card EW. Net's see if they bid the slam in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: 110, not 140, I should have written - I cannot count very well. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT good raise|pg||
nt|twcho: this is the 2nd last bd of this match|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rodal f: Puppet?|pg||
nt|twcho: still a very tight match with only 9 imps difference|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: % for it is bad 33-35% cirka|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT range is?|pg||
nt|offthebend: 22 and a solid 5-card suit -- no chance of a grand slam now -- at least I doubt it |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|patricck: Happy driving then :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Heading towards 6@H, which is a lucky make with friendly @D position|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@H is a bit less than 50%, needs @DK onside and 3-2 break, or bare king or maybe bare minor honour in @D |pg||
nt|duncan8622:  need a club lead to defeat 3NT, found at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C is the winner here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzek: 20-22 semibal|pg||
nt|rodal f: 5IMP more to Kiwi at B12|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 3@C puppet|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'd be tempted with the E hand to bid if I had some type of methods to show the majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  modified landy would work well|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: As bouth tables drove right at this one?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@S alerted Chayes. |pg||
nt|robbroy: careful defence needed on 32 so 5IMPs up for grabs to Malaysia to tunr this match into a small win|pg||
nt|robbroy: 2@S Ghestem?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Michaels we call it|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Next round China Hong Kong - China|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: start in 30 min|pg||
nt|twcho: I would open a weak 2 with south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: *Let's|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not Michaels not a cue is it|pg||
nt|twcho: don't know what is 2@s bid directlyover the T/O double|pg||
nt|twcho: most play it as weak|pg||
nt|twcho: and it will describe south hand perfectly|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Because 2Nt has wrongsided 3NT, he chose to play in 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: In particular, Patrick Huang at the other table has played splendidly, as always - age does not weary him at all, after 5 decades of being the supreme expert in this part of the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: world (he first starred when still a teenager)|pg||
nt|offthebend: Pele needs to Cue and paula may as well take a shot after finding all key cards and DQ|pg||
nt|super nova: 5c probably 2 key cards and the queen|pg||
nt|jjsb: when i start 2nt and other start with 1nt we can all see why 1 @c is better" |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 0-7 any|pg||
nt|henryb:  an effective preempt to keep N-S out of their cold 4@h|pg||
nt|twcho: I don't want to suppress my 7 cards suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 14 at other table: I don't understand North's Pass of 1NT - it's a bidder's game, and nil vul is the best vul to compete on (only 50 + 50 = 3 imps out if you're wrong)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|patricck: Could we check Paula McLeish is still at the table.... did she really pass on the North hand over a 1@H opening?|pg||
nt|twcho: partnership have to take the positive as well as negative inferences from the bidding|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  4th best of longest/strongest works as usual|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@H was some major-oriented bid (11-15), perhaps even a variation of an American convention. 2NT asked and 3@h showed what South had. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: effect the same now|pg||
nt|twcho: still buying the contract|pg||
nt|twcho: at 2 level|pg||
nt|patricck: I know it is red vulnerability, but......|pg||
nt|woozle: Certainly check her pulse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: This looks easy ... but|pg||
nt|rodal f: A healty one.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in our room N bid a silly 2N which forced them too high|pg||
nt|petergill: They will bid this slowly to 6@H, I think. I have no idea what their bids mean. |pg||
nt|petergill: Romex style Asking Bids in action here|pg||
nt|twcho: looks like one down|pg||
nt|twcho: and Indonesia will have a small gain|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rodal f: If 20-22 and 5@C with 22HP. Should S upgrade to 23HP. I mean it's correct but....|pg||
nt|jjsb: 2nt not fitted i guess ? |pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: and the cards are lying friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: very strange bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12. I asked. If 2/1. Or used it but ended 5@C|pg||
nt|twcho: don't understand why N hasn't supported south's @s?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: There's a good case to bid something on the East cards, especially if 2@S shows spades and a minor. The argument is that if you don't bid something, partner will surely lead the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: suit of your small singleton, which will eb a very bad start for the dfence, and you are not vul, so take the risk and avoid your fate defending 1NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: For any NZ fans out there, datums for NZ Open Team's pairs in Rounds 1-7 are: B-C +19, +14, +8 and -30, T-W -19, -13, -5, +24 (vs P Huang) and -18; B-L -51, -31 and -23. |pg||
nt|petergill: Good point, Andy|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. 2@C as takeout for majors|pg||
nt|petergill: How should 6@h be played?|pg||
nt|twcho: with east hand, some may opt for 1N overcall|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|patricck: I tracked down the system card. 2@S was a 5-5 hand with 5-6 losers|pg||
nt|petergill: Strip black suits then play @D how?|pg||
nt|petergill: how about low @D towards queen, so that bare king has to give ruff and discard?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: Ain't 2@S to hard if Michals? An obvious X and bid or if needed re open.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|woozle: EW need a diamond ruff to beat 5S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|rodal f: B25 ended =|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: a tie bd|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: top of the table clash between the two giants coming up|pg||
nt|twcho: luckily 5@c is also cold|pg||
nt|twcho: The overcall NT is of wider range spread and cover more distribution as well as you need more flexibility to cater for more hand types|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: Would you have inferred from North's faulure to bid 4NT opposite 4-5 in majors that @D6 opening lead was best?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|patricck: If I failed to take a bid on the east cards my partner would call a doctor to check my pulse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|robbroy: if michaels as in other room can be weak or strong - East has a free bid of 3@H to show a better raise in one room but cramped here|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|petergill: or should you cash @DA earlier, then if West drops bare @D king, use preserved @CQ to endplay West if West has @CK?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Or lead @D8 toward @D ace in case West covers with J109x?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jjsb: ok so its no swing here again |pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: On the club switch, one can play for AQ onside or for South to have Ax doubleton and be unable to get N on lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: 3@H showed 4522, so the actual hand was quite possible|pg||
pc|sT|nt|twcho: so we are moving to the last bd |pg||

nt|kerasidis: ty all guys!|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 13, the other table is in 3NT as Andy predicted, so it is likely to be 6 imps to NZ|pg||

nt|petergill: At other table, Kamto did same play as this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last Board Thank you|pg||
nt|woozle: flat board, but a missed opportunity for both NSs|pg||
nt|patricck: Thx for the usual efficient vu-graph operation Chayes|pg||
nt|woozle: EW down in 4H here...looks non-impressive|pg||
nt|patricck: and thx to all my fellow commentators for their valuable insights|pg||
nt|patricck: I think the West hand is a weak 2@S, not a 1@S opening|pg||
nt|twcho: so chances are there for both sides and defense finally emerged as the winner|pg||
nt|twcho: So we are now moving to the last board|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  5D reached on 29 at the other table for another 10 to Aus|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @D6 lead at Trick 1 is correct (looking at only 13 cards), not a double dummy lead. |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill: But risky daring stuff is not the disciplined Japanese style at all|pg||
nt|petergill: which won them the 2008 World Championship|pg||

nt|twcho: thanks to the excellent work by our wonderful operator, Chayes.|pg||

nt|jjsb: not ready !! |pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||

nt|by: I predict a push board |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: Of the Aussies, I expect Gosney is a certainty to find the best play in 6@H, Delmonte, Hans  and Nunn almost certain to find the best play with the slight extra chance in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|jjsb: moind u , Sout watched the vulnerability before doing that one :) |pg||
nt|petergill: Indonesia have reached 5@H on Bd 27, and look like losing trump control and going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Open|pg||
nt|patricck: ok, HL Chun thinks it is neither. I can sympathise but I don't agree, even when the hand isn't perfect I like to push my opponents around when I have spades|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  though it was a luck make, essentially needing doubleton J of Diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|nt|offthebend: thx all |pg||
nt|rodal f: As the spec shall have the same by there comment putting us at the sharpness|pg||
nt|jjsb: but this can create a little problem actually ....|pg||
nt|petergill: which should make the score about 51-10 to Indo for Bds 1-9 and Bds 11-13, with 4 bds still to be scored |pg||
nt|twcho: and thanks to all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board Thank you all|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  lucky*|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Patrick Huang did well to find the heart ruff needed to beat 6@C at the other table|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ths for inviting me Chayes. Been nice together with u nice specs:)|pg||
nt|jjsb: to reach 3nt that is |pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15, could be short|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: China Hong Kong - China|pg||
nt|robbroy: hmmm|pg||
nt|patricck: Thx Chayes for the Vu-Graph operation and thx to everyone else for taking part|pg||
nt|petergill: Boring 4@S to finish|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  or Jxx with 4 or more clubs in the same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: can we considere that any of the EW player got a clear stopper? |pg||
nt|jjsb: not easy...|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as @H8765 is good enough for 3NT |pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 4@s without interference from the opps|pg||
nt|petergill: 53-10 I think, Bds 1-9 being 41-1 to Indo|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks for u exelent work Chayes, as well as the comment from u specs ( keeping us at the needel) and TKS Patrick leting me beenig ure co commentor. Lovly.:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Last Board, thanx to Chayes for the excellent vu-graph operation, and to my fellow commentators for their instructive advice. And of course thanks to all the kibitzers. Without you ...|pg||
nt|patricck: we woldn't be here|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: South might have bid 3@S (not 2@S) at fav vul versus ctrong club (perfect conditions for maximal preempting) as 6-4 (or 6-5) shape is as good as a 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr:(|pg||
nt|twcho: this bd is more challenging for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|robbroy: Kop Khun Karp Khum Chayes|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: :)|pg||
nt|robbroy: Khun|pg||
nt|robbroy: tight defence required|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Tomorrow First round China - Indonesia ( Ladies)|pg||
nt|petergill: EW didn't make a contract in these 16 boards, bad luck. Thanks Chayes for good operating as usual|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = interesting - I would bid 1NT, but as they dbl on light values, they presumably like 1NT to be a bit stronger|pg||
nt|robbroy: bad start for Singapore|pg||
nt|rodal f: Why 2NT here? System faul? 1NT by 15 and....|pg||
nt|robbroy: they play a version of blue club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: B25 gave 1IMP for Indonesia.|pg||
nt|woozle: EW bid the routine game...now they have to make it|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D 5+ @D, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|alok_daga: NV VS V North did not enter the auction?|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps this sort of thing - attention to detail - explains why Australia and China are at the top of the leaderboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Patrick Huang would have played it right|pg||
nt|woozle: whether you win or duck the spade, you'll need the diamond finesse for the contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: and in my opinion N should remove bidding space early by raising spades directly, but his silence might prove golden, I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: and so it does!!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bit diferent style at OR and here. OR 2@S - 4@S. IMPs to Thailand|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: 10 imp for Thailand :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S fast arrival, weak in GF auction|pg||
nt|duncan8622:  slight swing potential here if declarer loses only 1 diamond trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Sucked them in. |pg||
nt|robbroy: open 1@S with weak hands or 4 card suits I believe|pg||
nt|twcho: strange that east didn't look for slam|pg||
nt|petergill: Deserved imps for Japan here|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the heart lead was right, because Axxx is often best avoided as a lead to 3NT or 1NT - the ace suit can provide the entry later. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: I think South can place North with @DQxx and might pass 3NT, even if she thinks there's a 4-4 @h fit|pg||
nt|henryb:  A less happy contract than 3N|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jjsb: sensible lead .. that give that contract |pg||
nt|jjsb: funny that both line reach a contract that both suppose to be down and that after all they ended up making it ! :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  N pretty limited by initial pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  so range was about 8-10 or maybe a bad 11 that didn't open|pg||
nt|petergill: NS will survive their bidding misadventure only if 3NT fails - how does 3NT go on a @d lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Chayes for his usual great job as operator. |pg||
nt|twcho: with such a good hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: An interesting point for a partnership to agree on (in advance) - does 3@s allow South to bid 4@s over 4@H, or is the responder to the 2@S preempt in complete charge, with the 2@S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: preempter being a disciplined person who must pass 4@H? China clearly thinks the latter. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think East has bid his hand with 3@S and should Pass 4@S, not double it. Then West will bid 5@C.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B13 ended 4@H at OR as here|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Last board for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzek: Thank You|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Win @DA, run @C9? |pg||
nt|henryb:  you own a lot of tricks: 3@c, 3@d, 2@s, 1@h for example|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: so defense has gone wild|pg||
nt|twcho: if north goes up with the ace, south's @s will be established before west @c|pg||
nt|twcho: and there is no way for him to gather 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|by: eh, ok, likely a dull board, but not flat ... |pg||
nt|petergill: Still on Bd 15: Given no !J lead from J109x, best play is @d8 towards dummy, duck if bare king appears, else rise with ace and elad low towards queen. I think.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: Not as I've seen but u're might right.|pg||
nt|robbroy: 3@S to ask for @C but count was preferred so a guess for N now|pg||
nt|petergill: oops, I spoke too soon. |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|robbroy: they have been playing a canape system for about 25 years - they may have changed but I think not|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: There were 4 matches today, so players are allowed to be tired and miss best play. |pg||
nt|by: more like 1 to INA, I miscounted.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: A coup by North gains 9 imps for the underdogs|pg||
nt|petergill: Trick 2 happened to be: cash @HK or get squeezed in red suits for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S wanted cue bids, he could have bid 3@s over 2@d to force them|pg||
nt|petergill: East erred slightly. |pg||
mc|9|nt|petergill: When partner leads your 5 card suit, you must pretend to have 4 cards and lead back lowest, so that partner is not tempted to duck South's doubleton, playing you for Axx. |pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence by West - his duck is correct in expert circles, as South has QJ9x - a shame that his partner made a small error.  |pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone who thinks West's duck is not good play is nowhere near expert status at bridge |pg||
nt|petergill: East must return @H7, not @H8. When @H8 was (incorrectly) played, West knows partner has A87 and South has QJ9x. |pg||
nt|petergill: and you ALWAYS trust partner to play properly, otherwise it is your error. |pg||
nt|petergill: although it is hard to create a hand of 20+ points where the duck is necessary, it is the right play becausde the heart position is 100% KNOWN by West. |pg||
nt|petergill: 100% known that South has either QJ9x or QJ9xx in hearts, assuming correct expert carding by the defence so far. |pg||
nt|petergill: South might have Q765, QJ9x, AKQ, AQ and might be more likely to go down after the duck. |pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps BBO's personal Skill Levels are OK guides, because specs who call themselves expert agree with me, and those labelled Advanced all do not see it - this is the best example ...|pg||
nt|petergill: of how a great expert (like West, Mr Yamada) thinks that I have seen for ages. |pg||
nt|petergill: sorry to carry on about it. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: If I was playing with Paul Gosney or Kieran Dyke or Sartaj Hans, I would duck @HQ. If I was playing professionally with a client, I would distrust my partner (naughty in principle, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: but I would be aware that partner might not know that standard play is to lead back original 5th best here) and win @HK and then give deep consideration to whether to continue ...|pg||
nt|petergill: hearts or not |pg||
