nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||

nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||

nt|brgpro: after @dQ ducked and a @h switch, he had to go 3 down i believe|pg||
nt|dburn: fast start for Couples - slow boat for China|pg||
nt|udo: bertesn took 1 diamond and played double finesse in @S,,,maybe antiodds after 3 @D opener|pg||
mb|1C!|an|polish !c|nt|Walddk2: Ah, that's why Fred Couples does not play in the US Open|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, as long as the chinese boat is still sailing...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: He is in Poznan playing bridge|pg||
nt|dburn: Polish club, by the looks of things|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: and South preusmably supposed to pass now, since 1NT would be 18-20 or so|pg||
nt|brgpro: now S will pass and W gets to bid 1NT...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: good defence will beat it by...let me see...5@c 2@h 1@d and 1@s perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is very often 12-14 balanced in Polish Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As her pass confirmed|pg||
nt|brgpro: but i woulda guess down 1 only|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7 or certain strong hands|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is Yan thinking about?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The nice weather they have in Poznan|pg||
nt|udo: yes only -1,,,,declarer can develop either @H s or @D S|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|brgpro: after 5 rounds of @c if N knows to switch to a @h..|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|udo: than west can take the @h and continue @H s|pg||
nt|brgpro: =2 or -3|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|pc|d5|nt|brgpro: then 5@c 2@h and 1@s already -2|pg||
