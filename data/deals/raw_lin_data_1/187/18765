mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: this will play in partial in @d i guess note that 3@d by North i admit i am a passer |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|danilo1: double dummy 5@D |pg||
nt|jjsb: that migth force S to game |pg||
nt|jjsb: and game it is |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: well i can understand that Madala didint bid 3@d to play 3nt ...|pg||
nt|jjsb: and now Rimstedt migth understand siomething is a bit weird and pass |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: not a lot of aces .. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jjsb: as it was point out 5 can actually be made but huh ... its just a scary contract |pg||

nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

nt|vugraphpl4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 2 segments o 14 boards|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
nt|baardolav: The bidding is near the limits now all ways and ended in 3@d NS|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5 @d makes but not to bid:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Two single red kings onside|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes 5@d make doubledummy, find the single @d king|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a cold 3NT.  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should make easaly, prob +1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hajru:  Is east mrs. Duboin?  |pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we need to shut down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we will back in the moment|pg||

nt|jjsb: danilo? |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|danilo1: 3NT for NS ... except if West does not take some action and end Dbled in 2@S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: note the opening of madala here ..|pg||
nt|danilo1: well ... 6@D on @HQ lead !!!|pg||
nt|jjsb: in any case we are now playing 3 nt as Danilo point out Rimstedt migth want to try to go higher , madala will refuse..|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jjsb: dotn tell me u want to be in 6@d danilo , i will juist simply not trust u :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jjsb: ok Rimstedt want to go higher not sure i see how madala will refuse that now :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not want ... but if II am ...and get @H lead :)|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: i have been asked why we dotn open 1@d with 9hcp.. well i just dotn , now if u decide to play agressive , why not |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphplf: Well, wish granted.|pg||
nt|jjsb: its just a cotnract ai dont want to be ..|pg||
nt|jjsb: but as danilo point out its a made now |pg||
nt|jjsb: actually not enough still |pg||
nt|danilo1: still problems - even on @HQ lead ... 1@D looser - need to prepare @H-@C squezze|pg||
nt|jjsb: rigth sorry guys |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Will a simple @C @H squeeze possibly do? I somehow can't see that.|pg||
nt|jjsb: i think that there is still some possible play if the defense not carefull |pg||
nt|vugraphplf: Only then. W would have to discard a @C by accident.|pg||
nt|danilo1: depends ... if E play @C immediatelly when in with @DJ - she will stop squezze ... otherwise , ruffing squezze possible I thk|pg||
nt|jjsb: double squeeze if u dont break the @c communciation i think other peoblem is communication |pg||
nt|vugraphplf: A double squeeze won't happen. W discarding after the dummy, thus the dummy is squeezed first.|pg||
nt|jjsb: the more i see it the more i think it just cant be made |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|danilo1: comuication problems ... may not have hand entry - so need to play @C finess immediatelly - will come to hand by ruffing third @C|pg||
nt|jjsb: i think (still not sure if u duck here West need to play @c to defeat |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||

nt|ntmon: this is Euro 2011, Mixed Teams, Swiss stage, Rd  3|pg||
nt|ntmon: teams corrently 5th and 6th met here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1 IMP for Lavazza|pg||
nt|tihana: slamish hands on NS|pg||
nt|tihana: and unfortune break in hs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here close 28-29|pg||
mb|1S|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
nt|baardolav: pony 29, calandra 28|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2 nt showing - 15-17?|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure, they might play strong club too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibbitzers told me - they play Polish club|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|baardolav: Sementa hit the best lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||
nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: morning danilo|pg||
nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: am I in the right room:)?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||

pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: dunno are u|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: Yan on money|pg||
nt|jbgood: the light interference next door seems to have made it impossible for NS to find out they wer cold for slam on a decent layout...|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jaapfr: cu:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good contract obviously hands too flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  30-28 now|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
mb|2H|an|NF|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the now-normal 4-1 break. seems to me these days you have to cater for a 4-1 break and bid accordibly|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s now for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S - for the lead partner|pg||
nt|baardolav: Very light overbids|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not my style... |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to finesse the @d Q to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: and get rid of one club from the closed hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
nt|baardolav: Calandra have some thoughts about this... Spade need to be 2-2 or H single|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 from s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: aggressive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, Dble by Guido was expected ... but not sure about the lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: making now with good guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: I still rather beleieve in down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why the long pause when the j is mandatory|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I could have tried something else" Lair: "did you have 5 spades?" Weichsel: "yeah" Boyd: "3N is down 1 also"|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 200 it was a good  desision to pass 1 @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: @h lead is a natural killer, takes away the entry to club tricks|pg||
nt|tihana: 15:15 after two boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so all of a sudden it is all square|pg||
nt|tihana: i loove this rooom|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weichsel holds the rare AK EMPTY ninth|pg||
nt|jbgood: the comeback was fast and furious|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  but the doubleton @d is a good sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: E probaply decided to show a major 2 suiter rather than just her spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tihana: i think both 3n and 5 cl make, yes?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|stc: NS may make games in both majors with some good guessing|pg||
nt|runnerup: brave 2 ! and + once again to ns|pg||
nt|tihana: @H and m i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have 29 hcp combined - and EW are already in 3@hs :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: polish style?|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like NS playing kind of Polish @C |pg||
nt|andreasw:  looks like one down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: Looked like it would be a dull board, but 4@S was doubled in other room |pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West later shows the @S Ace, East must have the @H Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s NO guess|pg||
nt|tihana: making 4?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: proving yet again that bridge is a bidder's game|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: seems as if NS should stay out of slams this set|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Why help declarer?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Might have killed K-10-x|pg||

pc|c6|nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|danilo1: not good guess in @S|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: not now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  There is a rule: Only ONE opponent can have @S Ace...|pg||
nt|runnerup: y a common convention helps to bid if partner doesn't delive that south bid his cards allready  |pg||

nt|baardolav: one down it will be I belive|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|danilo1: but logical ... after 1@C and 1@H by north and 2@S pass by South, more probable South has 3@S than North|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|ntmon: last train :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: Which may make - there are 9 tricks available but it is difficult for declarer to untangle the entries required|pg||
nt|baardolav: Gotart is not intending to do any mistakes and cashes the tricks|pg||

nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: i would say|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what happend the tried and trusted longest and strongest|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it will depend on whether they play in a minor or NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think they are in slam after this Q-bid|pg||

nt|jbgood: we dont know their agreements...|pg||
nt|ntmon: definitely not a low-scoring match|pg||

nt|henryb:  we are looking at 4 hands, Kit. I am surprised they got pat 3N|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ntmon: W in other rooms was more dynamic|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
nt|baardolav: well even easier... now I would like +2 |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: depends on how @H are played - but no real choice - so yes it makes|pg||

pc|d5|nt|stc: start with @s is normal, the A@S may be an entry for @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never seen so bad play - with such a good result. Now even an end-play against West|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||

nt|danilo1: @S9 is entry too late ... since @C is then 9th trick ... so declarer would on @C lead need only 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  13 tricks from the very beginning:-)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: i did say maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||

nt|andreasw:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1370 it is should be made in one flash when the @c finesse make... and K drops. There is not a play for 1390 because of single @d in east|pg||

nt|tihana: is 4h by Sabine an option?|pg||
nt|mareczek: better to stay silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with the object of either going down or scoring 90|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Switch to the @D King...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1 @H alerted - transfer, 2@C not alerted bur cannot be natural, |pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  heart lead ? |pg||

pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: who said that marek|pg||
nt|mareczek: "all in" lead by North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you or aristotle|pg||
nt|oosb: cant lead @s after the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  spade bid prevented spade lead|pg||
nt|oosb: perfectly logical @h lead, just unlucky|pg||
nt|oosb: more than one way to get to 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Should Lair pass 2@D?  I think so.  4 diamonds more likely than 2.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
nt|mareczek: both rooms opened 1@h with East|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|runnerup: well found -minors are not easy to be found because they can be sorter than 4 when opened|pg||
nt|oosb: but @D 9 seems best|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes.much better|pg||
nt|baardolav: No direct entries for the @d suit|pg||
nt|oosb: but no entries now|pg||

nt|andreasw:  there will be|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ntmon: finally a turnaround board  18 - EW allowed to 5@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: last one now - hope you have enjoyed as much as I have:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes, calandra needs a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks about the lead: "standard from feser than 4, or promises the J if from 4 or more"|pg||
nt|kit: he has down 1, but may take heart finesse trying to make and go down many|pg||
nt|tihana: tiny 3N?|pg||
nt|danilo1: waw ... both rooms played 4@S |pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosb: In other scores .. Brogeland trailing De Botton 22 imps to 60 !|pg||
nt|oosb: Heres the link to live scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r32runda1.html|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andreasw:  3 nt is on...|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: here ns must avoid 4 @s 4 @h or 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they declare a @H contract, E will have a nasty surprise for them|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|kit: At this point, Weichsel has in essence exposed his entire hand|pg||

pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: easy to get overboard |pg||
nt|danilo1: good stop ... 5@H may be in danger - especially with @HA lead|pg||
nt|baardolav: Have to see if @c q drops first|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d8|nt|oosb: He will play it out for @C|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcarroll:  yes - 2nd worst game contract - 4@S is the only game with any real prospect|pg||

nt|oosb: wow fun hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: and I said that just looking at West.!! look at Calandras hand!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 @h|pg||
nt|oosb: have to avoid the 7-1 fit and play in the 5-3. that's all :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6nt north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  west|pg||
nt|oosb: that is safest|pg||
nt|baardolav: I wonder what system makes the NT bid for West:)|pg||
nt|oosb: but I dont think it likely|pg||
nt|oosb: 7501 wont want to bid 6NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope 6 @h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: 6@S made???????|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats a real biggy n after p opensd 1s|pg||
nt|danilo1: 5@D or @C should be -2 (@H surcoup) ... but more important for NS is to avoid 5@S ... may be difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i think very difficult|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 4D?|pg||
nt|danilo1: As North, OI would bid 2@H rather than ev. splinter|pg||
nt|oosb: Does the BOA system allow us to get there? |pg||
nt|baardolav: A 6nt from east might be lightnerdoubled for spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: That looks impossible.  We are about to have a virtually tied match.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: both wrong|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4NT is too risky|pg||
nt|jcomyn: is now one dowen in 5s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|danilo1: still possible @H lead |pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes true|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Apparently S pitched a club against 6@s|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andreasw:  3@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: Boa will not make 6nt for west I am sure of that:)|pg||
nt|oosb: can be 5@S 4@H no?|pg||
nt|oosb: hehe :))|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: South wrongly discarded a club, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can't tell from the play. they certainly played 6@s on a trump lead|pg||
nt|kit: only 11 tricks even on favorable lead -- 6 spades, 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  the club pitch is not shown but that is the only possibility|pg||
nt|kit: 5th diamond sets up, but still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: diamond pitch could never happen from 4 looking at dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "3rd & 5th?" Weichsel: "yes, 3rd and low"|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and he did|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|oosb: 6-4 now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands should be bid slowly|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not 4 @h|pg||
nt|oosb: E might be forced to bid NT at this rate|pg||
nt|baardolav: Difficult hands are always bid slowly|pg||
nt|oosb: that would be 5-5 |pg||
nt|oosb: and sementa is planning to show 6-5 next|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or 6-5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|oosb: i guess sementa feels he can play 6 opposite a singleton too?|pg||
nt|oosb: perhaps singleton Q or A|pg||
nt|oosb: Very tricky hand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  apparently Chambers did pitch a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: whoops|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|baardolav: well... better than 6@s down one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not a good decision:-(|pg||
nt|oosb: I was thinking, maybe 5@H instead of 4@S ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes Baard.|pg||
nt|baardolav: Or 6nt X|pg||
nt|oosb: I wouldve bid that I think, suggests slam interest and 65?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|oosb: So a chance for Pony to finish off the match|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|oosb: if they get to 6@H|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lets see|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|kit: that is the only possibility I can think of, since North didn't duck ace of diamonds according to play record|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|ritong: he shifted to the @h 2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oosb: Meanwhile they picked up 11 more|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|oosb: in the last board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andreasw:  63 37|pg||
nt|oosb: where Thomas right sided 3NT and avoided 5@D|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: maybe south had wrong count|pg||
nt|oosb: But 24 might be some imps back, if 3NT is missed|pg||
nt|baardolav: 5@d can make double dummy|pg||

nt|oosb: 7@h -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|danilo1: another swing for German team board 10 ... slow bidding and as expected, it has been difficult to avoid 5@S ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh sorry thought it was over|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Don't anybody leave your seats -- there may be a big swing on the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and a small swing on this one|pg||
nt|jcomyn: need to keep my eyes open|pg||
nt|andreasw:  close now- calandra might get an little on board 27|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N is Lebensohl|pg||
nt|oosb: how costly will that trick 1 be now!|pg||
mb|3C|an|relay|mb|p|nt|oosb: NS were probably hoping for a nice simple board right now, but they've got another monster|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: big plus score for E-W, which will be enough to protect them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd wrote a long note about what it would mean if Robinson did something - I couldn't read it and then Robinson didn't do anything so it was irrelevant, but that's an interesting ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: way to save time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what a foul misfit|pg||
nt|danilo1: strange bidding EW ...looks like not agreed Dble on 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  what to lead???|pg||
nt|oosb: but once again, a comfortable 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andreasw:  only 4 imps now|pg||
nt|oosb: oops that will help declarer a lot|pg||
nt|andreasw:  63-59|pg||
nt|oosb: Had they made 6@H instead of 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oosb: they'd be tied|pg||

pc|dK|nt|oosb: By oops I meant it just makes declarer's work easy, NOT that it was a mistake|pg||
nt|oosb: perfectly natural @h lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Robinson might have bid 3N if his KQJQ were two aces or some duch|pg||
nt|henryb:  such*|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andreasw:  what willl board 28 give us?:-)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  think Pony is the winner and will go on|pg||
nt|oosb: Might be flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|oosb: but maybe some overtricks in 27|pg||
nt|oosb: 1-2 imps possible|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not enough|pg||
nt|oosb: hows 3 then?|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|andreasw:  board 25 will be haunting Sementa and Calandra|pg||
