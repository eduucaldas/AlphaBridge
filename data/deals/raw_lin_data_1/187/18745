mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  you always hear people at the club saying "I open with A, K, A (West)"|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gavin:  its definitely not a good idea to be opening balanced hands like this|pg||
nt|gavin:  in a normal 2/1 style|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  west giving leeway to easts 3rd seat opening|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|gavin:  a lot of pairs play 2NT as a limit raise in @H here|pg||
nt|gavin:  since there is no cuebid available without forcing to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|gavin:  east is considering throwing away a diamond here to avoid being shortened|pg||
nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||
nt|gavin:  and figure out if she can handle a 5-0 split|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: wlc  :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gavin:  west's distribution makes her hand a comfortable texas transfer|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  when both bids are jumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: not enough to explore for slam, so looking for best game|pg||
mb|4N|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|newmoon: a normal @C-lead gives the overtrick|pg||

nt|gavin:  more difficult when west is dummy|pg||
nt|gavin:  as T, J, Q, A doesnt really expose norths singleton|pg||

nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||

nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||

nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
mb|4H|nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||
nt|newmoon: East lets 2@S off the hook|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||

mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|gavin:  now there is a risk of your opponents bidding 3NT having never got your heart lead|pg||

nt|gavin:  as n-s havent found a fit|pg||
nt|gavin:  and now norths double would be penalty|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3NT reached in OR also, lead = @S7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|newmoon: 7@C - no finessing - ruff a spade in West after getting pitches on @Hs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gavin:  hard to argue with either of wests passes|pg||
nt|tec123: I think East would have done better to take over with 4N after 4@C - will be difficult yo bid 7 if West in charge of Blackwood|pg||

nt|newmoon: 4NT now... sets @C the suit... can now get info regarding @CQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gavin:  so south can assume clubs are 4-2 (west high lowed to show an even  )|pg||

pc|d6|nt|gavin:  ahh mor like it|pg||

nt|newmoon: wow, well done!|pg||
nt|newmoon: 5@S = 2 keys + @CQ|pg||
nt|tec123: Will need to protect against 4/1 clubs, so best to ruff two diamonds before drawing all the trumps|pg||
nt|newmoon: bd 9:  apteker (South) went 3@C - wjs - after North opens 1@H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfk: took it back|pg||

nt|gavin:  at some point in the trump drawing process|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: definitely played 10|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gavin:  the Ten ensures a 4th round diamond entry if they break 3-2|pg||

nt|tec123: Close to a cue bid raise - 9 pts and a probable working doubleton, but 2@S will keep them out of trouble|pg||

mb|p|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||
nt|newmoon: ignore me|pg||
nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||

nt|newmoon: what has West got that he hasn't already shown?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: was 4@S unilateral?|pg||
nt|tec123: I see 5@C made - looks like there was never a @H switch when in with A@C - 3N a better contract|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|tec123: Very difficult lead for South = a club may let it through though declarer can always make by dropping the K@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|tec123: With spades 4-4 and club right 3N can make EW - 5@C down as @H finesse loses|pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: oh ok .. see patrice like to overcall solid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||
nt|tec123: With 2 quick tricks East should pass rather than bale out to 4@C despite lack of @S stopper - potentially a very good result for Tunisia|pg||

nt|jjsb: good point |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|newmoon: an ace is the std. lead against a gambling 3NT... gets encouragement|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|newmoon: West made a "state of the match" bid... knows that up to now, they have had a good session in this room|pg||
nt|tec123: 4@H should make as well though as @H are 3-3 and the same club suit is equally useful|pg||
nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
nt|tec123: The 4-3 fit will play well here though I would have chosen 3@C rather than 2@S as the 1@H bid rather than double denied spades|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tec123: Maybe 19 & 20 will be swingy - still not a flat match as 66 IMPs have changed hands already|pg||

nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||

mb|p|nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||
