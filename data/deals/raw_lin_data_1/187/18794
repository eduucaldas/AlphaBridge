nt|eamongall: However he won't be happy as McGann grabbed the hand in EW at the other table nd is losing 3 50 point undertricks |pg||
nt|lml: always nice to make your first contract|pg||
nt|lml: relaxes the nerves a bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Trup-lead will NOT do 4 @H any good|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Trump|pg||
nt|dslee: Will NS reach 4@S :) likely no|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vbman: quantitative will save this hand or will end the auction|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess any score in, is happy at this moment in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|p m g: As a spec asked: EW need to do thing. They did at last board.|pg||
nt|dslee: good bid by  S- this would open dooors for sure|pg||
nt|dslee: lots of players fumble with these hands in a red vs white position|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Now South has a hand for 4 @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One @S more than promised|pg||
nt|dslee: surely - 3@H is good raise or more|pg||
nt|oosb: Part game in @S |pg||
nt|bobholl: possible 4@S but they won't bid it i guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vbman: dint like 4333|pg||
mb|d|nt|eamongall: Is'nt BBO great ... I remember when we used transparencies and projectors for vugraph presentations |pg||
nt|lml: 4 looks tough to me|pg||
nt|oosb: 4 seems ambitious|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|p m g: For them h don't know. At 2/1 1NT is force by one round |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The lead - 100 or 500...!?!|pg||
nt|lml: they can beat it off the top actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: good sac|pg||
nt|dslee: @H lead is mandatory while @D lead is tempting :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  @D-lead is OK - with a switch|pg||
nt|dslee: shoud lead @H , since S has a singleton @H|pg||
nt|dslee: not much of prospect for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|oosb: infact 2@S seems high enough, in 3 you might struggle to ruff all the @H|pg||
nt|oosb: and might have to resort on @c finesse|pg||
nt|lml: 3 is possible if you take the finesse now|pg||
nt|oosb: resort to*|pg||
nt|lml: and it really seems okay to me to do it|pg||
nt|lml: you need tricks and even if it loses it produces an extra trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzgz: stirbu said it isnt forcing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|p m g: If so here is a TD work.|pg||
nt|p m g: I will always recall TD now. AND E pressed to bid as it was no force|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|oosb: I dont know about that|pg||
nt|oosb: in 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
pc|s6|nt|oosb: only way to go down is to lose @c or @s|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Seems better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|edmunte1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|p m g: Hi Ed:)|pg||
nt|edmunte1: 1nt is semiforcing 6-12 hcp|pg||
nt|edmunte1: can be passed with a balanced minimum hand|pg||
nt|p m g: Like ure CC. Learning every day in Galatsi?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think its kettle time as both rooms declaring 3NT |pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont remember that - but I agree - BBO is great :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dslee: was wondering :) so -1 now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|edmunte1: yes|pg||
nt|p m g: :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|nt|edmunte1: a @c return could have been more usefull|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  No big difference, but better play to let the first @S go to hand - and then ruff|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|oosb: but I guess even if it loses you hope not to lose @S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|edmunte1: Ghigheci thought that double should mean a @d lead, but str is @s lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I will sit back and think about, WHEN a lead from Q x x x x x x is good...?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: there is a risk that you could lose 2 diamonds 2 hearts a club and a spade|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: @h?|pg||
nt|oosb: OR A@H onside so its safe|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: but you might need go down anyway in that case|pg||
nt|oosb: yeah but you do gain 2 tricks from finessing|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|blum1956: Probably it is a @h raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|woozle: No doubt, and a toothpick is a weapon but it's not really adequate for a duel|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: making now|pg||

mb|p|nt|p m g: 20-20 and no Roland. Swich JS to W|pg||
mb|p|nt|edmunte1: NS play 1nt 14-16, so with 17-19 they open 1 minor|pg||
nt|dslee: a  part score hand at the best for EW|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2 @s? :D|pg||

nt|lml: anybody know what 2@C is?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C the Dutch gadget: wk2 in @D or str any|pg||
nt|bobholl: bep (vriend) will bid 3@D i guess|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|lml: thanks |pg||
nt|oosb: nice preemption|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: via a double and some opps bidding and a small noise from McGann |pg||
nt|lml: east-west could end in spades now if East reopens with 4@D|pg||
nt|oosb: have taken away alot of space|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am not a fan myself, but it works against weak opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lml: opening 2@D weak would have much the same effect|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: Axxx of cl is xtremely dangerous for 3 h l think|pg||
nt|eamongall: they can get this but need to keep @DK @DQ in pocket |pg||
mb|4D|nt|edmunte1: 2@d ask which is longer|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|edmunte1: disciplined pass by Ghigheci|pg||
nt|lml: but if you use that bid for other purposes like multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: max pressure is my style too - sometimes weak|pg||
nt|vbman: must be careful with exit cards|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice bid by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgz: rusinov leads|pg||
nt|edmunte1: knowing that points are badly placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: target reached |pg||
nt|hawe45:  With the @H-ruff, there should be 110|pg||
nt|lml: east-west did get to the right place|pg||
nt|lml: and maybe the preemption kept them out of the slam they wouldnt make|pg||
nt|oosb: well done|pg||
nt|gulyas: limited values, but E knows he cannot have much since he passed over 3@D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Strange - but good - lead!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eamongall: maybe not so strange ... 1@D is @H transfer .. and Pass is no fit .. but I would not think of it |pg||
nt|dslee: these leads are effective when Kxx is on Table and declarer has the J and ptr has the Q :) and of course Jx with declarer :) here I guess the assumption of the lead was to see ...|pg||
nt|dslee: whether N has a Kx in the suit :)|pg||

nt|edmunte1: only 152 :)|pg||
nt|p m g: Y. Sr. by the tvr|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Expect 800 - as North double, not South|pg||
nt|lml: it keeps the door open for slam but says South has no particular interest|pg||

nt|oosb: double dummy you can make by playing on @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: but this seemed like a very reasonable line|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hawe45:  Looks like a part score in @H N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it is reasonable to play diamonds and they just dont work out for you|pg||
nt|oosb: unlucky to find @d 4-2 offside and niether K nor 10 dropping|pg||
nt|gulyas: but this all hinged on the @Ds being friendly|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lml: so we are going to end on what looks like another flat board|pg||
nt|gulyas: anyway, last board of the first half of the semis here|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: that brings us to the last deal here - thanks to all the specs who have been watching this|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  No comments - absolutely no(t)|pg||
nt|lml: a very well played low scoring game|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dslee: :) hans - you need to understand fiona and her ptr trying to get whatever they can|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will NOT do it that way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If the North hand can make game against a peaceful 2 @H-raise, then they must change the system|pg||
nt|woozle: Radin shows (due) disrespect for Mahaffey's third seat opening and does not double 4H|pg||
nt|lml: thanks to all the spectators for their helpful comments and to all the commentators|pg||
nt|oosb: Well done by both teams|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||

nt|woozle: in English?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt speak english|pg||
nt|lml: the teams played good bridge for us and the operator did an excellent job|pg||
nt|gulyas: the lead gives the 12th trick, may be worth an imp|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: and in this match an imp means a lot|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they are in 3NT on the previous board which really has no chance so maybe an imp or two will change hands|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|eamongall: what does rozdanie mean in polish ... maybe = deal |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
