nt|sybarra: dicey spade suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would open the hand also |pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||

nt|andyv:  interesting problem for N|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe see another 2 @S here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: final contract prob 5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: north leaps to what he thinks he can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the vul is tempting|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a routine 4@H |pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: west might have opened|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots od defence in the east hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably the right move|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: same auction both tables|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult play hand yet again|pg||
nt|roswolf: south takes the push|pg||
nt|pelu: W sh X on her 2 Aces now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the northpersons will stamp on this now|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a couple of lines and both work (duck club and, if no @h switch, lead @d or lead @s and use 2nd @s to pitch @d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I have to restart|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: South African Texas = hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TexasSouthAfrican.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I exp 5-level - wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|stc: with thje 10 @d in NS the slam would be quite fair - how to localize this ??|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brotherp: @c lead more or less kills the defence ...impossible to play the 9  it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can afford to lose 2 spades it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: logically should pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4-5 defensive tricks and pd did open|pg||
nt|kastan88: Previous board (11) all credits going for Bep Vriend fast 4@H arrival, must be good result for Dutch team, as both 4@S and 5@C are good sacfrifices against 4@H |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think NS will go any higher or EW will sacrifice in 4@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: are thw men sitting north and west?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: 4@s is a bad save|pg||
nt|stc: and they avoided it, wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: -1 or -2 |pg||
nt|pelu: 3x@D best defense now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: down 2 on best defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be beaten |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: need to cash ak in both minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: however |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: as has been pointed out, easy 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona: the heart J may worry declarer ..|pg||
nt|brotherp: well the @c lead took care of most problems; on a spade or trump lead this looks like an uphill struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 41 may be she thinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: than @DK is needed for 3d @S|pg||

nt|kastan88: Today we broadcast Mixed Teams. 90 teams are divided in groups of 6 and play a complete Round-robin of 10 boards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: with this lead one minor will disappear, |pg||

nt|sybarra: the hint not to lead a spade was the 3 nt bid by N|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: so from +500 to -100|pg||

nt|xenya: agreed|pg||
nt|stc: In team @c to the A is much safer|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this seems an easy grand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 was interesting as to what N should do...he passed 4@h but 4@s certainly had some followers|pg||
nt|sybarra: part score battle here |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong club in vogue here|pg||
nt|roswolf: no reason not to play in the club partscore|pg||
nt|sybarra: another 2 level contract likely |pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: despite the pre-empt perhaps not:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C explained as @D better(:)? than 4@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: can west do anything more than raise to 6?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D why not ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  big club fit but 5@c probably won't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@c a nice game - not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|roswolf: north playing in 2/3nt would be a travesty|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Oliver Clarke|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: but what next?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in a Mixed event i suppose predictable:)|pg||
nt|stc: in fact anyway @c to the A is better|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S on a @H guess here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: east is very minimum|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  very passive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: North didn't have a good opening call|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: jan will have to take the risk he daoes|pg||
nt|roswolf: no maybe @C will prevail|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, but did have a reopening dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how adventurous does E feel?  (not very)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt from north will put the question to south|pg||
nt|sybarra: wise choice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: if west is there with a punt - sowhat|pg||
nt|roswolf: well good luck comes to his aid|pg||
nt|oliverc: A fairly predictable final contract|pg||
nt|oliverc: Nothing likely to disturb this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oliverc: South effectively endplayed on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pelu: no some of the men know the game and can pass :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often though|pg||
nt|kastan88: how high EW going with their hearts 5@H or even 6@H after possible 5@S? NO, just gave up|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: on a @D-lead EW can take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, pass probably right as 4@s wont make (5@c was made in OR)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: my first prediction was right|pg||
nt|roswolf: still south may run the club Q|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by S and not 3@S to tell her hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north  i meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment peter|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but then he sh be in 6@C :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: that's true|pg||
nt|pelu: and on a @S-lead close to make :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: very close|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: run the queen or play the ace?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N did open|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 1@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: but bidding a making grand after a preempt is always a good achievemnt so well done|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|xenya: but 2N can be beaten with careful defence|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome back to Wiebe de Jong|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 1@S hand? in OR West open 1@S - and EW in 4@H -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like running the queen since opps sometimes dont cover anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not any longer|pg||
nt|stc: defense had 6 quick tricks but.... |pg||

pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: hmm north trying a psychological line|pg||

mb|4H|nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: cruel @d duplication|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 4@D = @s+@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 tricks should be possible now|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not on a club continuation after winning the diamond ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 9 to france ( was looking at OR results):)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: tricky hand |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|brotherp: impossible @c lead needed it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance of a club ruff perhaps|pg||

pc|d3|nt|brotherp: even on a d-lead declarer still has a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|oliverc: perhaps hard to find the J@C lead on this bidding|pg||

nt|petepunt: morning all|pg||
nt|ampelman: 1@c=16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: seems like 4@h made needs some defensive cooperation|pg||
nt|brotherp: which they got in the open room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the 4 hearts played elsewhere does not look that attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H X kostede 800|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||

nt|brotherp: 5@d really in the picture now|pg||
nt|pauleger: I won´t raise to 3@c here as well|pg||
nt|pauleger: though partner may have 17 count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jordan|pg||
nt|granguru:  excellent location of cards for EW|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
nt|ampelman: X=points|pg||
nt|pelu: only :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to have bid recklessly here|pg||
nt|granguru:  cross ruf can produce a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|stc: last making contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @D was the contract to be in but paulissens pass is understandable|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and another spec points out the attractions of 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 3rd bid for North,  but 2@H looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is spelt  Kuzselka|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 12 tricks - but only with @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  so a @D lead is this hand demanding|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Often the case on a preference auction.|pg||
nt|stc: was 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: over board|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt likely|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4NT feels the right spot though|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt pick a slam probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may have shown 15-17 NT now, if they play weak NT as seems likely|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no side entries, E might have tried to find partner|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit behaving, declarer should have no problems making contract|pg||
nt|ybob: by any player ,4@C , 3@H at least 1@S ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we get to see the play from other side now|pg||
nt|ybob: lead @H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this is more gentle|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think it will be 10 of ht lead|pg||
nt|ybob: only lost if play @D to A at trick 2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pauleger: wonder why N puts in @s4 with nothing in @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: And the diamond suit is also behaving for the declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely though unless south shows his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a long think|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is and understandable :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: s said he'll ask what he shows afterwards :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ampelman: 3NT seems to have 8 tricks on the first look|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: game need @DA + @SQ in S , so nice stop by EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  Declarer can try for 11 playing @h first but he risks a @D rerturn|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|ybob: danger now :(|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will take some time to play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: can be made after giving up 1@H and than a @D @C squeeze on n|pg||
nt|granguru:  return*|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: I have to go. Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: he doesn´t  hear me |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: it looks as if either W doesn't have the 3@S bid or E the raise |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ybob: another @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: speak louder :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @S is bad return|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petepunt: usefull to play 4n as quant after going through 4th suit as many othet forcing bids avail|pg||
pc|d4|nt|stc: a good observation from specs : penalty X not allowed in Mixte|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: i am sure declarer will ultimately play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|ampelman: @h or @s lead gives the ninth|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some choices which suit to attack first. Clubs might yield game going tricks without letting the opponents in|pg||
nt|ybob: now cold if declarer plays low @c from hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|granguru:  so right away with the cross ruff for 10 |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ybob: better is J but not easy|pg||
nt|ybob: W needs QXX on N|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure at the table you find that  |pg||

nt|pauleger: Gwinner is German, though he lives in Switzerland|pg||
nt|stc: and also not -2|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh wel took another tack |pg||

nt|andyv:  and may have been reason not to bid 2@d (if that weren't conventional)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will defence find their @S tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but S's first bid seemed to be 1N so they must have some system nuances that we aren't aware of|pg||

nt|roswolf: but the play is the thing|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow this is a dynamite hand|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see: Gotard in 3Nt on a @S lead to @sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W led a @h vs. 1NT and S had to attack @ds |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Multon calls TD|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW don't quite have a stopper in @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if it's in regards to the 2@c bid|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps there were different explanations|pg||

nt|hedyg: hey Kacper :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: a hand where you dont want to be declarer|pg||
nt|pauleger: 1@d shows @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: what will Gunn Heolness bbid now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C by east would have delighted west more|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H is not good news for Tor Helness|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: operator ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl9: sorry :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: look at the @S-suit - against 4@h S lead @SK - and N took @SA to play @H = only 3 @S-losers for E|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D or 2@C by West - I prefer 2@c|pg||
nt|ybob: np :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: ns are playing some kind of strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW have many possible games here. 3NT was one of the unlucky ones|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Kacper for all of your hard work |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: This should go down a couple.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a horror hand for e/w to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west should bid 6!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: winning the auction might work out very well anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be a challenge|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat easy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: in OR 2@C and then 2@S = 4. suit - so the NS didnt know the @S-suit by decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should as west be able to bid 3@D nf here|pg||
nt|pauleger: I would expect more points or more shape for a 2@s bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  8 tricks for a coorect defense|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct* damn|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: he showed 5@H 4@D and a minimum|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S is winning place|pg||
nt|ampelman: losing 2@s 2@c 1@d ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 black losers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: tricky play |pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 cards open not difficult but |pg||
nt|brotherp: best lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma does that (too) often :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: may even lead @H here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is as maybe but a 6-0 fit is usually to be avoided|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: plenty of chances though|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C suit is interesting here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c not that easy so 4@c should net EW a plus|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some variant of multi, showing a weak hand with long major (possibly with other options)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H showing some support for both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and 3@h was p/c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brotherp: think Verhees will play West for the @dJ...keeping the dangerous hand of lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks logical|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to cross ? open up the @H for defenders ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, @C 4-1 makes life much harder|pg||
nt|andyv:  some play that as invite in @s and some play it as furthering the preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 5@c bid from E, worried about pushing opps to slam?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ampelman: in 16 other room plays 4@hX|pg||
nt|ampelman: where east bid here 2@s and 3@s|pg||
nt|ampelman: which ended the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dealing computer is producing some fine hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: May get to 3NT now as west opened|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  all roads point to 1 or 2NT for EW...NS just don't have enough to compete|pg||

nt|sybarra: stange hand here |pg||
mb|2S|nt|pelu: wow: in OR 2@H by S - pass? by West and 4@H by N - no X|pg||
nt|granguru:  no good fit for no one|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hedyg: 3rd seat opening..i might open 1@c for the lead if i open, even if 5-5|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: 4@H incroyable|pg||
nt|roswolf: and where is the axe?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i think pass is best, can always show 5-5 later|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: east's opening is ugly|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will likely lead a spade|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h looks optimistic to me|pg||
nt|pauleger: this wont be too costly|pg||
nt|pelu: down 2-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very predictable|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely same spot?  will S X |pg||
mb|d|nt|brotherp: no light openers for Jansma (agreed it is a disgusting collection)|pg||
nt|ybob: yes :), cold 5@D. 4@S defeat @C lead or return after win the  A@S with J@H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: tough to deafeat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: too bold|pg||
nt|roswolf: it looks like a mixed teams bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  E must pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course, Ew have different ideas:P|pg||
nt|kaapo: Trying to make up for board 26 perhaps|pg||
mb|5S|nt|granguru:  if N ducks @D once there is no hope to win the hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: A good hand to be playing invitational 3@D over 1@H.|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: 3nt a good save against 4@S funny :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup bridge is a strange but wondrous game|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or 1NT forcing followed by a @D rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ampelman: 5@d looks fine|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure no X - %@D making easy|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: nice balance from gert jan (paulissen)|pg||
nt|brotherp: still Paulissen is there so EW reach their part-score in clubs|pg||
nt|granguru:  some 2/1 players changed system in such a way that a repeat of the same suit as here is no more GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4 spades, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds and a heart would be 9|pg||
nt|ybob: @D lead = 10 TRICKS|pg||
nt|sybarra: N just not defending with void |pg||
nt|sybarra: God gave you singletons to lead right?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  or the @hJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: but i saw 2nt as balance (may be wrong)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another workable treatment here.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pauleger: W will have to exit somewhere now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hard for allerton to place partner with a stiff club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|granguru:  defense is giving some help|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|xenya: so EW have got to best strain here, but as Hedy said, they were always in the position to do so, even if E had passed 3rd in hand |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ybob: can lead fron QXX @C ???|pg||
nt|henryb:  Leslie needs to lead a heart now to beat this|pg||

nt|ybob: from|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brotherp: Jansma doesnt know trumps are 2-2 so looking for the best way to play diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: east will be squeezed for the overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: only down 1 in 4@h = 11 for Norway|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the second @D permits to re-enter dummy |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d3|nt|granguru:  but declarer went for the finesse that didnt work|pg||
nt|andyv:  so W may be relying on bringing in the @h suit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu: so "only" down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I guess they still get a heart|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|nt|andyv:  I don't understand putting not putting the J@c in.  It seemed like a no cost play|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, NOT putting:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bobholl: now N thinks he's endplayed :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzhd: A very short break now|pg||
nt|roswolf: east letting a club go early|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s7|nt|granguru:  as he/she could make just 1 @H finesse |pg||
nt|andyv:  so declare was relying on the @h suit...and 7 imps to Zimmermann|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: but declarer should read the position easily|pg||

nt|roswolf: more distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|roswolf: this is a Mixed Competition and it has its own dynamics|pg||
nt|pelu: remember Board 17, where u would like W to bid 3@D NF - W in OR could that and are npw playing a hopeless 3@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 17 should give some to Jankova|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pauleger: E has a normal pass, but E/W are cold for 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: good hand for 2 suiters even with 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could also play @H to J, cash spade and end play south|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c some type of constructive raise|pg||
nt|stc: or a flat 4@h ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a direct raise to game isnt stupid|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the limit for both sides is the 5 level|pg||

nt|petergill: Steph Jacob is playing with her son Nick. At the other table, Tom Jacob is playing with Susan Humphries. All are from Auckland. Nick and Susan are youth players in their early ...|pg||
nt|petergill: twenties.  |pg||
nt|ybob: very nice :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
nt|roswolf: north really cant bid more|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know what the 2NT range is but a queen and a jack opposite a big hand is going to play about as well as one would expect it would.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andyv:  very difficult not to make 5 on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the vul sac in 6@DX was very tough to find|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: wrong Q by N :)|pg||

nt|Walddk1: Paula Leslie, however, is from Scotland originally|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||

nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||

nt|Walddk1: But has been living in London for about 10 years|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: sorry he made 3@D :(|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ampelman: after the 3@h bid the @hQ lead is too tough to find|pg||

nt|jcwla: from now until doomsday.|pg||
nt|xenya: the 9 would also do|pg||

pc|c6|nt|bobholl: small @D ?|pg||
nt|brotherp: think so; in the bidding and play East's 4441 is known so...|pg||

nt|brotherp: still a lot off guessing to be done by van Prooijen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps the diamond 9...|pg||

nt|roswolf: this could be bloody if someone gets too frisky|pg||
nt|petepunt: however would have bid 2@D first time|pg||
nt|roswolf: last bd|pg||
nt|kaapo: Four more rounds of swiss today|pg||
nt|petergill: In one match, East made 1@SX for 160, so perhaps 2@SX would not be too bad. |pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Kacper, our operator,  job well done |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Roberto and all who join us for the commentary |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: thx :)|pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: nice slam here|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C X P what should South call?|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: agree, Peter, 4@D now is a gamble - almost like all-in|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@S - 2NT = invit with 4+@s for sure 3@H cant be naturel|pg||
nt|ampelman: 9 tricks for NS in a @h contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: inverted raise to start with?|pg||
nt|ampelman: splinter bid ?|pg||
nt|pauleger: Last board of the match coming up. Play will resume in 35 minutes according to the bulletin. Thx all for watching and BBO for making this possible :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like @s and minor|pg||
nt|kaapo: After that 27 best of the A semifinal and 5 best of the B semifinal head to the round of 32|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: prefer to be able to bid 1n with wests cards|pg||
nt|jcwla: N intending to rebid NT here.|pg||
nt|stc: director ! she had 7@s, not 6|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I bid 4@S and go down|pg||
nt|ybob: i bid 4@C with the E hand|pg||
nt|petergill: It's like a Master Solvers Club problem: 3NT, 4@S, 3@S, 4@C or Pass|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: strong cub|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bid it?|pg||
nt|xenya: was a blind spot -- but a costly one|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lady is multiple European and World Champion. didnt get there by ooops|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed it is|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise the ante|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Too much for 3@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems fairly cold for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1086 a stop!?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I am not sure but Kopecky said 2s is transfer to nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural seems to be even a better treatment...less info given to opps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Multon hits declarers @D suit once again|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
nt|stc: that's why i said, hard to believe...|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8697|pg||
nt|hedyg: she had an easy entry to hand with AK@D|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Partner doubled at the 3-level vulnerable|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@C and later 4@S ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not what a little birdie told me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N opener had interesting effect of preventing N from showing the @h suit...compare to the auction in OR|pg||
nt|ybob: pd can have 4432|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, 4@C is not ideal but nothing is|pg||
nt|henryb:  shouldn't that show @s and @d? or a hand too strong for a direct 4@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and at the moment N is hopeful |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C followed by 4@S suggests 4 spades and a @d suit in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: -300 or -200 beats -400|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Maybe a strong 4@S only. Depends on agreement as is the case with everything in this game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stc: still wining the match and having a good position for the KO rounds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
nt|pelu: still hard fight for the first 3 places in this group: 62-61-60-60-57-54 VP's|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pauleger: a hand, where it is good to lead 2nd from 4 small|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: oh...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brotherp: finally an easy hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kacper for a great job as the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kari and specs...another round to start in a few mintues|pg||
nt|andyv:  minutes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile S has all sorts of problems here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe Madsen enters dummy in clubs to play towards @SA again|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we switch to play B |pg||
nt|Walddk1: If I don't have one, I prefer a direct 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: as W shows out|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would probably have duplicated the action at the other table: 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk1: In order to avoid confusion|pg||
nt|petergill: 3.5@S seems ideal, now that I think about it. |pg||
nt|ybob: agree 3.5 @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Want to borrow  ½  ?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 3½@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
nt|roswolf: everyone is pointing out that by ducking a spade 3nt is defeated - in practicethat means a small spade lead from north which might well not be found|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
nt|petergill: A problem with 3NT: If West was not vul, 3NT looks good, but a vul 3@C preempter is too likely to have an entry, and then -400 or -500 will be an ugly score, a lot of the time. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Though @C10 might make 3NT good. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
nt|ampelman: hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: especially if west bid it -|pg||
nt|kaapo: But East can win @SA, play heart to king and then 3rd heart after ace|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so bad|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: easy claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match, we will be back in 1 hour and 45 minutes for more fun|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this looks only -1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Kopecky may be going to the desk.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, anyway, this completes the rout.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Roland and John, and all.  For now, so long.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brotherp: setting up clubs sure is|pg||
nt|andyv:  finally went for the 3-3 @ss|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Steph Jacob is playing this well, trying to remove East's exit cards|pg||
nt|petergill: I think all four Aucklanders have played rep bridge for NZ. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think Stephanie might even escape for minus 100, an excellent outcome really|pg||
nt|ybob: two rounds @S and wait ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: cashing a top honour is more attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: can u explain why E bid 5@C and not 5@d???|pg||
nt|roswolf: no peter|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pauleger: W is not afraid to put N in|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|petepunt: in 1N he would have set up a @C|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: see you tomorrow, bye|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Kacper ! great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: thx|pg||
nt|petergill: If @DJ was onside, she could actually make 4@H from here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: so that is what she played for |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: east seems to have created a lot of losers now|pg||
nt|bobholl: gert jan looking whether it can be more than 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: but just an illusion|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|pauleger: bye for now|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless she intended it as some sort of try -which would have been odd|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  so loss of 1 imp|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: see you soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us|pg||
pc|h6|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: cant claim @Cs 4-1?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: now he can|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: 10min break|pg||
nt|roswolf: last board restart scheduledin 90 mins time|pg||
nt|roswolf: really no lunch!?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: after 3rd round i think|pg||
nt|pelu: now I see 1Ny first bid from Tor H - so East exo 4-4 i minor|pg||
pc|c9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h9|pc|s7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I have to close |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|d9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in 20 min or so |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: short break befor 4th round|pg||
nt|petergill: She played to make 4@H if East had @DA and West had @DJ in the ending - an excellent try|pg||
pg||
