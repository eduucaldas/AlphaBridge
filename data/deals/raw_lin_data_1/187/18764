nt|roswolf: -2 for 6 imps to the norwegian team|pg||

nt|riccho:  so finland quadrupled their lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  push|pg||
nt|hajru:  No, don't think so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: will north bid his own suit?|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
mb|2N|nt|hajru:  Not sure what happened here as it appeared that EW had 7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: psyche from tor|pg||
nt|roswolf: north passed - really|pg||
nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S @HA @SA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C|pg||
nt|hajru:  Yes, that is true.  |pg||
nt|hajru:  OK, did we really have a French person open a weak NT here?|pg||
mb|3C|an|.|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: 2 imps for an extra undertrick in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
mb|3N|nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: i understand bidding 2@S but i dont like it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: north reluctantly passes|pg||
nt|roswolf: pass missed out|pg||
nt|riccho:  yes looks a bit weird; |pg||
nt|riccho:  but as bad as the play was; the bidding in the other room was even worse|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from top|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: she is long time champ:)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|spooky: this lead didn't scare North|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told 3cl...mimimum....3nt stiff spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14419   south|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Pls do it now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: true|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: ok 1 imp loss|pg||

nt|jaapfr: would any of us:)?|pg||
nt|riccho:  ahh there is the 7th trick in bd 15 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hedyg: that N hand is not really worth 17 hcps, is it?|pg||
nt|hajru:  I would not, but then again, I usually play a system where 1H is limited to about 17, rather than the 21 in |pg||
nt|hajru:  a natural system.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even then never 1@S|pg||
nt|hajru:  If you had to bid, what would you bid then?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass or pass or pass:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|teckh:  hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt =23+ bal|pg||
nt|hedyg: so downgraded to the 2@H replay|pg||
nt|hedyg: reply*|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  np; I guess its very tricky to get the informations across to you from the table, if they are not interested :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south scared into passing - how could 4@C be wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bludegeon shouldnt work on this deal|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like the 3NT bid, whenever I bid 2NT, it seems to make no difference - it makes 3, or goes down 1, whatever I do|pg||
nt|roswolf: spades 3-3 gives some hope i suppose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|riccho:  is there a tiebreaker rule in the unlikely event of a draw? |pg||
nt|hajru:  I'm sure there is. |pg||
nt|arno11: might make 4 can pitch @C loser on @D after finessing against N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|teckh:  well bid, I think|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D might be the majority choice|pg||
nt|hajru:  Downloading the conditions of contest as we speak.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: now S even get slam ideas (sorry this is monday morning bidding:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|arno11: after @C lead this might not work anymore|pg||
pc|sA|nt|spooky: All about @HJ now|pg||
nt|spooky: with this lead she has enough entries to misguess it... |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|hajru:  Opposite SQxxx and a red ace, 6S has a chance, and it is not clear if N would cooperate over 4D|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  ok so South sees 14 HCP opposite 15-17, and shortness in hearts - East having most of the opposing honors, South knows there is a minor slam if North has a fit|pg||
nt|granguru:  landy, garozzo, woolsey, multilandy or something|pg||

nt|roswolf: probably worth a double!?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Operator, could you please enter scores on 21 and 22 manually?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i would bid game on this sequence but i suppose north is entitled to overbid after the first few bds|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4|pg||
nt|riccho:  but 2@d wasnt probably natural either|pg||

nt|granguru:  hard to get there after north showed 5-5 in mjaors|pg||

nt|riccho:  team lavazza is struggling: 35 Imps behind  with 12 to play|pg||
mb|4H|nt|spooky: South bid @C and played @H4...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s brushed it aside easily enough|pg||
nt|arno11: at least they picked their opponent themselves|pg||

mb|6N|nt|roswolf: nor me|pg||

nt|arno11: bal? and then N bids 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east might well play north for short diamonds here|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  I guessed before the 4@c bid :) |pg||
nt|hajru:  I have no idea why you'd call the S hand balanced in a strong club context|pg||
nt|arno11: as NS are playing a kind of polish club, the bid was either 1. 2@C  or 2. it showed @C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|granguru:  6@H is also possible to win..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have reached the slam|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think...|pg||
nt|roswolf: need to take a good view of the spade suit|pg||
nt|granguru:  interesting that W can only overruff @s with @HK|pg||
nt|riccho:  maybe S wanted to emphasize the "good" @d-suit?|pg||
nt|riccho:  2@d = @c sounds a bit funny|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyway: the contract is not very convincing, but successful|pg||
nt|hajru:  I think we can only guess at this stage|pg||
nt|arno11: if North takes the @C finesse we will come to 12 tricks via 4@C 4@D 3@H and the @S Ace|pg||

pc|cA|nt|roswolf: not going well|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmmm - idee fixee|pg||

mb|3D|nt|spooky: another 3rd hand Light opener|pg||

nt|roswolf: doubt whether they will get close to a slam|pg||
nt|arno11: teams full of star players like Lavazza, Brogeland or Gottlieb on their way out |pg||
nt|hajru:  3@d probably invitational with a good 6 card suit|pg||

nt|djneill:  example of how usually the weaker hand with a long suit plays better - honors from the strong hand are still relevant, but not if West declares - East's @d not so hot then|pg||
nt|hajru:  In the other room, west tried 1@s, not sure what that meant, but it got them to a playable contract|pg||
