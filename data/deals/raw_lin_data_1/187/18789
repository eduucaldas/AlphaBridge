nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||

nt|ntmon: hi Markku|pg||
nt|tihana: hi everybody!|pg||
nt|ntmon: 5th and 6th team of actual standings meet here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 2 segments o 14 boards|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The mandatory trump lead|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
nt|baardolav: The bidding is near the limits now all ways and ended in 3@d NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andreasw:  5 @d makes but not to bid:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Two single red kings onside|pg||
pc|cK|nt|riccho:  hi everybody; hope to see some exciting boards here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|baardolav: yes 5@d make doubledummy, find the single @d king|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|hajru:  This looks like a cold 3NT.  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@d should make easaly, prob +1|pg||
nt|riccho:  in the first session only the last three boards from team "Zimmermann" prevented them from being far behind|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hajru:  Is east mrs. Duboin?  |pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we need to shut down|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: we will back in the moment|pg||
nt|blum1956: the best lead by Anna Gulevich, the contract must go 1 off|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||

nt|ntmon: teams corrently 5th and 6th met here |pg||
nt|riccho:  a simple board to start with; at the tabel I always appreciate this :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ntmon: 1 IMP for Lavazza|pg||
nt|tihana: slamish hands on NS|pg||
nt|tihana: and unfortune break in hs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  here close 28-29|pg||
mb|2C!|an|15+|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
nt|baardolav: pony 29, calandra 28|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2 nt showing - 15-17?|pg||
nt|baardolav: not sure, they might play strong club too|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
nt|riccho:  NS are two wellknown players from france; both of them winning numerous national and international titles. |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibbitzers told me - they play Polish club|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Flat asa pancake - slam a mile off.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10-11 tricks|pg||
nt|baardolav: Sementa hit the best lead|pg||
nt|riccho:  EW are not known to me, but hopefully michael can held here ...|pg||
nt|riccho:  help; sry IÂ´m a typomaster ... :(|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
pc|d5|nt|ppiglett: Expect a diamond lead - J9xx usually give a trick in this situation|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||
nt|danilo1: Good morning all|pg||

nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||
nt|jaapfr: am I in the right room:)?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||

pc|s7|pg||

nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: 2 imp gain for Rossard here and the lead changes hands|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: Yan on money|pg||

nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good contract obviously hands too flat|pg||
nt|andreasw:  30-28 now|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the now-normal 4-1 break. seems to me these days you have to cater for a 4-1 break and bid accordibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
nt|riccho:  interesting to see, that at bd1 N opened with 1@H. An opening that even in a limited system would be hardly everybodies choice|pg||
nt|riccho:  this contract is difficult to beat (but not impossible)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s now for sure|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Very Baggy 4S bid with nine trick in the hand. |pg||
nt|riccho:  yes but dummy has no effective trick at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 1@S - for the lead partner|pg||
nt|baardolav: Very light overbids|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not my style... |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|baardolav: need to finesse the @d Q to make|pg||
nt|baardolav: and get rid of one club from the closed hand|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
nt|riccho:  @s 10 would be a nice-to-have-card at dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
nt|baardolav: Calandra have some thoughts about this... Spade need to be 2-2 or H single|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||

nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||

pc|sT|nt|riccho:  anyone has an idea whcih system EW play? |pg||
pc|s9|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c9|nt|hawe45:  East should be 6-2-3-2 now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  10 tricks wd|pg||
nt|riccho:  according to some kibs EW play some sort of polish club; 1@c is than a WK NT or medium club or strong any (some play it less than GF) |pg||
nt|blum1956: Ìàõ Êhven played for Russia many times, including the 2004 Olympiad (3th place). His partner (and wife) Anna Gulevich is 36-th rated in the rating-list (which includes men) and has ...|pg||
nt|blum1956: a Russian mixed teams wins to her credit|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW play the "Beriozka" system (based on Polish club) which is rather popular in Russia|pg||
nt|riccho:  typical polish style is that the 1NT rebid after the neg. 1@d is  a 18-20 BAL type of hand; with 12-14 in polish club they regularly are faking with 1@h or 1@s even with lesse than a 4carder|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|riccho:  Oh she can throw one|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ntmon: surprise|pg||
nt|blum1956: 1@c is weak NT (12-14) or strong (17-18+) any|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: so miss guessed -1|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|danilo1: West bid 2@C ... so he has 4 ... East who reopened therefore only 2 @C (possible single/double Q) - so @CJ has not been absolute mandatory ... however, good guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|cJ|nt|riccho:  so without the medium club stuff in it...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|riccho:  how comfortable to commentate french players. every bid is cristal clear here |pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  xcept sometimes... In the first segment there was a 2@hX contract, which succeeded but shouldnt|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||

pc|d3|nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||

nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|d5|nt|riccho:  In Bd. 2 I was wrong with my prediction (they reached 4@s but they didnt play it) because EW found the "sacrifice" in 5@h |pg||

nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
nt|baardolav: well even easier... now I would like +2 |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||

nt|henryb:  but it would only have turned a quick hand into a slow one|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @H-lead would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ntmon: something N has to have finally|pg||
nt|tihana: i got some comments regarding w 1nt, i think it is ok, you?|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S9 is entry too late ... since @C is then 9th trick ... so declarer would on @C lead need only 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto all|pg||
nt|andreasw:  13 tricks from the very beginning:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  41-35|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
nt|ntmon: no problem with 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i did say maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam zone -this time  @c easyest|pg||
nt|baardolav: polish club from N|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|baardolav: is this ending in 6nt? on 32 hp...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs makes... but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|riccho:  and 2@h from W is no common bid here either|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: sorry|pg||
nt|ppiglett: True - I play against those sort of hoodwinkers too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jbgood: not the worst bid I have seen...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Surely South didn't pass. Undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Tough choice for Robinson on opening lead, particularly in light of 1@C opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 or 8 tricks doesn't mean a difference|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew has to stay low 1 nt looks ok|pg||
nt|tihana: would y bid sth else?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 6nt too|pg||
nt|baardolav: North hand|pg||
nt|riccho:  2NT nat.? vs an unlimited opener of 1@c looks a bit... well ....|pg||
nt|chmitty: hummm ... indeed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tihana: strange bid 3cl, should south show strong balance?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a David Bird deal-em-again hand|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - good spades...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: No prob |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: game should be reached|pg||
mb|3N|nt|stc: misfit but enough points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good lead - for declarer|pg||
nt|stc: and the most friendly lead|pg||
nt|ntmon: multi-purpose club and transfer responses in use|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: now many tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: NS helped opps to devaluate their hands here|pg||
nt|jbgood: this may well be a push|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@h relay probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think so|pg||
nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-35|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: okay, now he is cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Especially, if E/W duck another @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: well north wked up -is it right ? -perhaps -200 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  4 NT quantitative ?|pg||
nt|riccho:  np; this operating stuff is very difficult to do|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ppiglett: The singelton ten fo spades is a huge card. A little luck for N-S.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|runnerup: jump in clubs doent look the way to desripe this hand all thought it make it easy to bid 6--but is it forcing even|pg||
nt|chmitty: next door, it will start 1@c 1@d 1@s but what next ? 2NT 3@d 3NT ... or 2NT 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho:  and the lead of the @sJ is sth I wouldnt have found either|pg||
nt|chmitty: in any case I suspect they will end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  How do you prevent 3 heart tricks, Kit?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - wasÂ´nt ducked|pg||
nt|andreasw:  6 clubs now - but why not bid 4 @d?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 750 on stake... pass or 6@c|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what is 2@c on 1 @c??|pg||
nt|baardolav: natural I belive|pg||
nt|chmitty: I like @sJ|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2NT is just too weak for the hand of that type, the few-pointed 3NT will be often missed|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: so 10 very badly needed IMPs for Lynch|pg||
nt|tihana: my gib says it will make :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: pos 8+HP and 5+ @c|pg||
nt|blum1956: I guess EW play 1@c-2@d as GF|pg||
nt|riccho:  just what N needed without it 4@h would probably a better contract|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes much better.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: I guess you really can't|pg||
nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||
nt|runnerup: nt -not really sensibal|pg||
nt|danilo1: good @CK position ... so EW need to cash @H to hold declarer on 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes - but points? nevermind - slam is on:-)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1@d is 0-7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  46-37|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kibb told med - 2 clubs is game force|pg||
nt|baardolav: Natural gf yeah|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me|pg||
nt|chmitty: the theory is : against limited hands (2NT shows that) your lead should be neutral|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ntmon: looks -2|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|tihana: shit|pg||

nt|runnerup: even this can go off|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tihana: ok, at least we will have a swing|pg||
nt|baardolav: well done|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ntmon: EW will negotiate @H ruff but not much more|pg||
nt|andreasw:  heart lead?|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1370 it is should be made in one flash when the @c finesse make... and K drops. There is not a play for 1390 because of single @d in east|pg||
nt|riccho:  the lead is interesting in a positive way. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|ntmon: this may not be good - defensive ruffs available|pg||
nt|baardolav: @d lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  youre right Baard!!!|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: Yes this is a nervy one, needs 4 tricks from Majors so must finesse, @H more dangerous and @S a 2 way guess - on the theory of vacant spaces - trusting W for longer @Ds than E, it ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks right to play E for the @SQ - which works|pg||

nt|ntmon: my yesterday fellow commenator - a lady - told: we are going to see a lot of contract played by W and N|pg||

nt|chmitty: actually 7@d may be not so great|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can't ruff a Spade AND cash the 4 @c tricks|pg||

pc|cT|nt|kit: Should Lair pass 2@D?  I think so.  4 diamonds more likely than 2.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
nt|mareczek: both rooms opened 1@h with East|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|runnerup: well found -minors are not easy to be found because they can be sorter than 4 when opened|pg||
nt|oosb: but @D 9 seems best|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andreasw:  yes.much better|pg||
nt|baardolav: No direct entries for the @d suit|pg||
nt|oosb: but no entries now|pg||
nt|oosb: he actually wanted @D to lose, so he can set up a nice 2nd finesse and entry :) |pg||
nt|andreasw:  there will be|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oups|pg||
nt|ntmon: preempting apparently works here w/o need to bid 4@H|pg||

nt|oosb: this works |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|stc: %play knowing 4@h in S|pg||

nt|danilo1: looks  very possible third hand ... personally I would pass as North and East, but I would open as South|pg||

nt|jcomyn: how far will ew go in clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  50-37|pg||
nt|riccho:  another quick play lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Guaranteed to wrongside 3NT, and he succeeds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Called Jackpot|pg||
mb|1C|nt|stc: lol|pg||
nt|ntmon: so why do not do something in systems to recover?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1 looks correct, but at this voulnerabilities, 4 may be rite action|pg||
nt|riccho:  presumably a 12-14 BAL or 16+ 1@c opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: other room played 3@S in 21|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: ns has points but west distribution so perhaps 2 spades |pg||
nt|blum1956: As opposite to the previous hand, EW must play 5@c here|pg||
nt|blum1956: not 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: we can see there are some good reasons to do so from East's perspective|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@D might well make|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many of us are not convinced of 3N gambling as a good bid, because if 3N is right the wrong person will be playing it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I open 1@c with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weichsel is thinking -- maybe of raising, maybe wondering if 4@D is conventional|pg||
nt|riccho:  :) I c  the point |pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  and rebid 2@c and 3@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@c if indicated|pg||
nt|henryb:  to show the solid suit|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what Boyd is thinking of doing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He's definitely thinking about something|pg||
nt|danilo1: opps, srry ... missed Bd Nr. (thought Sout dealer) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: might have been interesting if vul reversed|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@s x : support other suits|pg||
nt|blum1956: redouble showing the Ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and that must have been what|pg||
nt|stc: S noticed that all cards are good for declarer in this match|pg||
nt|riccho:  5@d can be a very expensive save|pg||
nt|chmitty: the french also stopped at 2NT at board 6 ... but with some reason, South overcalling !!|pg||
nt|blum1956: Max may expect that Anna has not that long diamonds (she seems to keep 4 spades|pg||
nt|chmitty: 3@c : my hand is interesting, although I passed 2@s ... so good support for red suits, with no doubt|pg||
nt|riccho:  with the S Hand? boah...|pg||
nt|riccho:  for sure - if they didnt switch systems since last round... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: 3NT from North is comfy|pg||
nt|chmitty: passed 2@c sry|pg||
nt|blum1956: Certainly Anna will bid 5@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: and NS should take a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting -- maybe right, but still .....|pg||
nt|mr murray: talk to u later. Going out to play poker now. Took me all day to get ready to go out and play a few hours. No energy in my body at all :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now Weichsel does have a problem -- who can make what?|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking a low road|pg||
nt|runnerup: now have to find  @h out|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @h said i not ace @h|pg||
nt|danilo1: very difficult task for Guido id declarer plays low @S especially|pg||
nt|riccho:  the save can be a good fortune for EW|pg||
pc|d8|nt|blum1956: wow!|pg||
nt|riccho:  inviting to a phantom sacrficie|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "all that for me, eh?" Robinson: "surprise"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, would North really bid 2@d after 1@c-1@h?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: He did in the othe room :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: in this vulnerability -this looks normal bidding seqwence |pg||

nt|andreasw:  no he wont|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||

nt|jbgood: big gain for China on the last one...|pg||

pc|c4|nt|blum1956: The save in 5@d costed  800 but...|pg||
nt|chmitty: and now ladies and gentlemen ....|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@c looks a bit offroad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ntmon: good decision by Yan to overrule partner's suit|pg||
nt|chmitty: 1540 is offroad indeed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|riccho:  and will be a make now...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|henryb:  opposite a passed partner?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: hard to see defense getting this wrong, so likely 3 IMPs for Lynch|pg||
pc|s2|nt|danilo1: good leaving @SK ... (no @H finess possible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|danilo1: still making (no options) ... develop @H and @Dto K|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ntmon: no brainer|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kit: 2 club entries in dummy, but not good enough|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|oosb: He will play it out for @C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
nt|riccho:  S needs a successful @C guess now; this is espec difficult after such a bd just before|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
nt|chmitty: terrible set for Multon Willard so far : 4@s made by opps, a frightening 50% grand slam not bid, 6cx made, and now 3NT 2 off|pg||

mb|p|nt|baardolav: Boa will not make 6nt for west I am sure of that:)|pg||
nt|oosb: can be 5@S 4@H no?|pg||
nt|oosb: hehe :))|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: South wrongly discarded a club, it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  I can't tell from the play. they certainly played 6@s on a trump lead|pg||
nt|kit: only 11 tricks even on favorable lead -- 6 spades, 2 diamonds, 1 heart, 2 clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  the club pitch is not shown but that is the only possibility|pg||
nt|kit: 5th diamond sets up, but still not enough|pg||
nt|kit: diamond pitch could never happen from 4 looking at dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "3rd & 5th?" Weichsel: "yes, 3rd and low"|pg||
nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and he did|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|oosb: 6-4 now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good hands should be bid slowly|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why not 4 @h|pg||
nt|oosb: E might be forced to bid NT at this rate|pg||
nt|baardolav: Difficult hands are always bid slowly|pg||
nt|oosb: that would be 5-5 |pg||
nt|oosb: and sementa is planning to show 6-5 next|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or 6-5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|oosb: i guess sementa feels he can play 6 opposite a singleton too?|pg||
nt|oosb: perhaps singleton Q or A|pg||
nt|oosb: Very tricky hand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  apparently Chambers did pitch a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosb: whoops|pg||
pc|h5|nt|baardolav: well... better than 6@s down one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not a good decision:-(|pg||
nt|oosb: I was thinking, maybe 5@H instead of 4@S ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes Baard.|pg||
nt|baardolav: Or 6nt X|pg||
nt|oosb: I wouldve bid that I think, suggests slam interest and 65?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chmitty: will declarer guess the @c ?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|oosb: So a chance for Pony to finish off the match|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|oosb: if they get to 6@H|pg||
nt|andreasw:  lets see|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|kit: that is the only possibility I can think of, since North didn't duck ace of diamonds according to play record|pg||
nt|chmitty: will south smoothly duck the Jack ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|ritong: he shifted to the @h 2|pg||
nt|chmitty: if declarer plays the Jack, he can't put the king|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosb: Meanwhile they picked up 11 more|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|oosb: in the last board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andreasw:  63 37|pg||
nt|oosb: where Thomas right sided 3NT and avoided 5@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: maybe south had wrong count|pg||
nt|oosb: But 24 might be some imps back, if 3NT is missed|pg||
nt|baardolav: 5@d can make double dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chmitty: so easy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb:  1 imp left. 4 boards|pg||
nt|kit: those of you looking at movie see:  Passell claims 12 tricks.  That is not a real claim.  It is the operator entering that 12 tricks were made|pg||
nt|henryb:  break?|pg||
nt|kit: we are pretty sure South must have discarded a club, unless operator just misentered number of tricks taken.  We don't see any other possibility.|pg||
nt|jpes: the hearts are already exposed|pg||
nt|kit: I am getting confirmation -- South did pitch club.|pg||
nt|kit: so we suddenly have a real nailbiter here -- 1 IMP difference, 5 boards to go.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind all kibitzers that I do not respond to people who do not have the courtesy to fully identify themselves on their profiles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - they rushed off to different bathrooms and I needed to close the window fast. We're back now|pg||

nt|riccho:  1NT = UNB? |pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: here we go|pg||
nt|kit: no double, no trouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Don't know, Henry, sorry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chmitty: the logic of the @c lead is that South must have some points to have a chance ... as she did not bid over 1@s, the probability she has good @h is limited|pg||
nt|blum1956: There are different possible agreements. One of them is : 1@d - 1@s - 1NT means the @h 4-card|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m told that 1@d is UNB from start. So 1NT showy 4+@c at least|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  I thought Kit might|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chmitty: oh I see|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be Multon did not realize that|pg||
nt|chmitty: can't be1453 for instance ?|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not from the start of course (1@d may be, say, 4-3-5-1)|pg||
nt|riccho:  the operator told that 1NT = 4@d; I took that to explain the bidding to myself|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|kit: if 3@D artificial, double is just diamonds I think|pg||
nt|kit: This certainly won't make, the question is how much will it go down|pg||
nt|henryb:  easy to lose control|pg||
nt|kit: remember, Boyd isn't trying to hold his losses -- he is playing to make.|pg||
nt|baardolav: now 3nt is down... making the @d finesse directly|pg||
nt|oosb: Yes, no safety play|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|kit: So he will be assuming good things, not bad things|pg||

pc|d4|nt|chmitty: isn't it 4@d at least ??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|blum1956: !@d opening in the Beriozka covers all unbalanced hands with 4+@d and no 5+ majors|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kill point - trick 1@h|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|kit: surprised Lair didn't win and return a trump|pg||
nt|henryb:  and he is almost out of winners|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe was good defense, as declarer assuming spade king is on|pg||

nt|henryb:  I think Lair lost count of trumps|pg||
nt|kit: he must have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel just revoked, playing a diamond on the club that was ruffed - of course BBO won't let me do that|pg||
nt|henryb:  He has not played to the next trick, though|pg||
nt|kit: was revoke established?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Revoke was definitely established - Boyd has called the director, who has ruled that there is a 1 trick penalty|pg||
nt|kit: anyway, probably around 5 IMPs for Kasle|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: so 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So he actually took 8 tricks, but I|pg||

nt|riccho:  an opp from yesterday from EW just told me that 1@d is a definite UNB Hand|pg||
nt|riccho:  but the @s lead make things complicated|pg||
nt|riccho:  anyway @d back is the killer now|pg||
