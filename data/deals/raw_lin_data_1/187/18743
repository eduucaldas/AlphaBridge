nt|henryb:  have you taken a session off, Jan?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel asks "what's your opening bid style?" B & R: "light - we open most 11's and some 10's. Weichsel: "you open balanced 11?" "some, not all"|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: hello, they are in the middle of a board, we will skip after they finish|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Looks like one down...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: this match brings 5th and 7th team in actual standings|pg||

mb|2C|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Hi Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Boyd chose to make light response|pg||

nt|stc: Most E will open 2@s, giving the good lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tihana: hi everyone, fast start!|pg||
nt|ntmon: welcome to last set of Swiss stage of Mixed Teams, Euro 2011, Poznan|pg||

nt|ntmon: X show 15+ with @c|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Markku Pekkinen|pg||
nt|ntmon: N believes in 7 @C quick tricks, an Ace and trick in dummy for her free bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Markku|pg||
nt|tihana: hi everybody!|pg||
nt|ntmon: 5th and 6th team of actual standings meet here|pg||
nt|vugraphpl4: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi everyone|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board for starter|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT cold -- they should get there -- probably 3@H from Lair, 3NT from Weishel|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C conservative -- now Weichsel has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  Lair has a problem|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would have tried 2N as Weichsel|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, had that backwards -- missed a bid|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry, Weichsel could have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are all sleepy: earlier Kerri Sanborn tried to analyze a hand played counter-clockwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That would be a new sort of bridge, wouldn't it? Counter-clockwise play - maybe clockwise on even numbered boards and counter-clockwise on odd?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|runnerup: if you guess hearts 5 @d makes ew but difficult to bid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Auction started exactly same way, but South bid 2NT and cold game was reached|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|runnerup: so this is good save anyway |pg||
nt|ntmon: 3@D showed fit but @CQ seems useless, so no further interest by E|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: 9 of diamonds discouraging, so likely will find heart shift to hold to 4.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tihana: nice lead directing 3@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  The drawback to responding with Boyd's hand is the few hands where it goes 1@d-1@h-2N-P-P-X|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: pretty rare to get doubled in 2NT Henry|pg||
nt|henryb:  the advantage is that sometimes the opponents miss a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel went to the bathroom while he was dummy so we're now waiting for him |pg||
nt|henryb:  There was a creative player in NY by the name of Larry Edwards who believed strongly that the auctions 2N-P-P and 1X-1Y-2N-P-P should always be doubled|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious says: i am not that strong for taking initiative, but i don't want rob you of space for investigation|pg||
nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|janm:  East's hand was pretty good for 1NT, but not so good opposite spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|janm:  Probably East bid 3NT :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|janm:  With the K of hearts lead, E will need to hold up and then duck a spade to North - but doesn't the club blockage prevent her from taking the 9 tricks she seems to have? |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|c4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brgpro: but the entry to her hand is gone|pg||
nt|brgpro: think she will end up 7 tricks|pg||
nt|janm:  Yes - can't get back after leading a spade to the ten, so won't be able to take the KQ of @cs - 4 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, 1 club|pg||
nt|brgpro: china gained 15 imps on 2nd board,|pg||
pc|c2|nt|janm:  Looking just at the NS cards on board 2, 6@h seems like where you'd want to be, but with the 5-0 break...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|brgpro: NS the other room reached a rather good 6@h ( needing 3-2 trump break) but when they were 5-0, they even got doubled for -500|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: well...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|brgpro: she is angry...|pg||
nt|janm:  I wasn't watching the carding on the spades, but would have thought that S's K, Q, J of hearts suggested diamonds over clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|mc|9|nt|janm:  That will probably be some IMPs back to Italy|pg||
pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "there must have been a better way to do that" Weichsel: "lead A of @hs earlier" Robinson: "if you lead it earlier, I'll probably make another trick - you can't ruff in with ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
mb|2C|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tihana: hm|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  truth and concequences|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: he got it right -- key was Weichsel's 2NT call -- would be unlikely with doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: glass half-full, half empty??|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|brgpro: with 6-4...i would|pg||
nt|janm:  And Cuzzi apparently agrees - don't know if 2@c is one Major or both.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@c here, ( playing @dJ from hand)...but|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm:  Likely both - which will work well on this hand, but the 2 card discrepancy would worry me|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|janm:  Even getting to 11 tricks isn't trivial here- ruffing 2 hearts in dummy gets 4 trumps in hand, 2 in dummy, the two major suit aces for 8, and 3 diamonds for 11 - but those 3 diamonds wouldn't always be there - for instance if West had the @d 10|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is he doing...|pg||
nt|janm:  Wonder if there's some sort of endplay?|pg||
nt|janm:  Cash A of hearts here, then play the third spade?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but even if he gets his @hQ big, it won't help...because it can be ruffed anyway|pg||
nt|janm:  And a @d back won't necessarily pick those up either|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: and his @hQ will discard 4th @d...doesnt help|pg||

nt|runnerup: so 200 it was a good  desision to pass 1 @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: @h lead is a natural killer, takes away the entry to club tricks|pg||
nt|tihana: 15:15 after two boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so all of a sudden it is all square|pg||
nt|tihana: i loove this rooom|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Weichsel holds the rare AK EMPTY ninth|pg||
nt|jbgood: the comeback was fast and furious|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!s !h|nt|henryb:  but the doubleton @d is a good sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: E probaply decided to show a major 2 suiter rather than just her spades|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|tihana: i think both 3n and 5 cl make, yes?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: NS may make games in both majors with some good guessing|pg||
nt|runnerup: brave 2 ! and + once again to ns|pg||
nt|tihana: @H and m i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have 29 hcp combined - and EW are already in 3@hs :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: Looked like it would be a dull board, but 4@S was doubled in other room |pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West later shows the @S Ace, East must have the @H Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s NO guess|pg||
nt|tihana: making 4?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: proving yet again that bridge is a bidder's game|pg||

nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "AK empty ninth" |pg||

mb|p|nt|runnerup: now  @h slam|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  6N by N is cold on the lie of the cards|pg||

nt|runnerup: par looks like 9 in ! ,but |pg||
nt|ntmon: N/s again off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Michaels cuebid - promising both Majors, not my style with only an 8 count vulnerable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  both minors 3-3, @dK onside, @s suit can't be misguessed if led|pg||
nt|stc: NS will play game here|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to bid ,but now known to be in rigth hand if bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Lair looking for more it seems|pg||
nt|ntmon: pass over 2@D and X later will be for penalty|pg||
nt|tihana: only a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised Weichsel didn't bid 3@S, unless he feared that would show 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||
nt|tihana: 2N by W would be scrambling?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ntmon: i would say|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it will depend on whether they play in a minor or NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think they are in slam after this Q-bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting - on the previous hand 3@H went down one in OR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|stc: friendly @s and blocked @ds help a lot|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: people are talking 6NT, but they aren't getting there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bu @C might be 3-3|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes can be rigth to x some caises,but north passed hand so pass looks ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: we dont know their agreements...|pg||
nt|ntmon: definitely not a low-scoring match|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hK|nt|stc: playing on @s looks better, the 10 may be short|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: Lair went conservative|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are looking at 4 hands, Kit. I am surprised they got pat 3N|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ntmon: W in other rooms was more dynamic|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: depends on how @H are played - but no real choice - so yes it makes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: start with @s is normal, the A@S may be an entry for @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never seen so bad play - with such a good result. Now even an end-play against West|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: look at Versace's 1 spade inbid on   2 - and you will see why this match is swingy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ntmon: 7 tricks only becauseof 2 @D S entries - well defended|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|stc: but think at @d 4-3 and @c 4-2, loosing 3@d 1@s 1@c|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: this needs an endplay for the 9th trick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|nt|henryb:  Steve would have done better to return a @s|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jbgood: just part of the reason of course...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  No - suppose West has the @C-lenght, what should you loose by checking the @C-suit - and you might have 9 ice-cold tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|janm:  Yes, that does make a lot of sense - sort of knows that despite his values, he's a little soft to get past the 3 level, and the diamonds are good enough to play opposite a doubleton if partner is 23 in the minors|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|janm:  South didn't raise spades - maybe because she didn't want a spade lead|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|janm:  Another double digit swing on board 4 when the other table played in 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm:  Important for N to lead a high spade here - that will beat 3NT easily. Even on a low spade lead, there may not be enough tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brgpro: small @s lead might give the contract away...Versace can tabke double @d finesse|pg||

pc|s2|nt|brgpro: double finesse or playing @dQ fall 1st or 2nd... i dont know which is better|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h9|mc|8|nt|brgpro: double finesse is about 25% ( playing !j first also works when 10 is singleton)...|pg||

nt|tihana: i got some comments regarding w 1nt, i think it is ok, you?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
nt|ntmon: no problem with 1NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||

nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: W ducked @s twice, very well played|pg||
nt|runnerup: minor game -so avoid 3nt is the name off this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Boyd: "I think that is a constructive jump" Robinson: "I think it's just to play"|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess 4@s is easier than 3N|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns slam zone in @s but ew can then bid 7 clubs -ok not here and perhaps only teoria|pg||
nt|ntmon: trump lead indicated|pg||
nt|ntmon: my yesterday fellow commenator - a lady - told: we are going to see a lot of contract played by W and N|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ntmon: but EW might doubled at 5th level  already if they find clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now 5@C completes the picture|pg||
nt|tihana: i was spying the other room, they are in 7@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  although both are simple|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps east thought west to have more and continued -now just trust and bid 5 @d|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ntmon: from any holding :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True - and effective|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: for the first time I have received comments from kibs supporting the seating rule - of course there are different opinions :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  Why can South not bid 3 @H in the first round - to play?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or correct|pg||
nt|ntmon: quiet board here :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stc: 11 easy tricks now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|runnerup: perhaps wets should bid 2nt to show both minors|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now 450|pg||
nt|stc: if defense starts with 2 rounds of @h declarer will be very worried :(|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: the curse of the commentator|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like an attempt to present declarer with a Greec gift|pg||
nt|tihana: well, no matter what seating rules are, men can play more hands if they intend to. Seating rules cant change someone bidding 3N on every occasion possible.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: will do now - continuing Trumps might have worked better|pg||

nt|janm:  5@c doesn't make, with the clubs 4-2|pg||

nt|janm:  Should E have rebid the diamonds? West certainly expressed a strong  opinion with 5@c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|janm:  Now there are 2 potential @h losers, and nothing declarer can do about it|pg||

nt|brgpro: when u put down a 7-5 hand as dummy and both ur suits are not trumps...something doesnt feel right...|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|brgpro: i remember once a Dutch player told me: when u put down a good 8 card suit as side suit, it can never be right!|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: good sacrifice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 8 tricks on top and little prospect of a 9th?|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Earlier in this match Boyd- Robinson couldn't get out of 1N because they play puppet (I think) and went -100 in 1N with 3@s made at the other table|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|janm:  With the heart lead, he could ruff just one club and pitch the other, but Wang tangled his entries by ducking the heart, and of course he doesn't know they're 3-3 (or maybe he does if the @h 3 was a 3rd and low lead)|pg||

mb|2D|nt|kit: 4@D might well make|pg||
nt|henryb:  Many of us are not convinced of 3N gambling as a good bid, because if 3N is right the wrong person will be playing it|pg||
nt|henryb:  I open 1@c with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure what Weichsel is thinking -- maybe of raising, maybe wondering if 4@D is conventional|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  and rebid 2@c and 3@c|pg||
nt|henryb:  or 4@c if indicated|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and that must have been what|pg||
nt|stc: S noticed that all cards are good for declarer in this match|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  If I opened 1@c the auction would go 1@c-1@h-2@c-3N and we would get a low diamond lead|pg||

nt|mr murray: talk to u later. Going out to play poker now. Took me all day to get ready to go out and play a few hours. No energy in my body at all :)|pg||
