nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel is back - asked about the result and then "is 3N cold?" Lair: "yes" Weichsel: "what was your hand" Lair told him|pg||
nt|runnerup: bad slam ,but makes -so should be 4 @h +2|pg||
nt|ntmon: this is Euro 2011, Mixed Teams, Swiss stage, Rd  3|pg||
nt|ntmon: teams corrently 5th and 6th met here |pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 1 IMP for Lavazza|pg||

nt|tihana: and unfortune break in hs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hello Tihana, Jon and Vladimir. Have fun|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: Weichsel will have to bid 2@H -- then what?|pg||
nt|henryb:  he redoubled for 1230|pg||
nt|kit: Probably 2NT by Lair|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: efficient bid by N|pg||
nt|tihana: even 3 sp is too high|pg||
nt|tihana: hi|pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky in a way to locate the heart fit|pg||
nt|ntmon: hi Jon|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3@s now?|pg||
nt|tihana: how many tricks in hs make?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: good decision to pass -- and now E-W may get in trouble|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange 1 NT - open 1 @D and bid @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  North passed, East bid 2H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  back up Jan|pg||
nt|ntmon: S may feel too strong for a simple splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @H-shift holds to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d : -500, so a good save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But only South bid @D...|pg||
nt|stc: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Another reason to open1 @D|pg||
nt|stc: 5@s by N is also cold|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not with @H-shift, I told you, morning|pg||
nt|ntmon: actually 12 tricks depends on @D suit, bidding slam is not totally out of question|pg||
nt|ntmon: many will prefer 1NT by N|pg||
nt|ntmon: that would lead to a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: A lot depends on the lead here - a @S would set up discards.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No hope now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why W bids 2@S and not 1@S|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ntmon: of course, game has 5 top losers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: Particularly if Lair reopens with a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Better? My connection's been very good here, so I've stopped looking to make sure the passes register |pg||
nt|kit: This will not be pretty, that's for sure|pg||
nt|stc: yes, u r right|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Robinson asks about signals: "standard but odd/even first discard"|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT non-serious?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Over - but West might even be single @H...|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|kit: cashing ace of hearts seems clear|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: maybe not that clear?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer can emerge with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: N shows 18+ range, S might be interested|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if W shows only 4 card @S then why E 4@S:)?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tihana: Wild Griffins are on 5th place now, Jacob on 7th|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ntmon: there are variations of 2@D enquiry, some of them showing 4M5m - then bidding slam would be easier|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 6@h is a good slam - only going down on a foul trump split|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: oh a change|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: 6 looks easy -- it is  7 I'm wondering about|pg||

nt|mareczek: Hallo everybody from Poznan|pg||

nt|tihana: Yan is serious :)|pg||
nt|ntmon: taking initiative :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: he thought he could beat 6 NT too|pg||
nt|jbgood: not unreasonable|pg||

nt|rv: 2@c seems to be Gazzilli like here|pg||
nt|rv: if Gazzilli it shows one of a) @h+@c 11-20 or b) any 17+ hand|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 2n possibly shows some @c fit and weak hand (<7 hcp)|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|vugraphplf: 2NT is short in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: South decided to sign-off in 4@s and not reveal full information (@d splinter)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|alok_daga: South after hearing 1sp has shown restraint|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Cecilia (South) could have bid 4@d to show 4 card @s raise strong hand with @d stiff|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: can't see a way to bring home this contract on this layout|pg||
nt|alok_daga: why not a dmnd?|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can't handle 4-1 @s break, Madala will play for 3-2 @s break and go down|pg||
nt|alok_daga: well hrt return makes things easier,dmnd reurn cud go 2 off|pg||
nt|rv: on bidding, playing Gazzilli South's 3 level and 4 level bids show distributional hands (5-5 or better) with not much strength (14-16)|pg||
nt|rv: incidentally many specs are asking why Madala responded to 1@h with stiff in partner suit and only 3 hcp (no controls)|pg||
nt|vugraphplf: KO round matchups available at http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/br.html|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "there must have been a better way to do that" Weichsel: "lead A of @hs earlier" Robinson: "if you lead it earlier, I'll probably make another trick - you can't ruff in with ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: it"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|tihana: y, and unfort you cant run to 6d from 6h|pg||
nt|jbgood: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swrunda5.html|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good contract obviously hands too flat|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But in fact, -650 is better for E/W than -620 - then they doÂ´nt think about the 500-sacrifice|pg||
nt|stc: strange things...|pg||
nt|ntmon: perhaps now (@H partscore)|pg||
nt|tihana: 0 scores there, are they playing or what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: as many as 15IMP|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and the now-normal 4-1 break. seems to me these days you have to cater for a 4-1 break and bid accordibly|pg||
mb|d|nt|stc: here NS must open the @Ds quite fast|pg||
nt|danilo1: 4@S may be inetersting ... but what will be really played?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: nver get there|pg||
mb|r|nt|hawe45:  Or play themselves|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kit: Question is how Lair should raise here|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 4 @s with  @h guess once again ,but first you have to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  why wouldn't Lair raise right away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this makes more sense|pg||
nt|henryb:  would 2@c be forcing here?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW may protect and get to a @S patrtscore?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 2@C as expected ... anyone for Dbling minors as North?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: double again|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: so will probably reach the doomed 4@S contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  sorry, I missed the correction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel writes that 2@h = limit raise and Boyd wrote something back that isn't where I can read it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2@S nat game-forcing|pg||
nt|danilo1: he passed, so maybe best action after pd's Rdble is to Dble ... even if made, 2m is not bad|pg||
mb|3S|nt|runnerup: looks like partscore can be made both direction perhaps |pg||
nt|jbgood: one thing I know for sure - NS will not be bothered by the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: can he guess the K@c ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After the bidding, he might - if East shows the @D Ace|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but he will play trump before @d|pg||
nt|ntmon: in my book X over 2@D would be T/O for @H but hand not strong enough|pg||
nt|jbgood: (neither will EW:))|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@S at least North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4 from s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Of course, it isn't 100$ clear for Boyd to continue diamonds when he leads the ace|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2N was natural, I would think that ten fifth of opener's suit would be a turnoff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: I can picture hands where heart shift necessary.  But bidding might help him.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "good luck"|pg||
nt|kit: They do play udca, so 6 won't be readable|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes in club system no big problems to bid,but natural not so easy |pg||
nt|ntmon: 4@S is good contract, will require get @H right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Moment of truth right now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: aggressive|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: well, Dble by Guido was expected ... but not sure about the lead|pg||
nt|jcomyn: making now with good guess|pg||
nt|danilo1: I still rather beleieve in down|pg||
nt|jcomyn: why look at it just play J|pg||
nt|danilo1: do not believe she can avoid 2 trump loosers as well as 2 red Aces|pg||
nt|jcomyn: maybe so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but why the long pause when the j is mandatory|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|stc: any making becuase of @h 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: anyway|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Despite the combined 22 count this is not an easy contract - particularly on this @C lead|pg||
nt|tihana: and go down in both directions :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|tihana: hm|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: so a lose-lose situation :)|pg||
nt|tihana: or win-win for the defence :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  truth and concequences|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|stc: and @d frienly, 3-3 with the 10 showing up|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right -- key was Weichsel's 2NT call -- would be unlikely with doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: glass half-full, half empty??|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|danilo1: West bid 2@C ... so he has 4 ... East who reopened therefore only 2 @C (possible single/double Q) - so @CJ has not been absolute mandatory ... however, good guess|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I could have tried something else" Lair: "did you have 5 spades?" Weichsel: "yeah" Boyd: "3N is down 1 also"|pg||
nt|runnerup: so 200 it was a good  desision to pass 1 @h|pg||
nt|ntmon: @h lead is a natural killer, takes away the entry to club tricks|pg||
nt|tihana: 15:15 after two boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: so all of a sudden it is all square|pg||
nt|tihana: i loove this rooom|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kit: Weichsel holds the rare AK EMPTY ninth|pg||
nt|jbgood: the comeback was fast and furious|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but the doubleton @d is a good sign|pg||
nt|jbgood: E probaply decided to show a major 2 suiter rather than just her spades|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|tihana: i think both 3n and 5 cl make, yes?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|stc: NS may make games in both majors with some good guessing|pg||
nt|runnerup: brave 2 ! and + once again to ns|pg||
nt|tihana: @H and m i guess|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS have 29 hcp combined - and EW are already in 3@hs :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: polish style?|pg||
nt|danilo1: looks like NS playing kind of Polish @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Looked like it would be a dull board, but 4@S was doubled in other room |pg||
nt|ntmon: 1 NT upgraded? but 3NT normal contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|runnerup: this loks like 3nt but even here 14+11 -some pairs might miss this game -clubs all well and dimonds badly .but 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ntmon: due to lucky @C position, 9 tricks ready without needing @D|pg||
nt|ntmon: do we agree with 2@H or prefer negative X passed out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If you play fantan around the corner, that is a really good suit|pg||
nt|ntmon: 3NT best but North could not know about @H position|pg||
nt|tihana: hmm, auken goes strong|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: they need at least one good guess in @h@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West later shows the @S Ace, East must have the @H Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s NO guess|pg||
nt|tihana: making 4?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcarroll: proving yet again that bridge is a bidder's game|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: seems as if NS should stay out of slams this set|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Another @C is correct defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why help declarer?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  Might have killed K-10-x|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|stc: A@s KQ@c and Q@h = 11|pg||
nt|ntmon: going for @D seems percentage action - bad luck |pg||
nt|runnerup: last board was plyed in 2nt inspite off 5-4 in @s but 180 was +6  imps because missguess here in 4 @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I prefer the neg X which may be passed out, but it may also lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|ntmon: seems that Auken explained herself the absence of 3NT bid by N as positive signal (no stopper, no vastage) |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|danilo1: not good guess in @S|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|danilo1: but logical ... after 1@C and 1@H by north and 2@S pass by South, more probable South has 3@S than North|pg||

nt|ntmon: N/s again off the hook|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Michaels cuebid - promising both Majors, not my style with only an 8 count vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  both minors 3-3, @dK onside, @s suit can't be misguessed if led|pg||
nt|stc: NS will play game here|pg||
nt|runnerup: not so easy to bid ,but now known to be in rigth hand if bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|danilo1: Guido will probably not lead @C (beliebve @H)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Lair looking for more it seems|pg||
nt|ntmon: pass over 2@D and X later will be for penalty|pg||
nt|tihana: only a heart|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: I'm surprised Weichsel didn't bid 3@S, unless he feared that would show 3.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably does not expect partner to have such robust majors for 3@d|pg||
nt|ntmon: S afraid of T/O X expecting to be passed out|pg||

pc|hK|pg||

nt|jcomyn: what happend the tried and trusted longest and strongest|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: If they do stumble into slam, a lot will ride on the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and it will depend on whether they play in a minor or NT|pg||
nt|kit: I think they are in slam after this Q-bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting - on the previous hand 3@H went down one in OR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stc: friendly @s and blocked @ds help a lot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: people are talking 6NT, but they aren't getting there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bu @C might be 3-3|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes can be rigth to x some caises,but north passed hand so pass looks ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: we dont know their agreements...|pg||
nt|ntmon: definitely not a low-scoring match|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|stc: playing on @s looks better, the 10 may be short|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: Lair went conservative|pg||
nt|henryb:  we are looking at 4 hands, Kit. I am surprised they got pat 3N|pg||
nt|ntmon: 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ntmon: W in other rooms was more dynamic|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes 8 only -beacuse  @h ruff so some chances to make 9 in clubs so-|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: 5@D is really a pretty poor contract compared to 3NT, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Henry.  Both took unclear views -- Weichsel might have bid 2@C instead of 3@C, Lair might have bid 3NT instead of 3@D, and Weichsel might have bid 3@S instead of 4@C.|pg||
nt|danilo1: no entries for @C lead ... but on any lead, declarer has enought time to develop 2@S tricks - so allways making ... |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and like the club, d opening denies d suit by the looks of things|pg||
nt|danilo1: good choice 3NT instead 4@H, may be swing board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Tries the @C-suit, but wins through the @S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This seems wrong. Try @C 3-3 - and then @S. By starting with @D, opponents might just take their 5 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  starting with @S... sry|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 spades you seems to have too bad suit and too much defensive values|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: depends on how @H are played - but no real choice - so yes it makes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|stc: start with @s is normal, the A@S may be an entry for @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Never seen so bad play - with such a good result. Now even an end-play against West|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|stc: the play is bad only if E has exactly ADxxx of @d|pg||
nt|jbgood: look at Versace's 1 spade inbid on   2 - and you will see why this match is swingy|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|c8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|ntmon: something N has to have finally|pg||
nt|tihana: i got some comments regarding w 1nt, i think it is ok, you?|pg||
nt|danilo1: @S9 is entry too late ... since @C is then 9th trick ... so declarer would on @C lead need only 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jcomyn: righto all|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: as I said, starting with @c may establish the 5th trick for defense with @d 4-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Will certainly get to 3NT, but if overcall gets heart lead things could get interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair: "did you have a jump shift partner?" Weichsel: "a light jump shift" Lair: "very light" Weichsel: "not really, because I made it because of the spots" Boyd: "true"|pg||
nt|ntmon: no problem with 1NT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: i did say maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: well defended ,but board still cost you 9 because your team mates were too aggressive|pg||
nt|runnerup: slam zone -this time  @c easyest|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: not the worst bid I have seen...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Tough choice for Robinson on opening lead, particularly in light of 1@C opening|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he is cold now|pg||
nt|kit: he is?  are you sure?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel: "I hope you're not banking on my club suit"|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h, 3@d and 3 black tricks|pg||
nt|kit: does he really have 3 hearts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weichsel has gone out of the room and there's no one to turn the dummy - Robinson suggests I ask one of you to do it please|pg||
nt|ntmon: 7 or 8 tricks doesn't mean a difference|pg||
nt|runnerup: here ew has to stay low 1 nt looks ok|pg||
nt|tihana: would y bid sth else?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tihana: strange bid 3cl, should south show strong balance?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: a David Bird deal-em-again hand|pg||

nt|ntmon: multi-purpose club and transfer responses in use|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|ntmon: X for penalty|pg||

nt|tihana: my gib says it will make :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

nt|tihana: got explanation: NS plays kind of Polish club so 3@c shows 17+ with 5+@c and 0-2@s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like @C set as trump, now will they go for the pairs 6NT or the safer 6@C?|pg||
nt|tihana: 6CL, wanna bet?|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns can not be a choice 6  @h perhaps can|pg||
nt|runnerup: nt -not really sensibal|pg||

nt|ntmon: huge lead, 25:4 so far|pg||

nt|mareczek: "all in" lead by North|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you or aristotle|pg||

pc|c5|nt|stc: Q@s, 10@h, K@d and KQ@c, FIVE key cards on side !|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bidding like this, you need it|pg||
nt|stc: but passing to the state of the match|pg||
nt|ntmon: theory (Garozzo i think said it) - against strong club, be as soon as possible at 3@S|pg||
nt|mareczek: both rooms opened 1@h with East|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ntmon: good competitive decision by W|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|kit: Perhaps he should not have cashed high heart first, just led spade to dummy, led jack of hearts, and seen if he got a cover|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  He might go up with the @hK on the theory that 1@c is 2 down and either the @hQ drops and he makes 3 or it does not and he is only 1 down|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll:  yes - 2nd worst game contract - 4@S is the only game with any real prospect|pg||
