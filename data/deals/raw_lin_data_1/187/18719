nt|kastan88: Official website for live-scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - we have a match from Group A, where all 6 teams still can win - there are only 9VP from No 1 (Pony) to No 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kacper:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: spec when West will open 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a slam zone hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 !! not afraid|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :) wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for N|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: final contract prob 5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: north leaps to what he thinks he can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the vul is tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west might have opened|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots od defence in the east hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably the right move|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: same auction both tables|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult play hand yet again|pg||
nt|roswolf: south takes the push|pg||
nt|pelu: W sh X on her 2 Aces now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the northpersons will stamp on this now|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a couple of lines and both work (duck club and, if no @h switch, lead @d or lead @s and use 2nd @s to pitch @d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I have to restart|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passing 1@S is optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: yup boring bd to finish with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TexasSouthAfrican.html|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp 5-level - wrong - again :(|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brotherp: @c lead more or less kills the defence ...impossible to play the 9  it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can afford to lose 2 spades it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: logically should pass now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: 4-5 defensive tricks and pd did open|pg||
nt|kastan88: Previous board (11) all credits going for Bep Vriend fast 4@H arrival, must be good result for Dutch team, as both 4@S and 5@C are good sacfrifices against 4@H |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: are thw men sitting north and west?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: -1 or -2 |pg||

pc|s5|nt|pelu: down 2 on best defense|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: the heart J may worry declarer ..|pg||
nt|brotherp: well the @c lead took care of most problems; on a spade or trump lead this looks like an uphill struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 41 may be she thinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: than @DK is needed for 3d @S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|pelu: ???|pg||
nt|kastan88: Today we broadcast Mixed Teams. 90 teams are divided in groups of 6 and play a complete Round-robin of 10 boards.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: nasty surprise in @H won't make anymore|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: now she 's made herself trump short|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: so from +500 to -100|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brotherp: still ok with both spades in North and only 3@d's - some anxious moments though|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Andy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: why not discard a sure @D loser on @HK?|pg||
nt|kastan88: This is 3rd round. After 2 rounds Langer is leader in group L with 41 VP, Zimmermann with 37 VP on 2nd place.|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems an easy grand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 was interesting as to what N should do...he passed 4@h but 4@s certainly had some followers|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: strong club in vogue here|pg||
nt|roswolf: no reason not to play in the club partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: despite the pre-empt perhaps not:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C explained as @D better(:)? than 4@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: can west do anything more than raise to 6?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D why not ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  big club fit but 5@c probably won't make|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: 5@c a nice game - not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|roswolf: north playing in 2/3nt would be a travesty|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Oliver Clarke|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but what next?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in a Mixed event i suppose predictable:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east is very minimum|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  very passive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: North didn't have a good opening call|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bobholl: jan will have to take the risk he daoes|pg||
nt|roswolf: no maybe @C will prevail|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, but did have a reopening dbl|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: 3nt from north will put the question to south|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: if west is there with a punt - sowhat|pg||
nt|roswolf: well good luck comes to his aid|pg||
nt|oliverc: A fairly predictable final contract|pg||
nt|oliverc: Nothing likely to disturb this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oliverc: South effectively endplayed on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pelu: no some of the men know the game and can pass :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often though|pg||
nt|kastan88: how high EW going with their hearts 5@H or even 6@H after possible 5@S? NO, just gave up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: on a @D-lead EW can take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, pass probably right as 4@s wont make (5@c was made in OR)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: my first prediction was right|pg||
nt|roswolf: still south may run the club Q|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by S and not 3@S to tell her hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north  i meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment peter|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but then he sh be in 6@C :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: that's true|pg||
nt|pelu: and on a @S-lead close to make :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: very close|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: run the queen or play the ace?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N did open|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 1@D|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: but bidding a making grand after a preempt is always a good achievemnt so well done|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: welcome back to Wiebe de Jong|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 1@S hand? in OR West open 1@S - and EW in 4@H -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like running the queen since opps sometimes dont cover anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|brotherp: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi again|pg||
nt|bobholl: making fun about ducking the @C twice|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  and despite misguessing the @c, S had enough time to set up @d for @h pitch|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bobholl: good @D switch|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: needs the heart switch - |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: hmm north trying a psychological line|pg||
nt|pelu: Easy for W - he can see the singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: now passive defence will win the day|pg||

mb|d|nt|jcwla: OK so W has bid 2@C, and N has an easy negative double.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: S has @S to mention but not the extras it would take, now N will make a second double showing extra values - and now S can bid 3@S.|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: 3@H now seems obvious, more or less|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jcwla: None of these doubles has anything to do with penalty.  |pg||
nt|xenya: double is also fine|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: N has to think game has chances, might just bid it.|pg||
nt|jcwla: And she has.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|xenya: looks an overbid to me, considering the auction and vulnerability|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: but the club shortage is certainly an asset|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|jcwla: By the way, even though it may have propelled NS into a making game here, W's bid (2@C over 1@D) is one of the best bids you can make.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: There are zillions of hands where making that bid will give even expert opponents least-of-evil choices involving pass, double, or 2 of a suit.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: after the 4. @c play @D from hand - if East play @DK then duck - if smal then endplay on @DK - before|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 imps to denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a freakish deal at last|pg||
nt|bobholl: normal 4@H now|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: difficult hand coming up now|pg||
nt|ampelman: 2@h=5+@s 4+@h 8-14|pg||
nt|pelu: S would prefer a TO X from N :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a conservative 3nt or something more adventurous?|pg||
nt|pelu: B3 flat - 1NT -1!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as north|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ampelman: ten major cards if 8-10|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H flannery?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: solidity|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be feisty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brotherp: cruel @d duplication|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 4@D = @s+@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 tricks should be possible now|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not on a club continuation after winning the diamond ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 9 to france ( was looking at OR results):)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|brotherp: impossible @c lead needed it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance of a club ruff perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: even on a d-lead declarer still has a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|oliverc: perhaps hard to find the J@C lead on this bidding|pg||
nt|bobholl: has to lead small @S from hand to get rid of 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: Standings after 8 of 11 rounds: 1: Drijver-Brink +56,7 2nd Jansma-Paulissen 20,4 3rd Schollaardt wortel +18,1 4th Westra-Bertens +12,5 5th Bakkeren-Bakkeren +4,1|pg||

nt|ampelman: after the 1Major opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks like a trick in every suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|kastan88: Hi Paul and Roland|pg||
nt|pauleger: Hi Jaak|pg||
nt|andyv:  range of NT either 11 or 12 - 14|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes but nobody alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they're probably used to it:)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well done to bid it on limited values. Just needs to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  S could go down if both majors are guessed wrong|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR they did exceptionally well to make 5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: the last one was freakish too ?)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6/6's are always freaks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|granguru:  excellent location of cards for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
nt|ampelman: X=points|pg||
nt|pelu: only :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||

nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 3rd bid for North,  but 2@H looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is spelt  Kuzselka|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 12 tricks - but only with @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  so a @D lead is this hand demanding|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Often the case on a preference auction.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt likely|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4NT feels the right spot though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt pick a slam probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may have shown 15-17 NT now, if they play weak NT as seems likely|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no side entries, E might have tried to find partner|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit behaving, declarer should have no problems making contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: this is more gentle|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pauleger: wonder why N puts in @s4 with nothing in @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kaapo: And the diamond suit is also behaving for the declarer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely though unless south shows his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a long think|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is and understandable :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: s said he'll ask what he shows afterwards :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ampelman: 3NT seems to have 8 tricks on the first look|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: game need @DA + @SQ in S , so nice stop by EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  Declarer can try for 11 playing @h first but he risks a @D rerturn|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this will take some time to play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: can be made after giving up 1@H and than a @D @C squeeze on n|pg||

pc|hA|nt|oliverc: I have to go. Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|d8|pc|c2|pg||

nt|ampelman: @h or @s lead gives the ninth|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some choices which suit to attack first. Clubs might yield game going tricks without letting the opponents in|pg||

nt|andyv:  another 3N hand but tougher to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S looks wet|pg||
nt|jcwla: Likely to play in a 3-level partscore here.|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S or 1NT?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|petepunt: west will prob be forced up to 4@C here too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11Poznan/Bulletins/bul01.pdf  for today's bulletin. I recommend pages 4 through 7 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: if 1Nt = 12-14 then 2@S is the normal bid|pg||
nt|ampelman: 2@H=should be 5+@H + 4+minor|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@D can be won|pg||
nt|granguru:  3@h can also be won as a @S goes on the 4th @C|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|pauleger: 2NT presumably natural here, I personally play it as Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|granguru:  if defense stats with 3@C rounds|pg||
nt|granguru:  starts*|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h was probably Ghestem @S and @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may play 15-17 NT in 4th seat|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@S looks better in 4th hand even if you normally open 1NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|brotherp: easy 3NT...13 tricks seems like a lot though|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@D no @H control|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes this will end up in game i fancy|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u can make 3NT on a @S-lead - but ...:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is thin in the extreme and probably needs to guess the hearts which i think is highly unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://r.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||

nt|granguru:  established*|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, the rest of the bidding looks rather odd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petepunt: East suspects the 4-3 fit :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead might help quite a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  and may have been reason not to bid 2@d (if that weren't conventional)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will defence find their @S tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but S's first bid seemed to be 1N so they must have some system nuances that we aren't aware of|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: hmm n/s didnt even try for the slam bonus|pg||
nt|ewj: I|pg||
nt|petepunt: lot to do here.|pg||

nt|kaapo: Well, hard for east to attack spades|pg||

pc|d2|nt|petepunt: He needs to play N for the AJ@S for many reasons|pg||

nt|pauleger: 1@d shows @hs|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@H is not good news for Tor Helness|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: look at the @S-suit - against 4@h S lead @SK - and N took @SA to play @H = only 3 @S-losers for E|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D or 2@C by West - I prefer 2@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|brotherp: ns are playing some kind of strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW have many possible games here. 3NT was one of the unlucky ones|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This should go down a couple.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: this is a horror hand for e/w to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west should bid 6!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: winning the auction might work out very well anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR 2@C and then 2@S = 4. suit - so the NS didnt know the @S-suit by decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should as west be able to bid 3@D nf here|pg||

pc|h3|nt|bobholl: he showed 5@H 4@D and a minimum|pg||

nt|bobholl: jansma does that (too) often :)|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes that is as maybe but a 6-0 fit is usually to be avoided|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: plenty of chances though|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C suit is interesting here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c not that easy so 4@c should net EW a plus|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was some variant of multi, showing a weak hand with long major (possibly with other options)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H showing some support for both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and 3@h was p/c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brotherp: think Verhees will play West for the @dJ...keeping the dangerous hand of lead|pg||

nt|bobholl: but how to cross ? open up the @H for defenders ?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|pauleger: W will have to exit somewhere now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|granguru:  defense is giving some help|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: east will be squeezed for the overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: only down 1 in 4@h = 11 for Norway|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|granguru:  now the second @D permits to re-enter dummy |pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|granguru:  but declarer went for the finesse that didnt work|pg||
nt|andyv:  so W may be relying on bringing in the @h suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: so "only" down 1|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand putting not putting the J@c in.  It seemed like a no cost play|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, NOT putting:)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|bobholl: now N thinks he's endplayed :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzhd: A very short break now|pg||
nt|roswolf: east letting a club go early|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|9|nt|granguru:  as he/she could make just 1 @H finesse |pg||
nt|andyv:  so declare was relying on the @h suit...and 7 imps to Zimmermann|pg||

nt|petepunt: this has been a good come back by fredins team here|pg||
nt|pelu: a biddinbg misunderstand - and unlucky lead chanced 650 to 1090|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not sure east would take out if west stood it - a golden rule seems to be to leave such decisions to the better player(ahem ie the man):)|pg||
nt|pauleger: Team Langer closing the gap|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, that's one way :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|roswolf: this is a Mixed Competition and it has its own dynamics|pg||
nt|pelu: remember Board 17, where u would like W to bid 3@D NF - W in OR could that and are npw playing a hopeless 3@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 17 should give some to Jankova|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: E has a normal pass, but E/W are cold for 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: good hand for 2 suiters even with 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could also play @H to J, cash spade and end play south|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c some type of constructive raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a direct raise to game isnt stupid|pg||
nt|pelu: I have been told that 1-3 from the group go to A-swiss and 4-6 to B-swiss, then 27 from A and 5 from B to Knock-out - is that correct??|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that sounds usual|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Yes|pg||
nt|pelu: wild cards in this sektion|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the limit for both sides is the 5 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
nt|roswolf: north really cant bid more|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know what the 2NT range is but a queen and a jack opposite a big hand is going to play about as well as one would expect it would.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  very difficult not to make 5 on this hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: the vul sac in 6@DX was very tough to find|pg||
nt|pelu: so 6@d x is the par-contract|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: \|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong Q by N :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ok|pg||
nt|granguru:  E should have asked Stayman or just passed|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now west was -2 elsewhere, how can East do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||
nt|pelu: @hQ will defeat 4@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: sorry he made 3@D :(|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ampelman: after the 3@h bid the @hQ lead is too tough to find|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3NT in the open room. Don´t really know, if E showed 14-16 there or upgraded her hand to a 15-17 NT, however, W directly jumped to game|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobholl: 4@H 2@C 3@S may be |pg||
nt|brotherp: small spade or small club both seem attractive|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: what is 3@H?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphpl9: nobody alerted|pg||
nt|ampelman: no alert so natural ?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: iI think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: semi-bluff|pg||
nt|ampelman: lead-prohibator :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  not a bad idea to establish a @S |pg||
nt|jcwla: Bidders who thread the needle and stop short of game on hands where it is truly impossible to tell how many tricks will make nevertheless make bids like this where it's just down 2 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: from now until doomsday.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: why is it "not bridge" to try for plus 130 instead of minus 140?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Would be a lovely idea to establish a @S - maybe on board 20.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: small @D ?|pg||
nt|brotherp: think so; in the bidding and play East's 4441 is known so...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south knows his partner has 4 diamonds...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still a lot off guessing to be done by van Prooijen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps the diamond 9...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobholl: k@D @C looks best|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|petepunt: or to try for -420 v -170 :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|pelu: West find partner with the best possible cards - and still down 1 - could easy cost 500 to bid 4@D|pg||

nt|kaapo: Four more rounds of swiss today|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: nice slam here|pg||
mb|2S|an|Nat|nt|pelu: agree, Peter, 4@D now is a gamble - almost like all-in|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@S - 2NT = invit with 4+@s for sure 3@H cant be naturel|pg||
nt|ampelman: 9 tricks for NS in a @h contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: inverted raise to start with?|pg||
nt|ampelman: splinter bid ?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Bid it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems fairly cold for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1086 a stop!?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I am not sure but Kopecky said 2s is transfer to nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural seems to be even a better treatment...less info given to opps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Multon hits declarers @D suit once again|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not what a little birdie told me.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N opener had interesting effect of preventing N from showing the @h suit...compare to the auction in OR|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
nt|pelu: still hard fight for the first 3 places in this group: 62-61-60-60-57-54 VP's|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||

nt|andyv:  minutes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile S has all sorts of problems here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe Madsen enters dummy in clubs to play towards @SA again|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
nt|roswolf: everyone is pointing out that by ducking a spade 3nt is defeated - in practicethat means a small spade lead from north which might well not be found|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
nt|ampelman: hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: especially if west bid it -|pg||
nt|kaapo: But East can win @SA, play heart to king and then 3rd heart after ace|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so bad|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: easy claim|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this looks only -1|pg||

nt|brotherp: setting up clubs sure is|pg||
nt|andyv:  finally went for the 3-3 @ss|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: cashing a top honour is more attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: can u explain why E bid 5@C and not 5@d???|pg||
nt|roswolf: no peter|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pauleger: W is not afraid to put N in|pg||
