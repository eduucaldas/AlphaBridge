nt|jaapfr: careless S to throw a @C away (the @H 6432 seem pretty useless|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  North and South do not play 3 @C the same "way"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: but with both major 3-3 a lot of play for N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 3nt -2??|pg||
nt|bobholl: fireworks but with ew vulnarable not too high :)|pg||
nt|buddyshah: To open or not to  open|pg||
nt|bobholl: n hand lot of options 1@H 2@D or even 2@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: must be @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: otherwise 2S forcingbid maybe  surely not 4H|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well next 1|pg||
nt|murat: she lead heart but then shifted to club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better take HERE first @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 30-7 for Baltic after 1. segment|pg||
nt|davpro: will they find the @hs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: this cud b playing at 5 level--action!!!|pg||
nt|bobholl: that's an option i missed :) but good |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: i can buy that and i love splinters, but have never used in this auction in an unbid suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat: he even took it|pg||
nt|murat: by the way 5@d seems better|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D can|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|pelu: strange misunderstanding un this levcel, but 61H sh be ok|pg||
nt|davpro: 4@d was (probably) improvising. 4@h passable. 6@d IS tourmenting for W :)|pg||
nt|davpro: A lot of tricks in 6@h, but on a @c lead there will be severe problems...|pg||

nt|pelu: sorry 12 IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: cud well b a swing --this last bd|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|007 joosth: 1H a bit risky, but pass is also with some risk|pg||
