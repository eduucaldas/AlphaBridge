nt|vugraphpld: Exciting competition between two english teams|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: Hello Joanna and Krishna|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphpld: redouble was alerted but lat either as balanced or transfer hand|pg||
nt|psyck: & which one does he have? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphpld: propably transfer for @C:)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|ralfwil: an overbid from E in my opinion. 1nt is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: East has alerted the redouble of Partner after 3rd round of bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: they played a relatively more normal transfer bid on 1M-(x) other table|pg||
nt|psyck: agree Ralf|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|psyck: but maybe the redouble confused her as much as it did us|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: the standard lead against NT 2nd or 4th|pg||

nt|vugraphpld: hello|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|chick: We're starting out with a straightforward 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: The spade suit is the interesting one here ... declarer needs to guard against QJxx, and that means taking a first round finesse in spades|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: helloDavid and Victor|pg||

nt|gulyas: 5@C looks decent except for the bad @H break|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play on @Ds, you get home, but if you think you can make with the @H suit, you will be disappointed|pg||

nt|odysseus69: unlucky 6 hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but declarer didn´t take a count when played @hQ. should exit with a small @h for -1|pg||
nt|chick: South is fortunate that the spades split 3-2, otherwise could have lost a spade trick too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|psyck: good enough slam here needing not much more than @h break|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphpld: pass was changed to 2@S|pg||
mb|6H|nt|dburn: crikey - Callaghan on the lager again|pg||
mb|6S|nt|psyck: they stopped ealily other table after N's hand was not improved by the splinter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Brian Callaghan has been playing in his mixed team mode throughout this event|pg||
nt|dburn: but this isn't a deal where he wants to keep the opponents out of slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt on N after a @s lead!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another way of saying he is bidding on peanuts|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's hard to keep Mrs P out of things|pg||
nt|dburn: Senior won't think he's being asked to bid six with spade control - just evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|dburn: which is pretty useless in context, given that he doubled at the three level already|pg||
nt|psyck: with his not so great holding in red suits, will pass|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just what Brian Senior wanted t hear- he knows he should bid 6 but will he?|pg||
nt|dburn: he knows he shouldn't bid six - how can he?|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: Brian looks very confused|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: the cards are next to bidding-box now and he looks at the wall:)|pg||
nt|psyck: well 5@h bid should be clear as natural & a slam try|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he has 2 and half goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: hope the paint on the wall dries off soon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I would expect him to bid 6 - 5H is a very big bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: He can expect a bad split in @h on the bidding. |pg||
nt|vugraphpld: he explained 5@H to EAST as strong hand:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: this auction got awfully high awfully fast|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H had no chance, and 6@S even less |pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: just in case East thought it was pre-emptive, perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the diamonds split Ok - but its the hearts that matter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @cA I think S can make|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear - maybe a club back will leave declarer an entry short|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear how she can avoid 2@h losers|pg||
nt|dburn: she can contrive an endplay in most cases, but I am not sure about all cases|pg||

nt|gulyas: the auction was much different in the CR, made E feel she has a cheap sacrifice (true) vs a making vul slam (not true)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|gulyas: still, it was safe, losing only 5 imps for the extra down|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pauleger: Qx worth a 2NT bid?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Berger   Austria   then all is fine|pg||
