nt|roswolf: trump again lo|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  push|pg||

nt|roswolf: a diversionary effort from tor?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be interesting|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|spooky: a very weak 1@S from Tor|pg||

nt|roswolf: amazing|pg||
mb|2N|an|.|mb|p|nt|roswolf: SOUTH MUST PROTECT SURELY|pg||

nt|roswolf: heart support?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H is ROUTINE BYT NORTH MAY BID ON|pg||
nt|roswolf: a high level adventure wont work out too good on this layout|pg||
mb|3N|an|.|nt|djneill:  I wonder if South will be able to show this strong a hand?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very mysterious|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: NS had to many HCP to believe Tors opening|pg||
nt|roswolf: brian and sandra come from Yorkshire - a region known for its blunt way of speaking|pg||
nt|roswolf: competent bidding|pg||
nt|spooky: with everything right for declarer, they will make 12 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: ty:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: sorry the caps key is having a life of its own:(|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes lots of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: well i would like it better if the @ss split better :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: anyhow this should make nicely with the 10@s dropping and A@H in S|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: 4@S seemed natural or even a raise to 4@H was possible - passing seems very wet|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: ups...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: shut down and reconnect to the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d lead might have been made on the assumption that if pd ,who surely has lots of hcps ,passed it must be because he has openers suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: at some tables N might bid 1@s over 1@d|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||

nt|roswolf: but escapes with a scratch|pg||

mb|4D|an|.|nt|granguru:  4@H should have been  the minimum...problem is that it might lead to a wrong lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|an|.|nt|roswolf: this auction will peter out in some partscore -2@H!?|pg||
