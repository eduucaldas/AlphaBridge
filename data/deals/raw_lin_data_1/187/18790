mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|nt|gavin:  you always hear people at the club saying "I open with A, K, A (West)"|pg||

nt|gavin:  it looks obvious to ruff but with the preempt over her a bad trump break very possible|pg||
nt|gavin:  when thinking about it, she must assume they will continue leading spades (if trumps are breaking badly)|pg||

mb|p|nt|gavin:  west's distribution makes her hand a comfortable texas transfer|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gavin:  when agreeing to play texas transfers its important to discuss whether you play them in competition|pg||
nt|gavin:  and when the bids cease to be texas|pg||
mb|d|nt|gavin:  I'm a fan of using texas over 1NT (3D)|pg||
nt|gavin:  or even 3H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|gavin:  but its commonly played only up until a 3C overcall|pg||
nt|gavin:  when both bids are jumps|pg||
mb|2S|nt|newmoon: not enough to explore for slam, so looking for best game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|newmoon: in MPs, it may be right to go back to @Hs by North|pg||
nt|tec123: a club partial will be a good stop here, but South may try again over a 3C raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  this contract had its chances but we can see the club finesse is offside (rather expected)|pg||
nt|gavin:  but still can be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|gavin:  4S can go down|pg||
nt|gavin:  by leading a diamond and using the ace of hearts entry to get a ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: a normal @C-lead gives the overtrick|pg||

nt|gavin:  right will surely lose 1@S and 2@D, need to avoid 2 trump losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  and the two ways to play the suit to avoid 2 losers|pg||
nt|gavin:  are if you think the layout is as it lies with east having honor doubeton|pg||
nt|gavin:  you lead the jack of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: ladies talking, bridge stuff|pg||
nt|gavin:  now if east doesnt cover the ace will drop the king|pg||
nt|gavin:  if east does cover then you win the ace and lead towards the ten|pg||
nt|gavin:  however that would not work if east has Q9x and west has Kx|pg||
nt|gavin:  as east would not cover with Q9x and have a sure trick later|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tec123: I think he will struggle without help to find the 8th trick as there is no entry to dummy for the @H finesse|pg||
nt|newmoon: I am lost with this bidding...  conventional meanings|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin:  so if you think the hearts are reversed|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tec123: This will be a good slam to bid, making when there is only 1 possible heart loser and all the clubs disappear on the AK @D and the established 5th @D|pg||
nt|newmoon: 6@H available here - even on @C lead - he has to smother @H10 dbleton on his right|pg||
nt|newmoon: on North's left, i.e.|pg||

nt|newmoon: Egypt beat SA yesterday - we saw it all on VUgraph - here is the transcript:  http://www.sabf.co.za/tunisia/bb1.htm|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|gavin:  you must begin the suit by leading low from Axx|pg||
nt|newmoon: @CA intact, @Ds blocked...  exit a diamond now|pg||
nt|newmoon: in the fullness of time, the @C9 makes!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gavin:  then if west has Honor doubleton they can fly up|pg||
nt|gavin:  but now you can finesse east|pg||
nt|gavin:  and if they dont fly their honor will drop under the ace|pg||
nt|wygbe1: moment of truth coming up - knows w has 5s, so might play w for the shortness|pg||
nt|tec123: Now declarer must win the spade in hand, cash 2 top hearts hoping the Q drops, and when it does not set about serring up the diamond suit for three club discards|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|gavin:  leading the jack has the added bonus of being able to pick up KQx in east and 9x with west|pg||

mb|2S|nt|newmoon: he went 2@S... I am more conservative, in 5th seat, vul|pg||
nt|newmoon: 4th seat|pg||

nt|newmoon: yes, esp at white v/s red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: other room says 2s -1|pg||
nt|newmoon: in SA, we use the phrase "at these colours"|pg||
nt|newmoon: meaning at "favourable" or non-vul/vul|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tec123: 3@D should show a good hand if playing Good/Bad 2NT as we would compete with 2N with same shape and less points|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|newmoon: hehehe  5@C now?|pg||
nt|newmoon: no?   wow|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|newmoon: 2@S a bit risky here, as West can still be 17-18 and if he has KJx @S, an easy 500 pickup|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|tec123: Presumably 1N was forcing and 2@C was better minor - South has now bid 2@S in a situation where the opposition have already passed a lot of information.|pg||
nt|newmoon: East lets 2@S off the hook|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry, trouble with the Internet connexion...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|newmoon: this is the kind of board where anything is possible in OR.   |pg||
nt|tec123: I would bid 5@C - this one has chances as North is going to be endplayed after 3 trumps and a @H exit|pg||
nt|tec123: Good pass by North - using the Law's adage of "Eight Never, Nine Ever" knowing that their spade fit will be only eight cards|pg||
nt|newmoon: 3@H is precarious|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tec123: 5 top losers, and a possible diamond to worry about, though the lead may help with that|pg||

mb|3D|nt|newmoon: sensible jump by Bosie to shut out the bidding|pg||

nt|tec123: might be some blood now|pg||
nt|newmoon: remember 1@D denied 4-card major.  So 3@H must be longer @Cs?|pg||
nt|tec123: True, but a simple t/out dbl would have been lower and carried a similar message|pg||
nt|newmoon: if it COULD be, North must pass the x, and South will 4@C|pg||
nt|newmoon: yes, of course, a t/o of 2@S|pg||
nt|newmoon: or even 2NT|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|tec123: 4@S looks a fair contract against normal breaks - the 4/1 spade break makes it difficult yjough as if East is forced to ruff, we would be cut off from the @H suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|tec123: With spades 4-4 and club right 3N can make EW - 5@C down as @H finesse loses|pg||
nt|newmoon: A-K-J-10 7th is solid?   today it is, with Qx dropping!    LOL|pg||
nt|jjsb: P P 1@d x P and..  i guess actualy not much choice and u have to bid 1@s |pg||
mb|4D|nt|jjsb: oh ok .. see patrice like to overcall solid....|pg||
mb|p|nt|newmoon: in OR, EAST opens 1@H.  They settle in 4@H|pg||
nt|tec123: With 2 quick tricks East should pass rather than bale out to 4@C despite lack of @S stopper - potentially a very good result for Tunisia|pg||
nt|glensa: this might end the auction|pg||
nt|jjsb: can we considere that "solid"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: i am a doubler Glen , am i wrong?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|glensa: that is defintely solid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|glensa: I am with Patrice on this one. I don't much value the q of diamonds, and don't want to play a 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|jjsb: good point |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|newmoon: an ace is the std. lead against a gambling 3NT... gets encouragement|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzhc: Sorry trouble with connexion...|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|newmoon: West made a "state of the match" bid... knows that up to now, they have had a good session in this room|pg||
nt|tec123: 4@H should make as well though as @H are 3-3 and the same club suit is equally useful|pg||
nt|newmoon: and, in 3rd seat, at these colours (favourable) 3NT is very descriptive|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|newmoon: Tim - I expected more swingy boards - something like the set you had against the Italians in the quarters of the BB some 4 years ago(?) where 3 slam swings won the match|pg||
nt|tec123: The 4-3 fit will play well here though I would have chosen 3@C rather than 2@S as the 1@H bid rather than double denied spades|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|tec123: Maybe 19 & 20 will be swingy - still not a flat match as 66 IMPs have changed hands already|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|jjsb: ok so just made it will be as far as i see |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|glensa: this is ping pong play and defense. Donde asked for a spade, got a diamond, which Patrice should have discarded a spade on|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|newmoon: a lucky make here as South and not North has the dbleton @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|tec123: running the 81S would have worked better, but with N having J@S this will still come home|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|newmoon: as the cards lie, u can make 4@S+1, but no slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|newmoon: partner is a passed hand.  Improbable to find 4 tricks there, so perhaps 4@S opening in 4th seat is best?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|newmoon: or even 1@S - then 4@S, since partner can be broke|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: 4@s will be reached here i assume |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|newmoon: both rooms are playing fast now... seems that there was a time warning.   Both operators couldn't keep up with play|pg||
nt|newmoon: as we said before 1@h maybe with 4 cards and 1@s relay|pg||
nt|newmoon: Mostafa is back|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|newmoon: and yes, Tim, bd 16 could have been a wash in 3@Dx both rooms.    Really, was that a 3@D bid, vul, 1st seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: surprised she did not opeen 1nt as they are playing that weak vulnerable ... |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jjsb: they migth change ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: well ok maybe they changed... |pg||
mb|4S|nt|tec123: In the modern style (Every hand an Adventure and bid whenever you can) it was a 3@D opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glensa: sylvain, is this reunion style to rebid 1nt, i am a raiser to 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|newmoon: in OR, South 1NT, North 3NT, swish|pg||
nt|tec123: A spade lead can beat 3N provided E snatches his aces when a minor suit is played|pg||
pc|s9|nt|newmoon: possible dble-swing now.   200 here + 100 from OR = 300 = 7 IMPs to Tunisia             provided they get 3@H here -2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jjsb: we are french .. so i guess we are not "used" to that 3card fit ... i like also 2@s here |pg||

mb|p|nt|tec123: A daring 6H contract making when @D are 3-3 and @H 2-2 ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tec123: 4@S possible here (on spade finesse) - will it be bid?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|tec123: After only bidding 1@S over 2@H a splinter to 4@C may have got them there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tec123: West must discard a @H in order to make now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|newmoon: and luck favours the brave... trumps 2-2 and @Ds are kind|pg||
