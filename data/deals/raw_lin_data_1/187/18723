mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kaapo: Welcome to the second round of semifinals of the open European mixed teams|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some live results are here: http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Kari|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: Hi Andy and Joanna (operator)|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: :)Hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 8 tricks in NT|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  but a good sac against the @d partial|pg||
mb|4N|mb|d|nt|kaapo: A French team against an English team, though the English team has some immigrants|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems like all teams have that nowadays|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  DeBotton currently sitting 6th and Payen 9th in the A group|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  not sure why S felt compelled to go to the 5 level|pg||
nt|kaapo: I don't think she was asking for aces at least|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, probably wanted to play 4N but then ran after the dbl|pg||
nt|andyv:  not dbld, the result will be ok|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|kaapo: Canonne bid her hearts first and got a chance to show diamonds later. With 5@H she wouldn't bother to bid @d so she probably has more @Ds than @Hs|pg||
pc|c7|mc|9|pg||
qx|c1|st||md|3SQJ952HK752D9C974,S84HAJ98DJ86432C3,S76HT6DA5CAKJT852,SAKT3HQ43DKQT7CQ6|sv|o|nt|oliverc: Given the K@H with North, perhaps it would have been more sensible to cash the|pg||
nt|oliverc: A@D after the A@H and then lead Ace and a small @S. If South wins, more likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: find the A@C with North and South might have been endplayed anyway|pg||
nt|brotherp: funny result in open room|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brotherp: weak nt or maybe upgraded because of the nice features|pg||
nt|brotherp: tactical decision needed by East|pg||
nt|brotherp: 3@d anyone?|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion thinks long :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure...and an unusual aution in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: a good weak 2?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good player, though|pg||
nt|peachy: All events transnational.  This is Round 5 of qualifying round robins in 15 groups of 6 teams each in the Mixed Teams.  This match is from Group I, between current first and 5th ...|pg||
nt|peachy: place teams in the group.|pg||

nt|peachy: Results website http://www.poznan2011.pl/  where running scores are available.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|brotherp: dbl showing a 4 card major and a longer minor; quite a common treatment in NL|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the slam zone just about|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html for standings|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: 3@d now ?!|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess marion will bid 3@D now|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 2@C by S -- must be some gadget showing the majors?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: but 6@C is no thing of beauty |pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is certainly a normal contract|pg||

nt|xenya: hello Constantin|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: again all very normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pas seems to turn out ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: remarkable decision imo; anyway 2@h will handle nicely also - barring the unfindable trump lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably cdonsidering the diamond guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: meike (wortel) THINKS LONG AND LEADS A @h|pg||
nt|brotherp: excellent lead :>|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ok now, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: and doesnt seem to be too difficult|pg||
nt|andyv:  at this point, Zimmermann third and Denmark 39th in the Swiss A|pg||
nt|stc: hi|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|wilkinsona: oh, right|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||

pc|s4|nt|xenya: anyway EW were bound to buy contract on this one|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|stc: yes, many play Stayman in this position|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: now @H and @D ??|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump now will cause a bit of anguish|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S prob @C-support, but singleton @DQ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  ?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|bobholl: @C now and another @D ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is lucky that the @S 6 is now high enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: will play @C now surely|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if yuo switch @D A and @C Q ??|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  operator, are we sure about the @h play?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think he is thinking far too much - especially when there is an obvious line|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brotherp: funny position; only 2 more trumps for ew now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: 11 tricks are available |pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: A sporty opening, but at third hand favourable anything goes|pg||
nt|andyv:  chance for EW to have huge pick up|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk8: Good morning to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||

nt|kaapo: But Janet bid it already once in order to play there|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  it would seem that dbl would be take out and 4N more likely to play but maybe I have it backwards|pg||
mc|8|nt|dburn: I would interpret it as one place to play|pg||
pg||

nt|kastan88: Official website for live-scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - we have a match from Group A, where all 6 teams still can win - there are only 9VP from No 1 (Pony) to No 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kacper:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: spec when West will open 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a slam zone hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3 !! not afraid|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :) wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for N|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: final contract prob 5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: north leaps to what he thinks he can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the vul is tempting|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a routine 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west might have opened|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots od defence in the east hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably the right move|pg||
mb|1H|nt|wilkinsona: same auction both tables|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult play hand yet again|pg||
nt|roswolf: south takes the push|pg||
nt|pelu: W sh X on her 2 Aces now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the northpersons will stamp on this now|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a couple of lines and both work (duck club and, if no @h switch, lead @d or lead @s and use 2nd @s to pitch @d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I have to restart|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passing 1@S is optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: yup boring bd to finish with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TexasSouthAfrican.html|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: I exp 5-level - wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|stc: with thje 10 @d in NS the slam would be quite fair - how to localize this ??|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brotherp: @c lead more or less kills the defence ...impossible to play the 9  it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can afford to lose 2 spades it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: logically should pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 4-5 defensive tricks and pd did open|pg||
nt|kastan88: Previous board (11) all credits going for Bep Vriend fast 4@H arrival, must be good result for Dutch team, as both 4@S and 5@C are good sacfrifices against 4@H |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think NS will go any higher or EW will sacrifice in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: are thw men sitting north and west?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: 4@s is a bad save|pg||
nt|stc: and they avoided it, wd|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: -1 or -2 |pg||
nt|pelu: 3x@D best defense now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: down 2 on best defense|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: as has been pointed out, easy 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: the heart J may worry declarer ..|pg||
nt|brotherp: well the @c lead took care of most problems; on a spade or trump lead this looks like an uphill struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 41 may be she thinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: than @DK is needed for 3d @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|pelu: ???|pg||
nt|kastan88: Today we broadcast Mixed Teams. 90 teams are divided in groups of 6 and play a complete Round-robin of 10 boards.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: nasty surprise in @H won't make anymore|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|bobholl: now she 's made herself trump short|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: so from +500 to -100|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brotherp: still ok with both spades in North and only 3@d's - some anxious moments though|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Hello Andy|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: why not discard a sure @D loser on @HK?|pg||
nt|kastan88: This is 3rd round. After 2 rounds Langer is leader in group L with 41 VP, Zimmermann with 37 VP on 2nd place.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk1: and welcome to Kari|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: 8 of @H now |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oliverc: hmmm|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brotherp: mmm|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C ruff beats it|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: lucky|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hello|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland and Kari|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oliverc: Something of a comedy of errors there|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: A short break|pg||
nt|brotherp: indeed|pg||
nt|brotherp: after the club lead declarer only needs hearts 3-2|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: looked odd for sure|pg||
nt|kastan88: At the end of the Round-robin the first 3 teams from each group will qualify for Swiss A and the other teams for Swiss B.|pg||
mc|12|nt|stc: I don't like the 2nd @d, assume E ruffs the K@d|pg||
pg||

nt|kaapo: Mixed pairs are rarely regular partnerships so there may be lack of agreements in situations like this|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s seems to be a decent contract|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kaapo: Or do NS play together a bit more?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|dburn: this pair plays together quite a lot|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|andyv:  looks like a Kokish relay but S hand not that strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is Kokish|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, apparently south is showing some balanced hand via 2@H|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|andyv:  S must be giving extra weight to her 5 card @s suit|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe she likes her spades a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@c puppet|pg||
nt|dburn: and North always uses Stayman|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dburn: 3@c asks for four-card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Though not that much that she'd describe this hand as a hand with lots of spades|pg||
nt|dburn: we do not play puppet Stayman in the de Botton team|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  in OR, S opened 2@c and was allowed to play it in 2N |pg||
nt|andyv:  so, this treatment, for this hand, seems better|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|dburn: nor do we play support doubles, or any other ridiculous conventions|pg||
nt|kaapo: North got to declare thanks to the method|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kaapo: What do you play then, Bridge? :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|dburn: he usually does|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he has an entry to his hand now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: so he can play diamonds before having to play hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: but he still has to guess without much to go on, though East should have dropped the king on the third diamond|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|sK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: he car ruff a club to mark time and possibly gain more distributional information|pg||
nt|dburn: on which East should probably have played the ten or the nine|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  looks like guessed right|pg||

nt|xenya: agreed|pg||
nt|stc: In team @c to the A is much safer|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: this seems an easy grand to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  22 was interesting as to what N should do...he passed 4@h but 4@s certainly had some followers|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong club in vogue here|pg||
nt|roswolf: no reason not to play in the club partscore|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: despite the pre-empt perhaps not:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C explained as @D better(:)? than 4@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: can west do anything more than raise to 6?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D why not ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  big club fit but 5@c probably won't make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@c a nice game - not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|roswolf: north playing in 2/3nt would be a travesty|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Oliver Clarke|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but what next?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in a Mixed event i suppose predictable:)|pg||
nt|stc: in fact anyway @c to the A is better|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S on a @H guess here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: east is very minimum|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  very passive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: North didn't have a good opening call|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobholl: jan will have to take the risk he daoes|pg||
nt|roswolf: no maybe @C will prevail|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, but did have a reopening dbl|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt from north will put the question to south|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: if west is there with a punt - sowhat|pg||
nt|roswolf: well good luck comes to his aid|pg||
nt|oliverc: A fairly predictable final contract|pg||
nt|oliverc: Nothing likely to disturb this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oliverc: South effectively endplayed on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pelu: no some of the men know the game and can pass :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often though|pg||
nt|kastan88: how high EW going with their hearts 5@H or even 6@H after possible 5@S? NO, just gave up|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: on a @D-lead EW can take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, pass probably right as 4@s wont make (5@c was made in OR)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: my first prediction was right|pg||
nt|roswolf: still south may run the club Q|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by S and not 3@S to tell her hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north  i meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment peter|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but then he sh be in 6@C :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: that's true|pg||
nt|pelu: and on a @S-lead close to make :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: very close|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: run the queen or play the ace?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N did open|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 1@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: but bidding a making grand after a preempt is always a good achievemnt so well done|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s7|nt|xenya: but 2N can be beaten with careful defence|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome back to Wiebe de Jong|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 1@S hand? in OR West open 1@S - and EW in 4@H -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like running the queen since opps sometimes dont cover anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not any longer|pg||
nt|stc: defense had 6 quick tricks but.... |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brotherp: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Tony Wilkinson|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi again|pg||
nt|bobholl: making fun about ducking the @C twice|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  and despite misguessing the @c, S had enough time to set up @d for @h pitch|pg||
nt|xenya: once E has discarded a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: good @D switch|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs the heart switch - |pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: hmm north trying a psychological line|pg||
nt|pelu: Easy for W - he can see the singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: now passive defence will win the day|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: but declarer played on diamonds, not clubs, and lost four tricks in that suit plus a long heart|pg||
nt|dburn: which was perhaps unlucky rather than foolish|pg||
nt|dburn: the jack isn't the normal lead from this holding|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually lost 8@s which turned out to be the entry to S's @ds|pg||

nt|ampelman: 1@c=16+ any|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brotherp: seems like 4@h made needs some defensive cooperation|pg||

nt|brotherp: 5@d really in the picture now|pg||
nt|pauleger: I won´t raise to 3@c here as well|pg||
nt|pauleger: though partner may have 17 count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jordan|pg||
nt|granguru:  excellent location of cards for EW|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
nt|ampelman: X=points|pg||
nt|pelu: only :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to have bid recklessly here|pg||
nt|granguru:  cross ruf can produce a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|stc: last making contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @D was the contract to be in but paulissens pass is understandable|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and another spec points out the attractions of 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 3rd bid for North,  but 2@H looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is spelt  Kuzselka|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 12 tricks - but only with @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  so a @D lead is this hand demanding|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Often the case on a preference auction.|pg||
nt|stc: was 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: over board|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: 6nt likely|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4NT feels the right spot though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt pick a slam probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may have shown 15-17 NT now, if they play weak NT as seems likely|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no side entries, E might have tried to find partner|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit behaving, declarer should have no problems making contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: this is more gentle|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pauleger: wonder why N puts in @s4 with nothing in @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: And the diamond suit is also behaving for the declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely though unless south shows his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a long think|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is and understandable :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: s said he'll ask what he shows afterwards :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ampelman: 3NT seems to have 8 tricks on the first look|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: game need @DA + @SQ in S , so nice stop by EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  Declarer can try for 11 playing @h first but he risks a @D rerturn|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: this will take some time to play|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: can be made after giving up 1@H and than a @D @C squeeze on n|pg||
nt|granguru:  return*|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|oliverc: I have to go. Thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: it looks as if either W doesn't have the 3@S bid or E the raise |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|petepunt: usefull to play 4n as quant after going through 4th suit as many othet forcing bids avail|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|stc: a good observation from specs : penalty X not allowed in Mixte|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: i am sure declarer will ultimately play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|ampelman: @h or @s lead gives the ninth|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks -2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some choices which suit to attack first. Clubs might yield game going tricks without letting the opponents in|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pauleger: 2NT presumably natural here, I personally play it as Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|granguru:  if defense stats with 3@C rounds|pg||

nt|kaapo: Will defence find their @S tricks?|pg||

nt|pelu: lets see: Gotard in 3Nt on a @S lead to @sQ|pg||

nt|hedyg: if it was -1 could you pls correct the score?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a hand where you dont want to be declarer|pg||

nt|pelu: what will Gunn Heolness bbid now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C by east would have delighted west more|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H is not good news for Tor Helness|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|pelu: look at the @S-suit - against 4@h S lead @SK - and N took @SA to play @H = only 3 @S-losers for E|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D or 2@C by West - I prefer 2@c|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brotherp: ns are playing some kind of strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW have many possible games here. 3NT was one of the unlucky ones|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: This should go down a couple.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a horror hand for e/w to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west should bid 6!?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: winning the auction might work out very well anyway|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: in OR 2@C and then 2@S = 4. suit - so the NS didnt know the @S-suit by decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should as west be able to bid 3@D nf here|pg||
nt|pauleger: I would expect more points or more shape for a 2@s bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  8 tricks for a coorect defense|pg||

pc|d5|pg||

nt|ampelman: losing 2@s 2@c 1@d ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 black losers|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobholl: tricky play |pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 cards open not difficult but |pg||
nt|brotherp: best lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma does that (too) often :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: may even lead @H here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is as maybe but a 6-0 fit is usually to be avoided|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: plenty of chances though|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C suit is interesting here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c not that easy so 4@c should net EW a plus|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some variant of multi, showing a weak hand with long major (possibly with other options)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H showing some support for both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and 3@h was p/c|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brotherp: think Verhees will play West for the @dJ...keeping the dangerous hand of lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks logical|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to cross ? open up the @H for defenders ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, @C 4-1 makes life much harder|pg||
nt|andyv:  some play that as invite in @s and some play it as furthering the preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 5@c bid from E, worried about pushing opps to slam?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3NT in Board 6 was played by East - no chance on a @S-lead - but only down 1 - same play in @h as here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ampelman: in 16 other room plays 4@hX|pg||
nt|ampelman: where east bid here 2@s and 3@s|pg||
nt|ampelman: which ended the auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: the dealing computer is producing some fine hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: May get to 3NT now as west opened|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  all roads point to 1 or 2NT for EW...NS just don't have enough to compete|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: in pairs it was rigth to play @D in imp @C seems rigth|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: wow: in OR 2@H by S - pass? by West and 4@H by N - no X|pg||
nt|granguru:  no good fit for no one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3rd seat opening..i might open 1@c for the lead if i open, even if 5-5|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: 4@H incroyable|pg||
nt|roswolf: and where is the axe?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but i think pass is best, can always show 5-5 later|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east's opening is ugly|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will likely lead a spade|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h looks optimistic to me|pg||
nt|pauleger: this wont be too costly|pg||
nt|pelu: down 2-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: all very predictable|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: no light openers for Jansma (agreed it is a disgusting collection)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|petepunt: tough to deafeat this|pg||
nt|roswolf: too bold|pg||
nt|roswolf: it looks like a mixed teams bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  E must pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  of course, Ew have different ideas:P|pg||
nt|kaapo: Trying to make up for board 26 perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  if N ducks @D once there is no hope to win the hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: A good hand to be playing invitational 3@D over 1@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 3nt a good save against 4@S funny :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup bridge is a strange but wondrous game|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or 1NT forcing followed by a @D rebid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ampelman: 5@d looks fine|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure no X - %@D making easy|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|bobholl: nice balance from gert jan (paulissen)|pg||
nt|brotherp: still Paulissen is there so EW reach their part-score in clubs|pg||
nt|granguru:  some 2/1 players changed system in such a way that a repeat of the same suit as here is no more GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4 spades, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds and a heart would be 9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bobholl: but i saw 2nt as balance (may be wrong)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Another workable treatment here.|pg||

nt|petepunt: this has been a good come back by fredins team here|pg||
nt|pelu: a biddinbg misunderstand - and unlucky lead chanced 650 to 1090|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not sure east would take out if west stood it - a golden rule seems to be to leave such decisions to the better player(ahem ie the man):)|pg||
nt|pauleger: Team Langer closing the gap|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, that's one way :)|pg||
nt|stc: Some swing potential here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: this is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: this is a Mixed Competition and it has its own dynamics|pg||
nt|pelu: remember Board 17, where u would like W to bid 3@D NF - W in OR could that and are npw playing a hopeless 3@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 17 should give some to Jankova|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: E has a normal pass, but E/W are cold for 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: good hand for 2 suiters even with 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could also play @H to J, cash spade and end play south|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c some type of constructive raise|pg||
nt|stc: or a flat 4@h ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a direct raise to game isnt stupid|pg||
nt|pelu: I have been told that 1-3 from the group go to A-swiss and 4-6 to B-swiss, then 27 from A and 5 from B to Knock-out - is that correct??|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that sounds usual|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Yes|pg||
nt|pelu: wild cards in this sektion|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the limit for both sides is the 5 level|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
nt|roswolf: north really cant bid more|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know what the 2NT range is but a queen and a jack opposite a big hand is going to play about as well as one would expect it would.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very difficult not to make 5 on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: the vul sac in 6@DX was very tough to find|pg||
nt|pelu: so 6@d x is the par-contract|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: \|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: wrong Q by N :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ok|pg||
nt|granguru:  E should have asked Stayman or just passed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now west was -2 elsewhere, how can East do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||
nt|pelu: @hQ will defeat 4@s|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: sorry he made 3@D :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ampelman: after the 3@h bid the @hQ lead is too tough to find|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3NT in the open room. Don´t really know, if E showed 14-16 there or upgraded her hand to a 15-17 NT, however, W directly jumped to game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bobholl: 4@H 2@C 3@S may be |pg||
nt|brotherp: small spade or small club both seem attractive|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|stc: E has the wrong single @h, give him the J or 10...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|pelu: what is 3@H?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphpl9: nobody alerted|pg||
nt|ampelman: no alert so natural ?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: iI think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: semi-bluff|pg||
nt|ampelman: lead-prohibator :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  not a bad idea to establish a @S |pg||
nt|jcwla: Bidders who thread the needle and stop short of game on hands where it is truly impossible to tell how many tricks will make nevertheless make bids like this where it's just down 2 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: from now until doomsday.|pg||
nt|xenya: the 9 would also do|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dburn: why is it "not bridge" to try for plus 130 instead of minus 140?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoping just for the 9@H..|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: W seeking the 9|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have another red 9, can i try that?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcwla: Would be a lovely idea to establish a @S - maybe on board 20.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|bobholl: small @D ?|pg||
nt|brotherp: think so; in the bidding and play East's 4441 is known so...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south knows his partner has 4 diamonds...|pg||

nt|hedyg: the lady is multiple European and World Champion. didnt get there by ooops|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise the ante|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems fairly cold for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1086 a stop!?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I am not sure but Kopecky said 2s is transfer to nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural seems to be even a better treatment...less info given to opps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Multon hits declarers @D suit once again|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
nt|stc: that's why i said, hard to believe...|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8697|pg||
nt|hedyg: she had an easy entry to hand with AK@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not what a little birdie told me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N opener had interesting effect of preventing N from showing the @h suit...compare to the auction in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: still wining the match and having a good position for the KO rounds|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
nt|pelu: still hard fight for the first 3 places in this group: 62-61-60-60-57-54 VP's|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pauleger: a hand, where it is good to lead 2nd from 4 small|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: oh...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brotherp: finally an easy hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Kacper for a great job as the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kari and specs...another round to start in a few mintues|pg||
nt|andyv:  minutes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile S has all sorts of problems here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe Madsen enters dummy in clubs to play towards @SA again|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
nt|roswolf: everyone is pointing out that by ducking a spade 3nt is defeated - in practicethat means a small spade lead from north which might well not be found|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
nt|ampelman: hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: especially if west bid it -|pg||
nt|kaapo: But East can win @SA, play heart to king and then 3rd heart after ace|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dburn: so far, so bad|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: easy claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match, we will be back in 1 hour and 45 minutes for more fun|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: this looks only -1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Kopecky may be going to the desk.|pg||
