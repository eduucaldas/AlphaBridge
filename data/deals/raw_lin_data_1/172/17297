nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  E certainly thinking about it|pg||
nt|kemperg: @S instead of @H|pg||
nt|bg: theres a psych which may make it tough for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@D in the other room was more constructive than the 3@D here, which is what led to the final double|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|kemperg: psychs still played in Eastern Europe|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the S hand certainly looks more like a 3@d bid than 2@d with these vul.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pjs_ch: double is lot more expensive where there are two overtricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: yes, 3@D describes it well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: last wwek in Bulgaria I saw some of those|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: not the expected opening  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kemperg: 3N was possible, E would start @H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  wonder if they play 1@d as all unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: perhaps N is treating the hand as a weak NT hand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kemperg: but pass was my bid too:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: if they get the diamond right, NS can make 3@D easily but might be hard to find the suit now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|andyv:  according to Taavi, 1@c was not alerted so maybe this is just N's creativity|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|pjs_ch: over the 2N enquiry, rebidding minor with min hand and major with max and correspnding minor is common|pg||
