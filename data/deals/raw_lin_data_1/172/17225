mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: stole the pot with it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C=South African Texas|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: I like blasting, so many ways it can work|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: gets the name from inventor who adapted Texas Transfers     Max Sapire was from South Africa|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4@d by Kingham would have shown slam interest|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unless you play transfer then 3C as INV + (i do), then how could you invite in a way where partner would know if his hand is suitable. of course if he has 4 aces or the like sure ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: he will bid it but he will also be guessin g a lot of the time|pg||

nt|ianmcc: Hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i own and have read at least one of Ian's books|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 imp gain well stopped|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW a chance to make 4@s here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wipes out the 11 they did get on 13|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: perhaps a little bit too much to do|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ritong: 4@h direct looks ok, one way or another|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: need to get @h right and ruff some of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat lead director|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: lets see just needs @H right|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only made 3 in OR........|pg||
nt|peachy: true, so they have left some tricks on the table, I just am so at awe at the level of the EW game|pg||
nt|mrdct: same idea in both rooms - just a slightly different conventioh to do it|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: i thought EW played 12-14 NT throughout  -- wonder why 1@D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: Hugh will surely give it the best effort in the odds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugrapha3: North is limited by his failure to open a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and EW didn't find @C because of East failure to open 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: probably not 4-4... (the interogation continues)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I didn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 encouraging in @C -- but no reason to rush  [even though seems automatic to shift to @C10 ]|pg||
nt|mrdct: going well so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes @S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: no easy defence here|pg||

pc|c7|nt|ianmcc: interesting|pg||

nt|peachy: suddenly this hand becomes interesting|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: no way to bury them except ruffing and hope no overruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: briefly :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|mrdct: i think he needed a smothering ruffing finese against north's @h9|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: loser i mean|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 3N opening for Nunn would be "any solid 8 card suit"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess the @HK made hand too good for that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW can make 3N on defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: Rosen wanted to Double . . whether he should depends on opening lead|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: @hA is non-ridiculous, gives up on millions off but lets you decide which black suit to switch to|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 1 anyway hard earned imp|pg||
mb|3N|an|gambling|nt|mrdct: defence was spot-on vs 3NT in the open room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: isn't N suppose to oull with no major stops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pull|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: holding 3@H east rejected attempt at forcing game, so hoped maybe to score @C & ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: like it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but EW might make 4@s here so Hans could still win the board|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now, certainly|pg||
nt|peachy: The book lead against Gamblin is an ace, which is not going to be as successful|pg||
mb|4D|an|p/c|nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||

nt|mrdct: but worked out OK here|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning the eighth card|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: only worked out cause he pulled|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: but the rebid does|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish choosing to go for a safe 300, 500 or (hopefully) 800 here rather than risk -100|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like a big pickup for klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 a suit preference card for @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i do like maing it gambling in any suit to increase frequency|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: NS convention card says opening bids are agressive 1st seat favorable -- but this must be close to a stretch for 1@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: tony could beat it by leading a diamond i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair shot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he comes under pressure on the run of clubs though|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: should make i think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: Indeed, it can backfire to have more than promised. But all card says is "gambling 1St and 2ND; 3rd and 4th to play"|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: with majors aswell????|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||

mb|2D!|an|!h or !s|nt|ahollan1: 2@D= @H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough call for Rosen  --  maybe he'll Pass and get in later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that seems a very dangerous plan|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chilloncan: have to bid something immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Not too dangerous - if 2@d gets passed out he'll just about get +600 anyway|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well believe it or not that isnt what i had in mind:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   NOT worried about 2@D-all pass because of his holding|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|chilloncan: "kater" may come at an uncomfortable level|pg||
nt|chilloncan: later|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: sure  and later may reveal useful info about opponent holding -- that's what makes it tough|pg||
nt|chilloncan: N going for massive brass ring. but in all likelihood if this can make 3N was going down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no standout scientific call so tactics apply  [and i'm lost in tactical situations]|pg||
mb|d|nt|chilloncan: and notyhing about the auction suggests that S has extras|pg||

nt|chilloncan: that second club seems to have been flung in haste. implausible that W is short in that suit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and even more implausible that W is seeking a ruff with his boid in trumps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding  standard count/attitude   odd/even 1st discard|pg||
nt|chilloncan: moreover, if S had another club loser there is nowhere it could disappear quickly to|pg||
