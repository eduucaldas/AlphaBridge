nt|zyxzewski: Olavi also, so it's interesting for me to see them in action|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: For Otepää Jaak and Jaan are the first names for Jaak Aava and Jaan Maripuu|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|zyxzewski: 1@D is "Estonian Beach Diamond" - basically 11-16 and nebulous (11-14 BAL, unbal with 4+@D or 4414/4405) - a method played by about 90% of Estonian pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got surnames now, thanks Kristjan|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 6@D makes for N-S though I suspect whether they will reach this slam|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|rv: North could have bid 2@s on 2@h and South could have supported @ds with 3@d|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: they might have maybe, if Oja had chosen to bid 2NT (or 2@S) and Luks could have get his diamond support across by 3@D, but i don't know their exact agreements, maybe 2@H was not ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: FG and Oja was afraid that Luks passes 2NT...|pg||
nt|rv: not a great slam and stopping in game is fine, but auction could have been better|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S is|pg||
nt|rv: I can live with 1@s|pg||
nt|pelu: close to a 4@S opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|zyxzewski: 1@S seems fine, but probably i would personally go with 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: with 7-4 you want to play in your 7-card suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Undo Kristjan, please|pg||
nt|rv: y|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: 1 moment|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: now a spade, later picking up the @HQ with finessing and ruffing the last heart to dummy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: This would be wrong if hearts had been 6-1|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: or that works also, although it seems unnecessary to risk with ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: as is very likely on the auction|pg||
mc|12|nt|pelu: in CR S - Peeter Lond! - bid 3@D over 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: +2?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Patrick Shields|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s is a bit aggressive by W and may push EW too high|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E certainly thinking about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: the 2@D in the other room was more constructive than the 3@D here, which is what led to the final double|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  the S hand certainly looks more like a 3@d bid than 2@d with these vul.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pjs_ch: double is lot more expensive where there are two overtricks|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: well, maybe declarer was happy and didn't see any losers and defenders were upset enough to throw it away|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE and overwrite  4SEX+1|pg||
nt|pelu: I would X 1@D in E|pg||
nt|rv: I like 3@c with South hand as fit jump on 1@d opening if it is standard|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: no 1@D alert - could prob be short|pg||
nt|rv: I would have passed with East hand though, don't like weak t/o doubles opp passed hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, but it's not standard, they are playing precision with nebulous 1@D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|zyxzewski: so it wasn't an option in here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|pelu: but still for sure a X in East|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, it's usually good to get majors to picture|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: maybe DBL to 1NT? would it show diamonds (although with these he could have just bid 2@D over 1@D) or something else? |pg||
nt|pelu: very passiv by East|pg||
nt|rv: I would have passed 1@d and balanced 1n with 2@c to show majors|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: although if my partner would be like that, i would assume he has opening values and he couldn't x 1@D because he doesn't have shape for it|pg||
nt|pelu: some would even open on his hand - but 2x Pass?|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Board 2 corrected now, all's well|pg||
nt|rv: on (1x)-(1n), I play 2@c as showing both majors with equal or better @hs and 2@d as majors with better @s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: can onyl just scrape up an opening bid here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: not the expected opening  :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|andyv:  wonder if they play 1@d as all unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: perhaps N is treating the hand as a weak NT hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|pjs_ch: if they get the diamond right, NS can make 3@D easily but might be hard to find the suit now|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|andyv:  according to Taavi, 1@c was not alerted so maybe this is just N's creativity|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: wow!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  either that or N pulled out the wrong bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pjs_ch: good excuse for the spade lead now, but witha takeout X of clubs, I can't see declarer getting the diamonds wrong|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|zyxzewski: 1@C shows strong hand (17+) with any shape here|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|1N|nt|zyxzewski: i guess 1@S shows @S + @C or @H + @D|pg||
nt|rv: 1@s seems to be suction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: bit risky at these colros and could have gone for a number|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: if i'm not mistaken, they play such defensive bids over 1@C and 1@D that 1@H/1@S = same major with @C or other major with @D, 2@C = @C or both majors and 2@D = @D or @H or @S, ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: don't know about 1@D and double|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: 3NT the normal contract - byt in the NS was close to -1100|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|rv: many folks think it is their birth-right to intefere against strong @c with any hand, even 1@s double would be bloody|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but i may be mistaken - although i have played a lot with them, i don't like that method myself, because it doesn't allow you to come in easily with 1 major and then be quiet ...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, Venky. Same goes for the mini-NT. When people open a 9-12 NT in front of you many think they have been robbed. That's not necessarily the case|pg||
nt|pelu: y34s 1 major good suit - could be 4 card - and jump 2-level = conventional|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: yes, their system card shows they are playing like that both over artificial 1@C and 1@D|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|pelu: I prefer "Bahama" = 2X = the suit or the next 2 suits - 2@C = !X or @d+@h - and so on|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
mc|10|nt|zyxzewski: i have also a gut feeling, that over such interference style you should look for penalty - at least to "keep them honest"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also prefer Bahama, but for a different reason, the beaches|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i thought "Bahama" was called "psycho suction" :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|andyv:  not much to this hand unless EW overreach|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: 5+ heart and 4+ minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Muiderberg, yes, a Dutch convention|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|pelu: on 8 tricks -even with @d 3-3 - the 9 trick can be produced in !§h (@HJ onside)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: diamonds are behaving, but it still may be tricky|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the UK they call it Lucas 2|pg||
nt|pelu: di they also have a "Marcus" :)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: because it's not so easy to see, where the 9th comes|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: probably he should play a heart after taking diamonds and unblock the king, if Luks plays @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but the Pontus 2 is very popular in the Vatican|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Pope plays it|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: though Oja has also some discarding issues on diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: playing on @h give decl a 2. option - dont need @Ds 3-3 if @Hs 3-3 with J onside|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: The Pope probably plays strong club system (in Estonian and Finnish we use the same word for cross and for club suit)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: although 1@D doesn't show any diamonds, i would prefere to have length in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Estonian Beach Diamond concept is basically that 1@C is strong and that 1@D denies a 5-card major|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That sums it up, more or less|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: actually, there are 2 schools in EBD - some use 2@C as natural opening bid (11-16, 5+ unbalanced), but some play 2@C as weak with both majors (i guess EW in CR belong to that ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: school), so for them it's exactly that - 1@D = any opening hand without 5 card major|pg||
