nt|vugrapha3: Modern Acol is a bit of an oxymoron :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just as "a bit" relates to "jumbo shrimp"|pg||

nt|jbgood: Ish came close to winning the Vanderbilt - he will not lose another..|pg||

nt|henryb:  and in fact 5@s is cold|pg||
nt|henryb:  from the N seat|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course - by north you dont have 2 @h losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: a pushy 3NT for NS here|pg||

nt|henryb:  from S you can only make 3@s|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: 2@h might not be everyone's taste|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 16 so no comparisons/score changes for a while|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact 6@s if you get trumps right|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: 7@s actually|pg||
nt|mrdct: a 7 or 5 hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2N Ogust  and 3@D good suit, bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a guess -- CC doesn't specify|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they probably play someting more sophisticated than ogust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H-4@H would be very interesting development|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d could be something like non-minimum with a shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nice 4@h opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: Ish is getting conservative!|pg||
nt|peachy: a practical 4H bid, not necessariy everyone's choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrdct: and 3@h by south would be asking where the shortage is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: if anyone knows meaning of 4@D -- SPEAK UP|pg||
nt|mrdct: no idea here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: stole the pot with it|pg||
nt|peachy: normally it is a "transfer to 4S for the opponents" :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: some would open that 1@h, but in 3rd seat it's certainly right to open at the 4 level|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry, thought Ish opened 1S, get me some focus here plsssssss|pg||
nt|mrdct: max likes his shape|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i'm wondering if specifically looking for @H cue   where 4@C looking for either red suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@D did not show anythign... bu 5@D showed cue in @D|pg||
nt|mrdct: is there any reason for declarer to get trumps right here?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: on @C/@D lead it's almost a 5 or 7 hand|pg||

nt|mrdct: he usually is|pg||
nt|peachy: Ish certainly is|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: some play only 1, some always if 4 support, some will superaccept with 3, others will show shortness/source of tricks ....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 tricks is going to be a lot harder than 9|pg||
nt|mrdct: west might be smelling some fear|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Hans made 5SX for another 14|pg||
nt|mrdct: a chance to steal a @d trick in the end as east will be under some presure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW should be able to pick up 1 imp by holding to 1 overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kiwibridge: wasted pips in @C's|pg||
nt|mrdct: good duck by max|pg||
nt|mrdct: south needs to ruff one @s and pitch 2 on the @DAK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct: trump lead will stuff up that plan|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: great match by Hugh and Ish|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: This month, he was in a close Final match in the Vanderbilt, second place|pg||
nt|mrdct: apart from the 4@s game they were preempted out of|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: i have to admit Andrew -- 2@D never came into my mind -- i'd pass before 2@D  and i'd never pass|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2@D very old-shioned false prfernce - too weak for 3@C but 2@C still forcing|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: sorry i've made a mistake....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: it takes a good 26-30 hours to travel from Louisville to Sydney|pg||

nt|ianmcc: Hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i own and have read at least one of Ian's books|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 imp gain well stopped|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW a chance to make 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did they get their 3@H & 2@D??|pg||
nt|mrdct: on 13 kingham lead his stiff @h against 6@s even when hold @SQxx and got what he deserved:  -17 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wipes out the 11 they did get on 13|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: lets see just needs @H right|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only made 3 in OR........|pg||
nt|peachy: true, so they have left some tricks on the table, I just am so at awe at the level of the EW game|pg||
nt|mrdct: same idea in both rooms - just a slightly different conventioh to do it|pg||
nt|pelepele: no thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought EW played 12-14 NT throughout  -- wonder why 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hugh will surely give it the best effort in the odds|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: North is limited by his failure to open a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and EW didn't find @C because of East failure to open 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: probably not 4-4... (the interogation continues)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @dK lead would be a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: after 4 of 6 matches  Hans had lead of more than 30 VP over 2nd place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 2 teams from Double Round Robin advance to SemiFinal|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: I didn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 encouraging in @C -- but no reason to rush  [even though seems automatic to shift to @C10 ]|pg||
nt|mrdct: going well so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes @S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no easy defence here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bottom 2 play top 2 from Division 2    with 3rd place choosing opponent|pg||
nt|mrdct: do the top 2 teams from div 1 get a day off or do they play for seating rights?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: but still has to deal with his 2remaining @h losers|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N (14)15-17|pg||
nt|mrdct: on brd 14 i mean|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: holding 3@H east rejected attempt at forcing game, so hoped maybe to score @C & ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: like it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but EW might make 4@s here so Hans could still win the board|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now, certainly|pg||
nt|peachy: The book lead against Gamblin is an ace, which is not going to be as successful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = transfer to 4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might bounce the auction a level or 3 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = TWERB   i don't know that convention by name  guessing something like what we call suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL = @C & @H or @D & @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d is only one off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 2@D  :(|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|peachy: First seat favorable, let them deal with it! Good practice|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a flacid 4@c opening in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm skeptical about the Open Room auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: it might be a good move for EW to defend a partscore here rather than push the opps into 4@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ew or NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C did NOT set up game force|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Al it's been a long day, thanks Michael on vugraph, thx audience|pg||
nt|ianmcc: pickup|pg||
nt|mrdct: personally i don't like a gambling 3NT with an outside K|pg||
nt|mrdct: sry NS to defend|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-4@S-all pass  just doesn't seem plausible|pg||
nt|mrdct: why - 6-4 bid more and all that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 9 hours for me but back tomorrow for another lot|pg||
nt|mrdct: but worked out OK here|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning the eighth card|pg||
nt|mrdct: that too|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only worked out cause he pulled|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why not 4S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but the rebid does|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish choosing to go for a safe 300, 500 or (hopefully) 800 here rather than risk -100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Ian!|pg||
nt|mrdct: now west is running out of bids|pg||
nt|mrdct: or double cards at least|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ianmcc: hi how do I get pretty pips on to keyboards?|pg||
nt|mrdct: ! in front of c d h & s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exclamation mark  "!"  then letter of suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx nobody tells me anything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as many suggest  Hollands really is "walking the dog" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: does that make me "nobody"?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|mrdct: does east have enough to raise here? partner has shown the world bidding this way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told the entire scoring system is down today -- not just the site with accumulated results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so even scoring done by hand  [no bridgemate  aaaarrrrggghhhh]|pg||
nt|mrdct: pathetic|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this looks like a big pickup for klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 a suit preference card for @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i do like maing it gambling in any suit to increase frequency|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: NS convention card says opening bids are agressive 1st seat favorable -- but this must be close to a stretch for 1@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: tony could beat it by leading a diamond i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair shot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he comes under pressure on the run of clubs though|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: should make i think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: Indeed, it can backfire to have more than promised. But all card says is "gambling 1St and 2ND; 3rd and 4th to play"|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: with majors aswell????|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: He might cash H first, thought it might backfire if N is void|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last one now|pg||
nt|mrdct: one of the most important and high profile events on the austrlian calendar and they are scoring by hand!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the patient died|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 6@H is good save against 4@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no....  I'm sure they've been using bridgemate|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable means  we not vul   they vul    [only they vul]|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugrapha3: maybe a heart switch gives the defense a chance?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: declarer should still be ok if he knocks out @sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd run with what partner has signal for unless there is a dramatic reaosn not to|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: duck this, float @C10   that might get to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: A wise kib said, with trumps blocked it cant cost|pg||
nt|mrdct: that way if it's wrong it's partner's fault!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i'm not saying that is how the play SHOULD go -- just trying to find a way to large number of tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think EW just need to follow suit to beat this|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well, guesing the @S position is a chance|pg||

pc|s2|nt|peachy: some one once said as advice, to always make such decisions at the table that you will win post mortem (should there be one)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: they call it "game force relay"|pg||
nt|mrdct: this might talk EW into playing 4@s rather than 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2N= game force raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Hengest will pay for  it by keeping EW out of non-making 3N|pg||
nt|mrdct: but 4@s is in trouble also with the 4-2 break|pg||
nt|ritong: non making, non making...would you double 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ehy might try  non-making Mosyian 4@S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d likewise|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW are in a GF auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 2@D game force -- i wonder why Gold bid 3@H letting NS off the hook|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the rush with 4333 and no @H stop?|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he wanted to show no4@s and dubious @h holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as bonus also let NS off the hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2S = 8-11 and 6+ S|pg||
nt|mrdct: chance to hold this to 8 tricks with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some cue raise|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c is @ds, so 3@d is a cue|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: back 10 min or so....|pg||
nt|mrdct: hopeful our fine operator helena can keep the room open to report the standings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for the 6th and final match of the Division 1  2nd Round Robin|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok... wait 2 min|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think the ladies event is finished now so i guess we will have both matches from the open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helena -- if you can get score updates    we'll try to get ABF to cover your bar tab|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: going to check ladies now.... wait 1min|pg||
nt|ianmcc: women|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you tell her Ian :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's actually ladies as this is the qualifier for the APBF where the event is still called the ladies teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: quaint|pg||
nt|mrdct: reality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd is critical since they advance to SemiFinals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd is better than 4th in that they get to choose opponent from top 2 in Division 2|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i guess 1st gets their pick of semi-final opponent also|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok so Wilkinson: 174|pg||
nt|mrdct: unless 1st/2nd play-off tomorrow to get choice|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bilski 160|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Djurovic 142|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hoffman 139|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: with Clark/Brockman not finished yet|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Clark 138/ B 117|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so 4th was that close!|pg||
nt|mrdct: so quite a tight finish in the ladies for that 4th spot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so appears CLark will overtake Durovic.... but only guestimate|pg||
nt|mrdct: huh - is 138 - 117 and imp score?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so women's scores have one match to come?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or was that the score before the last match?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Clark/Brock are not finished final match|pg||
nt|mrdct: the ladies has finished|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah - so it looks like clark should get through and hoffman will miss out|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: other 4 teams are finnished|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know Women don't have "repechage" tomorrow -- they go straight into KO|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thats what i think...|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct the - bottom two teams go home|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ladies don't have bottoms you mean rearmost|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never was sure about Division 2 format -- so don't know if they have more to play tonight|pg||
nt|mrdct: so helena were those ladies scores you gave before for the other 4 teams inclusive of the result from the last match?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes for other 4 teams|pg||
