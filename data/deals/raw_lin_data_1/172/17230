mb|p|nt|athene: so east is really Caplan in fact|pg||
nt|babs59: definitely an accurate description Brauny|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: but if there are any correct scores onsite it'd be nice to have an update|pg||
mb|2N|an| |mb|p|nt|babs59: the only odd action last hand was King's initial pass - but it kept them low|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|babs59: however, it probably kept them from a makeable game.|pg||
nt|babs59: on to this hand|pg||
nt|babs59: multi 2D bid by King|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|babs59: I guess I got it wrong and 3S showed a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might have considered doubling 2@S as a "pre-balance"|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|athene: once the @H10 appears, declarer's only worry is getting forced in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't happening either|pg||
nt|babs59: it looks like you can play for 2-2 spades, then use the hearts for discards, but East has a nasty surprise in the heart suit|pg||

nt|athene: 6@S+1 a reasonable score; 7@S tick would be pushy and lucky :)|pg||
nt|athene: too much work to do with the minor suits to want to be in seven|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but south really doesn't have the defence that a strong two generally promises|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: of course it was part of the original multi to include a strong-two in either minor, but not many play that these days|pg||
nt|athene: north did have a bit of a look for seven in the other room, but when south denies a king, north can see it's going to be on a finesse at best|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though 5@DX had chances|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have considered the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: since north didn't have much else for the opener|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: this auction is all a bit murky now|pg||
nt|athene: a very aggressive 3@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: jump overcalls are traditionally strong in the balancing seat of course|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: she murmured something to East after bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: south thinking about six now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i imagine strong option...|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@C denies any spade control, then north must just sign off - i.e. not bid 4@D, because that would promise a spade control too as well as diamond|pg||
nt|athene: she might just sign off because she realises she has overdone it a bit and she wants to dampen south's enthusiasm :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: North not sure what 4c is|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south is wondering if 3@H is "pass or correct"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: not at all clear what 3@H should be on the auction|pg||
nt|athene: when south has shown some single-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h alerted by North only|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, north thinks 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, it's not 100% obvious 4@C should be a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt was cold of course but you do have to double hook the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|vugrapha1: north must have thought shed bid 3s with all heart raises|pg||
nt|athene: south can have quite a few decent hands with a club suit that could not bid over 1@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: this is a bit unwise perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H really was pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: that means north was prepared to play in 4@C, if her partner in fact had clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to have pretty good clubs|pg||
