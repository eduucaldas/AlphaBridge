nt|Walddk2: No score in MOVIE|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4HS-1|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a game which really shouldnt be bid - but not hedded in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: sorry about that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: no worries|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2N|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How do you like the double of 1@D at the other table?|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s a hopeless game|pg||
nt|wygbe1: whats 2nt? trans to clubs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt =?|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 loser hand 4333, double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  my type of double|pg||
nt|andyv:  support for all suits|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the protection|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: east will raise|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should pass this as W didn't bid the first time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He shouldn't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's punishing partner if you do. He'll never balanced again|pg||
nt|roswolf: even though 1 of his aces has been "bid"by his pard|pg||
nt|wygbe1: east should pass - otherwise west can never play 3s = choice is 3c or 4s |pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov is still talking about the last deal... he suggest that declarer might make with J@C lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why must he be punished for doing the right thing?|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy to say from the armchair|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the battlefield 3 aces look rosy|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W had a 7 trick hand, we would have heard about it over 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9 losers, look at those instead|pg||
nt|roswolf: good judgment test though|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: it would be different if east had unexpected shape - but here neither points nor shape are unexpected|pg||
nt|roswolf: told you so|pg||
nt|andyv:  you win geoffrey:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: I guess he tried to play the same contract as the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Nanev said this is a game for deep finess|pg||
nt|vugraphzku: Mihov said .. no this is a plus score for them :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  very deep finesse|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Mihov had a better hand, we would have heard about it over 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has his 3@S now|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm it would be an interesting exercise to simulate say 10000 possible 3@S hands opposite east's hand to see how often game makes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|andyv:  less than 10% is my guess|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: A hand that did not bid 3@S over 2NT, Geoffrey|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|wygbe1: would have lost two imps by selling to 3c, but west had a chance to win 4 imps, for swing of 6, if pd had cooperated|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy the result would be counter-intuitive for most players|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a very pertinent consideration roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I need by dictionary again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: consideration|pg||

nt|wygbe1: yep, diamond play is better percentage|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: These players are lightning fast, especially Mihov, so don't be surprised if we overtake the closed room, although we started 4 boards behind them|pg||

nt|andyv:  that really is an ugly 2@h bid|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hey Anita @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could be disastrous for n/s if they are not careful|pg||
nt|wygbe1: this slam is semi-decent  - with non diamond lead, can try first hearts then clubs - with diamond lead needs club finesse|pg||

nt|roswolf: north should go quietly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nanev was unable to show his monster hand|pg||
