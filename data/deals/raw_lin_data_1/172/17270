nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||

nt|ianmcc: can an ace go away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some pairs specifically say 1@S = 4+@D   which fits in with Griffiths-Richman use of 1@C-1N as natural 6-11|pg||
nt|athene: entry to the diamonds getting taken out so declarer will have to play on clubs|pg||

pc|c9|nt|athene: and then you can see he wouldn't|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board of the set    restart after long break    about 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impressive push by the defense|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: a mildly horrible double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to score in the women's final    Bilski 24  Clark 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially since 1@D=4+|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H Limit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north might lead a club on the basis that south didn't double 1@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: right idea to catch partner's suit, but sadly giving a trick away just the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd pick @C just to avoid leading from Jack|pg||
nt|ianmcc: possible swing here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: before everyone leaves    restart on the quarter hour     and thanks Adam!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i knew agreements better --- 3@H just seems   overly agressive to me|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: declarer will be disappointed with events after ace and another diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|athene: he'll settle down to a long winter evening of setting up diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||
nt|athene: for|pg||
nt|athene: he either throws a diamond (if going for the throw in) or a heart (if going for the diamond establishment and squeeze)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   instead of ofr    off|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, courtney may just place @SJ in south  and shift to @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been non-force  [is that so bad?]  2@C game force   so  i guess 2@S or the mysterious 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H says EXACTLY 3@S  it is easier to stomach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many telling me it DID show exactly 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now i see that Adam had flagged it that way  --   sorry mate|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: now @SAQ, heart, heart, i guess|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West's shape is known   so Courtney knows to unblock @SK|pg||
nt|athene: yes @SK unblock coming for sure|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: two down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well i wouldn't have bet on that looking at the NS hands single-dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 70 minutes|pg||
