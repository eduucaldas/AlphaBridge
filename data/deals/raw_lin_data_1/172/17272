pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: either way -- a bit surprised that he sold out to 3@H when partner "freely" bid 3@D|pg||

mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: great to have you Ian|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice 5@H bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @d now and if he ducks the roof could fall in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes @C's are ominous|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andy_h: Although declarer still has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|andy_h: If trumps are 3-1, provided that the defenders duck a round of clubs, there is no entry to dummy to enjoy the clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||
nt|athene: but i think in general it's better to play 2nt as scramble|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andy_h: However, given that West holds the singleton queen of trumps, a good guess in clubs would see the contract for one off. If Gosney ducks the first round of trumps, declarer will ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: then be able to ruff his two little spades. If Gosney takes it with the Ace and returns a trump, declarer then guess the clubs|pg||

nt|athene: you need to discuss if x of these transfer responses = the suit bid or t/o of the suit shown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = artificia  10-12 HCP, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
nt|andy_h: yes, after board 18 and 19 which could be potential minus scores I think Brown has to double. I mean, he has an Ace and 5 trumps and partner has overcalled 2@D!|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: can they cash 3 aces?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: can an ace go away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some pairs specifically say 1@S = 4+@D   which fits in with Griffiths-Richman use of 1@C-1N as natural 6-11|pg||
nt|athene: entry to the diamonds getting taken out so declarer will have to play on clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but a spade shift gives the defence far too many tricks|pg||

nt|braunstar: heart lead will help here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mwigor: either round suit ace can go if the other is cashed|pg||
nt|andy_h: I guess 3@H is some sort of spade raise?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: and set in motion a delicate exploratory auction, like 1nt - 6nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: 4@H could have been beaten on this defence but Brown should have returned a LOW club at trick seven (where he returned the King)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the artificial invite again|pg||
nt|andy_h: It was a trump promotion. If Nabil had ruffed high he can finesse the heart but he would have been unable to ruff his diamond loser|pg||
nt|braunstar: 8 tricks for the defence here against 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok - i malign him - he is going to show his hand :)|pg||
nt|braunstar: i must go, thanks all, good luck to both teams|pg||
nt|andy_h: Thanks Daniel|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: 1@H = @S|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a small loss for a 1NT opening with a 5 card Major|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ianmcc: stay out!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: i just wasn't sure if transfer or 2@C [if playing Smolen]|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Klinger would have bid 2@D with minimum -- i'm just not sure what 2@H said |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|vugrapha4: 2@S an artificial bid of some sort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh found it   2@H = 14+ HCP, game force|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kiwibridge: strange bid Hugh|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|athene: 3@C looking for 5-3 club fit or a genius 54-3 club fit maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and was either 6+@S or 5@S & 4@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S was Relay    3@D natural    [and now i see 2@H could also be 11-14 BAL]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 2 to score in the Women's    Bilski 56  Clark 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches have 32 boards to play after this set|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 4-3 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 6-3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: you could claim this at trick 1 but probably worth playing a few tricks as if a diamond gets ducked you might have 33 spades or a spade-diamond squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely -- just clarified that Burgess in charge of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spies will get us an update on the Hans-Brown match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using Rule of 11 -- seems the only time it would be right to continue @HJ is when partner started with @HA10843  and event then   partner must duck and South must regain the lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: queen, diamond, is my guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who play Smolen -- did you know that after Opener rebids 3N you can/should show the @C fragment??|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: with A10943  lead might have been 10 or 9  [depending on agreements]|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: very memorable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and just in time - the other room had caught up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now other room half a board ahead|pg||
nt|andy_h: But regardless of which side you're on, just make sure you and your partner are on the same wavelength|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andy_h: It is always an endless debate on whether you should open 1NT with a 5-card major or not, there are big upsides and downsides to both styles|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: NS might be a little bit of bother now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C ==  creative just doesn't seem to describe that bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Classic aggressive style from Courtney|pg||
nt|athene: but might be hard for EW to get their hands on 3@C since neither has length or shortage in the suit :)|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4 more boards to compare and it seems almost impossible for the Brown team to catch up on|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: last set the memorable moment was when player caught Richman passing throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Robinson has only picked up imps on 3 boards this set|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: if west had doubled, east probably would not have passed, but i don't see how double can hurt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: No doubt Nye will get a laugh when Bobbys club holding tracks along with the 10@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 4+@H  nothing about @S|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: if partner bids 3red, you bid 3N anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W play a 9-12 1NT opening in 1st seat favourable, so it was a good thing Edgtton remembered that he was in second seat (was that your undo Andrew or Nabil's undo? lol)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: always double to cater for the penalty pass, if you can do it without cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe DBL risks  4@H/@S from Richman -- which exposes @CKJx on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well you have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: if partner jumps to 4major you expect to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i was thinking before it was outlawed   some might downgrade West to a mere 1N opener|pg||
nt|athene: this isn't a trivial hand to play actually|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and not 4+@H/@S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: other room got to 3N via   1@C-3@D//3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that 3@D bid before|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: you need to get diamonds and spades going and opps might get the hearts before that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: so one more after this then the final 16 starting in 17 minutes, thanks to Catherine on vugraph, Ian and all spectators for your great feedback....|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Rule:  NEVER lead from Jxx(x)      except when it's right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had partner who would chastise me/teammates even then|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd Quarter scheduled to begin in about 30 minutes|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|athene: i guess there is not really any way south, as a passed hand, can have a threatening heart suit AND enough entries|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Gill was probably thinking about what to pitch on THIS trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: and both players have discarded well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mullamphy can gain 2 imps by taking @DA -- but doubt he'll do that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Mullamphy shakes his head|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a pretty good assessment Matt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: he knows he needs @D hook but also knows its not working|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: after @C10 from South   MAYBE  Griffiths could unblock @CJ to generate interesting entry position|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|athene: a mildly horrible double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to score in the women's final    Bilski 24  Clark 3|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H Limit?|pg||
nt|andy_h: A very good effort by the Brown team and congratulations to the Hans team to be moving on towards the finals tomorrow|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: north might lead a club on the basis that south didn't double 1@H|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: right idea to catch partner's suit, but sadly giving a trick away just the same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd pick @C just to avoid leading from Jack|pg||
nt|ianmcc: possible swing here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: before everyone leaves    restart on the quarter hour     and thanks Adam!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wish i knew agreements better --- 3@H just seems   overly agressive to me|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: declarer will be disappointed with events after ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|andy_h: I don't know the scores for the other match but before going into the last set Courtney was up 105:59 imps against Klinger|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|athene: he'll settle down to a long winter evening of setting up diamonds|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|c7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||
nt|athene: for|pg||
nt|athene: he either throws a diamond (if going for the throw in) or a heart (if going for the diamond establishment and squeeze)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   instead of ofr    off|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, courtney may just place @SJ in south  and shift to @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been non-force  [is that so bad?]  2@C game force   so  i guess 2@S or the mysterious 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 3@H says EXACTLY 3@S  it is easier to stomach|pg||
