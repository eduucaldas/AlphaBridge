nt|mwigor: welcome back for the 4th (and final for today) set of the Australian Open Team Selection|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|babs59: 2 IMPs in it, I'd estimate|pg||
nt|pelu: Alida is Clark?|pg||
nt|newart: she is a very agressive player - Ed barnes calls her the Smiling Assassin|pg||
nt|babs59: 8 boards to go|pg||
nt|newart: Alida is Clark yes|pg||

nt|mwigor: (there are two sets tomorrow)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|babs59: Berman is Candice (used to be Feitelson) - has played several times for Australia|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: yes - 1@C = 1+    since 1@D/@H/@S all promise 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: Candice played for several years with Elizabeth havas who is at other table in Bilski team|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: SERVER not responding.... won't let me place W|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: west's bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry East|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: contract is 3nt E|pg||
mb|3N|nt|babs59: Candice's last partner was Elizabeth Havas who is sitting East for the opposition|pg||
nt|newart: snap|pg||
nt|babs59: oops - I was too slow (for once)|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: ungeard of|pg||
nt|newart: unheard*|pg||
nt|mwigor: the 5-level looks to be safe enough|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor shouldnt be too excited by his aceless hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: but I'm more accurate typing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  reverse count & attitude|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|mc|10|nt|newart: Paula Macleish is an ex-Kiwi |pg||
nt|pelu: so from start it was exp a close match|pg||
nt|babs59: both Candice and Liz are now playing Acol-based systems which is more 'foreign' for them|pg||
nt|newart: No - i think Bilski would have been at very short odds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 3rd of 6 16 board segments      sets 5 & 6 played tomorrow|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: convention cards at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H!|an|promises 4|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS play Weak NT 1st/2nd seat  so  1@D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: along with 4@H i suspect there's also a KS inference of 15-17 support points|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: the double might help declarer with the trumps here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: hyperactive double will locate spoade queen for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: i was thinking it might stop west getting two trump tricks, more importantly|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: standard carding for EW      NS upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|athene: still a lot of work to do though|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer needs to build a diamond trick as well as everything else|pg||
nt|chilloncan: npt saying this about E specifically, but the busy-bidder school often tend to focus on the successes of their swashbuckling exploits and sweep undr the rug the losses inciurred by ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: giving away so much information when they are outgunned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: based on info from the dbl --   @S finesse @HK @HJ?|pg||
nt|athene: it's certainly true that the stronger your opposition, the more costly it is to give them information|pg||
nt|athene: they start doing mean things like taking deep finesses through your partner after you bid unusual notrump overcalls, and suchlike :)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, one should gear methods towards serious opposition. and when one actual is in a Team Trials the opponents are seldom potzers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but must do something about @D at some point - maybe start them now?|pg||
nt|athene: now would be a good time|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise the defence will be able to do a bit of damage by leading clubs repeatedly, i think|pg||
nt|athene: giving away ruff-and-discards|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the most revealing sort of double of all is when one is a passed hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: why the jack? king was the card to play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: he did try @D    i was still trying to see what happens after that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|athene: declarer hopes that if he incurs a diamond ruff, he will be able to pick up the trumps for no loss|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is excellent start by Hans|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: without that double, declarer might have been cashing the @HA and going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: star material|pg||
nt|chilloncan: before a card was played, S could read W for 2434|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SQ located by DBL  so  Marshall right about the downside of that action|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E doubled so four spades, surely. but why didnt W lead his doubleton? four trumps|pg||
nt|athene: when?|pg||
nt|athene: after the diamond?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you are all misunderstanding me|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|chilloncan: my comment was tracing the reasoning S should use to know W distribution|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
mc|10|nt|athene: well west wasn't on lead|pg||

nt|noodle:  easy push to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: still 1+|pg||
nt|mwigor: last set had something like 10 flat boards - and we start with another one here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andy_h: South is Peter Gill, a frequent vugraph commentator on BBO that you may have seen from time to time|pg||
nt|noodle:  do they promise 5@d for 1@d opening ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: CR playing bd 17 in 2S NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  here they play transfers so redouble shows @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S gets my vote|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: sooo close|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have to pass with a classic 10+ redouble hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  dyke can still raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north had bid less -- it would be a Support DBL situation for most  [yes, even in @D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the 3@S bid is defined differently that last millenium|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it was a weak hand with lots of @S, now it is more like 2@S strength with extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I think that should put Clark in the lead|pg||
nt|newart: Barbara - i beat u again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: I believe both N/S and E/W play transfer responses to 1@C, so 1@D here shows 4+@H's|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3@D was alerted, but i'm not sure what it means. likewise with 4@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so we have a new leader :)!!!!!|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, I was out of the room, so missed your comment :(|pg||
nt|noodle:  well vulnerable it can not be completely preemptive|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|ianmcc: this is a thin game - needs lots right - and they are going to bid it here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|newart: if thy make - but hard to see it going down|pg||
nt|babs59: imagine the tension at the tables|pg||
nt|pelu: best to lead @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: Both sides play a 2/1 GF system, but E/W however have recently added a mini NT (9-12) in their arsenal when 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s seems like a make  will W sacrifice ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ9 probably worth nothing on defense   !KH probably a trick in either contract|pg||
nt|noodle:  y but E rebid at 4 level  W might be afraid 4@S is going down|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not certain as to the meaning of 3@D, but I have seen this bid used as some form of a 4 card raise|pg||
nt|ianmcc: neither wants to play it|pg||
nt|noodle:  he goes for it|pg||
nt|mwigor: the other table reached game - so this will not be flat|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newart: Sue and therese must know they are down a lot at this table|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: salvaging 3 imps|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mwigor: .|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|andy_h: And if that's the case, then 4@D is a retransfer, letting the stronger hand play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to set up 2nd @H trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: lead @D out of hand - now defense can kill all @D-ruffs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|pelu: @s now can defeat 4@S - carelss played by N|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: after a small @D fromhans - she still can play for @DA by West|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @S4 likes @S   @S9 reverse current count|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|ianmcc: he has to hook @s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|nigel: Not sure why Grosvenor ventured 2D witch such a balanced hand. Nothing to be gained. Courtney then applied the brakes for a nice pick up.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: @Hx better come out soon|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hell, i cant think of everything:):) sorry all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: EW play "4 Card Standard"   so all 1-suit openings are 4+|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: i would probably open 1nt with west, if in range|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: at least the suspense is out of the way. i dont have to worry on which board i will ssayy my first idioptic comment|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|athene: :) it's easier to see who is dummy in live bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil Edgtton did open 1N|pg||
nt|athene: he is the one who has gone to the bar|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thought that was tennyson|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: he crossed it, i thought|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C8 popping up is friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: there is quite a trend these days to use a strong notrump to solve a lot of these middle-strength "awkward" hands|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of 5422 16 counts|pg||
nt|athene: even some 5431|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. i saw courtney the other night open 4-5-2-2 16 count 1nt|pg||
nt|chilloncan: "these days" being since about 1932? :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you open that 1@H and partner bids 1NT you are a bit stuck|pg||
nt|athene: you can either push to 2nt and go down facing a minimum, or back off and miss game facing a max|pg||
nt|chilloncan: whereas if he responds 3N to 1N you are guaranteed in right spot?|pg||
nt|athene: of course|pg||
nt|athene: because you will get a short major lead|pg||
nt|athene: "always lead majors against 1nt 3nt!"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: well such 1NT bids might have been around a while but there are still people who think they are vaguely illegal, immoral, or fattening, or something|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: LOL|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: i tried advocating one in a recent junior teaching tourney and people explained you couldn't open 1nt because 54 shape wasn't balanced|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chilloncan: it is if you are 5454|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||

pc|hK|pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dQ|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: you could address this issue by playing schizo-multi ... 2D opener is either a weak 2 in spades or a strong NT with 5 hearts.....weak 2 in hearts semi-useless anyway. i leave ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: further development to  my fellow inamtes|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SQ92H9543DKT4CAT8,SKHAKJ6D965CKJ753,SJ876HT87DQ32CQ62,SAT543HQ2DAJ87C94|sv|e|nt|andy_h: There are some interesting ideas that I have read from the Bridgebase Forums which discusses the pros and cons of which side of the partnership should play the contract. One ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: example is a multi 2@D showing a weak hand with either major. One benefit of allowing the strong hand to play is that leads will be coming towards the tenaces, on the otherhand by ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: letting the 2@D opener play the hand, it conceals the hand with more distirbution|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: looks like a total collaps for NS here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|newart: might get overboard here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|noodle:  2@d p 2@h P P|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: he bids the 5-suit rather than off-shape Double|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mwigor: grosvenor's 2@h guarantees 4 card @h support (1@h would be 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: so it is possibly a closer decision for him than for standard players whether to bid 2 or 3|pg||
nt|mwigor: he chooses the more agressive course|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Tony Nunn Opened 6D in the Open in First seat and was rewarded. with his partner passing.|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one adjunct of Garbage Stayman  allows   1N-2@C//2@D-2@H//2@S[3@S & 2@H]-3@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  crawling stayman 2@h weak with both majors or @h@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "crawling" is too wimpy   i like "garbage" moniker|pg||
nt|noodle:  we have more bugs here Al|pg||
pc|c2|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I think, Jamie, that the room crashed and that was just catch up result|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
nt|babs59: I think any partner would bid 7D if you opened 6D on South!!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|babs59: bd 18  3NT is about to make for more IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: it's not just a bucketload of IMPs - more like 2 buckets|pg||
nt|pelu: but 6@D is a very fair slam - need @Ds 3-2 or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W have discussed a lot in terms of competitive bidding and evidently this is one of them. If 4@C was some sort of fit-show I wonder if they play 4@D as any max hand raise or if ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: they play that as "choice of games"|pg||
nt|noodle:  a good hand for 'non forcing' Stayman  1N 2@c P  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in other room is impressive result|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mwigor: 6@h can be made by ruffing the third round of @c high|pg||
pc|cT|nt|nigel: Fans of the losing trick count would call 4@h  then possible to get to 6@h|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|pelu: on a @s Lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: wow and a nice switch by Dyke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: brill switch - if he rises it's curtains|pg||
nt|andy_h: If Edgtton rises with the Ace this contract will be off due to a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andy_h: Alternatively Edgtton can duck this (which is the winning play here) but that switch by Dyke was a pretty quick one|pg||
nt|andy_h: Unfortunately for Edgtton, he gave a bit too much information in the bidding which allowed Dyke to find this brilliant switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes the @h cue was informative|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dyke "knows" that partner has a doubleton heart (giving Edgtton 4 hearts and not 5) because Gill would most likely have led a heart if it was a singleton|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|newart: in CR they are in 3NT on last baord and will make so more to Clak|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: Gosney-Edgtton play 1N favorable vul 1st/2nd = 9-12  so 1@C instead of 1N opener there|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  Impressive stop|pg||
nt|nigel: A tougfh decision by Burgess, pass seems reasonable but with shortness he has correctly acted 5@s mey be a bit high|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: yes small @S could cause problems.. ofcourse S had to lay small|pg||
pc|h8|nt|babs59: generated the 5C bid!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this figures to be down 1 with everything wrong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|newart: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|newart: Alida not shy |pg||
nt|newart:  this will be a few more imps I suspect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Grosvenor's decision to take low road is right -- this hand|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm told that the other table actually made game and that the score is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is close   pure values, 4 card fit, singleton|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  makes sense given only 3 obvious losers and the QJx for H coming down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have actually looked at the hand instead of the other room result :(|pg||
nt|serhat: yes -1 ..If they are playing 6-11 NT 3d is a little much for this hand. Pass is also difficult|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|babs59: I love it when the opps could pass out part-score then you bid to making game.  Such psychological damage|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andy_h: 2@C is a transfer to diamonds, a very common treatment nowadays after 1M (dbl)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gruffydd:  So I better change my statement to "unimpressive stop" :D|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S can make a partial|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mwigor: was about to say i think ishmael needs to get @c going for the defense|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he beat me to it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: 12 tricks now = 950|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mwigor: now grosvenor will have two clubs to cash to go with his trump trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|newart: in 3NT on previous board in CR|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: both players went low -- i think Ish's pass probably closer than Hugh's 2@S vs 3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|serhat: 2h easy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pc|d9|nt|mwigor: in fact he can now tap the south hand out|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|vugrapha1: east just claimed on a double squeeze :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gruffydd:  Ish's pass is likely based on the fact that Grosvenor might have only 3-card S support ... that swings the odds for his decision|pg||

nt|athene: good players take note of your bids and use the information|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but you can get something back by not bidding your hand correctly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: he can forsee that if his pd balances he is going to be in-between ranges and have to guess. if he overcalls -- which of course does have its risk -- they probably rate to be more ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: accurate about bidding a game if they have one|pg||
nt|athene: this is the zia strategy - pre-empt with lots of side queens|pg||
nt|athene: and watch good declarers finesse into them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14  1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|chilloncan: well if everyine knows that zia does it then it shouldnt be a particularly effective ploy for him...unless he plays in disguise|pg||

pg||
qx|c5|st||md|3ST85HQ6DQ832CK863,SAKJHK854DJ96CQ52,SQ943HAT9DA4CAT74,S762HJ732DKT75CJ9|sv|n|nt|andy_h: I knew he would!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always nice to underplay when you've underbid   takes away some of the sting|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  Methods that employ a Kaplan-style inversion of 1S and 1NT so that 1S is a forcing NT type with up to 4S and a 1NT response shows 5+S can avoid this particular issue by establishing whether a fit actually exists at the 2-level,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Burgess in 4@H East|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|p|mb|1S|an| |nt|babs59: When I made her play last sets, she ALWAYS played well.  I think the pressure makes her play better!|pg||
nt|pelu: 67 - 6 and the 6 IMP was a gift from defense :)|pg||
nt|newart: thats twice where Alida has taken a conservative action then bid game after ops bid again|pg||
nt|mwigor: the late ted chadwick was famous for saying that the second person to bid at the 5-level better know what they are doing - once again he was right on board 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 6@Hs on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I thought South's @h7 could hold out sqz|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gruffydd:  ... before the decision to invite is made.  But this might require using a Flannery opening depending on the rest of the system.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT is an impressive score from Burgess-Courtney|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||
nt|babs59: so they are in 4S NS|pg||
nt|nigel: No doubt Grosvenor was simply following the LAW with 11 trumps competing to the five level|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think grosvenor's raise is clear - the action in question is north's 5-over-5|pg||
nt|nigel: This will be tough to stay out of slam|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|pelu: yes 6@Hs is not very good - but as the match has gone - N know she need some good boards|pg||
nt|mwigor: if ishmael thinks 3NT shows strong balanced rather than a long running diamond suit then he will bid again|pg||
nt|nigel: Good point Michael but Courtney has never been backwards in coming forward. He does not know who is making what and the oppo forgot to double!|pg||
nt|mwigor: even if he suspects running diamonds he probably cant pass|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could make|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugrapha1: i think 1S showed a strong NT with 3@S...|pg||
nt|nigel: Grosvenor has done well here|pg||
nt|serhat: he cant go wrong now.. either QD or QS 7th trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andy_h: the 1@C is a short club. Edgtton didn't open 1NT because they play 9-12 mini NT in 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|mwigor: 4@c is clearly a slam try|pg||
nt|nigel: but not the Vandabilt runner up|pg||
nt|mwigor: is 4NT - please leave me alone?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ianmcc: low @c from both hands?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mwigor: the danger with 4@d is it may sound like a cue for @c|pg||
nt|serhat: Peter, may be saying now, I should have played Q!:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|nigel: Looks like a runaway train|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suspect other room auction was the same, but operator lost track when correcting the score for Board 4 :(|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The QD coming down makes things easy .. but does declarer know about it early enough in the hand to actually play the required line?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mwigor: at the other table gill opened the east hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|mwigor: incredibly despite opening the east hand they stopped in 4@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: making 12 tricks on a heart lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|gruffydd:  specs suggesting a crossruff will also work ... but the timing is very difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it needed?   2@C 2@D 1@S  then scramble 5 trump tricks?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only a heart lead lets this make i think|pg||
nt|serhat: not knowing K off|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|mwigor: declarer may think his best chance is to finesse clubs - giving him two pitches|pg||
nt|mwigor: that would not have worked|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mwigor: he will now play for the @h finesse|pg||
mc|7|nt|ianmcc: bravely played|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: you have to raise with a side singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had fun partnership where System Description was  "We Raise On 3"|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|athene: you didn't say whether that was 3 hcp, 3 trumps or 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: late breaking news - I missed a X on board 4, so 3NT was actually -500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Edgtton 3@H was 3-card Limit Raise|pg||
nt|athene: and what was 4@H? forgetting what 3@H was?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: Jeff Rubens wrote an article in Bridge World long ago about his experiences in a fictional Individual where he used the same convention card   ("The Wickle Jar Pinkle")|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|athene: it does sort of come back to the old thing about bidding 4@H - don't be surprised if someone decides to bid 4@S over it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i couldn't find description of Gosney's 4@H :(|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  Yes ... very interesting match despite the flat boards|pg||
nt|nigel: for another pickup to Courtney|pg||
nt|babs59: well they missed slam where East opened!  and bid slam where East passed as dealer|pg||
nt|babs59: rather amusing|pg||
nt|mwigor: indeed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mwigor: hi griff/al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=8-11 HCP, 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: A 22IMPer for full speed?|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Hi Michael|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you find @C slam from here???|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor has an interesting hand 6@c is quite a good spot played by him|pg||
nt|serhat: yes if managed the Q@H as an entry he would multiply his chances|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|ianmcc: ouch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure hope that's forcing :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: although Majors score more i think if i was going to introduce a suit with that hand i'd prefer to introduce the clubs|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I think that if you're willing to play partner for AKxxxx for their 2S (does it show 8-11?) opening then 6C is actually a good punt|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  2S does show 8-11|pg||
nt|serhat: he had to be brave |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an| |nt|ahollan1: Nabil Edgtton didn't bid with South hand after same opening in other room|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  after all this D bidding AKxxxx is looking more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: nabil was facing a 3@s opening|pg||
nt|mwigor: slightly different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought we bid MORE when his age|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  you're right, it was 3@S   sorry Nabil|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a very thin 4@s makes|pg||
nt|serhat: 4s?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: @d2?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hard to see where declarer's 9th trick is|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Particularly since over 3S they probably play 4D as "non-leaping" Michaels showing 5/5 D+H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: correct bidding auction (so far)|pg||
nt|serhat: do we know the alert Ellana?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: loses 1110|pg||
nt|serhat: Helena|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: sorry, I can't read what they've written|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|andy_h: That would have been a good hand for 3rd/5th leads. But Edgtton doesn't know how many diamonds declarer has but he knows that partner had the @DQ so he went for the sure set|pg||
nt|henryb:  1N-3N anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: 6 person teams, so not that heavy a workload|pg||
nt|newart: Can they make 3NT here - looks like it|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|mwigor: presumably 2@c would have been michaels even though 1@c only showed 1+@c|pg||

mb|3N|nt|ianmcc: the dreaded balanced 11 count vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Gill's 1@C opening is a short club, and evidently they do it with 4@D-2@C so their 1@D shows 5 (possibly 4441 too, unless their 1@C=1+@C)|pg||
nt|babs59: in the OR  I imagine Peter (Gill's)  2@D after 1@c then 1nt overcall showed both majors|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The N-S team must be|pg||
nt|newart: I think the Bilski team will be in serious shock|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not sure, it appears that they would have taken out the 18-19NT hands out of 1@C and put them in 1@D thereby putting some pressure off the 1@C openings (so 1@C-transfer-accept ...|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, Hans winning against Brown in one of the open semi-finals|pg||

nt|babs59: this year the Zonal Championships are part of the APBF|pg||
nt|newart: oh so no consolation prize this year|pg||

nt|babs59: joint 'target events' in 2011|pg||
nt|babs59: I think West bid 3C not South|pg||
nt|newart: i suspect Clark bid 3C|pg||
nt|pelu: or is the 3@C bid by Clark?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney should be able to work it out. He can see that the clubs are breaking and most likely declarer would have either @SA or @SQ for the 3NT bid so he must switch to a diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Wandered if 2 @D could be a major. If vug could give exsplains it would be nice, Sorry my foalt.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think 2d is weak 2 in a major. 2n was an inquiry and 3d showed i think 6-9 in spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||

mb|5D|nt|ianmcc: 3NT no joy|pg||
nt|beauch:  expect so- burgess made comment before tourney - very unusual for him to be the most normal person on team |pg||
nt|babs59: that would prevent some of the 4@H accidents we've seen|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: It has been said that the only time opps have any idea about whats in Courtneys hand is when he is out of the bridge room|pg||
nt|mwigor: well supposedly low IMP turnover is an indicator of high quality bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: long think from Gill b4 passing that out|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i think Grosvenor did better job of evaluating this hand than Courtney  [unlike board 4]|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  For those that wonder why it's good to play 2S as INV here, it's because it frees up the auction 1NT - 2H-2S-2NT for some other purpose.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  for instance, a 2nd round of transfers can be played, so that minor-suit fits can easily be agreed at the 3-level, or to allow INV hands to show both their suits, or ...|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mwigor: some play transfer splinters which might be even better|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, the principle being that the opps can't dbl so easily|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3NT = @c splinter, 4@c = @d splinter, 4@d = @h splinter - you accept the transfer as a kind of "last train"|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|pelu: I dont trust the score - 3@Hs making on board 27 - lloks like down 2 - and no play-record|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  but burgess could have played spade to set up a 5th trick for defense?|pg||
nt|mwigor: 4@h makes NS i think|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/open/Edgtton-Gosney.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|mwigor: and indeed that is the contract in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, but since he claimed...:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do YOU define misfit?|pg||
nt|ritong: affair was over|pg||
nt|mwigor: as nine of the ten players live in sydney - flights are not a consideration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really 9 of the 10?|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: sydney is where the vast majority of australia's top players live|pg||
nt|babs59: flights may have been a consideration when the program was created - they couldn't predict who the finalists would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's the odd man?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the danger for NS now is not missing 4@h but getting too high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: gill should raise @cs despite his minimum|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney's double suggesting they play equal-level-conversion. Meaning if partner bids clubs he can remove that to 2@D which does not say anything about a strong hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor|pg||
nt|ritong: so we will never know if burgess would have played a @h or a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dyke peeking around the screen to see if Ish really passed 2@H ???|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably they have the agreement that 3@c would show a good 3@h bid|pg||
nt|mwigor: so michael is showing a bad 3@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm kidding folks|pg||
nt|babs59: well a non-forcing 3@H bid anyway|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the other room sartaj was content to pass|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: same start next room|pg||
nt|ritong: different ending|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: seems Ish is thinking|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@d is in fact a good save for EW|pg||
nt|mwigor: (i think)|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|frankaus: i played a lot of rubber V cortney, he has a lot of my money :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
nt|andy_h: Indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: @c ruff will set this, but good try|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think diamond lead & contin gets it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I think he's angling for 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure gosney has enough to compete  possibly his side has eight trumps only|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: now only 13 IMPs diff - and I still dont belive the 6 IMPin board 27|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a lot of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I hope you got your money's worth in education :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: gill must feel not so confident|pg||
nt|ianmcc: unless he has to come back in clubs|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, the East hand has quite a lot of defence so it's tough to take the save|pg||
nt|babs59: unwilling to take a phantom|pg||
nt|mwigor: sure|pg||
nt|mwigor: at any other vul you wouldnt dream of saving i dont think|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess it boils down to who is more likely to be overbidding - Courtney or Grosvenor (or both)|pg||
nt|mwigor: when burgess makes a slam try it sort of feels like they must both be overbidding a little|pg||
nt|mwigor: but the fact that he made a slam try and they've stopped in 4 suggests that it probably isnt a phantom|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: even if there is no @c ruff, he has three @d losers to take care of|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|andy_h: Certainly not his lucky day when partner comes down with @HAQ9 in the opponents suit|pg||
nt|ritong: the defense is not terribly difficult  south has shown @c length|pg||
nt|ritong: and west has not led his singleton, so he is void|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: was aways nice to me - pays to be nice to ur "pidgeons"|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: in response to the questions about session lengths|pg||
nt|mwigor: WBF regs allow 140 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  seems he wanted to avoid @C|pg||
nt|mwigor: ABF regs allow 120 minutes for 16 boards|pg||
nt|mwigor: (behind screens)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: @d3 now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Hopefully E/W will have got their discarding right this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: is it necessary?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|ritong: west should wonder why declarer made such a risky play in @h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: At this point @dA looks best? specs like it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||

nt|chilloncan: no major game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Gill in 4@H North|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: restart at 1300 local time i.e.76 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and expect Hans will be there too|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh -- so players are NOT going to override the schedule|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry my chat was sent before done typing --- no major game from S side|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: Burgess found a way to help NS avoid 4@H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: would be phenomenal achievement to getto 4H - N npw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how about 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: cant get to 4S N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: cool stop|pg||
nt|chilloncan: out of frying pan into fire for 1H opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps that @D are 72|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why frying pan   since @D not running this is make -- maybe overtrick!|pg||
nt|chilloncan: then is exactly my poin al|pg||
nt|chilloncan: that is exactly my point|pg||
nt|athene: certainly declarer has ten tricks, just wondering if 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry  -  i missed the qualifier re: 1@H opener|pg||
nt|chilloncan: perhaps shd have said good news bad news|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: many people would want to do something with east after partner opens 1@H|pg||
nt|chilloncan: burgess loving his lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: back in 70 minutes -- thanks Andrew|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Big hand to the commentators - if Al makes it back he will have commentated every session of this event|pg||

nt|chick: This is the last hand of this session|pg||
nt|babs59: then that's inadequate|pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not --  last board of the set|pg||
nt|mwigor: so we may be about to play an entire set without a single double digit swing|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry.... lost connection to server|pg||
mb|1C|nt|newart: in closed room they are in 3D|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator Ellena for a great job :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I wonder why @d9?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Probably a count card I would imagine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scheduled restart -- 2 minutes    colour me skeptical|pg||
mb|1H|nt|serhat: last one for tis round.  Thank you everyone. speacialy to Helena. very good work. I believe very hard last round will be on soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C  slightly more than the promised 1+|pg||
nt|ritong: i pray for a push  have a bet on 15 imps gap|pg||
nt|mwigor: 2@s by S was reached in the other room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
nt|serhat: what time Helena please?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not 1NT by East?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised by 1@C rather than 1N opener?|pg||
nt|ritong: gill!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mwigor: this looks like down 1 at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: alida often will not open a vul NT in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|ritong: but still possible|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 3N on this one?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andy_h: Nice fitting hands, seems like E/W in the OR diagnosed their diamond fit|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|mwigor: @cK switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: doesn't want to go for a numebr|pg||
nt|pelu: ok but then she has a bid problem after 1@C - 1@S -?|pg||
nt|newart: she would rebid 2C i suspect here|pg||
nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks by NS in @H|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again: dont X to a 5 card major - bid 1@H over 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a difference  only 3@H over 1@C   but  4@H over strong NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: if they lead clubs each time then declarer loses control|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, 3N as a final contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no idea.... but that's the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: restart at 1pm (AEST)|pg||
nt|othered1: How long from now, please|pg||
pc|c3|nt|serhat: Peter offered 3nt with 1.5 stopper|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 80min (1hr 20min)|pg||
nt|serhat: which was agood idea|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|newart: i'm with Pelu - get your 5card major in quickly|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugrapha1: there's a frenzy of writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do we know if West has shown a stiff @c?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry, i can't see the explanations clearly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we know why Nabil started with 2@C [FG @C or BAL] instead of 2@D [FG 5+@D]|pg||
nt|ritong: probably trying to muddy waters|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andy_h: 2@C is is GF clubs or balanced, 2@D=catch-all, 2@H bal 2+@S andasks, 2@S shows any 5-4, 3@D shows 5@S4@D|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: and if opp then stop in 2@c/2@D u can X and show your @S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: keep tuned in I expect some real fine bridge for the rest of this event  - 3X16 to go|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|newart: i wonder if they realise how close it now is - 47-6 in 7 board in this set|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|ritong: very pretty|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: if completely incomprehensible|pg||
nt|ritong: i think this is one of the most satisfying feelings in this game|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: declaring such a perfecto|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dQ|nt|andy_h: for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: zero unuseful card and xxx for x in the last suit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|frankaus: i'm told 5X16 to go|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|newart: I think it would be considered a big upset if Clark got up to win|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not 100% sure about the meaning of 3@H but given at how the auction progressed it makes sense for it to ask for further shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: OK folks, thanks for coming. We'll be back in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|andy_h: Thanks Andrew for the hard work!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|mwigor: down 3 now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: NS in 3@H in CR - prob down 1 |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|babs59: hi Neil.  I would have to agree.|pg||
nt|chick: Not a real exciting finish here, but at least we have seen some good bridge played|pg||
nt|mwigor: so the gap is down to 17 with 32 to play|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d9|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|newart: Hi barbara|pg||
