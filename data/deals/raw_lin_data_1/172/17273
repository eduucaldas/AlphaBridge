nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||

nt|mwigor: and if the other table might stop in game then you definitely want to stay at the 6-level|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mrdct: the void in south's hand is actually a bad holding|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||
