mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  2@d opening would be "Multi"?|pg||
nt|jtr: Might make 4@h  Play a @s after one trump|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: no, Polish Wilkosz for NS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: better nice pass in CR N just bid 3Nt - no fit and too few HCP|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  Can you enlighten me? What is "Polish Wilkosz"?|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 5-5 suits (except both minors)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|zyxzewski: less than opening strength|pg||
nt|jtr: Polish @c i guess|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: so probably about 3-9 for that particular NS|pg||
nt|pelu: is "Polish Wilkosz" also called "truti-fruti"?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3C!|nt|pelu: why?|pg||
nt|jtr: Many play 4@d as that sort of hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: probably 1@S followed by 4@S, whatever happens|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: they actually play Namyats|pg||
nt|jtr: Very good playing strength without high cards|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but promising 8,5-9,5 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|nt|zyxzewski: that's not probably strong enough|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|pelu: we can see 3@C as red suits - it that then convention?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that is a very bad Namyats: the spades are not strong enough and the hand is too playable in other strains|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i guess so|pg||
nt|jtr: North wont like the think|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: probably they are playing Ghestem|pg||
nt|jtr: But 5@s will be ok|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: 2@S = highest and lowest, 2NT = two lowest and 3@C = two highest|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Isn't 5@s cold?|pg||
nt|jtr: Sure|pg||
nt|jtr: Especiaaly after the X|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: if you have cold nerves to finesse spades deeply :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jtr: You can lose a @s|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that "tutti frutti" is 1) a weak 2@H or 2) 5-5 - so close but not Wilkosz :)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but after 3NT and DBL Luks can figure out that Jullis meant it|pg||
nt|henryb:  don't need to: two club ruffs and throw a @h on the @dA|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: oh yes, rightsided the contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good diamond guess will make 6|pg||
nt|jtr: You had Namyats on your mind:)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: I would have bid 4@D from Luks hand instead of 4@S|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: so then you can hope partner to decide over 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  If he plays the 8 or 10 from dummy he will make an overtrick|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: these @HKJ don't look too good when AQ are favourites to sit behind you|pg||
nt|pelu: is 3@C an overbid - or do u exp that East just overbid his hand - he sh know that his black honnors are limites value|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|jtr: pass is a very odd position|pg||

nt|zyxzewski: no|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i hate it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - but they have paid entry-fee and love to bid :):)|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: or at least i feel it's unnecessary|pg||
nt|pelu: a good rule: if u show opp your distrbution your site sh be decel more than 60% - u give too many information to decl|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: for me there are two main problems: first, if opponents are tuned to penalize you, you can be in deep trouble; second, it disrupts your own bidding|pg||
nt|henryb:  That is true of players under 30 here too -- especially since the entry fees are usually a larger part of their disposable income :)|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|pelu: and NS could buy the contract in 2@S with a lot of play for 4@H EW|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: Luks should have probably bid 2@S - Oja was prepared to play either 2@S or 3@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|henryb:  Gentlemen. Our company grows. |pg||
nt|jtr: We start with the last two boards so we will get comparisons thru 33|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: The format of competition is triple round robin, now it's the third match of final round|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Quite right not to overcall IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: Druva is leading and Monte Carlo is currently on 7th place (8 teams competing)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Do you know whether both pairs are playing Beach Diamond?|pg||
nt|jtr: But i might do something on the second round|pg||

nt|henryb:  The @h10 was an unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: i guess one of the reasons of Oja's pass was that they are playing some weird defensive system against nebulous 1@D and he wasn't able to bid his spades on 1st level and facing ...|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: passed partner he didn't like the prospects of going to 2nd|pg||
nt|henryb:  Beach @d will make many auctions unintelligible to our eyes. |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  In essence, 1@d shows any hand that does not open 1@c or 1NT and has no 5-card major|pg||
pc|c7|nt|zyxzewski: at least both pairs use 2@C as natural opening bid, so they don't have to open 1@D with all the hands, which don't contain 5 card majors|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|jtr: 3 options for North|pg||
nt|jtr: X 1@h 2NT|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: due to their defensive system Oja virtually had to start with double|pg||
nt|henryb:  in standard anyway|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|jtr: Ah 2NT minors maybe|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 2NT over nebulous should be minors i guess|pg||
nt|pelu: when @d is not @D then 2NT can be for minors|pg||
nt|henryb:  But the Estonian methods have forced very different defensive methods|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|pelu: why 2@S when u not yet had shown @D - why not 2@D|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 2@S is akin to standard - 4@S, longer diamonds|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: and max hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: Since 2@C = clubs or clubs+4 card major, 2@S guarantees diamonds|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: 2@C opening bid i meant|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H and 5@C making 5@D down 1 and can pusj opp to 51H|pg||

nt|henryb:  They did well to avoid it: in 4@h declarer ruffs the @d lead, plays two trumps, but can never get a @s trick as he runs out of trump|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he tried to show them with 3@s|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: he can't, it does show either @H and @C or @S and @D, but usually with only 4 card major and weaker hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  So he loses three spades and a trump|pg||
mc|11|nt|zyxzewski: probably if he was anyway going to 5@C, he maybe could have bid 3@H over 2@S|pg||
