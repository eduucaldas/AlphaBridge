mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt was a reasonable choice, though, getting the basic hand type across|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@D natural|pg||
nt|athene: if you fiddle around too much showing which majors you have, that can help the defence find the right lead, so you often lose out anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct: yeah - opening 4@s is a good option|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: wrong again|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|mrdct: good hand for screens - south has no stray tempo info here to help her double|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: snashall wants to make a bid|pg||
nt|caitlin: to see open room http://www.bridgebase.com/client/client.php|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrdct: helen snashall is a very agressive player so it wouldn't surprise me if she doubled|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: smart passed pretty quickly, Lachman thought for a bit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mrdct: which is why it's so much better to be playing with screens|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: or 4 diamods in 3NT|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N E-W|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds just not 4-1 and you are at least breaking even by trying to get the spade away|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: W could have tried for clubs to break nicely.... before trhowing diabmond entry then only 2 down|pg||
nt|athene: yes sure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: but the diamond would work out except when diamonds are 4-1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: yeah 3NT is the palce to be|pg||
nt|athene: east should double 5@C on that last hand, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: dunno, tricky - she isn't sure her @CKx is a trick, after south shows a fit (3@D splinter)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: 12-14?|pg||
nt|athene: but still an ace and Kx in opener's suit is quite a defensive hand for a 2-suiter overcall|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|vugrapha1: i think east should double on the 1st round |pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 3@S overcall here a little bit sick, i think|pg||

nt|mrdct: perfect shape and all that|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they did next door but then South failed to XX|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: these are 10 board matches. The second match is due to start in 18 mins|pg||
nt|athene: maybe only a bit, but you are sort of supposed to have a hand for an overcall there|pg||
nt|athene: especially vul against not|pg||

pc|d3|nt|athene: if the play record from the other room is right, south gave a ruff and discard and lost the @HA|pg||

pc|c2|pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: the format in the ladies event is a double round-robin of 10 board matches amongst the 6 teams and then the top 4 play 64-board semifinal and the 64-board final|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: remmeber the names are reversed here so its Clark 18 Bilski 7|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: agree ellen|pg||
nt|athene: south might be tempted to do something here, with such a max|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrdct: yes - deep finesse makes it easily dropping the @DQ|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
