mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mwigor: interesting to note how much more effective opening 2@s is than overcalling 2@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does everyone/anyone approve of 2N?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor: open the bidding and you get to defend some silly contract - overcall and you get to play some silly contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: at this vul  Pass must be huge contender|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think 2NT is marginal - the hand is a bit of a lemon - but if  partner had just a little more then we would be ridiculing him for passing|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the hand is a bitof a lemon, but you could still have a game and it is not as if your IMP expectation for defending 2S is particularly mouthwatering|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mwigor: it will feel a little bit silly to be playing on the suit that you could have defended - but now its time to set up our 3 @s tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|an|4+!d|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: as a point of theory and tactics, opening 2S pon that N hand has a lot of ways to lose -- main problem is playability in all 3 of the hiughest ranking suits, so it is very likely ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: to preempt your side rather than theirs. also the hand has too much defense for a preempt, and the suit is terrible|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|chilloncan: such a preempt an of course work on any given hand, and is always temoting at the colors, but trhe point is that it is really swimming against the current|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Michael got there 1st with explanation of 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: other room stopped in 2H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: self-splinter|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but it does highlight slam interest immediatel|pg||
nt|peachy: My non-scientific recordkeeping indicates aggressive preempts work 9 out of 10 - but the tenth is then a DISASTER|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if 3@C said "not worst hand"  or if just showing shape without clarification of range|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hans needed ability to make "last train" bid of 4@H  [i'm still interested, but can't bid beyond 4@S]|pg||

nt|mwigor: it looks like the defense has a trick in each suit (except hearts) - but even getting 3 may be difficult in practice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the question is --- would opp get to game with a lesser opening from Hans?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: almost anything goes at favorable, so i do not mean the following as critique but certain general points are worth mentioning  --|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|nt|chilloncan: 1)  it is a liability for a big preempt to hold the ace of your suit, because it is more defense than you  would ideally want to have when encouraging partner to take a save|pg||
nt|mwigor: the diamond switch was certainly best - now there is maybe a slight chance to beat this|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 2)  4C may leave them with no losing alternatives|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mwigor: one round of trumps before the spades would have worked much better on this layout|pg||
nt|mwigor: to stop the overtrick tony actually needs to ruff high and cash his diamond trick|pg||
nt|mwigor: he will be checking to see if there is a layout where he can beat the contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kingham's 2nd @S seems better when possible 4-0 trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Hans would open 5@C with 8@C & void|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: holding 3@H east rejected attempt at forcing game, so hoped maybe to score @C & ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: like it|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|peachy: First seat favorable, let them deal with it! Good practice|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a flacid 4@c opening in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C did NOT set up game force|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Al it's been a long day, thanks Michael on vugraph, thx audience|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 9 hours for me but back tomorrow for another lot|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: but the rebid does|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish choosing to go for a safe 300, 500 or (hopefully) 800 here rather than risk -100|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like a big pickup for klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 a suit preference card for @d|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: NS convention card says opening bids are agressive 1st seat favorable -- but this must be close to a stretch for 1@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: tony could beat it by leading a diamond i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair shot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he comes under pressure on the run of clubs though|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: should make i think|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: He might cash H first, thought it might backfire if N is void|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: favorable means  we not vul   they vul    [only they vul]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugrapha3: maybe a heart switch gives the defense a chance?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: declarer should still be ok if he knocks out @sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd run with what partner has signal for unless there is a dramatic reaosn not to|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck this, float @C10   that might get to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: A wise kib said, with trumps blocked it cant cost|pg||
nt|mrdct: that way if it's wrong it's partner's fault!|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i'm not saying that is how the play SHOULD go -- just trying to find a way to large number of tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think EW just need to follow suit to beat this|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well, guesing the @S position is a chance|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|peachy: some one once said as advice, to always make such decisions at the table that you will win post mortem (should there be one)|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hand you had better direct a D lead. it is not as if game is likely your way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm standard honor lead this time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: make that a swing posted|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Sorry, did Sartaj a disservice there, actually played @s 10 first|pg||
