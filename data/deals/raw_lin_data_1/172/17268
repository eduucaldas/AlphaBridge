mb|p|nt|ahollan1: without interference -- there's no longer a guess of  "should i pull 1N with 5 of my suit"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hi Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: west will probably try an agressive opening|pg||
nt|ritong: but it should not deter 4@s NS|pg||

nt|ritong: i predicted an aggressive opening, al  not spec 2@h:)|pg||
nt|ritong: mighta been anything between 1 and 4 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs upside-down count [if given] & attitude    EW some odd/even carding situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting  if 3@H then 3N?|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see how sartaj manages his tenth trick|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably will try for @d A onside and a ruff later on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  maybe start @D from hand -- then when/if they play trump  and @DA doesn't fall  THEN @C finesse|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: but this requires at least one trump left in dummy|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: so, indeed, he starts the suit from hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ritong: which does not cancel the @d A on case|pg||
nt|ritong: neither @c Q on  fine play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to be honest -- i focused in on that because of Sartaj's strong spots -- so dummy's QJ not needed to pull trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|sT|pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: he is wondering why west did not play a small @h|pg||
nt|ritong: and might deduce trumps are 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and still thinking Lavings has 2nd 4+ suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: which would be perfectly consistent with the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer in really good shape with East winning 2nd @D|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sQ|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: claimer when trumps do not reaveal 5/0|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the other room has already posted 3 scores -- but out movie only showing 1  --  will try to get somebody to check on room linkage|pg||
