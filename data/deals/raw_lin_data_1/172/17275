nt|andy_h: example is a multi 2@D showing a weak hand with either major. One benefit of allowing the strong hand to play is that leads will be coming towards the tenaces, on the otherhand by ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: letting the 2@D opener play the hand, it conceals the hand with more distirbution|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: looks like a total collaps for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: might get overboard here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: he bids the 5-suit rather than off-shape Double|pg||
mb|4C|an|fitshowing|mb|p|mb|4H|an|cue|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|super nova: Tony Nunn Opened 6D in the Open in First seat and was rewarded. with his partner passing.|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I think, Jamie, that the room crashed and that was just catch up result|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
nt|babs59: I think any partner would bid 7D if you opened 6D on South!!|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|babs59: bd 18  3NT is about to make for more IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: it's not just a bucketload of IMPs - more like 2 buckets|pg||
nt|pelu: but 6@D is a very fair slam - need @Ds 3-2 or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W have discussed a lot in terms of competitive bidding and evidently this is one of them. If 4@C was some sort of fit-show I wonder if they play 4@D as any max hand raise or if ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: they play that as "choice of games"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: on a @s Lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: wow and a nice switch by Dyke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: brill switch - if he rises it's curtains|pg||
nt|andy_h: If Edgtton rises with the Ace this contract will be off due to a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andy_h: Alternatively Edgtton can duck this (which is the winning play here) but that switch by Dyke was a pretty quick one|pg||
nt|andy_h: Unfortunately for Edgtton, he gave a bit too much information in the bidding which allowed Dyke to find this brilliant switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes the @h cue was informative|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dyke "knows" that partner has a doubleton heart (giving Edgtton 4 hearts and not 5) because Gill would most likely have led a heart if it was a singleton|pg||

nt|chilloncan: different when the major is sopades vs hearts, and it also depends how high you are willing to bid spades -- if  that isnt an issue and you have the blacks, 1C is fine|pg||
