mb|2C|nt|mwigor: as a result they make gamble and bid this|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: but AKQ10 not ideal opposite a splinter so north might put teh brakes on|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 6@Hs on|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||
