mb|p|mb|3N!|an|!s, short !h|nt|jcwla: What does that have to do with whether the hcp placement and the texture of the long suit made the hand a preempt in @S's?  Perhaps something but not everything.  But again matter ...|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Klinger's 2nd splinter on a stiff Ace . . worked last time . . |pg||

nt|jcwla: But if the hand is otherwise suitable, I don't hesitate to make either of these bids."|pg||
