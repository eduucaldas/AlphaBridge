nt|athene: if you fiddle around too much showing which majors you have, that can help the defence find the right lead, so you often lose out anyway|pg||

nt|caitlin: 3N E-W|pg||
nt|athene: diamonds just not 4-1 and you are at least breaking even by trying to get the spade away|pg||

nt|athene: yes sure|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: but the diamond would work out except when diamonds are 4-1 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: yeah 3NT is the palce to be|pg||

mb|p|nt|caitlin: 12-14?|pg||
nt|athene: but still an ace and Kx in opener's suit is quite a defensive hand for a 2-suiter overcall|pg||
