nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the team score, a pop-up shows the imp scale|pg||
nt|henryb:  (Gib would lead trumps)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade game for e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  a chance for EW to have an easy board|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: can't say I like 2@C here - would rpefer 1NT if it is in range|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 1@d to me, but that may be age.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 1NT = 15-17 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, I'll go with 1@D :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Remember when we used to worry about rebids?  Called "prepared bidding".|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Well, 2@C is not forcing, but it appears to have given North quite a problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  good stop|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Our 1st Burn's Law violation of the session.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: vulnerability reversed then 5@D a good save|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|othered1: This will be a yawner.   But 6N might be a bit better|pg||

nt|ady: team mates will be very gratefull for the unexpected plus|pg||
nt|chick: This would have been much better bid using control cuebids instead of ace asking|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|espooz: I dont think V should bid 4@D so long they play 2/1 "game force"|pg||
nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||
nt|brobles: yeah, for sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kmb24: when they cover then you have to play the T@s and you could take enough tricks...|pg||
nt|tez: i bet @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: this could be fun|pg||
nt|kmb24: looks like a normal 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|tez: and they will play 3 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||
nt|kmb24: but you never know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tez: 2@h is not enuf for me:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: you never know...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tez: for you?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|brobles: you were right, but still a push|pg||
mc|7|nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||
nt|brobles: I agree, I try a NT bid, not sure if 1 or 2|pg||
