nt|ahollan1: in Dan Neill's notes   1@C-P-1@S-2H  DBL=18+ HCP|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i sure hope Wiltshire asked about inferenced from Jacobs PASS|pg||
nt|janm: I agree that 4 aces and a Jack is worth 18, especially if the alternative is to pass and not show anything (or rather, imply a shaped hand with clubs)|pg||
