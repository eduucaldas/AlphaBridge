nt|noodle:  easy push to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS standard carding   EW  upside down count & attitude [and usually lead 2nd of touching honors]|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: still 1+|pg||
nt|mwigor: last set had something like 10 flat boards - and we start with another one here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: South is Peter Gill, a frequent vugraph commentator on BBO that you may have seen from time to time|pg||
nt|noodle:  do they promise 5@d for 1@d opening ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|babs59: CR playing bd 17 in 2S NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  here they play transfers so redouble shows @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S gets my vote|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sooo close|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have to pass with a classic 10+ redouble hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  dyke can still raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north had bid less -- it would be a Support DBL situation for most  [yes, even in @D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the 3@S bid is defined differently that last millenium|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it was a weak hand with lots of @S, now it is more like 2@S strength with extra length|pg||
mb|2D|an|!H|nt|babs59: I think that should put Clark in the lead|pg||
nt|newart: Barbara - i beat u again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: I believe both N/S and E/W play transfer responses to 1@C, so 1@D here shows 4+@H's|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3@D was alerted, but i'm not sure what it means. likewise with 4@D.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 4+@H|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu: so we have a new leader :)!!!!!|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, I was out of the room, so missed your comment :(|pg||
nt|noodle:  well vulnerable it can not be completely preemptive|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ianmcc: this is a thin game - needs lots right - and they are going to bid it here|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: if thy make - but hard to see it going down|pg||
nt|babs59: imagine the tension at the tables|pg||
nt|pelu: best to lead @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: Both sides play a 2/1 GF system, but E/W however have recently added a mini NT (9-12) in their arsenal when 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s seems like a make  will W sacrifice ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ9 probably worth nothing on defense   !KH probably a trick in either contract|pg||
nt|noodle:  y but E rebid at 4 level  W might be afraid 4@S is going down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hi Michael|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|andy_h: I'm not certain as to the meaning of 3@D, but I have seen this bid used as some form of a 4 card raise|pg||
nt|ianmcc: neither wants to play it|pg||
nt|noodle:  he goes for it|pg||
nt|mwigor: the other table reached game - so this will not be flat|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|newart: Sue and therese must know they are down a lot at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen Michael  as vugraph operator, player and vugraph commentator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any roles NOT filled?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: salvaging 3 imps|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|mwigor: .|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andy_h: And if that's the case, then 4@D is a retransfer, letting the stronger hand play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to set up 2nd @H trick|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|nt|pelu: lead @D out of hand - now defense can kill all @D-ruffs|pg||

nt|andy_h: example is a multi 2@D showing a weak hand with either major. One benefit of allowing the strong hand to play is that leads will be coming towards the tenaces, on the otherhand by ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: letting the 2@D opener play the hand, it conceals the hand with more distirbution|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H from East in other room -- go cand see how that will matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe  when hands shift over one key  |pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: looks like a total collaps for NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: might get overboard here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(14)15-17|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|noodle:  2@d p 2@h P P|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 1 level suit openings for NS are 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: he bids the 5-suit rather than off-shape Double|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: grosvenor's 2@h guarantees 4 card @h support (1@h would be 3)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mwigor: so it is possibly a closer decision for him than for standard players whether to bid 2 or 3|pg||
nt|mwigor: he chooses the more agressive course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: burgess would have preferred courtney to reopen with double|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: Hans in the lead!   that may be 1st time in the match|pg||
nt|mwigor: no|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT for minors i suppose; but what was wrong with the double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: Tony Nunn Opened 6D in the Open in First seat and was rewarded. with his partner passing.|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one adjunct of Garbage Stayman  allows   1N-2@C//2@D-2@H//2@S[3@S & 2@H]-3@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  crawling stayman 2@h weak with both majors or @h@c|pg||
nt|mwigor: both teams led during the first set|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "crawling" is too wimpy   i like "garbage" moniker|pg||
nt|noodle:  we have more bugs here Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I think, Jamie, that the room crashed and that was just catch up result|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
nt|babs59: I think any partner would bid 7D if you opened 6D on South!!|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: also maybe south could consider bidding 3nt with 14 hcp and those spades looking a lot like @SAKQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|babs59: bd 18  3NT is about to make for more IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: it's not just a bucketload of IMPs - more like 2 buckets|pg||
nt|pelu: but 6@D is a very fair slam - need @Ds 3-2 or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W have discussed a lot in terms of competitive bidding and evidently this is one of them. If 4@C was some sort of fit-show I wonder if they play 4@D as any max hand raise or if ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: they play that as "choice of games"|pg||
nt|noodle:  a good hand for 'non forcing' Stayman  1N 2@c P  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in other room is impressive result|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: 6@h can be made by ruffing the third round of @c high|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|nigel: Fans of the losing trick count would call 4@h  then possible to get to 6@h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|pelu: on a @s Lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: wow and a nice switch by Dyke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: brill switch - if he rises it's curtains|pg||
nt|andy_h: If Edgtton rises with the Ace this contract will be off due to a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andy_h: Alternatively Edgtton can duck this (which is the winning play here) but that switch by Dyke was a pretty quick one|pg||
nt|andy_h: Unfortunately for Edgtton, he gave a bit too much information in the bidding which allowed Dyke to find this brilliant switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes the @h cue was informative|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dyke "knows" that partner has a doubleton heart (giving Edgtton 4 hearts and not 5) because Gill would most likely have led a heart if it was a singleton|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|newart: in CR they are in 3NT on last baord and will make so more to Clak|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Gosney-Edgtton play 1N favorable vul 1st/2nd = 9-12  so 1@C instead of 1N opener there|pg||

nt|nickf: Hi to Serhat Ozenir and Ian McCance|pg||
nt|mwigor: hans is endplayed at this point|pg||
nt|athene: someone asks why south couldn't double 2@S for penalties - i don't know if their system allowed him to and he just decided not|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|mwigor: burgess could get the @h right himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room will start  1@C-P-1@S[trf] -  DBL?   not sure where things will go from there|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|babs59: 5@C makes on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: vulnerable so Clark will expect a decent hand|pg||
nt|newart: as long as she isn't tempted to gamble 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: the best tecnical bid is 3@D - asking for stoppers in major - but that bid also tell opp how to defend|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@h would be illegal over 1@s|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pelu: 19 flat in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: Certainly a good confidence boost to the start of the second set for N/S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close was he to 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he didn't really think for very long. so i'm guessing not very.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Courtney did rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor is just furthering the pre-empt|pg||
nt|serhat: yes small C and C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: harder otherwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  Dyke in 2@HX Westt|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|vugrapha1: http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/results/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should be 2nd lead change of the set|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i was about to say  ABF convention cards don't describe type of Game Tries|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Impressive stop|pg||
nt|nigel: A tougfh decision by Burgess, pass seems reasonable but with shortness he has correctly acted 5@s mey be a bit high|pg||
pc|sT|nt|serhat: yes small @S could cause problems.. ofcourse S had to lay small|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|babs59: generated the 5C bid!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this figures to be down 1 with everything wrong|pg||
pc|d9|nt|newart: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|newart: Alida not shy |pg||
nt|newart:  this will be a few more imps I suspect|pg||
nt|mwigor: you think he will make 2@hX?|pg||
nt|athene: diamond now, saving the spade ruff as entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no that's wrong  Dyke on Courtney team|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: Grosvenor's decision to take low road is right -- this hand|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm told that the other table actually made game and that the score is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is close   pure values, 4 card fit, singleton|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  makes sense given only 3 obvious losers and the QJx for H coming down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have actually looked at the hand instead of the other room result :(|pg||
nt|serhat: yes -1 ..If they are playing 6-11 NT 3d is a little much for this hand. Pass is also difficult|pg||
pc|d4|nt|babs59: I love it when the opps could pass out part-score then you bid to making game.  Such psychological damage|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2@C is a transfer to diamonds, a very common treatment nowadays after 1M (dbl)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gruffydd:  So I better change my statement to "unimpressive stop" :D|pg||
nt|ianmcc: N/S can make a partial|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|mwigor: was about to say i think ishmael needs to get @c going for the defense|pg||
nt|mwigor: but he beat me to it|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: 2@HX going for a million in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: big swing to hans|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats what i would have thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most ACBL players don't have to deal with transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C - 1@S (art) X - you really should have discussed this one surely?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: 12 tricks now = 950|pg||
nt|athene: sure but when you sit down against a pair who play it, that is the first thing you discuss|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mwigor: now grosvenor will have two clubs to cash to go with his trump trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newart: in 3NT on previous board in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key to know difference between DBL and "cue"|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both players went low -- i think Ish's pass probably closer than Hugh's 2@S vs 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|s7|nt|serhat: 2h easy|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: also good to have generic understandings e.g. x of art bid is that suit, or x of art bid is t/o of suit shown|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mwigor: in fact he can now tap the south hand out|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugrapha1: east just claimed on a double squeeze :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gruffydd:  Ish's pass is likely based on the fact that Grosvenor might have only 3-card S support ... that swings the odds for his decision|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mwigor: meanwhile this is +130|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: and singleton @H not great for offense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 1@S usually a weak nt response, there really is no cue, so default should be DBL = @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: always nice to underplay when you've underbid   takes away some of the sting|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  Methods that employ a Kaplan-style inversion of 1S and 1NT so that 1S is a forcing NT type with up to 4S and a 1NT response shows 5+S can avoid this particular issue by establishing whether a fit actually exists at the 2-level,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Burgess in 4@H East|pg||
nt|mwigor: should it?|pg||
nt|mwigor: dont you want a way to show a good hand with both majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: 2@s can show spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: When I made her play last sets, she ALWAYS played well.  I think the pressure makes her play better!|pg||
nt|pelu: 67 - 6 and the 6 IMP was a gift from defense :)|pg||
nt|newart: thats twice where Alida has taken a conservative action then bid game after ops bid again|pg||
nt|mwigor: the late ted chadwick was famous for saying that the second person to bid at the 5-level better know what they are doing - once again he was right on board 20|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: 6@Hs on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I thought South's @h7 could hold out sqz|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 2@C & 2@D are probably not needed a natural -- but you could be right Michael|pg||
nt|mwigor: if the auction had gone 1@c-1NT would you play double as showing @ss?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gruffydd:  ... before the decision to invite is made.  But this might require using a Flannery opening depending on the rest of the system.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT is an impressive score from Burgess-Courtney|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||
nt|babs59: so they are in 4S NS|pg||
nt|nigel: No doubt Grosvenor was simply following the LAW with 11 trumps competing to the five level|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think grosvenor's raise is clear - the action in question is north's 5-over-5|pg||
nt|nigel: This will be tough to stay out of slam|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think either method is enough better than the other that it's worth worrying about really|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't compare -- transfers offer more options|pg||
nt|athene: you either play x as showing the suit or x as t/o|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mwigor: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: just play same way as partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: yes 6@Hs is not very good - but as the match has gone - N know she need some good boards|pg||
nt|mwigor: if ishmael thinks 3NT shows strong balanced rather than a long running diamond suit then he will bid again|pg||
nt|nigel: Good point Michael but Courtney has never been backwards in coming forward. He does not know who is making what and the oppo forgot to double!|pg||
nt|mwigor: even if he suspects running diamonds he probably cant pass|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this could make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugrapha1: i think 1S showed a strong NT with 3@S...|pg||
nt|nigel: Grosvenor has done well here|pg||
nt|serhat: he cant go wrong now.. either QD or QS 7th trick|pg||
nt|mwigor: you gain a 1NT overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: the 1@C is a short club. Edgtton didn't open 1NT because they play 9-12 mini NT in 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|mwigor: 4@c is clearly a slam try|pg||
nt|nigel: but not the Vandabilt runner up|pg||
nt|mwigor: is 4NT - please leave me alone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: low @c from both hands?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: the danger with 4@d is it may sound like a cue for @c|pg||
nt|serhat: Peter, may be saying now, I should have played Q!:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nigel: Looks like a runaway train|pg||
nt|mwigor: everything else should be as if its gone 1@c-1NT in my view|pg||
nt|athene: interesting burgess doesn't raise diamonds here|pg||
nt|athene: he probably thought it might help his opponents into a thin 4@H and perhaps help them play it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i suspect other room auction was the same, but operator lost track when correcting the score for Board 4 :(|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The QD coming down makes things easy .. but does declarer know about it early enough in the hand to actually play the required line?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mwigor: at the other table gill opened the east hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case you missed it  on 19 2@HX went for 1700|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|mwigor: incredibly despite opening the east hand they stopped in 4@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: making 12 tricks on a heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|gruffydd:  specs suggesting a crossruff will also work ... but the timing is very difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it needed?   2@C 2@D 1@S  then scramble 5 trump tricks?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only a heart lead lets this make i think|pg||
nt|serhat: not knowing K off|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: e.g. if he jump raises diamonds, a good hand looking at @Dxxx might decide his partner has a singleton, and do something or other|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mwigor: declarer may think his best chance is to finesse clubs - giving him two pitches|pg||
nt|mwigor: that would not have worked|pg||

nt|serhat: well he has enough for splinter for me.. what ever their method's is|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: ouch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure hope that's forcing :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: although Majors score more i think if i was going to introduce a suit with that hand i'd prefer to introduce the clubs|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I think that if you're willing to play partner for AKxxxx for their 2S (does it show 8-11?) opening then 6C is actually a good punt|pg||

nt|babs59: in the OR  I imagine Peter (Gill's)  2@D after 1@c then 1nt overcall showed both majors|pg||
nt|babs59: then his 3@D showed diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|serhat: I would be woried for @S with 14|pg||

nt|athene: now you can finesse the @C8 and just pay up with a smile when east played @CQ from @CQ10 doubleton|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ianmcc: well done|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Spade lead is the most awkward cutting comminications, here.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|newart: Ace spades and switch would beat it wouldn't it?|pg||
nt|pelu: no she can play on @Hs and finess @CQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 = attitude|pg||
pc|c2|nt|babs59: a bit of a let off in the Open Room because 1NTX or any escape would have been nasty|pg||
nt|mwigor: this looks like down 1|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|babs59: she doesn't know the spades are blocked tho|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those leads for years  and they still confuse me|pg||
nt|mwigor: interestingly east was correct to play Q from QT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: but it looks DD to play that way|pg||
nt|andy_h: Upon reviewing N/S's system card, their 1m openings are both 2+|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: reverse count|pg||
nt|mwigor: only chance for a trick when south has K97x|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|d7|nt|mwigor: for 2 imps to hans|pg||

nt|pelu: strange discard for sure|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mwigor: east should possibly also play Q from QTx?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: andy when would they open 1@d with 2?|pg||
nt|athene: yes |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  but Gill only needed 2 himself|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: darn   i wanted more time to decide if 2nd round of @D should have been @D2 to Q|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andy_h: Andrew informed me that they open 1@D when they hold 18-19NT|pg||

nt|ianmcc: or not|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: the gap is widening|pg||
mb|p|nt|gruffydd:  4S EW looks like a make, except that on trump leads you need to tackle C for a source of tricks|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: sore is a good word in this context|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The N-S team must be|pg||
nt|newart: I think the Bilski team will be in serious shock|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not sure, it appears that they would have taken out the 18-19NT hands out of 1@C and put them in 1@D thereby putting some pressure off the 1@C openings (so 1@C-transfer-accept ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can be passed)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is NOT auto game force|pg||
mb|2D|nt|serhat: dbl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually for NS 2/1 doesn't even promise a rebid|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: 3nt has lots of tricks with the minors behaving|pg||
mb|p|nt|gruffydd:  Double will pick up 2 possibly critical IMPs here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andy_h: so 1@D is either 5+@D or 18-19NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: its unusual that someone else thinks a hand is worth a bid and courtney doesnt in my experience|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they will get in one round of trumps for -100|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: 6c could make on a spade lead.. but hard to play from this point|pg||
nt|henryb:  which may be good as the foul splits make all contracts difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's late for everybody|pg||
nt|chick: other than the trump losers, this looks pretty solid|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: @DJ shift nasty here|pg||
nt|ianmcc: and likely|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: but not enough|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  dare I say another flat board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: almost 19:30 in Sydney|pg||
nt|athene: in fact you make 6@D don't you?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: Courtney playing 4-handed and had to play extra day of bridge winning its Repchage match while Hans [6-man] sat out by winning Division 1 Round Robin|pg||
nt|athene: burgess not put off by heart length over him|pg||
pc|h2|nt|newart: Barbara - there is some consolation for them isn't there - they get to represent Australia at PABF?|pg||
nt|babs59: not this year Neil|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 boards remaining tonight and 32 more tomorrow    "possibly critical" probably premature|pg||
nt|mwigor: on the basis of what we've seen so far this match rates to be quite close|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I think this will go down to the wire. Both teams will fight tooth and nail: one of the best Open Team Trials finals we've seen here in Aus|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, Hans winning against Brown in one of the open semi-finals|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: this year the Zonal Championships are part of the APBF|pg||
nt|newart: oh so no consolation prize this year|pg||
nt|babs59: so the team has to go to the APBF and then the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|pelu: is this bidding correct???|pg||
nt|babs59: joint 'target events' in 2011|pg||
nt|babs59: I think West bid 3C not South|pg||
nt|newart: i suspect Clark bid 3C|pg||
nt|pelu: or is the 3@C bid by Clark?|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney should be able to work it out. He can see that the clubs are breaking and most likely declarer would have either @SA or @SQ for the 3NT bid so he must switch to a diamond|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: possible fatigue factor    Hans 6-man team and had a full day off by virtue of winning Division 1 Round Robin|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: gill claiming one off here.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|athene: hans|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ianmcc: we'll see|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pelu: the bidding sh call for a @c-lead|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  6@c will not make, I don't think except on the @dA or @c3 lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it's 5@c that's critical for a swing and how to get there?|pg||
mc|9|nt|rodal f: Wandered if 2 @D could be a major. If vug could give exsplains it would be nice, Sorry my foalt.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i think 2d is weak 2 in a major. 2n was an inquiry and 3d showed i think 6-9 in spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|chick: I'm sure 2@D was multi for the weak 2@S bid, but not sure about the 3@D.  I play it as good weak 2 in spades, but some reverse that|pg||

mb|5C|mb|5S|nt|vugrapha1: 1C is 2+ and 1H was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D also 2+   if balanced then 18-19 HCP|pg||

pc|s2|nt|andy_h: a phantom sac, with the added insult of a trump promotion. But Dyke couldn't believe his luck when his partner made a negative double in his 6-card side suit|pg||

nt|henryb:  on 8 rather|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so more for Courtney|pg||
pc|s3|nt|noodle:  800 or 1100|pg||

nt|mwigor: i would bid 2NT|pg||
nt|nigel: So would the rest of the world!|pg||

nt|mwigor: might have been better to lead up to @dJ and @cK for two heart pitches|pg||
nt|mwigor: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: north has to cash the club anyway or else it goes on the @DJ|pg||

nt|ianmcc: alwats there seems to be a ruffing value|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: if only down 500 then +3 IMP, but the risk is that 4@S cant make - |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|noodle:  or that pard already pushed because of favorable vul|pg||

pc|hK|nt|pelu: but the gamble the other way is that u push EW to the 5-level|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what/how/when should Nunn get to 3 or 4@H?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mwigor: its normal to bid 2@c on this pattern - partner will bid a 4 card red suit if he holds one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mwigor: or indeed in this case a 3 card red suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: on the @S N should signal for @c - now 4@S prob making|pg||

nt|chilloncan: well nobody trally had a double|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the point of fit-showing jumps was they allowed west to double on hands like this|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess if east has @CKQ that is a lot worse than @CA|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes|pg||
nt|athene: since you aren't getting your ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but still - where is declarer putting his losers? |pg||
nt|chilloncan: i thopught the point of FJS was more generally to know when to stop bidding and when to go on.|pg||
nt|athene: true, that as well|pg||
nt|serhat: if partner 3c is something , dbl is very normal. no one will be angry with you|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: but we can see @hKJ|pg||
nt|athene: another perhaps more important point is that if you double, partner is more likely to read your club lead as a singleton|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|chilloncan: when they have enough trumps and cross-m,atched shortnesses they can make a LOT of tricks. and they are NV. and it is N who doubled so very possible heart king will leer at you ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: from dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 1@D=2+   3@C used to show @C & @D|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: maybe "lured" was a better word than thrown away :)|pg||
nt|mwigor: so no fit is ever missed|pg||
nt|mwigor: tony and sartaj play weak NT in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|babs59: got doubled and it got messy|pg||
nt|mwigor: and strong NT in 3rd|pg||
nt|babs59: I think Sartaj (North) was 3rd seat 1NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 12-14 cards S-W cards... going to bd 12|pg||
nt|ianmcc: that's got to be an IMP|pg||
nt|serhat: wasnt the best lead|pg||
nt|mwigor: so a chance for the courtney team|pg||
nt|athene: nunn could have done something over 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Nunn DBL instead of 2@H?    i can't even figure out best auction after seeing all the hands|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mwigor: but sartaj seems to open 1NT on lots of hands that dont strictly fall into the 15-17 balanced range|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: definitely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = a) 18-19 HCP, BAL, 2+@D  b) 11+ HCP, 4+@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|noodle:  y now well within reach  wd clark|pg||
nt|mwigor: michael has opened the final contract in the other room|pg||
nt|mwigor: however ishmael will probably just overcall 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: These 4 are possibly the most fascinating players in AUS|pg||
nt|andy_h: A second contract that's three-down in the OR. You can check their bidding by moving your mouse cursor over the Open Room's score on the top left hand corner (assuming you're using ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: the windows client of BBO)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: some 4@h|pg||
nt|andy_h: Any information on 3@D Andrew? Some sort of raise I'd imagine, could be bergen-y or my guess is a fit showing|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I assume - but can't see|pg||
nt|mwigor: sartaj ended up playing 3@cX after opening 1NT|pg||
nt|babs59: Sartaj ended in 3@CX  which could go for 800 but appears likely to go for 500|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=8-11 HCP  5@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mwigor: 2@c is also the "standard response on a 3433 shape (assuming too strong for any of your systemic 3 card raises)|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry - too slow of me|pg||
nt|babs59: wow - Ish is hopeful, wanting a X from Hugh|pg||
nt|mwigor: can grosvenor find the re-opening double|pg||
nt|mwigor: earlier in the week i heard kieran dyke commenting on the success of his teammates 2M openings|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mwigor: i don't think he is changing to playing them any time soon|pg||
nt|athene: will the defence get their crossruff here?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andy_h: But if it's fit showing I wonder what Gill is thinking about - his singleton diamond must be the second worst holding in partner's suit|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|noodle:  other room S decided on the multi with a bad suit and opps never found @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: come on Gosney, @h4|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be too hard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: Del'monte runners up last week in US Spring nationals|pg||
nt|henryb:  a club will do fine|pg||
pc|h9|nt|noodle:  that s why aggressive vul game bids is very important  so hard to defend perfectly  reward is big|pg||
nt|ianmcc: sac or ax?|pg||
nt|babs59: I recall once that Tim Seres opened NV 3@S in front of me|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: we also had a stretch where one commentator thought they were obvious loss to the opening side|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: oh yes|pg||
nt|othered1: but @D won't|pg||
nt|henryb:  of course 4@s is cold on the layout|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andy_h: Nobody likes the penalty double|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|mwigor: there is a lot to be said for bidding something at your first turn|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Both declarers (Grosvenor and Courtney) had the chance for an overtick on the previous board if they'd cashed out ending in hand and then played a club to the TC ... south would have only Clubs left and be endplayed for the final trick.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so there you have it -- those 2 bids are either great or awful  or vice versa|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|mwigor: even when it is a silly contract it makes it hard for them to get you|pg||
nt|babs59: I held a 19 count incl. @SAKQ109x  but figured 3NT was the best bet|pg||
nt|mwigor: take your time and it is much easier for them to double|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|frankaus: Burgess has the highest WBF rating of all aussies|pg||
nt|ianmcc: surely @cK next?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andy_h: I wouldn't blame them I guess. There was a hand in this tournament (I can't remember when) where one made a penalty (lightner-ish) double of an opponent's bid of 5@H (a response to ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: keycard when they were on their way to slam) but that was taken so lightly and was rewound for an overtrick|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm a bit surprised both claimed early without looking for that line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by ability to show 18-19 with 1N   some who play transfers over 1@C have that ability too|pg||
pc|s9|nt|babs59: sometimes it's just too big an ask for partner to dbl|pg||
nt|mwigor: this looks like the same 3 down - but 8 imps to courtney|pg||
nt|othered1: So, risk is full game swing reward is push with normal 4@S.  Doesn't seem like the odds are with me.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mwigor: i watched every board of the Australian Playoff in 2000 - and burgess-marston seemed to have huge success with the auction 2M (X) 3M|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|mwigor: gumby-lazer play a similar method|pg||
nt|mwigor: opening 1@c with 17-19 BAL and 1@d with 11-13 BAL (1NT is 14-16)|pg||
nt|mwigor: it means you can never "raise" partner|pg||
nt|ianmcc: must go back next set|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mwigor: the contents of the raisers hand didnt seem to have any bearing on whether or not he made the bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: in Cr West open 1@H - ok for me - but East pushed her to 3@h|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|frankaus: Courney made a living as a rubber bridge player in high stakes games and has a incredible immegination - the most dangerous player at the table|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW almost always open 1@D with 4@D & 4@C [when not in NT range]|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: 3NT is presumably showing a splinter of some range|pg||
nt|mwigor: with 4x showing a different range|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: shows one must ALWAYS count cards... even in National events|pg||

nt|serhat: guess both side leads @C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ianmcc: 3NT no joy|pg||
nt|beauch:  expect so- burgess made comment before tourney - very unusual for him to be the most normal person on team |pg||
nt|babs59: that would prevent some of the 4@H accidents we've seen|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: It has been said that the only time opps have any idea about whats in Courtneys hand is when he is out of the bridge room|pg||
nt|mwigor: well supposedly low IMP turnover is an indicator of high quality bridge|pg||
nt|athene: well you better cash that diamond against 6@C|pg||
nt|athene: not that 6@C is getting bid i suppose|pg||
mb|3D|an|checkback|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: long think from Gill b4 passing that out|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D=checkback|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D looks like "old minor forcing" :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mwigor: i think its a @h splinter - hence hugh's eagerness to signoff|pg||

nt|ianmcc: it looks better|pg||
nt|athene: do they play wolff there?|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@C wld be puppet to 3@D to sign off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: i'm told that 2S would have been invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C covers a couple of different hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- or some slam tries|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in @C|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D asking for 4@H or 3@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: now the 2 tricks -- get to 6@C   avoid @D lead|pg||
nt|athene: 6-5 hands aren't usually associated with notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: only in the sense of "i don't want to play in... with this hand" :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|frankaus: They they are almost certain he has a cigarette in his hand|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt might be taken as a sign-off|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: shouldn't nunn be bidding 4@H here or something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think Grosvenor did better job of evaluating this hand than Courtney  [unlike board 4]|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  For those that wonder why it's good to play 2S as INV here, it's because it frees up the auction 1NT - 2H-2S-2NT for some other purpose.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  for instance, a 2nd round of transfers can be played, so that minor-suit fits can easily be agreed at the 3-level, or to allow INV hands to show both their suits, or ...|pg||
nt|mwigor: if thats the case nunn has take an extremely lucky view|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|mwigor: some play transfer splinters which might be even better|pg||
nt|athene: he has a good hand for clubs?|pg||
nt|mwigor: i would have thought so yes|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well, it worked out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK looking fairly useless opposite 10+ black cards|pg||
nt|athene: but AQxx in trumps must be worth something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ... for slam purposes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, the principle being that the opps can't dbl so easily|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3NT = @c splinter, 4@c = @d splinter, 4@d = @h splinter - you accept the transfer as a kind of "last train"|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: notice difference if  you throw out @HKQ and @DK for @DA|pg||

nt|andy_h: I think the 'standard' meaning is natural and forcing, but I myself prefer it as NF, a good hand but can be raised|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  But at my table West opened 2@s or some facsimile thereof|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: final session of the night scheduled to begin at bottom of the hour -- so just a pinch of time pressue|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: An uncommon (but often right) lead|pg||
nt|mwigor: if they play 3 @h then its -150|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: in CR BS in 4@S|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|pelu: could be 15 for Clark - and even if 4@S down 1 then +12|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: except that 4@D all pass looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|serhat: if both minors dont break 3-3 then you need an extra trick before it is too late|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unless S can open 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: A big pre-empt here would be bad|pg||
nt|athene: if south opens a pusillanimous 3@D, then west will bid 3nt, i suppose|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|chilloncan: none so feckless as to oen 3D in Trials final, surely|pg||
nt|athene: well, some play 4@D shows a good spade hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: from the result shown the lead should stay at 2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: then they would open 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ  3@D opening would have 2 less @D|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: in the other room west let declarer get a heart pitch|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: sorry, E omitted to pitch a @D, that was me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he blank the @DK?|pg||

nt|mwigor: stephen is known for opening 74 patterns at the game level|pg||

nt|athene: 4@D will get passed out for 3 or 4 down i suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|pelu: 2@H is max for EW -and 2½§C for NS - but very normal that both sides overbid a little|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  On this board at the other table Nabil misclaimed having incorrectly thought clubs had been set up in his hand, which the commentators thought cost him the contract, but it's not clear to me.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i guess Ish had 2 ways to show 3@S  --  or maybe RDBL is not Support|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3NT in the other room on this - dare i predict yet another board with only overtricks at stake?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ianmcc: 10 correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with 4@S East would rebid 2@S, not 1@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think xx is something else|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s shows 3|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S wasn't natural|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mwigor: xx is probably old fashioned penalty style|pg||

pc|sA|nt|pelu: spects: 3nt makes on @Hlead|pg||
nt|serhat: no. but unfortunate contract for NS|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: need some good guesses here |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they won't be allowed to play the last two boards, as they've run out of time. |pg||
pc|c3|nt|frankaus: awful lead problem|pg||
nt|frankaus: cortney gets off to the best lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: who do we back? def  or declarer?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: declarer :)|pg||
nt|chick: whoever makes the most brilliant plays :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'm backing defence |pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  why?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Not sure I agree with that regulation in a final :/|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont like it at any stage ...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: the best hope I can see is a heart club squeeze on S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|timb: When the 2=4 @S comes to light, Ish may reason that Courtney has @HJ, @DQ & @CQ_J|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like 7 tricks to me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|serhat: easier for trupm contracts when you have 7 or more|pg||
pc|dA|nt|serhat: yes on H finese|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mwigor: although in practice it is necessary in tournaments with lots of tables|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry* they are completing the set.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it sets very good precedence|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: since the quick burst from Hans   Courtney won imps on then next 4 boards  set score is  Hans 38  Courtney 18|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|serhat: I was talking about 1S bid.. you bid 1s with 44 in the minors or with this hand as well I noticed. |pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s denies a 4 card major|pg||
nt|serhat: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  and not 10-12 balanced|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 1s=4+ D / NT 6-9 or 13+ or D|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: play low in trick 1 on @H-lead = making|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  How long do they have for each 16 here??|pg||
nt|ritong: something sad happened next room on that board|pg||
nt|mwigor: and i dont understand why the final isnt being played as two 48 board days on the same timetable as bermuda bowl will be|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mwigor: the abf should be allowing more time for sets behind screens in my opinion|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||

nt|athene: trump promo for -3|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer was in 3Nt, @c lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: he took a good start cashing one @d, then @s off dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 64-32 setup is a mystery   must be money issue|pg||
nt|ritong: east hopped ace and cashed two top @cs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: sorry still down 1|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Henri ... it looked to me like Nabil was going to go off anyway, assuming last club not cashed?|pg||
nt|ritong: at that point, contract was made|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: well he has two entries, one for setting the @c and one to cash it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible reason --  easier this way to get flights out of Sydney tomorrow with early finish|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@H not so bad for EW but down on a club lead i suppose - south splits his honours and gets a ruff|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|serhat: dbl?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2C with W hand. pd didnt overcall so they are likely to have spade fit and thus can probably outbid you. if od has anything there will be Ds in his hand and that is not ...|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S?|pg||
nt|athene: surely not|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mwigor: technically it is in range - but only if you count @cJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: and indeed that is the contract in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: if he does, courtney will just bid 4|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: yes, but since he claimed...:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do YOU define misfit?|pg||
nt|ritong: affair was over|pg||
nt|mwigor: as nine of the ten players live in sydney - flights are not a consideration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really 9 of the 10?|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: sydney is where the vast majority of australia's top players live|pg||
nt|babs59: flights may have been a consideration when the program was created - they couldn't predict who the finalists would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's the odd man?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the danger for NS now is not missing 4@h but getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: gill should raise @cs despite his minimum|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney's double suggesting they play equal-level-conversion. Meaning if partner bids clubs he can remove that to 2@D which does not say anything about a strong hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor|pg||
nt|ritong: so we will never know if burgess would have played a @h or a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dyke peeking around the screen to see if Ish really passed 2@H ???|pg||
nt|mwigor: presumably they have the agreement that 3@c would show a good 3@h bid|pg||
nt|mwigor: so michael is showing a bad 3@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm kidding folks|pg||
nt|babs59: well a non-forcing 3@H bid anyway|pg||
nt|mwigor: in the other room sartaj was content to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: same start next room|pg||
nt|ritong: different ending|pg||
pc|d2|nt|babs59: seems Ish is thinking|pg||
nt|mwigor: 5@d is in fact a good save for EW|pg||
nt|mwigor: (i think)|pg||
nt|athene: EW could make 5@C?|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry diamond to lose |pg||
nt|athene: as well as spade and heart|pg||
nt|athene: but 4@H....|pg||
nt|mwigor: what about 4@h|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|frankaus: i played a lot of rubber V cortney, he has a lot of my money :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
nt|andy_h: Indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: @c ruff will set this, but good try|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think diamond lead & contin gets it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I think he's angling for 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure gosney has enough to compete  possibly his side has eight trumps only|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: now only 13 IMPs diff - and I still dont belive the 6 IMPin board 27|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a lot of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|athene: i thought west had a diamond void, but that is AFTER he led :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chick: I hope you got your money's worth in education :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: well, this might be good for courtney, in that a slower auction to 4@S will get it doubled|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: gill must feel not so confident|pg||
nt|ianmcc: unless he has to come back in clubs|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, the East hand has quite a lot of defence so it's tough to take the save|pg||
nt|babs59: unwilling to take a phantom|pg||
nt|mwigor: sure|pg||
nt|mwigor: at any other vul you wouldnt dream of saving i dont think|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess it boils down to who is more likely to be overbidding - Courtney or Grosvenor (or both)|pg||
nt|mwigor: when burgess makes a slam try it sort of feels like they must both be overbidding a little|pg||
nt|mwigor: but the fact that he made a slam try and they've stopped in 4 suggests that it probably isnt a phantom|pg||
nt|athene: @C2 saying "yes, diamond ruff please" maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 26 where we were wondering how Nunn should bet to @H partscore or game    where Nunn PASSED  Dyke just rebid 4@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: even if there is no @c ruff, he has three @d losers to take care of|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|nt|andy_h: Certainly not his lucky day when partner comes down with @HAQ9 in the opponents suit|pg||
nt|ritong: the defense is not terribly difficult  south has shown @c length|pg||
nt|ritong: and west has not led his singleton, so he is void|pg||

nt|andy_h: Spec points out that if Team Hans hold on here Nabil will overtake Gosney's record as the youngest ever Australian Open Team Representative at age 19 (Gosney was 21)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll   5 imp spread  but it is really this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, hans can't lose on this board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: i thought Nabil turned 20 earlier this year|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: more likely another pickup the way they bid|pg||
nt|babs59: Nabil is still 17 isn't he|pg||
nt|babs59: I mean he's 18, turning 19|pg||
nt|babs59: 19 in May|pg||
nt|serhat: I think they will bid the slam now. Congrats to Hans team.. and very well done to 4men Courtney team..|pg||
nt|mwigor: they may bid 7 now|pg||
nt|babs59: it gets confusing because Adam Edgtton is 20 :)|pg||
nt|serhat: if no miracle last hand was a last chance for Courtney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|serhat: dbled 4s would bring them a victory|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 7 could go down on 8 of D lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unlikely but not impossible|pg||
nt|athene: refuse finesse - what, play for @HQJx?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not enough other tricks|pg||
nt|serhat: 7 is on a finese isnt it?|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont see what declarer's other chance is?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: clubs 33 and hearts QJx|pg||
nt|mwigor: not enough bill you need to find pitches for 3@d and a @c|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw @C, ruff @C good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dare i ask -- is 1N going to make it TOUGHER to get to ANY slam?|pg||
nt|athene: but that is too thin|pg||
nt|mwigor: surely you just take the finesse|pg||
nt|serhat: for that also spade 2-2 needed.. what a 7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pitch one club on heart then ruff out clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you just close your eyes and say "small please"|pg||
nt|serhat: poor Nabil.. he doesnt know 6s is good enough!:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: much lower percent than finess of course but on 8 of diamonds lead N might assume no D king with E, as it is not as though E is leading thru the NT bidder|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you are a bit short of entries to north anyway for that|pg||
nt|mwigor: you cant even make playing for QJx of @h and 3-3 clubs not enough entries|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could shut your eyes and bid 6@s|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: i don't know if they play same conventions over the mini-NT as over strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: you can Micheal with spade finese|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot on Ian !!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: gotcha|pg||
nt|serhat: !:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he did! well maybe he shut his eyes and bid 7@S, but missed it and bid 6 instead|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find the right bid with closed eyes|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: next set scheduled to begin in about 25 minutes|pg||

nt|serhat: what time Helena please?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not 1NT by East?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised by 1@C rather than 1N opener?|pg||
nt|ritong: gill!|pg||
nt|athene: they might go to 7@S here|pg||
nt|athene: north has a monster facing a 2@C with spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mwigor: this looks like down 1 at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: alida often will not open a vul NT in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|ritong: but still possible|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you get to 3N on this one?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|andy_h: Nice fitting hands, seems like E/W in the OR diagnosed their diamond fit|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|mwigor: @cK switch|pg||
nt|athene: but if he starts cueing hearts that will turn south off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D ostensibly 0-8 HCP|pg||
mb|4N|nt|newart: doesn't want to go for a numebr|pg||
nt|pelu: ok but then she has a bid problem after 1@C - 1@S -?|pg||
nt|newart: she would rebid 2C i suspect here|pg||
nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks by NS in @H|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: again: dont X to a 5 card major - bid 1@H over 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a difference  only 3@H over 1@C   but  4@H over strong NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: if they lead clubs each time then declarer loses control|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather, 3N as a final contract|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no idea.... but that's the auction|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: restart at 1pm (AEST)|pg||
nt|othered1: How long from now, please|pg||
nt|mwigor: you dont want to be in 7 (needs the @d finesse) but you will probably make it if you bid it|pg||
nt|athene: so they might just power into it and get lucky|pg||
nt|athene: if you know the match is this close, the traditional imp odds don't apply|pg||
mb|5C|nt|serhat: Peter offered 3nt with 1.5 stopper|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 80min (1hr 20min)|pg||
nt|serhat: which was agood idea|pg||
nt|athene: it's more like board a match|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|newart: i'm with Pelu - get your 5card major in quickly|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: there's a frenzy of writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do we know if West has shown a stiff @c?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry, i can't see the explanations clearly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we know why Nabil started with 2@C [FG @C or BAL] instead of 2@D [FG 5+@D]|pg||
nt|ritong: probably trying to muddy waters|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andy_h: 2@C is is GF clubs or balanced, 2@D=catch-all, 2@H bal 2+@S andasks, 2@S shows any 5-4, 3@D shows 5@S4@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|pelu: and if opp then stop in 2@c/2@D u can X and show your @S|pg||
