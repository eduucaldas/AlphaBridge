qx|c3|st||md|1SH75DA8732CQJT973,SAQ85HAK64DT654CK,SJT9643HQJ32DC854|sv|e|nt|kiwibridge: the preemptive 1@D opening seems to have stolen the day|pg||
nt|psridhar: "if only people bid what they have and not what they dont....."  Late Kaplan :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hello Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: Michael Rosenberg notes 6 makes on any lead so my bad there.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so please excuse any delays if I need to look up their methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|psridhar: be that as it may, Yeh just inched 4 Imps closer|pg||
nt|garnetts: didn't fancy 3@D then :) |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kiwibridge: yep|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dagold: I suspect many would overcall 2@c on west non-vul but few would vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@H a @S bid and the double to show @H's - presumably higher level choices available to one or both sides.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not mind 1NT on the North hand --I think 2@C at red is too rich |pg||
nt|dagold: 2@h a transfer|pg||
nt|dagold: showing 6+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sad to admit, thik I would have tried 2 spades with East|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dagold: Goodman has decided to get off the bus|pg||
nt|dagold: had he completed the transfer suspect he would have heard 3N next|pg||
nt|cicus: Is this the room with Polish commentary?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kiwibridge: 3@H is making|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@c is the limit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark:  best to stop quickly on a misfit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as is 4@C :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I might under an assumed name |pg||
nt|kamyk: dzieñ dobry|pg||
pc|d4|nt|idc: Hi all and sorry for appearing late|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ian Crorie|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: and this contract looks in danger too |pg||
nt|dagold: This looks close but probably 1 down|pg||
nt|dagold: due to the bad red suit breaks|pg||

pc|dK|nt|psridhar: 5@c is not a hopeless contract, needs defense to shift to @h before winning @d ace|pg||
nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there would be an overruff on the 3rd@s even if trumps were 2-2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT by East is the best spot|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  9 on top in 3NT|pg||
nt|wendle: Open room of Match 5C will remain open and official result announced.  Results will also be on official website as soon as they are confirmed: www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: one of the most exciting finishes to a CAmrose series, with 3 teams possible winners at this stage|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcarroll: So not all 11 counts are opened|pg||
mb|1H|nt|greerm: Wales can get 170 VPs by winning this match by 59 imps, whcih is quite achievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: then Engalnd, currentl behind to WBU, would need 19 VP to equal that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pessimist!|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|bg: on a good day 6 hearts would make but not here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played by N double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|bg: even double dummy in the trump suit looks short of entries to set up spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: when in six, the double dummy play allso seems to be your only shot at making it|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|greerm: and ROI, currently also behind to Scotland, would need 23 to go equal|pg||
nt|sharkey: In six have to solve @H - then probably @SAK then @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: but they'll end up in 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  even passed I hat overcall on such empty suit|pg||
nt|mamos:  hate|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm.... i think i prefer to show my ability to play in the other two suits with North|pg||
nt|lestergold: eg x|pg||
nt|mamos:  though stopped N bidding 1@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N istead of dbl|pg||
nt|mamos:  I think so too x for me|pg||
nt|santyclz: Showing your age Mike, considering that x shows 2 suits...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: S has 22 HCP and a 5 card M - a heavy 2 NT - unless conventional 22-23|pg||
nt|lestergold: south nopw could just about justify a reverese with such excellent shape and hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not agree with 3@d why not show more of her hand with 2@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: (That's what my pd's tell me anyway.)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kemperg: 4crd @H enough for dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: there are two suits|pg||
nt|mamos:  for me 1NT denies 4 cards @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: I aghree Mike!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south must agree because she has not bid her great hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: so do I|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: first six for the defence?|pg||
nt|mamos:  this might not be a success|pg||
nt|mamos:  seven?|pg||
nt|lestergold: silly contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|greerm: england 28 imps down, Ireland 10 imps down, if I was welsh I would be very nervous :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: ur right 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 8|pg||

qx|c4|st||md|2SA5HAQJ82DJ74CKT3,S974H765DAT8CJ872,SJ863H943DK63CQ94|sv|b|nt|kiwibridge: and the gap now 30|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  That did not go well :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: And EW dropped a trick|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sort of mystifying why W didn't cash the @C tricks before, think would have been down.|pg||
nt|dagold: Tempting to respond 1N to keep the opponents out (or find hearts)|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe---North too busy?  |pg||
nt|dagold: at favourable it is too tempting|pg||
nt|dagold: I confess i would respond|pg||
nt|Walddk7: scores with 1 match remaining: eng 151; ireland 147; wales 145; scotland 137; wbu 131; ni 97|pg||
nt|idc: We have an exciting finish to the Camrose in prospect|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Some auctions would have gone a level higher EW I think.|pg||
nt|garnetts: me too :)|pg||
nt|dagold: slam making here but won't be bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: NS will reach 3N..unless they decide to nail W now |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: interesting opening from west|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|garnetts: If that is 14-16 OK---not in my view if it is 12-14 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: tricky for south though|pg||
nt|garnetts: agreed|pg||
nt|idc: You can get other info from the event site at:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Connection problems here|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes I suppose its asking a lot to read the stiif ace|pg||
nt|dagold: slam surprisingly reasonable too with only 29 and 1-5 card suit. No waistage I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard high card vaues and a decent suit make 1@H look better |pg||
nt|garnetts: yes the 10@C offers a slight extra chance too |pg||
nt|01 smok: aaaaaa ja nie komentujê, bo jestem za s³aby gracz, ale wszelakie informacje z miejsca gry, nastrój itp. przeka¿ê|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks, Denis|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do we like 3@C?  |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Similar trump suit to the previous board|pg||
pc|h7|nt|garnetts: it also breaks 3-3 |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: dont really see he has a choice, I am not waiting for a heart lead vs 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Sadly there isn't a constant updating of the running scores during matches available|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psridhar: if S can finesse @d based on the Vul bidding by W......this will make overtricks|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Support double |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: anyway as they say NEXT |pg||
nt|idc: but we'll try to keep you up to date|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|idc: There's a website for this weekend at:  http://camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk/|pg||
nt|garnetts: This one makes though|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: any card will do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 11 facing 11 EW do not want to be getting much higher than this|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark:  3@D GF|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar: even a double finesse in @c will do|pg||
nt|01 smok: mecz æwieræfina³owy, promuje jednoczenie czerwcowe Mistrzostwa Europy i tym samym odbywa siê w Poznaniu :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|idc: results, CCs and more|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Lucky heart position - but he has nothing else to play for|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: only 11 tricks it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: I assume toys prohibit anything else |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @s ruff should beat this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South can swiitch to a @c while North still has the @dA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dagold: I would use puppet stayman on North if playing it|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|idc: N-S only have one quick loser, but that's not the same as having 12 tricks|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we all have a pramful vs NT thesedays|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: south very slow|pg||
nt|spil: not known for his vitesse certainly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dagold: you could be off the spade (or the club) suit|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: prawid³owe rozpoczêcie - od niskiego kontraktu...jak w wierszu Lokomotywa mam nadziejê bêdzie|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|idc: I'm not convinced the North hand is a 2@c opener; nice @h suit but that's about it|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well hard to see where the 12th come from|pg||
nt|idc: I should say, we don't get running scores on website, just updates at the end of each session|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: trouble is, last time I didnt open 2 clubs with the north hand it was passed out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  It comes - and then it goes|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  If it does not like what it sees....|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|idc: The Hamiltons play a standard american style system, 15-17 NT & 5 card majors|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: might have ducked that spade as it offers extra chances |pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark:  Michael Rosenberg tells me that if south has Ax, 109xx. KQJxxx x he could be triple squeezed|pg||
nt|01 smok: system pary Busse-Syrek, 1BA 14-16, naturalna baza SAYC, po otwarciu 1@c transfery|pg||

pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: goes on the blink whenever we drop a trick it seems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|spil: would like to switch to a @C but neither N nor S can|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  NS will not bid much at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: well caught partner|pg||
nt|idc: Result in for Bd 1 - not surprisingly the 6@s dbld here wasn't replicated, just 4@s and 13 IMPs to Scotland|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H making here|pg||

mb|3N|nt|psridhar: this will end the auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that 2 heart bid ... well north is between bids, a hand often seen|pg||
nt|garnetts: my thoughts entirely |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I like to raise partner - keeps them sweet|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: just making|pg||
nt|psridhar: all cards lying badly for declarer|pg||
nt|dagold: not saying double was clear by any means but it is his style|pg||
nt|idc: An example of the Welsh pair's system - 1NT in 3rd seat 15-17, 12-14 otherwise|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wilkinsona: this may be a good slam.... to stay out of|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, cruel if N-S bid it given the way the morning has started, so I'm rooting for them to stop in 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: With a spade & club to lose, declarer may well take two heart finesses and go down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: personally i dont think it is obvious for N to seek 4H. one alternative would be 1N-3N. a compromise would be to bid 4S if S shows spades, and bid 3N otherwise|pg||
nt|idc: A club lead from West may have helped South avoid a loser in that suit, so this @d instead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure...i think S can organize the play to put the defense in a bad spot|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, West may have problems finding a safe lead later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: exactly|pg||
nt|idc: say declarer wins in hand, @d to dummy & takes a @h finesse - tough for West|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normal play is to let the D ride around and then force out spade ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are several options both early and late but i think S should eventually prevail|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, if the club finesse wins later on, he'll be looking to set up a pitch for the 3rd club, so avoiding a loser there|pg||
nt|idc: He doesn't know that the @c finesse won't win of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2NT for the black suits here - would not be everyone's choice but reasonable and has N shown this @D holding? |pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h was going to make|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: we saw E open 2D on Bd 4 with much less, so it was easy guessing:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: everything wrong for NS |pg||
nt|dagold: 5 imps to england on board 3. Denning did overcall 2@c but didn't take the heart hook and went down in 4@c|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  at the moment the WBU are 28 up against England|pg||

nt|idc: 1 & 2 flat, 3 IMPs to N.I. on Bd 3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is dangerous but i like 3H better than 2H, esp if NS are playing support doubles. 3H puts the pressure on and increases chances of scoring a black queen (or two)) on defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Conservative 3@H   ---I know I will risk sounding boring--Kokish said many years ago when you have five card support for partner bid game |pg||
nt|dagold: England played the wrong partscore on 6 after intervention from Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought he would pass--but these days 1@C is often short --so TOD of 1H |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: but west needs to play low..|pg||
nt|henryb:  the defense would seem to have 2@h, 2 Aces, and either a @s or a second @d trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if NS lead 3/5, the 2D call -- which was sort of pointless in my view, as you know they can outbid you -- may give the show away in spades if E plays along discovery lines|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: and Ace needed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: yes heart switch is good enuf of course because declarer has too many cards to knowck out|pg||

pc|cT|nt|psridhar: couple of guesses involved in 4@s..|pg||
nt|psridhar: but favoourite to make -once the @h ace is seen with W, the opener shd hv @c ace, so 4@s rates to make|pg||

pc|sA|nt|psridhar: hence we hv to assess this 5@d as a good save by the leaders|pg||

pc|s3|nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||

nt|dburn: indeed - 3@s would likely have made had anyone bid it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: each of the last 3 boards could be a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: very long indeed and thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: spec suggest 4 spades was a slam try|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: last 3 bds here|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  A frozen moment in time|pg||
nt|garnetts: a weak two with two aces --a hanging offence |pg||
nt|chilloncan: and 2 of them to NI|pg||
mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: if so somewhat optomistic|pg||
nt|dagold: 3@s a make or 4@c|pg||
nt|dagold: some play 4@c as clubs and spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  It looks to me that East will make 3N although "Deep Finesse" would not think so|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  WBU are 31 up against England|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|idc: Murdoch got @c suit wrong on Bd 6, so -3 in 3NT instead of making, more IMPs to WBU|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a z cieñsza?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: well NS may sac in 5 clubs now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so Engalnd have about 9 boards in which to pick up neraly 60 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: very close -and interesting 4@h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we do thank Chen our great operator and the CTCBA for bring you this broadcast|pg||
nt|psridhar: a play or defense problem -classical|pg||
nt|dagold: good stop|pg||
nt|idc: Will be interesting to see if West accepts the later invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: as 4@s down on club lead|pg||
nt|dagold: can still be beaten|pg||
nt|dagold: needs to get two ruffs|pg||
nt|idc: only a minimum 15 but what a 15 count|pg||
nt|chilloncan: automatic to do so i think|pg||
mb|d!|nt|idc: undo|pg||
nt|dagold: one with a diamond entry|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: pre empt in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so theory is, one of the players forgot the system|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 2@c shows @d, and S leads a @d, then maybe they will beat 3N|pg||
nt|lestergold: sI cam  see hazards here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: Padman thanks for your great commentary|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I dont go along with norths bid Im afraid, with a double fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with you Tony--cramp them for space--get them at the five level |pg||
nt|dagold: one with a heart underlead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: looks like a maximum|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the Welsh are hoping for some nice flat 1NT contracts|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if declarer guesses trumps he can make with a throw in on N|pg||
nt|psridhar: Thanks Gary , you have been very educative too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure being with you and thanks all our great spectators for your feedback |pg||
nt|psridhar: first he shd ruff a club -as a matter of technique, here it is essential too|pg||
nt|psridhar: after @c ruff, run @h jack, @h to king, @s to king, run trumps for the throw in = is the double dummy line, can it work ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6 @h tricks + 2 @s tricks +1 @c =9 and the throw in for 10th =yes double dummy line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 @cs 2 @hs 2 @ds and 2@s doesnt add to 9|pg||
nt|idc: 5-card suit, good intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 4-0 trump break is only a mild irritation here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: amazing, wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: That was 5-card Stayman, so 2@h was continuing the search for a fit|pg||
nt|chilloncan: more likely route to NT partial would be 1N all pass|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, I might pass that East hand - at matchpoints for sure, at teams it is close|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to correct bridgemate entry AS IT STANDS: Wales 168; Ire 161; Eng 161; Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 104|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: so you expect -1 then :)|pg||
nt|lesniak: z cieñsza ciut gorzej bo podzial pikow 4-0 komplikuje sprawe|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: south has bid 2 suits, you have support, "raise"|pg||
nt|henryb:  Operator, could you see what 2@c meant?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yes @D,s|pg||
nt|idc: well, porobably would pass at teams|pg||
nt|idc: wouldn't i meant|pg||
nt|chilloncan: NV|pg||
nt|idc: I used to pass but these days I'm a paper tiger|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the thing is, you are so barren outside of hearts that even if you find a heart fit you probably do not have game|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|idc: yes, and points outside hearts are 2 Jacks, not brialliant|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: it went down other tbl...:)|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales let through 4@h on boar 10|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|psridhar: J.Chung has been spot-on thus far..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well the lead of the spade 10 may have givin away the position in a key suit....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: does anyone know where the scores can be seen?  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|chilloncan: you have 9 LTC and opener will have 6-7, hence IF you have a fit you still dont rate tpo have a game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  North will be in deep trouble, and declarer can guess the spades, Mike|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: the problem in runnning the @h jack is N made a TAKE-OUT double of 1@h|pg||
nt|dagold: link through the ebu website|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be an overtrick now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||
nt|spil: 3@H going 1 off and NS making 3@D exactly so not much in it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and you might be down at the 3 level, if you invite and W passes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lesniak: na wyjcie  dok³adnie 2 z 3 impasów jest 37.5% + 3 z 3 = 12.5%razem 50%|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: Shields/Denning had a good stop in 2@s on Bd 8, 6 more to Wales|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: I am pretty sure That South is Walker not Murdoch|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: you can see him from there?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry delay TD at table|pg||
nt|garnetts: I ahve good eyesight rarely get a finesse wrong |pg||
pc|s7|nt|psridhar: may still make lets see|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed esp board 92 of 96|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 3C bid not alerted by east - appeal?|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done Wales |pg||
nt|dagold: nice defence|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d3|pc|c5|nt|chilloncan: i wouldnt call it a "good stop" since both major games rate to make. they are almost surely worried they will LOSE imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psridhar: that @s queen shift has created a major tenace for Declarer|pg||
nt|psridhar: if he plays a @d for eg, N is helpless |pg||
nt|psridhar: what can he do winning the queen of @d?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont know much about deep finesse but it seems that Byrne must be a better card player|pg||
pc|s6|nt|idc: But as John pointed out, there may be IMPs to N.I. comming on Bds 9 & 10|pg||

nt|vugraphzza: WOW nice result!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: not the optimal discarding of NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: final board this session|pg||

nt|tomi2: east's try was awarded|pg||

nt|lestergold: he has|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|greerm: suddenly a not so flat baord|pg||
nt|greerm: presume this showing @D and @H|pg||
nt|greerm: North no real reason to move|pg||
nt|greerm: spec tells me this is going to be about the fat lady, hasn't yet sung :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: rightly so|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear the girls have gone overboard|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nd finest kind of sac.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think east may even double and cash 3 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: One that induces the opps to go overboard.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|greerm: 7@D on on an unlikely @D guess|pg||
nt|mcarroll: maybe not but I suspect I can hear her practising scales in the wings|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|tomi2: this is the last board to be compared, so France made it to the finals. well done, congratulations to them!|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzza: its over kill!|pg||
nt|greerm: england got 17 imps on this board, are now only 3 behind and the scores are not super reliable|pg||

pc|d8|nt|kemperg: forgot to tell 2nd of 4/5 small?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: don't know|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: they also only provided 1 convention card, wich was on the side of barendrecht|pg||
nt|kemperg: thats sloppy|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: barendregt*|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: convention card states 4th best|pg||

nt|spil: not too many swings about so far|pg||
nt|henryb:  South did not listen and lead a @d|pg||
nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|chilloncan: they will gain IMPs on 6, but not because they played a partial:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: tbf they are playing a strong club system so 1D 1S 2S is a weak way to raise 1S to 2S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  23 was costly for Wales as expected|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak - wyjasniali to sobie niedawno Jaszczak z Gierulskim na BBO|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A very light game could come home here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland also made the close game on 24|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i am SOOOOOO sorry Ian, i thought you said board SIX, my bad|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Daniel, a good point|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Wales need only 1 more IMP at the moment to move into 24-6 territory|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Deep Finesse, a double dummy analyst, would assume a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  huge fit each way|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4Nt any two suits?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep, common American style|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thanks, denis|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i mixed up your 6 & 8:(|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark:  One hurdle jumped - several to go :)|pg||
nt|spil: yes but perhaps unlikely to get there|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  treating as 3 suited|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @h ruff defeats 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: actually i often wonder why people so often do not lead their partner's suit especially whene a heart lead here was more or less guaranteed to give a trick|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark:   murdoch is resting|pg||
nt|garnetts: did they just put a ringer in--Walker is now back |pg||
nt|garnetts: Thanks a lot folks--I have to go shortly--been interesting    |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Walker avoids a give away double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wilkinsona: you were right David|pg||
nt|dagold: 3N has a problem due to the diamond blocakge. Declarer may need to run the T on the first round|pg||
nt|dagold: then he will have to guess the clubs|pg||
nt|dagold: could be interesting|pg||
nt|lesniak: doæ znana historia gdy trzeba 2 lub 3 udane impasy z 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: bye for now |pg||
nt|henryb:  why? couldn't partner have the @hQ instead of the @sK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: could do but my partners never do they alwayswin these post moprtems when i dont lead their suit|pg||
nt|idc: A strong club pair are limited to about 15 when they open 1@d, so can freely distinguish between 14/15 maximums and bad 11-13 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Declarer can still pick up the trumps, and I'm not sure leading @d would help the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  and rightly so|pg||
nt|chilloncan: confess that at these colours i would surely open 1S as E in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|idc: The hands are both pretty flat and don't mesh tpogether very well, so plenty of potential losers in 4@h|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well one of them has just vanished|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: East allowed to play 2 hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: if declarer plays the Q@d the suit is blocked if Espen takes the first one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|psridhar: that 3@h was unwarranted in my opinion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Liu made a take out X, his pd passed 2@s he had no reason to overrule that|pg||
nt|idc: on a bad day you could lose 3@d, a @c and a @s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E had tough lead. can make a case for eevery suit. perhaps when that is so, trump is best idea|pg||
nt|idc: now draw trumps and ... perhaps try to set up a @c for a @d pitch|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the idea is this: should i lead a trump or not? if i don't i have to decide which sidesuit to lead and i will only be right about once in three times. if it is right toi lead a ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: trump and i do so i am right all of those times|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: I must admit I would just bid 3NT on the South tickets |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Agreed - the 5-3 fit is not always best|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep. but 4 hearts ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: while the opps chalk up the imps...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  actually the ruff might not beat 6@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has to bid on when South does not X 5@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@c might make after all|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has doubled for a ruff as expected|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|spil: Natural lead but not slaying declarer, as they say :)|pg||
nt|dagold: not now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East has not read it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark:  I take it you would have competed, Alex?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|wilkinsona: yes, good play by South|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: Surprising stop - hard to judge in the bidding that it will make exactly 9 tricks and not go for 500.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psridhar: but it is only 5 imps to the Yeh cause, with a large deficit now|pg||
nt|henryb:  and they never say nice lead when you don't and you turn out to be right|pg||
