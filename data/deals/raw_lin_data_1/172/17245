mb|p|nt|dslee: that would be my style too P, 20 is too much for a simple overcall, in my opinion, souren would pass now|pg||

nt|psridhar: u mean forciing type? if so i refer 1@s|pg||
nt|psridhar: prefer|pg||
nt|babs59: this contract seems to rely on picking the HQ/A |pg||
nt|babs59: I was thinking maybe the 10-11 type of hand, rather than 6-9 -- so no, not forcing, invite type of hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: ok |pg||
nt|babs59: of course, it helps to see that South does have 10 points (soft as they are)|pg||
nt|nkgupt: think they play 2@h 5/8 and 2@s 9/11|pg||
nt|babs59: they fit rather well with North's as long as you are good at finding queens|pg||
nt|psridhar: has values in all 3 suits other than @d-3nt may be a playable spot|pg||
nt|psridhar: qjx in @c|pg||
nt|psridhar: is 3N better cont than 4@s here?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|psridhar: or 2@s is the best spot? :)|pg||

nt|babs59: tho he cashed the @DAK in case QJ were short (doubleton or singleton) that entry could have been beneficial if East had ducked clubs|pg||
