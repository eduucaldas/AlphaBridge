mb|p|nt|tomi2: transfers over transfers here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I dislike transfers over opps strong 1@C, it gives them extra room. a 2@H overcall would take away this room|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to Sofia |pg||

nt|baldfriede: They are on a good road for finding the slam.|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he had overvalled 2@H they would maybe bid 3@C and have only one of this information|pg||
mb|3S|nt|viren169: This will be 1-off as the cards lie poorly for declarer.|pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2: the downside of the 1@D overcall was, that they can plan on the @H finesse working now|pg||

nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has to decide iff @Cs are good |pg||

nt|lestergold: i would have got in the first round|pg||

nt|kemperg: @H10 is usefull|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|baldfriede: That is overboard, in my opinion; W saw the reluctance of E to bid, so he can hardly expect 3nt to work.|pg||
nt|lestergold: grossly overbid|pg||

nt|chilloncan: as expected, since if W had honor-jack in damonds doubleton, the hand is cold on the elimination despite 3 diamond losers|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to find a @D lead...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sad to be in last chair with W hand|pg||
nt|xenya: @H9 was probably suit preference |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes that A@c neeeds to be knocked out quickly|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the basic idea is that a supporting hand is better if it contains primary cards OUTSIDE the trump suit and secondary honors IN the trump suit, rather than vice versa|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo E hand was good for 2@S only.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: well, it is an invitation by LTC standards, but i would certainly agree with 2S initially before i would approve the final raise to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h looks makeable here as cards lie|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lestergold: problem is that south may well play east for a singlweton @h in a @h contract|pg||
nt|baldfriede: slam time here. but N/S have to pick the right one|pg||
nt|lestergold: or nourth whoever is declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: although it seems W showed more than a minimum as well, which was not an accurate description|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Made as good as she could|pg||
nt|viren169: Great pressure bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: bad distribution, I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 1@D nebuloues 1+card at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: so did he|pg||
nt|lestergold: both slams can make if the Q@h is picked |pg||
nt|lestergold: but I doubt if it will|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are 12 tricks available in either denomination with the A@d onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@D art FG|pg||
mb|2N|nt|viren169: Not the best bid in the world...  but 12 tricks available here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there is a lot less to be gained from this full-blooded pre-empt  once S has already shown her hearts. better to bid 3S and let partner judged whether or not to sacrifice. the one ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thing that 4S does achieve, though, is to  make it harder for NS to find their diamond fit if that is where they belong|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the hand has potential for a swing for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 1@D mean Silvia?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: on the actual hand S was always going to bid a slam, so the level of the preempt had no bearing on the outcome|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if W now bids 3S, E shd call 4S, not 3N|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: 1 @D looks like any 11 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Ok:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: being a coward, i also would have passed as S|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and I'm with E for his brave bid|pg||
nt|chilloncan: his hand is very primey, and there may be commu niocation issues in NT, and there is a club weakness|pg||
nt|rado: at 3@S E may cue since he denyed @S supp earlier|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: so it looks a club sytem, probably a lot like polish club|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: 1@D is 11-15p, 1+@D, no 5 cards @H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chilloncan: and it is likely that W has a club holding worth protecting, which is in fact the case. since E has a third heart, his tenace in that suit is not as vulnerable|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chilloncan: this contract will however also make|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thanks to spade 9 in dummy which prevents N from double-unblocking|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  his distribution allows it|pg||
nt|xenya: EW lead small from doubleton|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but he does have a good hand opposite pd's double|pg||
nt|chilloncan: oops|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W's hand could have been better|pg||
nt|chilloncan: avoidance play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks with !K@H favourable.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S continues clubs E has another stop, and if he switches there is time to knock out heart king even if S has it|pg||
nt|chilloncan: so either way 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if S pounds out clubs then club ten is ninth trick, no need to work on hearts|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4S also an easy make as cards lie|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S trying to decide who has club ten. on the auction it is surely Txxx with E|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: maybe he had a spade in with his club |pg||
nt|lestergold: well i got a prediction right|pg||
pc|h7|nt|baldfriede: Safe line for 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rado: singl @s might be surprise for S and he might try quick entry in @H|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h5|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||

nt|chilloncan: hearts and lots of club values. all that means E issued an invitation, when he had a 4H bid|pg||

nt|lestergold: 4 amjor is cold as both majors behave very nicely|pg||

mb|p|nt|rado: NS use  14-16 NT so 1@C normal|pg||

pc|d5|nt|po-s: very nicely played by West|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@D+1 or etc. from S. Why can't W wait? PASS!!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|chilloncan: unfortunate lead, will cost a red suit trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: but as W can get two ruffs, will turn out ok|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|chilloncan: whatever is gained in decelption by play of spade queen may be lost (perhaps with interest) in giving N an easy entry to hand without using up too many trumps|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|isp: 30-16 ? |pg||
nt|rodal f: N is unlimitted so W risk to become corporal in the army as minimum if N have cards. |pg||
nt|rodal f: Even up to a captain|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|isp: When I said one of those lucky slams board no.11 , Danailov bid and made it :)|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if 2@h promises kind of 5-6 points with 5-card-suit, W definitely underbid, imo|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  sorry, not that meaning - I d said, they have not so much points to bid game :)|pg||
nt|isp: Stamatov - Mihov  4th in the pairs world pairs Championship !|pg||

mb|4H|nt|chilloncan: obviously S thought this sequence had some special meaning|pg||
nt|viren169: even easier pass over the dbl!|pg||
nt|isp: 3 segmenta  x  20 igri|pg||
nt|xenya: and some very good bridge, i'm certain|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT forces 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|isp: Danailov bronze medal in the last Bermuda Bowl event|pg||
nt|xenya: this might make|pg||
nt|isp: not if A@c + @c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no doubt, they are top players (otherwise, they wouldn't play here)|pg||
nt|isp: 2@h 1@d + 1@c|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but now @d start looks like clear|pg||
nt|xenya: a bit lucky perhaps but not unreasonable in view of W's opening|pg||
nt|xenya: however if Ew play clubs ealy, they'll beat it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see - the board could be fruitful for NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: wrongsided?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh no, S bid NT 1st|pg||
mb|p|nt|isp: now making|pg||
nt|xenya: solving all declarer's problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: even easier pass over 5H. wht on earth is E thinking? |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  N did well when inserted @c K, not the Q|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible for E to duck it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chilloncan: W would be plenty happy to learn about E having a defensive trick during the play of the hand. no need to annoyunce it in the bidding. gives away IMPs for no reason|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|isp: if no changes  next at 13.00   last at 16.00 hrs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

mc|9|nt|rnmalik: To my information these trials are taking place to select a team for Bermuda Bowl and another pair.|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S had to hope for AQ doubleton or stiff trump queen in W hand. the only alternative is to play E for QT doubleton of hearts by leading small heart from dummy, but that has 3 flaws: ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan:  1) it is one chance versus 2    2)  E can get a promotion    3) it requires an error (though a likely one)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all and by for now.|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: ty all, bye|pg||
