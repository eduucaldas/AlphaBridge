nt|garnetts: Good afternoon everyone |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all and welcome.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 to start out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry having trouble finding the right boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Sorry about that, have the right boards now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT expected|pg||
mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry have lost the bidding though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its OK final contract 2@S |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|h5|nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
nt|garnetts: when a spade is led it will pay south to duck |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 2@D showed 5@S and 4@H according to the system|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  North must have opened surely|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wendle: Subject to Bridgemate entry being correct, half time scores: Wales 168; England 161; Ireland 161; Scotland; WBU; NI 104|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Hamilton rather than Hamiltin|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry not correct bidding slow to start but correct contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  thanks Dan - we guessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: East not showing his cards so missed the play|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: mast play 2NT as 4 card support...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: well, I certainly dont like the double|pg||
nt|idc: It'll mean your commentators will be impartial - since we don't know which direction the countries are sitting!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona: that can only help declarer..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: and this lead also...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no great cost to either side just no gain here|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, a big decision for poor South to have to take this early in the morning|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|idc: I can barely put my slippers on the right way round, leading to a doubled slam way beyond me|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and that it shipped it seems|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: This is an easy make now after south's giveaway|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wilkinsona: since i dont know the names, i can criticize the players freely for once..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess Scotland are E-W, took me ages to work that out|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: East still has a choice but knows the club ace is with south..|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  NI obviously have other ideas|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|psridhar: to recover 30 one needs about 5 swingy bds - assuming u judge 4 right and err on one....|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  England came into the match 6 ahead of Wales|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Engalnd need to win by at least 29 to do that|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Roland hi specs|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i think the play could get tricky in 4S if N starts off with two rounds of clubs, but W can always prevail if he reads the layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: we saw E open 2D on Bd 4 with much less, so it was easy guessing:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: They went off in 4@C on baord 3 for a swing to england--but it looks laydown to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: everything wrong for NS |pg||
nt|dagold: 5 imps to england on board 3. Denning did overcall 2@c but didn't take the heart hook and went down in 4@c|pg||
nt|idc: hhmm, yes, SOuth having the @s9 creates some worries|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the score shows board 3 as flat but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we think they were -1 in this room..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1 in closed room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the moment the WBU are 28 up against England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so England will need to pick up 57 to score 29|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is assuming my maths and VP conversion is correct|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is Precision style|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  pass = 0-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: hand plays well for EW though|pg||
nt|idc: As the other room play the boards we have already seen, the socres will come in|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: slam almost there the opening put it off their thoughts|pg||

nt|garnetts: Normal lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a quick two off  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quick?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think X = @c + @h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psridhar: without that opening EW may well have overshot to slam and gone down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my thoughts also|pg||
nt|psridhar: With E undervaluing his @s queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Julian, it seems that it is the player names that are wrong - the right names for Irelad/WBU are in the Open room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Operator probably has not had time to set up here|pg||
nt|idc: 1 & 2 flat, 3 IMPs to N.I. on Bd 3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is dangerous but i like 3H better than 2H, esp if NS are playing support doubles. 3H puts the pressure on and increases chances of scoring a black queen (or two)) on defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Denise, so further 10 or so to Scotland|pg||
nt|garnetts: assuming that £@C is to play here--would you bid it David?|pg||

nt|chilloncan: now with a clear run, NS likely on way to cold slam. E would perhaops been better off passing if he was not going to bid 3H|pg||
nt|idc: Here, the 2@h overcall has left N-S a lot of room (and convenient cue bids) to investigate|pg||

pc|s6|nt|yorkbeach:  the @s2 might have encouraged North to underlead|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Conservative 3@H   ---I know I will risk sounding boring--Kokish said many years ago when you have five card support for partner bid game |pg||
nt|dagold: England played the wrong partscore on 6 after intervention from Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought he would pass--but these days 1@C is often short --so TOD of 1H |pg||

nt|lestergold: on second thoughts you may be rIGHT|pg||

pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: his hand surely a max for not finding a neg double|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but west needs to play low..|pg||
nt|henryb:  the defense would seem to have 2@h, 2 Aces, and either a @s or a second @d trick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: if NS lead 3/5, the 2D call -- which was sort of pointless in my view, as you know they can outbid you -- may give the show away in spades if E plays along discovery lines|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: so well judged by WBU|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho may go off evenc without heart lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  and very possible if played by West, as N really cant hope to get his club suit going|pg||
nt|idc: the @c5 may be revealing - lowest so if not singleton, South has length|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kiwibridge: the @C won 6 imps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chilloncan: has 3 to be precise|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: South might have gone to 4@h himself over 2@h but 3@h was fine|pg||
nt|idc: It's a 3 1/2 @h bid really, but so few bidding boxes have that card in them :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Ace needed|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes heart switch is good enuf of course because declarer has too many cards to knowck out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cuttysark:  Scotland had lots of luck on board 21 - they made 3@D in one room and 3@S in the other: both contracts can be beaten|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chilloncan: S wont have five on this auction or defense|pg||

nt|tomi2: I think south might have bid a (non forcing) 2@C bid expecting opps to compeate in hearts and then come agaiin with some spade bid|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner only promised 4 spades. So south could not really correct. Perhaps North should bid 2@c, then bid and rebid spades|pg||
nt|tomi2: even as 2@C is non forcing, it will very seldom get passed out|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  So North would have to bid 3@c to force?|pg||
nt|henryb:  or would 1@s show clubs and forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2: I guess 1@S would just show some points with no good other bid and no 4 spades|pg||

pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: well, I had though the auction over|pg||

pc|h6|nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||

nt|dagold: pass of 2@s showed a bad hand already|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and maybe not enough|pg||

nt|psridhar: Thanks Gary , you have been very educative too :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a great pleasure being with you and thanks all our great spectators for your feedback |pg||
nt|psridhar: first he shd ruff a club -as a matter of technique, here it is essential too|pg||
nt|psridhar: after @c ruff, run @h jack, @h to king, @s to king, run trumps for the throw in = is the double dummy line, can it work ?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 6 @h tricks + 2 @s tricks +1 @c =9 and the throw in for 10th =yes double dummy line works|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 @cs 2 @hs 2 @ds and 2@s doesnt add to 9|pg||
nt|idc: 5-card suit, good intermediates|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 4-0 trump break is only a mild irritation here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: amazing, wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: That was 5-card Stayman, so 2@h was continuing the search for a fit|pg||

nt|chilloncan: the thing is, you are so barren outside of hearts that even if you find a heart fit you probably do not have game|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  should be an overtrick now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||

nt|tomi2: I think not - but had enough misunderstandings in such situations|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bernix: 5@c is the practical bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: since 4@h followed by 2@D shows a good hand 4nt for me is "I have a good fitting hand for this auction that might belong in slam" or simplier... RCKB|pg||
nt|bernix: i agree with you|pg||
nt|tomi2: some singleton or doubleton AK or Q in trumps, ace of dias and a good club suit that might be established for some side tricks|pg||

mb|d!|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||

nt|idc: now draw trumps and ... perhaps try to set up a @c for a @d pitch|pg||
