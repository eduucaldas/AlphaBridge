nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
mb|1S!|an|!Cs|nt|tomi2: transfers over transfers here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I dislike transfers over opps strong 1@C, it gives them extra room. a 2@H overcall would take away this room|pg||

nt|xenya: just 2 of us here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back to Sofia |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|tomi2: Aronov was now able to shhow his clubs and a heart stopper while his partner showed his spades before 3@C|pg||
nt|baldfriede: They are on a good road for finding the slam.|pg||
nt|tomi2: if he had overvalled 2@H they would maybe bid 3@C and have only one of this information|pg||
mb|3D|nt|viren169: This will be 1-off as the cards lie poorly for declarer.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sfoxa:  Hello Silvia and kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: the downside of the 1@D overcall was, that they can plan on the @H finesse working now|pg||

nt|lestergold: Hi Friederike|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hopefully we will have the players' names soon|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has to decide iff @Cs are good |pg||
nt|xenya: slam is not easy to bid -- from S's perspective, N has to have at least @CKQxxxx for slam to be good|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would have got in the first round|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldfriede: I would have expected 1nt too, but West might think it may be more fruitful to play against 1nt with his hand.|pg||

mb|2N|nt|xenya: can he be sure of that -- yes he can|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Marshall:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: @H10 is usefull|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|baldfriede: That is overboard, in my opinion; W saw the reluctance of E to bid, so he can hardly expect 3nt to work.|pg||
nt|lestergold: grossly overbid|pg||
nt|baldfriede: The lead is helpful though.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Not the best bid in the world...  but 12 tricks available here|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there is a lot less to be gained from this full-blooded pre-empt  once S has already shown her hearts. better to bid 3S and let partner judged whether or not to sacrifice. the one ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: thing that 4S does achieve, though, is to  make it harder for NS to find their diamond fit if that is where they belong|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the hand has potential for a swing for sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: 1@D mean Silvia?|pg||
