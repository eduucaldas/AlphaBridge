mb|1D|nt|athene: but south really doesn't have the defence that a strong two generally promises|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|athene: of course it was part of the original multi to include a strong-two in either minor, but not many play that these days|pg||

mb|p!|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|casenjo:  this contract will make with friendly diamonds if east goes for it|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|an| |mb|p|nt|athene: this auction is all a bit murky now|pg||

mb|4C|nt|athene: not at all clear what 3@H should be on the auction|pg||
nt|athene: when south has shown some single-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h alerted by North only|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, north thinks 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: 3nt was cold of course but you do have to double hook the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this is a bit unwise perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H really was pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: that means north was prepared to play in 4@C, if her partner in fact had clubs|pg||
