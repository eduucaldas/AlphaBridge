nt|henryb:  I would not choose 3@s with those 16 points|pg||

nt|peachy: their openings start at (10)11+ so in that context|pg||
nt|peachy: and their 2S opening 8-11|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think with the nice source of trick in @s, 3NT was an option for west|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: miserable...... cold and grey... |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Ish is in the tank....|pg||
nt|henryb:  even so, Qx/Qx/Kxx on a hand where partner probably has two or fewer spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW playing Modern Acol with Weak NT throughout|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Modern Acol is a bit of an oxymoron :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just as "a bit" relates to "jumbo shrimp"|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: right |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Historically Victoria, SA and Canberra all had an Acol bias; NSW was always a Standard stronghold|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=(11)12-14   is Robinson contemplating a slam invite?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||

mb|1S!|an|no major|mb|d|nt|henryb:  so does 5@c by E-W|pg||
nt|mrdct: that's the best way in my view|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: well i KNOW he didn't PASS|pg||
nt|jbgood: Ish came close to winning the Vanderbilt - he will not lose another..|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@c is cold so we have a rare red v green sac in 5@s here|pg||
nt|henryb:  and in fact 5@s is cold|pg||
nt|henryb:  from the N seat|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course - by north you dont have 2 @h losers|pg||
nt|mrdct: a pushy 3NT for NS here|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: not what klinger was hoping to hear|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he will probably pass 3@c out|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: thanks Andrew|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: sorry, I fell asleep waiting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- still no scores posted on the web site|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT a chance here if west gets to play it on a @d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@S=no major|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  and a ruff|pg||
nt|henryb:  from S you can only make 3@s|pg||
nt|mrdct: now 6@c is the winning action!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: North tanked before bidding... so Ish had no hesitation before doubling|pg||
nt|mrdct: good board|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2@h might not be everyone's taste|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but at favourable vul 1st seat is the best time to be agressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 3-7 weak in a major it says|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS upside down count & attitude|pg||
nt|mrdct: @d109 coming down is convenient|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: comparisons to come after board 5|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: I'll teach them thinks Ish|pg||
nt|henryb:  no more 7@d, and now no more doubling 5@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Should W pull with zero defense and so many clubs?|pg||
nt|henryb:  dummy will be a disappointment to Ish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW upside-down count & attitude|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: the doubleton @H10 might save the day for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Ew use transfers in several sequences|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@s means no Major|pg||
nt|jbgood: dont think he plays for that|pg||
nt|jbgood: the di pos|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||

nt|henryb:  why? for all he knows Ish has the @hK instead of the Q|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: I think he did bid it all in one swoop, but does he have the right even to pull. Questionable|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: friendly @C layout -- if declarer can take advantage|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|mrdct: everything is working now - predict this will make|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ah better thx Michael|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 @s |pg||
nt|mrdct: a would've thought so :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 16 so no comparisons/score changes for a while|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fact 6@s if you get trumps right|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 7@s actually|pg||
nt|mrdct: a 7 or 5 hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 2N Ogust  and 3@D good suit, bad hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a guess -- CC doesn't specify|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think they probably play someting more sophisticated than ogust|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H-4@H would be very interesting development|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@d could be something like non-minimum with a shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: nice 4@h opening|pg||
nt|jbgood: Ish is getting conservative!|pg||
nt|peachy: a practical 4H bid, not necessariy everyone's choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and 3@h by south would be asking where the shortage is|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: if anyone knows meaning of 4@D -- SPEAK UP|pg||
nt|mrdct: no idea here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: stole the pot with it|pg||
nt|peachy: normally it is a "transfer to 4S for the opponents" :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: some would open that 1@h, but in 3rd seat it's certainly right to open at the 4 level|pg||
nt|peachy: sorry, thought Ish opened 1S, get me some focus here plsssssss|pg||
nt|mrdct: max likes his shape|pg||
nt|mrdct: but perhaps should be a bit wary of the likely bad trump break after the dbl|pg||
nt|henryb:  He did but then the operator retracted it|pg||
nt|peachy: oh well, explanation was tight in any case...|pg||
nt|peachy: *right|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugrapha3: 4@D asks for cue bid|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: I think 4@H is an underbid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK lead   as directed by the 1@S opening|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: was 2@H forcing??|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no-one asked ...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kiwibridge: currently Hans is well clear, the others in a close race for 2nd|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i'm wondering if specifically looking for @H cue   where 4@C looking for either red suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 4@D did not show anythign... bu 5@D showed cue in @D|pg||
nt|mrdct: is there any reason for declarer to get trumps right here?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Helena|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mrdct: i must say this structure does't look very efficient|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @C/@D lead it's almost a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 5@D is just a cue -- my guess about meaning of 3@D must be wrong|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 6H=offer to play|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mrdct: but let's see if pete's queen sniffing skill are in tune today|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: they've certainly reached the right spot - flat board|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugrapha3: sorry... there was a double of 5@D (lead directing)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems likely   @DA  @H  @SA @SK  down 1|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah - well that can only help declarer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i've never heard of it being this strong -- surprised Sartaj took the risk|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice play!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugrapha3: is it?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes its ok on the hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: but what if hearts were not 3-3|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: perhaps not enough entries to set them up now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries - Ebery was going to lead a minor either way|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it's big - I guess South expected less too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still chance for extra in @D  but also:  protects @C   possible extra in @H if RHO failed to play hi with doubleton @H honor|pg||

nt|henryb:  unlucky that the @hK is offside|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: need to get @h right and ruff some of them|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd seat lead director|pg||
nt|mrdct: entries are scarce|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lets see just needs @H right|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only made 3 in OR........|pg||
nt|peachy: true, so they have left some tricks on the table, I just am so at awe at the level of the EW game|pg||
nt|mrdct: same idea in both rooms - just a slightly different conventioh to do it|pg||
nt|pelepele: no thanks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: i thought EW played 12-14 NT throughout  -- wonder why 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Hugh will surely give it the best effort in the odds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugrapha3: North is limited by his failure to open a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and EW didn't find @C because of East failure to open 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: probably not 4-4... (the interogation continues)|pg||
nt|mrdct: @dK lead would be a good start for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after 4 of 6 matches  Hans had lead of more than 30 VP over 2nd place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 2 teams from Double Round Robin advance to SemiFinal|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no fair peeking Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I didn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C3 encouraging in @C -- but no reason to rush  [even though seems automatic to shift to @C10 ]|pg||
nt|mrdct: going well so far|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes @S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ianmcc: no easy defence here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bottom 2 play top 2 from Division 2    with 3rd place choosing opponent|pg||
nt|mrdct: do the top 2 teams from div 1 get a day off or do they play for seating rights?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hT|pc|c9|pc|sT|nt|mrdct: i think he needed a smothering ruffing finese against north's @h9|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: loser i mean|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 1 anyway hard earned imp|pg||
nt|mrdct: henbest got 10 imps of revernge on 18 making 4@h in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: defence was spot-on vs 3NT in the open room|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: pull|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N (14)15-17|pg||
nt|mrdct: on brd 14 i mean|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: holding 3@H east rejected attempt at forcing game, so hoped maybe to score @C & ruff|pg||
nt|mrdct: like it|pg||
nt|mrdct: but EW might make 4@s here so Hans could still win the board|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: now, certainly|pg||
nt|peachy: The book lead against Gamblin is an ace, which is not going to be as successful|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = transfer to 4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might bounce the auction a level or 3 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = TWERB   i don't know that convention by name  guessing something like what we call suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL = @C & @H or @D & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: me too|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d is only one off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 2@D  :(|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|peachy: First seat favorable, let them deal with it! Good practice|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: a flacid 4@c opening in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm skeptical about the Open Room auction|pg||
nt|mrdct: it might be a good move for EW to defend a partscore here rather than push the opps into 4@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ew or NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C did NOT set up game force|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Al it's been a long day, thanks Michael on vugraph, thx audience|pg||
nt|ianmcc: pickup|pg||
nt|mrdct: personally i don't like a gambling 3NT with an outside K|pg||
nt|mrdct: sry NS to defend|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-4@S-all pass  just doesn't seem plausible|pg||
nt|mrdct: why - 6-4 bid more and all that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 9 hours for me but back tomorrow for another lot|pg||
nt|mrdct: but worked out OK here|pg||
nt|ritong: not mentioning the eighth card|pg||
nt|mrdct: that too|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: only worked out cause he pulled|pg||
nt|ianmcc: why not 4S?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: but the rebid does|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish choosing to go for a safe 300, 500 or (hopefully) 800 here rather than risk -100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome Ian!|pg||
nt|mrdct: now west is running out of bids|pg||
nt|mrdct: or double cards at least|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ianmcc: hi how do I get pretty pips on to keyboards?|pg||
nt|mrdct: ! in front of c d h & s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exclamation mark  "!"  then letter of suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: tx nobody tells me anything|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as many suggest  Hollands really is "walking the dog" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: does that make me "nobody"?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: does east have enough to raise here? partner has shown the world bidding this way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told the entire scoring system is down today -- not just the site with accumulated results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so even scoring done by hand  [no bridgemate  aaaarrrrggghhhh]|pg||
nt|mrdct: pathetic|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugrapha3: this looks like a big pickup for klinger|pg||
nt|mrdct: @s10 a suit preference card for @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: but i do like maing it gambling in any suit to increase frequency|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: NS convention card says opening bids are agressive 1st seat favorable -- but this must be close to a stretch for 1@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: tony could beat it by leading a diamond i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: fair shot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he comes under pressure on the run of clubs though|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: should make i think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: Indeed, it can backfire to have more than promised. But all card says is "gambling 1St and 2ND; 3rd and 4th to play"|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: with majors aswell????|pg||
nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|peachy: He might cash H first, thought it might backfire if N is void|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: last one now|pg||
nt|mrdct: one of the most important and high profile events on the austrlian calendar and they are scoring by hand!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the patient died|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even 6@H is good save against 4@S|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: no....  I'm sure they've been using bridgemate|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: favorable means  we not vul   they vul    [only they vul]|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugrapha3: maybe a heart switch gives the defense a chance?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: declarer should still be ok if he knocks out @sA|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'd run with what partner has signal for unless there is a dramatic reaosn not to|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck this, float @C10   that might get to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: A wise kib said, with trumps blocked it cant cost|pg||
nt|mrdct: that way if it's wrong it's partner's fault!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i'm not saying that is how the play SHOULD go -- just trying to find a way to large number of tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think EW just need to follow suit to beat this|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well, guesing the @S position is a chance|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|peachy: some one once said as advice, to always make such decisions at the table that you will win post mortem (should there be one)|pg||

nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: now that s apretty gutsy overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they call it "game force relay"|pg||
nt|mrdct: this might talk EW into playing 4@s rather than 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2N= game force raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Hengest will pay for  it by keeping EW out of non-making 3N|pg||
nt|mrdct: but 4@s is in trouble also with the 4-2 break|pg||
nt|ritong: non making, non making...would you double 3NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but ehy might try  non-making Mosyian 4@S|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 5@d likewise|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW are in a GF auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 2@D game force -- i wonder why Gold bid 3@H letting NS off the hook|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what's the rush with 4333 and no @H stop?|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he wanted to show no4@s and dubious @h holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as bonus also let NS off the hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2S = 8-11 and 6+ S|pg||
nt|mrdct: chance to hold this to 8 tricks with a @c ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some cue raise|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c is @ds, so 3@d is a cue|pg||
nt|ritong: suggesting game in @ss|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 500 looks cheap - 3NT a cakewalk|pg||
nt|ianmcc: what was 3C?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 3c=@D|pg||
nt|mrdct: which woul dmake 3@d a cue raise|pg||

pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: vindictive card gods --- west invites slam -- game goes down|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: the other choice was to show short @C -- which shows disdain for 'splinter' with singleton King also|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: ok... wait 2 min|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think the ladies event is finished now so i guess we will have both matches from the open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helena -- if you can get score updates    we'll try to get ABF to cover your bar tab|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: going to check ladies now.... wait 1min|pg||
nt|ianmcc: women|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you tell her Ian :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's actually ladies as this is the qualifier for the APBF where the event is still called the ladies teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: quaint|pg||
nt|mrdct: reality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd is critical since they advance to SemiFinals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd is better than 4th in that they get to choose opponent from top 2 in Division 2|pg||
nt|mrdct: and i guess 1st gets their pick of semi-final opponent also|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ok so Wilkinson: 174|pg||
nt|mrdct: unless 1st/2nd play-off tomorrow to get choice|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Bilski 160|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Djurovic 142|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Hoffman 139|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: with Clark/Brockman not finished yet|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Clark 138/ B 117|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so 4th was that close!|pg||
nt|mrdct: so quite a tight finish in the ladies for that 4th spot|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so appears CLark will overtake Durovic.... but only guestimate|pg||
nt|mrdct: huh - is 138 - 117 and imp score?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so women's scores have one match to come?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or was that the score before the last match?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Clark/Brock are not finished final match|pg||
nt|mrdct: the ladies has finished|pg||
nt|mrdct: ah - so it looks like clark should get through and hoffman will miss out|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: other 4 teams are finnished|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know Women don't have "repechage" tomorrow -- they go straight into KO|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: thats what i think...|pg||
nt|mrdct: correct the - bottom two teams go home|pg||
nt|ianmcc: ladies don't have bottoms you mean rearmost|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never was sure about Division 2 format -- so don't know if they have more to play tonight|pg||
nt|mrdct: so helena were those ladies scores you gave before for the other 4 teams inclusive of the result from the last match?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: yes for other 4 teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: they wish|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think division 2 has finished also - so do you know who qualified there helena?|pg||
