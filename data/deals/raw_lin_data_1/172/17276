mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|andy_h: It's been a very tight match so let's hope it stays this way|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: a typical " intrafinesse" trump position|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W play a standard system with a strong NT and a 4 card major context, where N/S plays 2/1 GF with a 9-12 mini NT in 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea is to play up to the 9|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: with the hope to catch 10x onside, with an honor or not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: then play the jack second round to pin the whole stuff|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: however, burgess has other preoccupations|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: one being establishing his fourth @s to pitch a @d|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ianmcc: now @s then @d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: hoping @ds are " frozen" for the defense|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|1+|nt|babs59: 2 IMPs in it, I'd estimate|pg||
nt|pelu: Alida is Clark?|pg||
nt|newart: she is a very agressive player - Ed barnes calls her the Smiling Assassin|pg||
nt|babs59: 8 boards to go|pg||
nt|newart: Alida is Clark yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||

mb|p|nt|newart: Candice played for several years with Elizabeth havas who is at other table in Bilski team|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: Candice's last partner was Elizabeth Havas who is sitting East for the opposition|pg||

mb|p|nt|newart: ungeard of|pg||

nt|ianmcc: can they get a second @h trick?|pg||

nt|noodle:  easy push to start|pg||
mb|1C|an|1+|nt|ahollan1: still 1+|pg||
mb|d|nt|andy_h: South is Peter Gill, a frequent vugraph commentator on BBO that you may have seen from time to time|pg||
nt|noodle:  do they promise 5@d for 1@d opening ?|pg||
mb|r|an|!D|nt|babs59: CR playing bd 17 in 2S NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  here they play transfers so redouble shows @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S gets my vote|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: sooo close|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have to pass with a classic 10+ redouble hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  dyke can still raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north had bid less -- it would be a Support DBL situation for most  [yes, even in @D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the 3@S bid is defined differently that last millenium|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it was a weak hand with lots of @S, now it is more like 2@S strength with extra length|pg||
mb|4C|nt|babs59: I think that should put Clark in the lead|pg||
nt|newart: Barbara - i beat u again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: I believe both N/S and E/W play transfer responses to 1@C, so 1@D here shows 4+@H's|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3@D was alerted, but i'm not sure what it means. likewise with 4@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so we have a new leader :)!!!!!|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, I was out of the room, so missed your comment :(|pg||
nt|noodle:  well vulnerable it can not be completely preemptive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: this is a thin game - needs lots right - and they are going to bid it here|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: if thy make - but hard to see it going down|pg||
nt|babs59: imagine the tension at the tables|pg||
nt|pelu: best to lead @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: Both sides play a 2/1 GF system, but E/W however have recently added a mini NT (9-12) in their arsenal when 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s seems like a make  will W sacrifice ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ9 probably worth nothing on defense   !KH probably a trick in either contract|pg||
nt|noodle:  y but E rebid at 4 level  W might be afraid 4@S is going down|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|andy_h: I'm not certain as to the meaning of 3@D, but I have seen this bid used as some form of a 4 card raise|pg||
nt|ianmcc: neither wants to play it|pg||
nt|noodle:  he goes for it|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: Sue and therese must know they are down a lot at this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: salvaging 3 imps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|andy_h: And if that's the case, then 4@D is a retransfer, letting the stronger hand play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to set up 2nd @H trick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|pelu: lead @D out of hand - now defense can kill all @D-ruffs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|pelu: @s now can defeat 4@S - carelss played by N|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||

nt|andy_h: example is a multi 2@D showing a weak hand with either major. One benefit of allowing the strong hand to play is that leads will be coming towards the tenaces, on the otherhand by ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: letting the 2@D opener play the hand, it conceals the hand with more distirbution|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu: looks like a total collaps for NS here|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: he bids the 5-suit rather than off-shape Double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|super nova: Tony Nunn Opened 6D in the Open in First seat and was rewarded. with his partner passing.|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one adjunct of Garbage Stayman  allows   1N-2@C//2@D-2@H//2@S[3@S & 2@H]-3@C|pg||
nt|noodle:  crawling stayman 2@h weak with both majors or @h@c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: "crawling" is too wimpy   i like "garbage" moniker|pg||
nt|noodle:  we have more bugs here Al|pg||
pc|d4|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I think, Jamie, that the room crashed and that was just catch up result|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
nt|babs59: I think any partner would bid 7D if you opened 6D on South!!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|babs59: bd 18  3NT is about to make for more IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: it's not just a bucketload of IMPs - more like 2 buckets|pg||
nt|pelu: but 6@D is a very fair slam - need @Ds 3-2 or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W have discussed a lot in terms of competitive bidding and evidently this is one of them. If 4@C was some sort of fit-show I wonder if they play 4@D as any max hand raise or if ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: they play that as "choice of games"|pg||
nt|noodle:  a good hand for 'non forcing' Stayman  1N 2@c P  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in other room is impressive result|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pelu: on a @s Lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: wow and a nice switch by Dyke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: brill switch - if he rises it's curtains|pg||
nt|andy_h: If Edgtton rises with the Ace this contract will be off due to a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andy_h: Alternatively Edgtton can duck this (which is the winning play here) but that switch by Dyke was a pretty quick one|pg||
nt|andy_h: Unfortunately for Edgtton, he gave a bit too much information in the bidding which allowed Dyke to find this brilliant switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes the @h cue was informative|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dyke "knows" that partner has a doubleton heart (giving Edgtton 4 hearts and not 5) because Gill would most likely have led a heart if it was a singleton|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d7|nt|newart: in CR they are in 3NT on last baord and will make so more to Clak|pg||

nt|ahollan1: always nice to underplay when you've underbid   takes away some of the sting|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  Methods that employ a Kaplan-style inversion of 1S and 1NT so that 1S is a forcing NT type with up to 4S and a 1NT response shows 5+S can avoid this particular issue by establishing whether a fit actually exists at the 2-level,|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: When I made her play last sets, she ALWAYS played well.  I think the pressure makes her play better!|pg||

nt|newart: thats twice where Alida has taken a conservative action then bid game after ops bid again|pg||

nt|ianmcc: I thought South's @h7 could hold out sqz|pg||
mb|p|nt|gruffydd:  ... before the decision to invite is made.  But this might require using a Flannery opening depending on the rest of the system.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT is an impressive score from Burgess-Courtney|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ianmcc: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||

mb|3H|nt|vugrapha1: i think 1S showed a strong NT with 3@S...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: the 1@C is a short club. Edgtton didn't open 1NT because they play 9-12 mini NT in 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i suspect other room auction was the same, but operator lost track when correcting the score for Board 4 :(|pg||

nt|mwigor: although Majors score more i think if i was going to introduce a suit with that hand i'd prefer to introduce the clubs|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I think that if you're willing to play partner for AKxxxx for their 2S (does it show 8-11?) opening then 6C is actually a good punt|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  2S does show 8-11|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nabil Edgtton didn't bid with South hand after same opening in other room|pg||

mb|5S|nt|ianmcc: @d2?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ianmcc: the dreaded balanced 11 count vul|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: sorry, E omitted to pitch a @D, that was me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he blank the @DK?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=1+|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: he probably didn't, i lost some of the discards, sorry.|pg||
mb|1H|an|!S|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@H is max for EW -and 2½§C for NS - but very normal that both sides overbid a little|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  On this board at the other table Nabil misclaimed having incorrectly thought clubs had been set up in his hand, which the commentators thought cost him the contract, but it's not clear to me.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i guess Ish had 2 ways to show 3@S  --  or maybe RDBL is not Support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 10 correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with 4@S East would rebid 2@S, not 1@S|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think xx is something else|pg||
nt|mwigor: 1@s shows 3|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mwigor: xx is probably old fashioned penalty style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes sense Michael|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: spects: 3nt makes on @Hlead|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: need some good guesses here |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they won't be allowed to play the last two boards, as they've run out of time. |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: awful lead problem|pg||
nt|frankaus: cortney gets off to the best lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: who do we back? def  or declarer?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: declarer :)|pg||
nt|chick: whoever makes the most brilliant plays :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'm backing defence |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|gruffydd:  Not sure I agree with that regulation in a final :/|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont like it at any stage ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: the best hope I can see is a heart club squeeze on S|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|timb: When the 2=4 @S comes to light, Ish may reason that Courtney has @HJ, @DQ & @CQ_J|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|mwigor: although in practice it is necessary in tournaments with lots of tables|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry* they are completing the set.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it sets very good precedence|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|s5|nt|pelu: play low in trick 1 on @H-lead = making|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  How long do they have for each 16 here??|pg||
nt|ritong: something sad happened next room on that board|pg||
nt|mwigor: and i dont understand why the final isnt being played as two 48 board days on the same timetable as bermuda bowl will be|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mwigor: the abf should be allowing more time for sets behind screens in my opinion|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|ritong: declarer was in 3Nt, @c lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: he took a good start cashing one @d, then @s off dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 64-32 setup is a mystery   must be money issue|pg||
nt|ritong: east hopped ace and cashed two top @cs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry still down 1|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Henri ... it looked to me like Nabil was going to go off anyway, assuming last club not cashed?|pg||
nt|ritong: at that point, contract was made|pg||
mc|5|nt|ritong: well he has two entries, one for setting the @c and one to cash it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another possible reason --  easier this way to get flights out of Sydney tomorrow with early finish|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andy_h: A bit curious why Nabil claimed, I have partnered with him for a few years and it's not like him to claim unless he's 100% certain that nothing can harm the contract|pg||
nt|andy_h: Maybe he got a bit too confident after he claimed for a double squeeze on the previous set (which was successful)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: he thought he had the rest, guessing he forgot about the last club and thought they were good|pg||
nt|ritong: possible|pg||
nt|andy_h: Courtney and Burgess play ordinary Michaels, so burgess cannot be sure of which minor partner has. But he takes his odds that it will be clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: good thing this set ends soon anyways, this kind of blunder is extremely painful|pg||
nt|ritong: and it is fun too|pg||
nt|andy_h: indeed, and you would hate that if it happened at the start of the match|pg||
nt|ritong: to pass 2@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|nt|ritong: a creative way to learn pard's minor|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  but burgess could have played spade to set up a 5th trick for defense?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, but since he claimed...:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do YOU define misfit?|pg||
nt|ritong: affair was over|pg||
nt|mwigor: as nine of the ten players live in sydney - flights are not a consideration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really 9 of the 10?|pg||
nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: sydney is where the vast majority of australia's top players live|pg||
nt|babs59: flights may have been a consideration when the program was created - they couldn't predict who the finalists would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's the odd man?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: gill should raise @cs despite his minimum|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney's double suggesting they play equal-level-conversion. Meaning if partner bids clubs he can remove that to 2@D which does not say anything about a strong hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor|pg||
nt|ritong: so we will never know if burgess would have played a @h or a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dyke peeking around the screen to see if Ish really passed 2@H ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm kidding folks|pg||

nt|frankaus: i played a lot of rubber V cortney, he has a lot of my money :)|pg||
nt|ritong: nice shot|pg||
nt|andy_h: Indeed|pg||
nt|ritong: @c ruff will set this, but good try|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I think diamond lead & contin gets it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I think he's angling for 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure gosney has enough to compete  possibly his side has eight trumps only|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: now only 13 IMPs diff - and I still dont belive the 6 IMPin board 27|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a lot of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: I hope you got your money's worth in education :)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: gill must feel not so confident|pg||
nt|ianmcc: unless he has to come back in clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: even if there is no @c ruff, he has three @d losers to take care of|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|andy_h: Certainly not his lucky day when partner comes down with @HAQ9 in the opponents suit|pg||
nt|ritong: the defense is not terribly difficult  south has shown @c length|pg||
nt|ritong: and west has not led his singleton, so he is void|pg||

nt|mwigor: in response to the questions about session lengths|pg||
nt|mwigor: WBF regs allow 140 minutes for 16 boards|pg||

nt|andy_h: Hopefully E/W will have got their discarding right this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: is it necessary?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|ritong: west should wonder why declarer made such a risky play in @h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: At this point @dA looks best? specs like it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|c9|nt|babs59: Michael, that's what we get for 16 boards without screens|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard's carding will just confirm that the actual layout is on|pg||

nt|andy_h: I'm sure Nabil will get this right, he's just double checking|pg||
nt|babs59: certainly in Canberra in January we did|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not 1NT by East?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised by 1@C rather than 1N opener?|pg||
nt|ritong: gill!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|newart: alida often will not open a vul NT in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|ritong: but still possible|pg||

nt|mwigor: thats a good start for the defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|newart: doesn't want to go for a numebr|pg||
nt|pelu: ok but then she has a bid problem after 1@C - 1@S -?|pg||
nt|newart: she would rebid 2C i suspect here|pg||
nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks by NS in @H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: again: dont X to a 5 card major - bid 1@H over 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a difference  only 3@H over 1@C   but  4@H over strong NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: if they lead clubs each time then declarer loses control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: there's a frenzy of writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do we know if West has shown a stiff @c?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry, i can't see the explanations clearly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we know why Nabil started with 2@C [FG @C or BAL] instead of 2@D [FG 5+@D]|pg||
nt|ritong: probably trying to muddy waters|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andy_h: 2@C is is GF clubs or balanced, 2@D=catch-all, 2@H bal 2+@S andasks, 2@S shows any 5-4, 3@D shows 5@S4@D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|pelu: and if opp then stop in 2@c/2@D u can X and show your @S|pg||
