mb|3D|mb|p|nt|babs59: 2 IMPs in it, I'd estimate|pg||
nt|pelu: Alida is Clark?|pg||
nt|newart: she is a very agressive player - Ed barnes calls her the Smiling Assassin|pg||
nt|babs59: 8 boards to go|pg||
nt|newart: Alida is Clark yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards at http://www.abf.com.au/events/playoffs/2011/Systems_Open.html|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: yes - 1@C = 1+    since 1@D/@H/@S all promise 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart: Candice played for several years with Elizabeth havas who is at other table in Bilski team|pg||

nt|noodle:  Good evening Al|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nigel: Delmonte worth a move towards slam. The great Tim Seres was cautious about bidding slam after a pre-empt as bad braeks are expected but not here|pg||

nt|noodle:  easy push to start|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: still 1+|pg||
nt|mwigor: last set had something like 10 flat boards - and we start with another one here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andy_h: South is Peter Gill, a frequent vugraph commentator on BBO that you may have seen from time to time|pg||
nt|noodle:  do they promise 5@d for 1@d opening ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|babs59: CR playing bd 17 in 2S NS|pg||
nt|noodle:  here they play transfers so redouble shows @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S gets my vote|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: sooo close|pg||
nt|noodle:  they have to pass with a classic 10+ redouble hand|pg||
nt|noodle:  dyke can still raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if north had bid less -- it would be a Support DBL situation for most  [yes, even in @D]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the 3@S bid is defined differently that last millenium|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then it was a weak hand with lots of @S, now it is more like 2@S strength with extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: I think that should put Clark in the lead|pg||
nt|newart: Barbara - i beat u again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: I believe both N/S and E/W play transfer responses to 1@C, so 1@D here shows 4+@H's|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3@D was alerted, but i'm not sure what it means. likewise with 4@D.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so we have a new leader :)!!!!!|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry, I was out of the room, so missed your comment :(|pg||

nt|babs59: imagine the tension at the tables|pg||
nt|pelu: best to lead @S|pg||
nt|andy_h: Both sides play a 2/1 GF system, but E/W however have recently added a mini NT (9-12) in their arsenal when 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|noodle:  4@s seems like a make  will W sacrifice ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CQ9 probably worth nothing on defense   !KH probably a trick in either contract|pg||
nt|noodle:  y but E rebid at 4 level  W might be afraid 4@S is going down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not certain as to the meaning of 3@D, but I have seen this bid used as some form of a 4 card raise|pg||
nt|ianmcc: neither wants to play it|pg||
nt|noodle:  he goes for it|pg||
nt|mwigor: the other table reached game - so this will not be flat|pg||
pc|d7|nt|newart: Sue and therese must know they are down a lot at this table|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: salvaging 3 imps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|andy_h: And if that's the case, then 4@D is a retransfer, letting the stronger hand play|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|andy_h: letting the 2@D opener play the hand, it conceals the hand with more distirbution|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: looks like a total collaps for NS here|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mwigor: grosvenor's 2@h guarantees 4 card @h support (1@h would be 3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: so it is possibly a closer decision for him than for standard players whether to bid 2 or 3|pg||
nt|mwigor: he chooses the more agressive course|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|super nova: Tony Nunn Opened 6D in the Open in First seat and was rewarded. with his partner passing.|pg||
nt|babs59: in the Open SF, Brown and Kanetkar bid to 7D - but given they were many down, that was perhaps a state of match bid|pg||

nt|noodle:  crawling stayman 2@h weak with both majors or @h@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: "crawling" is too wimpy   i like "garbage" moniker|pg||
nt|noodle:  we have more bugs here Al|pg||
mb|4H|nt|super nova: Perhaps they did have a full auction and it was missed by the operator so they just punched in the final contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I think, Jamie, that the room crashed and that was just catch up result|pg||
nt|super nova: yep|pg||
nt|babs59: I think any partner would bid 7D if you opened 6D on South!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: bd 18  3NT is about to make for more IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: it's not just a bucketload of IMPs - more like 2 buckets|pg||
nt|pelu: but 6@D is a very fair slam - need @Ds 3-2 or @C 3-3|pg||
nt|andy_h: E/W have discussed a lot in terms of competitive bidding and evidently this is one of them. If 4@C was some sort of fit-show I wonder if they play 4@D as any max hand raise or if ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: they play that as "choice of games"|pg||
nt|noodle:  a good hand for 'non forcing' Stayman  1N 2@c P  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D in other room is impressive result|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: 6@h can be made by ruffing the third round of @c high|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nigel: Fans of the losing trick count would call 4@h  then possible to get to 6@h|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|pelu: on a @s Lead|pg||
nt|andy_h: wow and a nice switch by Dyke|pg||
nt|ianmcc: brill switch - if he rises it's curtains|pg||
nt|andy_h: If Edgtton rises with the Ace this contract will be off due to a heart ruff|pg||
nt|andy_h: Alternatively Edgtton can duck this (which is the winning play here) but that switch by Dyke was a pretty quick one|pg||
nt|andy_h: Unfortunately for Edgtton, he gave a bit too much information in the bidding which allowed Dyke to find this brilliant switch|pg||
nt|ianmcc: yes the @h cue was informative|pg||
nt|andy_h: Dyke "knows" that partner has a doubleton heart (giving Edgtton 4 hearts and not 5) because Gill would most likely have led a heart if it was a singleton|pg||

nt|ahollan1: always nice to underplay when you've underbid   takes away some of the sting|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  Indeed.  Methods that employ a Kaplan-style inversion of 1S and 1NT so that 1S is a forcing NT type with up to 4S and a 1NT response shows 5+S can avoid this particular issue by establishing whether a fit actually exists at the 2-level,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Burgess in 4@H East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: When I made her play last sets, she ALWAYS played well.  I think the pressure makes her play better!|pg||
nt|pelu: 67 - 6 and the 6 IMP was a gift from defense :)|pg||
nt|newart: thats twice where Alida has taken a conservative action then bid game after ops bid again|pg||
nt|mwigor: the late ted chadwick was famous for saying that the second person to bid at the 5-level better know what they are doing - once again he was right on board 20|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|pelu: 6@Hs on|pg||
nt|ianmcc: I thought South's @h7 could hold out sqz|pg||
mb|p|nt|gruffydd:  ... before the decision to invite is made.  But this might require using a Flannery opening depending on the rest of the system.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT is an impressive score from Burgess-Courtney|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ianmcc: maybe not|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: at this table N sh gamle on slam - but S has super-super max for a splinter|pg||
nt|newart: You need very firm agreements about the hand types you will spinter  on - if S can have this hand N should move|pg||
nt|babs59: On a spade lead, it does require clubs to break 4-3 (for spade discard) AND the hearts favourable (enough)|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 4@D is in the range 9-11 - Ss hand look stronger to me - 2NT!|pg||
nt|babs59: where Clark emerged with 5C last hand, Havas has passed|pg||
nt|babs59: so they are in 4S NS|pg||
nt|nigel: No doubt Grosvenor was simply following the LAW with 11 trumps competing to the five level|pg||
nt|mwigor: i think grosvenor's raise is clear - the action in question is north's 5-over-5|pg||
nt|nigel: This will be tough to stay out of slam|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pelu: yes 6@Hs is not very good - but as the match has gone - N know she need some good boards|pg||
nt|mwigor: if ishmael thinks 3NT shows strong balanced rather than a long running diamond suit then he will bid again|pg||
nt|nigel: Good point Michael but Courtney has never been backwards in coming forward. He does not know who is making what and the oppo forgot to double!|pg||
nt|mwigor: even if he suspects running diamonds he probably cant pass|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugrapha1: i think 1S showed a strong NT with 3@S...|pg||
nt|nigel: Grosvenor has done well here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: the 1@C is a short club. Edgtton didn't open 1NT because they play 9-12 mini NT in 1st/2nd seat favourable|pg||
nt|mwigor: 4@c is clearly a slam try|pg||
nt|nigel: but not the Vandabilt runner up|pg||
nt|mwigor: is 4NT - please leave me alone?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mwigor: the danger with 4@d is it may sound like a cue for @c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|nigel: Looks like a runaway train|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: i suspect other room auction was the same, but operator lost track when correcting the score for Board 4 :(|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  The QD coming down makes things easy .. but does declarer know about it early enough in the hand to actually play the required line?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: at the other table gill opened the east hand|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mwigor: incredibly despite opening the east hand they stopped in 4@d|pg||
nt|mwigor: making 12 tricks on a heart lead|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gruffydd:  specs suggesting a crossruff will also work ... but the timing is very difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it needed?   2@C 2@D 1@S  then scramble 5 trump tricks?|pg||
nt|mwigor: only a heart lead lets this make i think|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|cK|nt|mwigor: declarer may think his best chance is to finesse clubs - giving him two pitches|pg||

nt|mwigor: although Majors score more i think if i was going to introduce a suit with that hand i'd prefer to introduce the clubs|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I think that if you're willing to play partner for AKxxxx for their 2S (does it show 8-11?) opening then 6C is actually a good punt|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Nabil Edgtton didn't bid with South hand after same opening in other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|andy_h: That would have been a good hand for 3rd/5th leads. But Edgtton doesn't know how many diamonds declarer has but he knows that partner had the @DQ so he went for the sure set|pg||
mb|3C|nt|babs59: 6 person teams, so not that heavy a workload|pg||

mb|d|nt|mwigor: presumably 2@c would have been michaels even though 1@c only showed 1+@c|pg||

nt|babs59: in the OR  I imagine Peter (Gill's)  2@D after 1@c then 1nt overcall showed both majors|pg||

pc|s3|pc|cT|pg||

nt|mwigor: take your time and it is much easier for them to double|pg||

nt|ianmcc: surely @cK next?|pg||

nt|andy_h: keycard when they were on their way to slam) but that was taken so lightly and was rewound for an overtrick|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  I'm a bit surprised both claimed early without looking for that line|pg||

nt|mwigor: opening 1@c with 17-19 BAL and 1@d with 11-13 BAL (1NT is 14-16)|pg||

nt|gruffydd:  For those that wonder why it's good to play 2S as INV here, it's because it frees up the auction 1NT - 2H-2S-2NT for some other purpose.|pg||
nt|gruffydd:  for instance, a 2nd round of transfers can be played, so that minor-suit fits can easily be agreed at the 3-level, or to allow INV hands to show both their suits, or ...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, the principle being that the opps can't dbl so easily|pg||
nt|mwigor: 3NT = @c splinter, 4@c = @d splinter, 4@d = @h splinter - you accept the transfer as a kind of "last train"|pg||

nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mwigor: sydney is where the vast majority of australia's top players live|pg||
nt|babs59: flights may have been a consideration when the program was created - they couldn't predict who the finalists would be|pg||
nt|ahollan1: who's the odd man?|pg||
nt|mwigor: the danger for NS now is not missing 4@h but getting too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: gill should raise @cs despite his minimum|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney's double suggesting they play equal-level-conversion. Meaning if partner bids clubs he can remove that to 2@D which does not say anything about a strong hand|pg||
nt|mwigor: grosvenor|pg||
nt|ritong: so we will never know if burgess would have played a @h or a @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dyke peeking around the screen to see if Ish really passed 2@H ???|pg||

nt|babs59: unwilling to take a phantom|pg||
nt|mwigor: sure|pg||
nt|mwigor: at any other vul you wouldnt dream of saving i dont think|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess it boils down to who is more likely to be overbidding - Courtney or Grosvenor (or both)|pg||
nt|mwigor: when burgess makes a slam try it sort of feels like they must both be overbidding a little|pg||
nt|mwigor: but the fact that he made a slam try and they've stopped in 4 suggests that it probably isnt a phantom|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: even if there is no @c ruff, he has three @d losers to take care of|pg||

nt|mwigor: 2@s by S was reached in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: sigh|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: why not 1NT by East?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone surprised by 1@C rather than 1N opener?|pg||
nt|ritong: gill!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mwigor: this looks like down 1 at least|pg||
pc|sK|nt|newart: alida often will not open a vul NT in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|ritong: but still possible|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andy_h: Nice fitting hands, seems like E/W in the OR diagnosed their diamond fit|pg||
nt|mwigor: thats a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|mwigor: @cK switch|pg||
pc|h2|nt|newart: doesn't want to go for a numebr|pg||
nt|pelu: ok but then she has a bid problem after 1@C - 1@S -?|pg||
nt|newart: she would rebid 2C i suspect here|pg||
nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks by NS in @H|pg||
nt|mwigor: or maybe a trump|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: again: dont X to a 5 card major - bid 1@H over 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a difference  only 3@H over 1@C   but  4@H over strong NT|pg||
nt|mwigor: if they lead clubs each time then declarer loses control|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|newart: i'm with Pelu - get your 5card major in quickly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: there's a frenzy of writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|ianmcc: do we know if West has shown a stiff @c?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: sorry, i can't see the explanations clearly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do we know why Nabil started with 2@C [FG @C or BAL] instead of 2@D [FG 5+@D]|pg||
nt|ritong: probably trying to muddy waters|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andy_h: 2@C is is GF clubs or balanced, 2@D=catch-all, 2@H bal 2+@S andasks, 2@S shows any 5-4, 3@D shows 5@S4@D|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|pelu: and if opp then stop in 2@c/2@D u can X and show your @S|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|frankaus: keep tuned in I expect some real fine bridge for the rest of this event  - 3X16 to go|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|newart: i wonder if they realise how close it now is - 47-6 in 7 board in this set|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: very pretty|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ianmcc: if completely incomprehensible|pg||
nt|ritong: i think this is one of the most satisfying feelings in this game|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: declaring such a perfecto|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andy_h: for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: zero unuseful card and xxx for x in the last suit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|nt|frankaus: i'm told 5X16 to go|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|newart: I think it would be considered a big upset if Clark got up to win|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm not 100% sure about the meaning of 3@H but given at how the auction progressed it makes sense for it to ask for further shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: OK folks, thanks for coming. We'll be back in around 15 minutes|pg||
nt|andy_h: Thanks Andrew for the hard work!|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mwigor: down 3 now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: NS in 3@H in CR - prob down 1 |pg||
pc|c7|nt|babs59: hi Neil.  I would have to agree.|pg||
nt|chick: Not a real exciting finish here, but at least we have seen some good bridge played|pg||
nt|mwigor: so the gap is down to 17 with 32 to play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: :(|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|pc|c2|nt|newart: Hi barbara|pg||
nt|babs59: Bilski would have been hot favourites BEFORE the final, let alone when 45 IMPs ahead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugrapha1: thanks to all our commentators. i think the next set starts at 1. in 1 hr 20 mins.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Grosvenor squeezed ot all winners|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: michael predicted it right|pg||
nt|ritong: he got severely tapped|pg||
nt|mwigor: hope you didnt lose too much on your bet|pg||
