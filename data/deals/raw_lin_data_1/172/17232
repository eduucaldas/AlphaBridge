nt|athene: she knows opps are in an  8-card fit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard Hans finally lost a match   against Klinger   so  probably needs a few VP to secure 1st place in the Division 1 Double Round Robin|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kareno: And the contract, sadly.|pg||
nt|mrdct: best plan will be to defend here|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Edgtton a very unorthadox player, should make for an interesting match|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct: reasonable 3 card raise here with the shortage in @h|pg||

nt|athene: not surprised, now she knows her partner has KQJxx support for her six card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is Hinge expression better now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, that sounds right|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: so east is really Caplan in fact|pg||
nt|babs59: definitely an accurate description Brauny|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: but if there are any correct scores onsite it'd be nice to have an update|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|babs59: the only odd action last hand was King's initial pass - but it kept them low|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: however, it probably kept them from a makeable game.|pg||
nt|babs59: on to this hand|pg||
nt|babs59: multi 2D bid by King|pg||
nt|babs59: now she's shown - presumably - a bad weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|babs59: she has no idea about the value of her @HK|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|babs59: I guess I got it wrong and 3S showed a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might have considered doubling 2@S as a "pre-balance"|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: didnt they miss a game ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Scores after 5/6 rounds|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: once the @H10 appears, declarer's only worry is getting forced in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't happening either|pg||
nt|babs59: it looks like you can play for 2-2 spades, then use the hearts for discards, but East has a nasty surprise in the heart suit|pg||

nt|mrdct: looking like another 3 imps for ebery|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT would typically be based on a source of tricks in @h with some holes elsewhere|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Klinger sure looks to have better draw in their attempt to finish 2nd|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very heavy 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: In division 2 Neill won from Courtney|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: but it's just a choice between a spade and a diamond lead, for me|pg||
nt|athene: north might just bash 3nt in now|pg||
nt|athene: partner opened in 4th...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Open Div II, Courtney beat Brown 25-1 in the last round to win, on 182 from Brown 178, Noble 156, Nixon 141  Gumby 130 and Gue 106|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: some might open 3@D in 4th chair |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|athene: i suppose there is some slight danger that if declarer loses to the @SA and @HK the defence might not realise the urgency of their position, and allow declarer to get all the ...|pg||
nt|athene: losers in one or other minor away on the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that should happen really|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|vugrapha1: not the best layout here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: trump lead feels best especially with declarer showing 3 spades (as i assume 3nt did)|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: 3@D as INV+ raise of @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  there was always keycard but I think Morrison did the right thing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: heart lead, trump shift maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but the immediate trump lead in the other room was better for the defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: these third seat positions are really tricky|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know declarer has the queen it is sometimes still right to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh not Morrison's problem -- i think Hinge was TOO GOOD for jump to 4@S |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Unusual vs Unusual [can also be used when Michaels shows both majors]   creates 2 cue bids|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: the table joked that 3D was natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: low cue bid = 1 suit    high cue bid = the other suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hinge said natural my [redacted]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common, but not necessarily best theoretically   low cue = low suit, hi = hi|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|athene: north must have been tempted to bid those clubs over 1@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's a pretty reasonable suit|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|vugrapha1: 4h clears things up|pg||
nt|athene: also you know declarer has not many cards in the red suits so covering the long-term prospects in hearts is not such an issue|pg||

pc|c6|nt|athene: just grabbing the quick trick in hearts looked more sensible|pg||

pc|d2|nt|athene: game over, really|pg||

nt|ahollan1: should he return trump or force with 3rd round of @C|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mrdct: this headed for 3NT i think|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jcwla: With a strong NT opener hands like N that would otherwise have reasons for devaluation no longer apply - these are all great combining cards - not sure where 2@C is aiming except ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: to give info|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jcwla: I like Hans' auction in the CR much better.|pg||
nt|mrdct: north might have been forced to take an invitational hand via stayman|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think with those @s and at this vul bill should just bid 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand is not invitational opposite a strong (to say nothing of red) NT.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has two cards below a 7.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: ben wont be very happy with this dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: And what do you know almost every one of those middle cards comes into play.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Thanks all, restart in -13 and counting...|pg||
nt|mrdct: so hans will be sitting on a 22-8 win after this board - but 10 more boards to play in this match|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|sK|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: Klinger 33  Henbest  12|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|mc|8|nt|mrdct: which would be 20-10 for Klinger|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: thanks all, see you a while ago|pg||
nt|mrdct: so Ebery have a mountain to climb in the last segment|pg||
nt|mrdct: the good news for Ebery is they are solid for 3rd place so will have choice of opponents in the repechage|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lets hope so thanks Daniel, Dave, Jordan, Al and all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: back to the future for the next set a while ago|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: perhaps not careful enough to pull the board all the way through the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: last hand of this set but this table is fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Hans would get it right  @CJ  then @HJ|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine where that would ever be wrong|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: it looks as though 5@DX had chances|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have considered the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: since north didn't have much else for the opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 6, EW got rescued out of the doomed 4@s contract in OR and gained 11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  just @HJ without 2nd @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both rooms in other match are on 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: this auction is all a bit murky now|pg||
nt|athene: a very aggressive 3@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: jump overcalls are traditionally strong in the balancing seat of course|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: she murmured something to East after bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: south thinking about six now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i imagine strong option...|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@C denies any spade control, then north must just sign off - i.e. not bid 4@D, because that would promise a spade control too as well as diamond|pg||
nt|athene: she might just sign off because she realises she has overdone it a bit and she wants to dampen south's enthusiasm :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: North not sure what 4c is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're on last board of the set|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: south is wondering if 3@H is "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunate opening bid by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger now leads Henbest  23  to 9|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I'll close this table after this board - please join another for the last couple of boards - we're due back in about 25 mins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Nick|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Nick|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: not at all clear what 3@H should be on the auction|pg||
nt|athene: when south has shown some single-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h alerted by North only|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: ok, north thinks 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, it's not 100% obvious 4@C should be a cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Al and specs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt was cold of course but you do have to double hook the diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|nt|vugrapha1: north must have thought shed bid 3s with all heart raises|pg||
nt|athene: south can have quite a few decent hands with a club suit that could not bid over 1@S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: this is a bit unwise perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H really was pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: that means north was prepared to play in 4@C, if her partner in fact had clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to have pretty good clubs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: still i am not sure they can do much about this contract|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: if declarer takes every finesse in the book she makes 12|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: @CQ, @CJ, @DK, @DJ, @HK all where you want them to be|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no diamond unblock there|pg||
nt|andyv:  still difficulty with finding that 9th trick but Nick is right...not play J@d is careless|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: still, north shouldn't pass 4@C, i don't think|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: although what she should bid is perhaps more of problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice endplay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems he was destined to gain 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure looks like it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Kling sitting on an 18-12 for now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Klinger*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @D 33 or blocked or @H10 onside  or ...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|vugrapha1: thanks all, see you soon !|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: back in a few mins|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: maybe 4@D trying to cover all possibilities|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: nunn wants to play the endplay but calls for the king and Morrison says you wimp|pg||
pc|sK|mc|9|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: that's all for now, please join us again in 20 mins maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wimpage prevails|pg||
