mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: My partners never have :(|pg||
nt|ady: I would have favoured a top heart lead    hope partner has Queen to 5   or maybe Jack to 5 with queen doubleton  coming down|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And then you can switch to a spade when partner discourages|pg||
nt|ady: 12 tricks   for e.w in hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think they can bid it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|zyxzewski: now how many spades from N? I would bid 3@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Me too|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Definitely 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just the right colours for 3@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  My third seat green weak two would look rather different to that hand|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: :) same here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can Oja bid 5@D? I doubt it|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|zyxzewski: no way|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: in CR  north opened 3@S   east bid 4@H   south 4@S   and west 5@H   all pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would never sit for 4@SX with the East cards|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Unless you twist my arms|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: he even didn't want to use forcing pass, i thing in general pass should be forcing in such auction|pg||
nt|ady: as a passed hand would 5@D make sense from west  if not deciding to double?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Well it depends what you think you shown by bidding 4@h and what you could have done instead|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: However, I don't think 5@D by West is so far away. It can't be natural|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But I agree 5@h looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Lauri. 4@H is bid to make after a pre-empt, a strong hand, so pass by West should be forcing|pg||

mb|4H|nt|xenya: 6@S would be a good save -- if EW get to slam that is|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|xenya: not too likely thery will after this start?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ady: if South plays 3NT  will have to play on clubs first to make  to knock out west entry|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: again NS have both passed, but here they actually have a chance to reach to 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ady: may get a heart lead  though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|zyxzewski: seems like 11 tricks are possible if the opening lead is not a diamond - ruffing finesse against @HQ, discarding a diamond on @H9 and ruffing the last diamone|pg||
nt|ady: game swing for Druva|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  From South's point of view, North is limited by the failure to overcall immediately|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: (discarding one to spade)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But I can understand North passing because no suits break when they use Wilkosz and his suit is poor|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|zyxzewski: it's usually quite uncomfortable to come in with such suit quality, knowing there's quite big chances for adverse breaks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: modern stle is to double multi 2@D with most hand 13-15 range that are not completely unbalanced   it  solves problems on this hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But this Multi is different|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a two-suiter, 5-5|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: why not, needing two aces and a little bit of luck (or little less values and more luck) :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure that slam is any less attractive over 4@h than it was over 3@h|pg||
nt|zyxzewski: but probably figured out, that if Luks has them, he goes over 4@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zyxzewski: although EW 2@C opening is normally 5@C with 4 card major or 6+ clubs, Luks decided to pre-empt the opponents a bit|pg||
