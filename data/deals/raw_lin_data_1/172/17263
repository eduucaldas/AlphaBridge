mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||

nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||

nt|henryb:  no, A is about 4.5 in suit or NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|chilloncan: analohously there are many crisp 17 counts that one knows are too good for 1N if the hand will be played in a suit. but they are still NOT good enough for one of a minor and a 2N ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: rebid, so you have to open 1N|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Ace controls tempo, even in NT|pg||
nt|chilloncan: very true. but once in a great while the fate of a contract deopends on something other than tempo|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or 6-3 :)|pg||
nt|athene: you could claim this at trick 1 but probably worth playing a few tricks as if a diamond gets ducked you might have 33 spades or a spade-diamond squeeze for 13|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely -- just clarified that Burgess in charge of @D|pg||

mb|p|pc|c6|nt|athene: always double to cater for the penalty pass, if you can do it without cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe DBL risks  4@H/@S from Richman -- which exposes @CKJx on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well you have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: if partner jumps to 4major you expect to make it|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
