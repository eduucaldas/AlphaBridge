nt|athene: and that might get beaten|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: west wants to play this one again :)|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think south should stand that double|pg||
nt|athene: she knows opps are in an  8-card fit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i heard Hans finally lost a match   against Klinger   so  probably needs a few VP to secure 1st place in the Division 1 Double Round Robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: should just bid a gentle 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st & 2nd advance to SemiFinals|pg||
nt|mrdct: very similar hand to the last one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think he probably did cash @D10 before crossing to dummy and then woudl've had a good read on north's squirms|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugrapha1: he did hook a heart in the end, the spades must have been cashed already|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3rd gets to pick from top 2 in Division 2  and 4th gets the other D2 team  for  matches to determine other semi-finalists|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: it will be fixed shortly|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|athene: west should be thinking about 5@C now |pg||

nt|athene: i think the double of 1@S was a bit dubious - what was East planning to do if her partner bid a lot of diamonds?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: yes, that sounds right|pg||

mb|2C|an|GF clubs or Bal|mb|2D|nt|babs59: the only odd action last hand was King's initial pass - but it kept them low|pg||

nt|babs59: on to this hand|pg||
nt|babs59: multi 2D bid by King|pg||
nt|babs59: now she's shown - presumably - a bad weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|babs59: she has no idea about the value of her @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: is it?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|babs59: I guess I got it wrong and 3S showed a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east might have considered doubling 2@S as a "pre-balance"|pg||

nt|babs59: it looks like you can play for 2-2 spades, then use the hearts for discards, but East has a nasty surprise in the heart suit|pg||

nt|mrdct: by inserting the mini-NT into the picture it changes their basic structure and they may not havecovered all bases|pg||
nt|andy_h: I'm pretty sure they have discussed the 1@S bid, which I'm guessing again to be natural and forcing for 1 round|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: seems odd that 2@d wasn't available as nat and forcing|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: better just to raise the hearts|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one of my favorite series of articles in Bridge World    introduced ASTRO, then someone improved to ASPRO  then someone further improved to ASPTRO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 6    Klinger 11  Henbest  9|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andy_h: I think they always bid 1@H with any hand that has 3card hearts except for game forcing hands, so 1@H can have up to 18-19bal (in other words it can be passed)|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3NT is often a safe bid in murky auctions|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: people often bid notrumps to show a stopper in some suit or other|pg||
nt|athene: but it's usually possible to get into notrumps if you bid suits first|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|athene: it can be much harder to get OUT of notrumps if you go there precipitously|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andy_h: That's true Dave, as long as you know it won't be artificial!|pg||
nt|mrdct: a nice agreement to have is 3NT is never artificial!|pg||
nt|mrdct: but we saw an artificial 3NT bid by nabil in the last segment|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|athene: it looks as though NS just show number of kings over 5NT|pg||
nt|athene: rather than specific kings|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mrdct: in quite a different auction though|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: basically the same auction as the other room|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andy_h: A couple of years ago, my partner and I incorporated that 2NT-3@S is a transfer to 3NT so we could put 2NT-3NT to have another meaning. But just in case, we also added that ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2NT-3NT-4x-4NT was "sorry partner I forgot"|pg||

nt|jcwla: What say you, Al?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Last board of the day here. Back in 15 hours|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse auctions too tough for me -- that's why i've played big club since 1971|pg||
mb|p!|mb|1D|mb|2H|an|intermediate|nt|ahollan1: quick winners in @S  fillers in other suits -- sure seems like 3N a bit wet|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i first read about varying strength of jump overcall by vulnerability in Mike Lawrence's  Complete Book of Overcalls|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: perhaps not careful enough to pull the board all the way through the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: last hand of this set but this table is fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought Hans would get it right  @CJ  then @HJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine where that would ever be wrong|pg||
nt|mrdct: good idea - did the latter ever come up?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2H|an|11-16|mb|p|nt|athene: it looks as though 5@DX had chances|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have considered the double club finesse|pg||
nt|athene: since north didn't have much else for the opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 6, EW got rescued out of the doomed 4@s contract in OR and gained 11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  just @HJ without 2nd @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both rooms in other match are on 8|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrdct: as an aside, i wonder if such a method is legal - as it could be construed as a psychic control (after partner psyches 3NT)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: this auction is all a bit murky now|pg||
nt|athene: a very aggressive 3@H overcall|pg||
nt|athene: jump overcalls are traditionally strong in the balancing seat of course|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: she murmured something to East after bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: south thinking about six now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i imagine strong option...|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@C denies any spade control, then north must just sign off - i.e. not bid 4@D, because that would promise a spade control too as well as diamond|pg||
nt|athene: she might just sign off because she realises she has overdone it a bit and she wants to dampen south's enthusiasm :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: North not sure what 4c is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're on last board of the set|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: south is wondering if 3@H is "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunate opening bid by E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger now leads Henbest  23  to 9|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I'll close this table after this board - please join another for the last couple of boards - we're due back in about 25 mins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Nick|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Nick|pg||
nt|mrdct: last board now|pg||
nt|mrdct: and it looks like klinger are having a big win vs henbest so the finishing order will be Hans, Klinger, Ebery, Henbest|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Gold in the tank|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gold may just pass this out, he knows that all the minor kings are onside for declarer|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW have a good save in 5@h|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: not at all clear what 3@H should be on the auction|pg||
nt|athene: when south has shown some single-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 3h alerted by North only|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, north thinks 3@H is pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: ah ok, it's not 100% obvious 4@C should be a cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Al and specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt was cold of course but you do have to double hook the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: and an even better save undoubled|pg||
nt|mrdct: some consolation imps coming for ebery|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 11, I think|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Gos should find the trump promo|pg||
nt|andy_h: Gosney probably doesn't know who can make what, and that the deal could be very distributional so decides not to double this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugrapha1: north must have thought shed bid 3s with all heart raises|pg||
nt|athene: south can have quite a few decent hands with a club suit that could not bid over 1@S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: this is a bit unwise perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@H really was pass or correct|pg||
nt|athene: that means north was prepared to play in 4@C, if her partner in fact had clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so she has to have pretty good clubs|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: still i am not sure they can do much about this contract|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer takes every finesse in the book she makes 12|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: @CQ, @CJ, @DK, @DJ, @HK all where you want them to be|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hA|pc|d6|nt|vugrapha1: no diamond unblock there|pg||
nt|andyv:  still difficulty with finding that 9th trick but Nick is right...not play J@d is careless|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: still, north shouldn't pass 4@C, i don't think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|andy_h: Good defence|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: although what she should bid is perhaps more of problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice endplay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems he was destined to gain 9th trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure looks like it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Kling sitting on an 18-12 for now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Klinger*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either @D 33 or blocked or @H10 onside  or ...|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|vugrapha1: nunn wants to play the endplay but calls for the king and Morrison says you wimp|pg||
