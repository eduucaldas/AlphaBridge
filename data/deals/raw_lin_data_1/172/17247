nt|brobles: This is actually Joaquin Pacareu's first deal of hands of the tournament, right in the final :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: 600 is a huge result|pg||
nt|brobles: The team Caracci won the Round Robin, and had a confortable win in the semifinals over a women team that has played for the Chilean Women team a couple of times|pg||
mb|2D|an|søppelmulti|mb|p|nt|brobles: Time to start comparing results finally|pg||
mb|2S|an|pass hvis svake to sp|nt|ady: may also get to game here   |pg||
nt|kmb24: another 22 point game|pg||
mb|p!|an|  |nt|brobles: The Team Rubio has also played the event mostly 4 handed and had a very tough semifinal match against the RIOS team|pg||
nt|tez: undo pls|pg||
nt|kmb24: they're playing the board backwards|pg||
nt|tez: this is no real|pg||
nt|kmb24: paca did in fact open 1@H|pg||
nt|tez: different hand i thk:)|pg||
nt|brobles: I think NS play 2@d as a constructive weak 2 in a M (8-11 points)|pg||
mb|2N|an|24-25|nt|brobles: East west playing in 2 hearts, not sure who is who and who has what though :)|pg||
nt|tez: check pls vugraph operator|pg||
nt|kmb24: it's the right hand, the board is just rotated |pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|brobles: Vugraph operator tells me that West has east cards, so they put the board the other way round|pg||
nt|tez: not right hand|pg||
nt|brobles: So Paca is playing 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: north is dealer|pg||
nt|brobles: the auction was not like this, they just put the contract|pg||
nt|tez: he cant pass|pg||
nt|brobles: so Joaquin Pacareu is playing 2@h (as WEST)|pg||
nt|vugraphzja: yes|pg||
nt|tez: yes means?|pg||
nt|kmb24: the board is right, the hands are all in the opposite spots|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s pass 1nt 2@h all pass may be|pg||
nt|brobles: so 3@h shows a minimum heart bid|pg||
mb|3D|an|overf|nt|ralfwil: there is in my opinion a big difference between a 3- or 4-card support, so 2@h is enough for me as E on previous board|pg||
nt|chick: or perhaps 3@C showing 3 card support and let pard decide|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Cornelia and Friggi|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Everyone :)|pg||
nt|brobles: You can watch this table live through this link: http://www.bridgesantiago.cl/vugcam|pg||

mb|3H|nt|vugraphzwd: well hello Cornelia :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hej Staffan @H@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: We'll get layer names up soon|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Staffan's pc is a bit slow|pg||
nt|brobles: but that will not stop Juan Pablo :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kmb24: most pairs these days do it the other way, 2d a bad weak 2 and 2M a good one.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|chick: I believe some of the IMPs you see in the score are handicaps|pg||
nt|chick: Not sure how many|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: I´ll check :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Blandat got 29 imps for this evening of 24 boards|pg||

nt|barbyh: lots of work|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Hei Espen|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks Staffan :)|pg||
nt|espooz: Hi all! :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hei Espen :)|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca has to give his partner a diamond ruff or a diamond trick to hold this to 4|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|chick: Trump lead was good, as he has to ruff some hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: try @s10|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello Roland and David|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@D  strong 2   usually either balanced  above 2NT opening  or 8+ tricks in any suit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N should be happy to know partner has invitational values|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT confirmed balanced type  around 23-24|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can understand S's problem - if partner has @h fit, 7 may be possible, if not - just a small slam|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about that 2@H bid|pg||
nt|daman: this is like playing at the club|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: they get about 1.25 imp per board so there is a difference in playing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: it might be described as frisky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: in sweden we have a national handicap|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: and we add this for all four players|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ady: around 33  34 between them  but KQX hearts minimum to consider grand slam    |pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: but you need to have standards|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: then we take the difference between the two teams and we get a handicap|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes. why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|cuttysark: SOunds interesting - probaby more accurate than accumulated master points|pg||
nt|ady: if south can establish hearts as trumps fit  then rkc can establish quality of norths hearts   and find the queen is missing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now N should know - @h Q is missing|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 6NT  better than 6 hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|daman: good auction to get to 5@C in the CR|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: best to cash K@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morning everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzxe: the handicap is base on all pairs tournament a player plays. Not optimal but the onlye way wwe got ;)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: weak or multi|pg||
nt|brobles: Huge result from the Open Room|pg||
nt|kmb24: went something like pass-1@h-1@s-2@c-p-2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: most systems have ups and downs|pg||
nt|kmb24: back to normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: i might try 1n in third seat on that|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: south might balance|pg||
nt|kmb24: other room chose to double 1@d.  i really prefer 1N|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt with singleton?|pg||
nt|tez: ok for me.np:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: prefer 1N with singleton over t/o double with one!|pg||
nt|kmb24: the other room's result is huge.  game on every hand!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|friggi: light opening|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C 2@H should end it|pg||
nt|brobles: I would probably bid 1@h at the table, would be a little scared of 1N red white with a PH partner. 1N looks still reasonable to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S from west shows decent hearts|pg||
nt|chick: very light, even by my standards :)|pg||
nt|tez: 20 point game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kmb24: not sure what's the plan with 2@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: balance chancy  as west could be shortin spades   possibly singleton and a good defensive hand|pg||
nt|ady: this looks cedrtainly down 1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as I see it -1 or -2|pg||
nt|friggi: agree to that:)|pg||
nt|barbyh: found a home|pg||
nt|brobles: I don't know what Smith was planning over 2@d but he should definitly pass now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Very interesting hand to lead from. You sure know one thing - you don´t want to lead :)|pg||
nt|kmb24: unless he had 2@s available to show 4@s and longer minor, nf|pg||
pc|d3|nt|friggi: W signs off with 10 points!?|pg||
nt|chick: He's probably seen his partner's openers :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|friggi: that is the only fair clue to make from this |pg||
nt|vugraphzwd: Well, their agreement before was that East may do light openings and bids, while West makes sure he covers up for his partner.. :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kmb24: not much here.  took a heart lead to let this one slip though.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|friggi: but 3NT would have been super here|pg||

nt|paulg:  I guess North thought that slam would be no better than a finesse opposite a normal 3@s call|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it might be a lot worse|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  having so much points in minors - definitely|pg||

nt|kmb24: another great result from robles/caracci coming in making 3N off the first 5 tricks here|pg||
nt|brobles: Goren says that with this quantity of points you can play 3N :)|pg||
nt|brobles: The Open room had a misunderstanding on this hand but stopped safely in 4NT. Smith was denying majors with 3@h but apparently they weren't in the same page|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brobles: Valdes is going to prempt?|pg||
nt|kmb24: here's a nice little trick... open the south hand with multi, and show whichever major partner doesn't like|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: but have to play the bad version of multi for that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: still got the club away   so  down 2 last hand|pg||
nt|friggi: plain 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|kmb24: dbl!|pg||
nt|brobles: so 2@s is 0-7hcp|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|kmb24: anyone like double on paca's cards?|pg||
nt|kmb24: 3n looks normal to me|pg||
nt|brobles: 4@d is pretty conservative in my opinion|pg||
nt|kmb24: i agree|pg||
nt|brobles: Paca not liking his trick source in 3N with only 1 stopper, but it has to be a winning bid more often.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kmb24: well, given that your partner would take a trick in spades this hand in 3n, maybe it's a better stopper than it seems|pg||
nt|brobles: 5@d turns out to be an excellent spot, because he prefered to evaluate his hand as suit playing cards|pg||
nt|brobles: now rafa should definitly blast into slam|pg||

nt|kmb24: they squealed|pg||
nt|brobles: Nice try by Joaquin but Rafa decided he was missing too many key cards to get involved|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: @hK is a bad honour, so pass on 3@s|pg||
nt|brobles: NS playing 4 card diamonds so I think that a club lead is reasonable. Well done|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|tez: @c 7 was very good|pg||
nt|kmb24: looked very likely that 4 spades were possible, and given the clubs i think @h finesse was a better shot|pg||
nt|brobles: Yep|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|friggi: but not enough|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brobles: Rubio team picked up 11 imps on board 25 after a terrible club split for NS|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: this happens with a multi sometimes   both sides playing in the same suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|kmb24: it's hard to untangle it though|pg||
nt|brobles: so the first 13 imps to the Rubio team|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: the e/w made 8 tricks defending in CR in spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h ruff before playing @dA and an overtrick...|pg||
nt|kmb24: was hoping to creat some action by passing i'm sure.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think you have to run the T@s to leave the Q as a reentry|pg||
mc|10|nt|kmb24: but if they don't cover maybe you're blocked anyway|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I think I liked the 1@H opener on the previous deal better than this 12 count|pg||
nt|santyclz: If you can call this a 12 count with qj-.|pg||
nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This is more like it|pg||
nt|paulg:  looks dangerous hand for West|pg||
nt|ady: would not play well|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not a bad responding hand to a strong @c, 12hcp 3 controls...|pg||
mb|d|nt|cuttysark: I presume 1NT is wide-ranging|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 6@c (or @ss in matchpoints).|pg||
nt|ady: double from south?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: It makes the auction game-forcing, and hopefully West will not worry about too much wasted in diamonds|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, W is aware now|pg||
nt|paulg:  on hands like this it is better to play multi 2@d as North may overcall 2@h :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|paulg:  the only good news is that there is a chance that this auction will be duplicated|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: Response denies the king of hearts so all is well|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H was asking partner if he had the @S Queen    |pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: I'm told 3nt was forcing|pg||
nt|daman: right Joe|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 5@H asking for @sQ, Rdb = Ace or void|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||

nt|ady: team mates will be very gratefull for the unexpected plus|pg||
nt|chick: This would have been much better bid using control cuebids instead of ace asking|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|espooz: I dont think V should bid 4@D so long they play 2/1 "game force"|pg||
nt|friggi: I think Blandat will gain some Imps on this one|pg||
nt|kmb24: JD to the K for a H finesse was a winner|pg||
nt|brobles: yeah, for sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: this board likely to be the third push of the segment|pg||

nt|kmb24: looks like a normal 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|tez: and they will play 3 nt|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes as West in the Open room took a lot of tricks after a spade lead|pg||
nt|kmb24: but you never know|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I agree Espen, splinters are for game hands, slower is better for slam hands|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|tez: 2@h is not enuf for me:)|pg||
nt|kmb24: you never know...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: for you?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brobles: you were right, but still a push|pg||
pc|c9|nt|espooz: Exactly|pg||
nt|chick: replying to a couple of private comments .... splinters should be used by the person who knows there is game, but doesn't have a slam force hand.|pg||
nt|brobles: I agree, I try a NT bid, not sure if 1 or 2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|chick: in that case, West is the one who knew there was slam, so he should NOT splinter ... his partner doesn't need to know about the @D shortness|pg||
nt|friggi: do you like W's dbl?|pg||
nt|kmb24: i kind of like 2n over 1s|pg||

nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  If you hover your mouse over the team score, a pop-up shows the imp scale|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade game for e/w|pg||
nt|paulg:  a chance for EW to have an easy board|pg||
mb|1C|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: can't say I like 2@C here - would rpefer 1NT if it is in range|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like 1@d to me, but that may be age.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxe: 1NT = 15-17 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: OK, I'll go with 1@D :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Remember when we used to worry about rebids?  Called "prepared bidding".|pg||

nt|ady: easy game missed in CR for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: Blandat (Mixed in English) is kicking back, just 2 imps from its handicap|pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 17 so far (7 carryover and 10 more in the segment)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kmb24: only 3 of the 15 boards this segment were played in partscore at both tables!|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1n overcall in the other room was a little weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: This event has a very nice trophy at the entrance of the main chilean Bridge Club where you can eventually print your team name if you win :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|espooz: standard 1nt here|pg||
nt|kmb24: especially with double so close to describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: finally, a makeable contract :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes that is a bid odd to see that:)|pg||
nt|brobles: Slam is agressive but easily makes on this layout|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes, very odd|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think rafa should bid 1nt over 1s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: only 12 cards on E on board 17, so they play 18 now|pg||
nt|brobles: Yeah, partner could have enough values for game on this auction|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|kmb24: for sure, not to mention 1s could be a silly contract with 1nt cold|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: I dont like the lead|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H is a far better contract then 3NT|pg||

pc|hA|nt|chick: why?|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: W bid hearts.  I'm sure S was just leading the unbid major|pg||

pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|friggi: I know|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|espooz: S have a normal @S lead|pg||
nt|friggi: but N can signal|pg||

nt|friggi: then S will play @D and more|pg||
nt|espooz: Low heart in trick 2 ?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|espooz: If they use smith that a big card likes the lead. North should throw a low @H |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|friggi: @H Ace is asking for signal, due to the fact that W has already bid @H|pg||
nt|friggi: he could have made 6|pg||
nt|friggi: discards @D on @S 10|pg||
nt|friggi: then take @C twice and ruff|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|ady: even if west followed   might be best to try ace of clubs and when the jack does not appear  try the hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|brobles: Seems normal|pg||
nt|kmb24: just need AK A to wrap 3n|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|ady: can still make if ruffing a heart early and playing a spade  if later finessing a club  and eliminating and playing ace and another diamond     east willhave to unblock or be end ...|pg||
nt|ady: played   either way declarer makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice play David - eliminate @c and @h before playing @s|pg||
nt|chick: EW could end in 3N, and if a heart is led, he won't get to use the diamonds|pg||
nt|friggi: @H is a mandatory lead from N|pg||
nt|tez: q of @c or ace and small|pg||

nt|ady: goulash|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I suggested, opening a multi 2@d on  4 was a lot more successful as North did overcall 2@h, so the penalty was missed|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ady: 4@C can be beaten last hand   so if south had been more active they may have saved some imps|pg||

mb|4C|nt|brobles: Rubio will consider a slam try in this hand but my guess is that they will stop in 4. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: i think so.. though slam only on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|brobles: Juan Pablo Valdes was planning to bid 1 or 2 spades after the double but I bet he was very prepared for this auction|pg||

nt|ady: 5@C a make for e/w|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|cuttysark: the 4-0 fit cost 11 imps when they reached 5@C in the other room - did well to make that, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i know it is light but it is classic distribution |pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ady: some like full opening for a take-out double  in case partner has a penalty pass |pg||
nt|ady: 2@C inverted minor raaise|pg||
nt|paulg:  who does a penalty pass of 1@c? :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough problem for West now, perhaps 3@s?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  as we can see, 3@d does not promise considerable extra values|pg||

nt|ady: 8 card suit|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ady: 11 tricks  1 club    1 diamond to lose|pg||
nt|ady: west will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  that is the definition of CHO (centre-hand opponent) ...opening a weak 2@d without a suit when you have 10 tricks in your own hand|pg||
nt|ady: not fond of opening 2@D on that|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  a lot of side values for weak-two|pg||
nt|paulg:  i might just bid 6@h, only needs @dAJxxx|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but if partner can expect such a hand - it's their methods, all in all|pg||
nt|paulg:  but i suppose I should force in hearts, if I can, and then bid blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree   west should investigate slam with that diamond holding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|paulg:  for me, 5@h would now ask for the @dQ, so West may be forced to play in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: that was the easy way as long as east does not mis read 5@H  as some sort of bid asking for queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  which goes down if clubs lead and continued, but at least South on lead|pg||
