nt|babs59: perhaps the HA is better - can still cope with 4-0 either side, but if they are breaking any better you don't give away the overtrick|pg||
nt|chilloncan: careful play makes 4H easy here despite bad break|pg||

nt|babs59: Last year I was NPC of the Australian Women's Team for a couple of events.|pg||

nt|babs59: of course, they aren't all playing at this table right now :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|babs59: but our isolation from the top world events, and general laziness about improving, are a major issue as far as I'm concerned|pg||
nt|babs59: we desperately need some high level coaching|pg||

pc|s5|nt|babs59: I guess 2@C must have been forcing|pg||
nt|babs59: but it certainly doesn't look forcing - esp with the intervene|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S has chosen a sequence that wouldnt normally be taken to reflect an accurate perspective about relative suit lengths. but S luckily catches N with  a hand where she has to pass 4H|pg||

nt|athene: south thinking about six now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i imagine strong option...|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@C denies any spade control, then north must just sign off - i.e. not bid 4@D, because that would promise a spade control too as well as diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: south is wondering if 3@H is "pass or correct"|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|athene: this is a bit unwise perhaps|pg||
