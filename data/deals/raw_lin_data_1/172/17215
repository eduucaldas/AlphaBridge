nt|vugraphzzb: sorry having trouble finding the right boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: Sorry about that, have the right boards now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  1NT expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: The profile for our excellent viewgraph operator gives Denis Dobrin from Russia|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|jcwla: A quiet pass by E, would have a reasonable 1NT rebid after opening 1 of a minor.  Meanwhile, choice of openings perhaps for S, either @S or NT.  Likely @S with a small side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton.  Some like to have three of the other major to open 1NT with a five-card major; the thinking is that they can still land in the better fit if pd has five of the other ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: major.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also conceivable some E could 1@D and rebid 2@C over 1@S but that seems a bit much.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: contract is |pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: seems a normal slam-depends on how declarer guesses the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes DD 6@H is the spot|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is nasty--NS likely to make nine tricks on a spade lead--4@S a phantom |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well I have been led up the garden path again|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry had to get a mouse will get contract in a min|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sounds like the contract may be 3@S - obv not on a 3@S opening.|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: think it is|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@S will fail by one or two and EW will post the plus on this 20-20 hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for N to hold both minors and tries squeeze throw in , he wins|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can hardly be right..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: doubt if we have that bid right|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: shame I've never been to russia!|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: if he plays for either @d finesse or @c to be 3-3 he may fail|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thinking hard obviously|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep with 4 spades cold EW it seems, thanks for the undo there|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: sorry have lost the bidding though|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: 1D lead from N would help|pg||
nt|garnetts: Its OK final contract 2@S |pg||
pc|cK|nt|idc: Hi Tony and all|pg||
nt|garnetts: straight in and North probably should double --minimum and not wanting to bid 5@H |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|psridhar: this 6nt is not a long-suit slam, so N will be passive in his lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west bids 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well EW looking to go slaming..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..or perhaps the wrong hand...?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or an outrageous and spectacular NS auction|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: close run thing though...|pg||
nt|garnetts: when a spade is led it will pay south to duck |pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: director has been called|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: 2@D showed 5@S and 4@H according to the system|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcwla: In the famous words of Barry Crane, "God dealt you A-K so you wouldn't have a lead problem."|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here no other choice.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wilkinsona: ...but 6 spades may be tricky|pg||
nt|idc: we'll try to get you names as we can - starts of matches are often rushed|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..it looks to have handling probs, but the diamond ace is right..|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psridhar: when they bid slam on long suits it is often a 'tempo' game, so u make attacking leads|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: that is a no play slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzzp: the contract is really 6C|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not surprised-W suggested 6C enroute to 6N ...and E imagined his pd has a 5 bagger-lack of unnderstdg|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, hoped the original @C wasn't short, alas it was|pg||
nt|garnetts: You might make 4@H double dummy --more likely going at least one off|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and certainly dont want to ship any defensive tricks here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  North must have opened surely|pg||

nt|lestergold: north even led the right suit but.....|pg||
nt|lestergold: might get some back as not everyone will find this somewhat lucky 3n contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: where 4@s also makes if spades done right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its not reallyh biddable|pg||
nt|mamos:  Heart ruff  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: or @d ruff, sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: who would bid this at unfave vul not likely|pg||
nt|mamos:  maybe both and lots off|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: When I'm red I bid game, easy to get there :-P|pg||
nt|kemperg: how would you prevent 2 @S losers|pg||
nt|lestergold: when im red i do notm bidm game when pard has a min raise opp my 13 count|pg||
nt|lestergold: or here a sub minimum one|pg||
nt|tomi2: when I am red I need 10 tricks for a game and not x+y=z points|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: you also have a great singleton @c and a brilliant side suit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|dagold: I suspect many would overcall 2@c on west non-vul but few would vul|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jcwla: 1@H a @S bid and the double to show @H's - presumably higher level choices available to one or both sides.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not mind 1NT on the North hand --I think 2@C at red is too rich |pg||
nt|dagold: 2@h a transfer|pg||
nt|dagold: showing 6+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both EW rightly conclude bidding is dangerous--|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sad to admit, thik I would have tried 2 spades with East|pg||

nt|idc: I think 2@c is natural but alerted since game forcing|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there would be an overruff on the 3rd@s even if trumps were 2-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|idc: North does have some extras after 4@h, and at least they have managed to stop below six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: which has a chance|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  south trying to signal for a heart: declarer has to play him for stiff ace|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: west best to play ace and another trump it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: does not want to concede a ruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: is that not an assumed name you are using?|pg||
nt|lesniak: po angielsku to siê nazywa "selfconfidence"?|pg||

nt|dagold: On a heart switch that is|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  NI obviously have other ideas|pg||
nt|jkotor: oczywicie, ¿e w tym uk³adzie nawet ja bym nie przegra³, ale co jak trefle 5-2? lub kara nie dziel¹ siê|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psridhar: but they found the defense and beat it, so the leaders get ahead further|pg||
nt|idc: normally you'd say a 6-0 @c split was awful, but here it is a lot better than 5-1, when they might suffer a ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: enough undertricks as it is...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|greerm: one of the most exciting finishes to a CAmrose series, with 3 teams possible winners at this stage|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: So not all 11 counts are opened|pg||
mb|2H|nt|greerm: Wales can get 170 VPs by winning this match by 59 imps, whcih is quite achievable|pg||
mb|2S|nt|greerm: then Engalnd, currentl behind to WBU, would need 19 VP to equal that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pessimist!|pg||
nt|wendle: subject to bridgemate entry being correct, AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
nt|bg: on a good day 6 hearts would make but not here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Played by N double dummy perhaps|pg||
nt|bg: even double dummy in the trump suit looks short of entries to set up spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: when in six, the double dummy play allso seems to be your only shot at making it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|good hand|nt|greerm: and ROI, currently also behind to Scotland, would need 23 to go equal|pg||
nt|sharkey: In six have to solve @H - then probably @SAK then @D finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: but they'll end up in 4@H|pg||
nt|mamos:  even passed I hat overcall on such empty suit|pg||
nt|mamos:  hate|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm.... i think i prefer to show my ability to play in the other two suits with North|pg||
nt|lestergold: eg x|pg||
nt|mamos:  though stopped N bidding 1@h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N istead of dbl|pg||
nt|mamos:  I think so too x for me|pg||
nt|santyclz: Showing your age Mike, considering that x shows 2 suits...|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sharkey: S has 22 HCP and a 5 card M - a heavy 2 NT - unless conventional 22-23|pg||
nt|lestergold: south nopw could just about justify a reverese with such excellent shape and hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: do not agree with 3@d why not show more of her hand with 2@h|pg||
nt|santyclz: (That's what my pd's tell me anyway.)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|kemperg: 4crd @H enough for dbl|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: there are two suits|pg||
nt|mamos:  for me 1NT denies 4 cards @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: I aghree Mike!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south must agree because she has not bid her great hearts|pg||
nt|kemperg: so do I|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: first six for the defence?|pg||
nt|mamos:  this might not be a success|pg||
nt|mamos:  seven?|pg||
nt|lestergold: silly contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: not the first|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|greerm: england 28 imps down, Ireland 10 imps down, if I was welsh I would be very nervous :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzaj: ur right 7|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: cash clubs and switch 1d|pg||
nt|santyclz: Much as we hate it, we have to credit this to the 1@s overcall.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 1@s overcall minimum at unfave vul but normal its the 1N bid by North |pg||
nt|mamos:  Joe you know I was just thinking that  but North could have doubled ..........|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, the blame is in n for not x'ing but without the overcall it is moot.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Any safe play in trumps Bruce?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: hen it was more improtant to show her suits if pard is strong but notm fitting with hearts can always bid no trumps if necessary llater|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  That did not go well :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: And EW dropped a trick|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sort of mystifying why W didn't cash the @C tricks before, think would have been down.|pg||
nt|dagold: Tempting to respond 1N to keep the opponents out (or find hearts)|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe---North too busy?  |pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Sri Lanka have just tossed a wicket to Canada by contriving a run out|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  easy for us :)|pg||

pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: this may be a good slam.... to stay out of|pg||

pc|dK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double game swing board 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 2@H should carry preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: With a spade & club to lose, declarer may well take two heart finesses and go down|pg||
nt|chilloncan: personally i dont think it is obvious for N to seek 4H. one alternative would be 1N-3N. a compromise would be to bid 4S if S shows spades, and bid 3N otherwise|pg||
nt|idc: A club lead from West may have helped South avoid a loser in that suit, so this @d instead is better for the defence|pg||
nt|chilloncan: not sure...i think S can organize the play to put the defense in a bad spot|pg||
nt|idc: mind you, West may have problems finding a safe lead later|pg||
nt|chilloncan: exactly|pg||
nt|idc: say declarer wins in hand, @d to dummy & takes a @h finesse - tough for West|pg||
nt|chilloncan: normal play is to let the D ride around and then force out spade ace|pg||
nt|chilloncan: there are several options both early and late but i think S should eventually prevail|pg||
nt|idc: Yes, if the club finesse wins later on, he'll be looking to set up a pitch for the 3rd club, so avoiding a loser there|pg||
nt|idc: He doesn't know that the @c finesse won't win of course|pg||
pc|s3|nt|psridhar: but @s break shd help|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: In spite of slamy suggestions from a spec, WBU settle for game|pg||

mc|10|nt|psridhar: to recover 30 one needs about 5 swingy bds - assuming u judge 4 right and err on one....|pg||

mb|1C|nt|psridhar: we saw E open 2D on Bd 4 with much less, so it was easy guessing:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: They went off in 4@C on baord 3 for a swing to england--but it looks laydown to me |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: everything wrong for NS |pg||
nt|dagold: 5 imps to england on board 3. Denning did overcall 2@c but didn't take the heart hook and went down in 4@c|pg||
nt|idc: hhmm, yes, SOuth having the @s9 creates some worries|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the score shows board 3 as flat but..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we think they were -1 in this room..|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: board 3 was -1 in closed room|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at the moment the WBU are 28 up against England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so England will need to pick up 57 to score 29|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  this is assuming my maths and VP conversion is correct|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yorkbeach:  1@c is Precision style|pg||

nt|garnetts: Normal lead |pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a quick two off  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: quick?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think X = @c + @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: without that opening EW may well have overshot to slam and gone down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my thoughts also|pg||
nt|psridhar: With E undervaluing his @s queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Julian, it seems that it is the player names that are wrong - the right names for Irelad/WBU are in the Open room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Operator probably has not had time to set up here|pg||
nt|idc: 1 & 2 flat, 3 IMPs to N.I. on Bd 3|pg||
nt|chilloncan: it is dangerous but i like 3H better than 2H, esp if NS are playing support doubles. 3H puts the pressure on and increases chances of scoring a black queen (or two)) on defense|pg||

nt|idc: Here, the 2@h overcall has left N-S a lot of room (and convenient cue bids) to investigate|pg||

pc|s5|nt|cuttysark:  Bit of a lunge by East|pg||
nt|dagold: but perhaps it was lebensohl for them|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has shown values with the doubel so leaves it to partner |pg||
nt|dagold: it really shouldn't be leb here|pg||
nt|dagold: pass of 2@s showed a bad hand already|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and maybe not enough|pg||
nt|idc: yes, and continuing clubs not best - think they needed to cash tricks then get a 3rd round of diamonds from North maybe|pg||

nt|henryb:  North will be in deep trouble, and declarer can guess the spades, Mike|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: he has done|pg||
pc|h9|nt|psridhar: the problem in runnning the @h jack is N made a TAKE-OUT double of 1@h|pg||
nt|dagold: link through the ebu website|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  should be an overtrick now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psridhar: so, declarer's misguess is reasonable|pg||
nt|spil: 3@H going 1 off and NS making 3@D exactly so not much in it|pg||

nt|chilloncan: i wouldnt call it a "good stop" since both major games rate to make. they are almost surely worried they will LOSE imps|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|psridhar: that @s queen shift has created a major tenace for Declarer|pg||

nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|chilloncan: they will gain IMPs on 6, but not because they played a partial:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: tbf they are playing a strong club system so 1D 1S 2S is a weak way to raise 1S to 2S|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  23 was costly for Wales as expected|pg||

nt|chilloncan: i am SOOOOOO sorry Ian, i thought you said board SIX, my bad|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Wales need only 1 more IMP at the moment to move into 24-6 territory|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: bad heart break for NS here|pg||
nt|idc: I think N-S play 1M - 2M as a sound, full value raise to two (maybe 7-9 or so), hence the alert last hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  Deep Finesse, a double dummy analyst, would assume a @d lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  huge fit each way|pg||

nt|chilloncan: confess that at these colours i would surely open 1S as E in 3rd seat|pg||

pc|dK|nt|psridhar: that 3@h was unwarranted in my opinion|pg||
nt|psridhar: Liu made a take out X, his pd passed 2@s he had no reason to overrule that|pg||
nt|idc: on a bad day you could lose 3@d, a @c and a @s|pg||
nt|chilloncan: E had tough lead. can make a case for eevery suit. perhaps when that is so, trump is best idea|pg||
nt|idc: now draw trumps and ... perhaps try to set up a @c for a @d pitch|pg||
nt|chilloncan: the idea is this: should i lead a trump or not? if i don't i have to decide which sidesuit to lead and i will only be right about once in three times. if it is right toi lead a ...|pg||

nt|lestergold: while the opps chalk up the imps...|pg||

nt|dagold: good result for Wales|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually on that hand the @d lead was especially marked because south also held likely double stop in clubs sp he kn ew declarer was likely tobe under pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: perhaps a trump lead might have rendered the play a little more tricky (in 4) |pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: this looks a well judged contact by NS|pg||

nt|lestergold: with this right sided i dont think it can fail as north is never in to lead a club thru|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: wait a minute it can|pg||
nt|idc: I used to play with a much older player, though still a very good one, you usually said..|pg||
nt|idc: when his partner led a trump, "do you have a licence to do that partner?"|pg||
nt|idc: You quickly learned only to do it when right (i like to pretend I did at least)|pg||
nt|idc: West doubling to suggest a lead of dummy's first bif suit|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|wilkinsona: ..so relieved to here 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry cant discard two losers on one long @d|pg||
nt|idc: because declarer is likely to be taking a @c finesse into the danger East hand, he won't want to rise with @sA at trick one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|idc: I wondered if West might consider a switch to a low @h at trick 2, but North's bidding should incline him to an honour|pg||
nt|idc: since North will be short in majors|pg||
nt|bambik: i jeszcze trzeba trafic pika |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho isnt soth endplayable?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|garnetts: Like the q@H now and then the ace of trumps --that should ensure enough tricks|pg||
nt|idc: Scary hand for Gary Jones to play, but no realistic alternative to @c finesse I think|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|spil: well if W goes slamming the @H is winning (Hurray) ... but the trumps are disappointing (:()|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|psridhar: we can see all cards-win ace, king and jack of @h =11 tricks, but that is double dummy. more normal is to take the failing @h finesse|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|jcwla: Back - and I'm sure Scotland will have no trouble matching the contract.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  26 HCP should reach game|pg||
mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: north finds the double...|pg||
nt|idc: Swings in both directions on Bds 9-12, but Welsh lead beginning to grow to decent size|pg||
mb|3H|nt|wilkinsona: surprised south didnt bid 4 spades... will it work?|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I think 4@H is -1|pg||
nt|henryb:  takes a @c lead to beat 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: A potential gain for Wales here - 6@c doesn't need a commentator to point out its flaws|pg||
nt|snetram: nie bêdzie ³atwo |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wyladuj¹ w kierach tak na oko|pg||
mb|3S|nt|idc: South too strong for 1NT but CC suggests a 1@d opening is possible with their methods|pg||
nt|dagold: I play this double as t/o |pg||
nt|idc: so I won't|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: identical auctions in both rooms to end a marathon like match a loong one|pg||
nt|chilloncan: sorry for truancy, problem in kitchen|pg||
nt|wendle: As it stands (unofficial) Wales 164; England 160; Ireland 158; Scotland 156; WBU 152; NI 108. Next update at start of Stanza 2|pg||
nt|idc: The 2@c raise was inverted, promising 10+ points|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psridhar: with trumps 3-3 this shd make in comfort|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Needs to finesse diamonds - would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will not be too excited about his @d hloding opp tyhe spliter|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: trefle ju¿ nie bêd¹ do licytacji jako kolor|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: spec says JM has to play this very well|pg||
nt|dagold: and give up on the high card double|pg||
nt|dburn: takeout of what?|pg||
nt|dagold: higher ranking suits|pg||
nt|dagold: maybe 4432|pg||
nt|lestergold: calls for an attack in the unbid suit indeed he has|pg||
nt|lestergold: but this holds it to 4 only|pg||
mb|4C|nt|garnetts: This is now foolproof too |pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  England are closing the gap on the WBU but only slightly|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p!|nt|cuttysark:  The Scottish west also led a heart. Yeugh!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 12 tricks is a lot though|pg||
nt|dagold: 1h-1n-p-p- double=spades|pg||
nt|chilloncan: curious that S did not pass the double at these colors|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dagold: higher ranking suits being the emphasis|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N expects short @h in dummy, hence the trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: thx and bye all |pg||
mb|5C|nt|henryb:  I do not like splintering with three small in the side suit|pg||
nt|lesniak: witajcie|pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: not sure why N didn't bid 4@D|pg||
nt|dagold: the strong balanced hand is rare and partner tends to be broke|pg||
nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS: Wales 169; Eng 162; Ire 161; Scot 153; WBU 150; NI 103|pg||
mb|5S|nt|spil: not sure what 5@H is...|pg||
nt|lestergold: lot of debate about when it is right to lead from unsupported K against suit games|pg||
mb|p|nt|snetram: blok pikami pokazuje, ¿e aktywnoæ w licytacji pop³aca|pg||
mb|6D|nt|ryskiel_: dobrze by³o tez zrekontrowaæ 3 karo i utrzymac - +1 za chyba 840|pg||
nt|snetram: A + 2 króle - grozi szlemem w kiery|pg||
nt|lesniak: czy moze lepiej zagrac 7 trefli?|pg||
mb|p|nt|snetram: Po otwarciu 1@D by³oby nawet trudniej znale¿æ trefle|pg||
nt|bambik: 6 kier tez idzie bo sa trzy trefle przy 4 kierach|pg||
nt|snetram: na pewno lepiej, ale trefle siê nie pojawi³y w licytacji|pg||
nt|lesniak: jedyne zaskakujace 3 kier Narkiewicza po kontrza na 3 karo- moze to jakies specjalne ustalenie|pg||
nt|snetram: 3@H Burasa|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywisci 6 ba tez idzie|pg||
nt|lesniak: 3kier burasa|pg||
mb|6N|nt|lestergold: I think yhere was clearcut |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: South settles for 3NT, though perhaps 2 sdades doubled occured to him...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not N's finest hour here and 11 big ones to Wales.|pg||
nt|snetram: tak to jest odzywka nienaturalna. Odruchem jest pas|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: He may be wishing he had now, needs to fid @sQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark:  he did not find the spade switch either - might put delclarer off the heart finessse|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark:  Has been pointed out that ducking a heart will get a complete picture of the distribution|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Or maybe not quite complete, but a clear indication to finesse|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: najlepiej zrobi puszczaj¹c pierwsze karo|pg||
nt|snetram: powinien pobiæ karo królem, a nie dam¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: powinien pusci bo inaczej...|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: z licytacji ca³y mariasz jest u E, ale nawet jeli zabije drugie asem, to automatycznie wygra na przymusie karowo kierowym|pg||
nt|snetram: rozgrywaj¹cy musi zgraæ karo do waleta przed sprawdzeniem kierów|pg||

nt|vugraphzzb: no thought it was asking in @C|pg||
nt|dagold: my double has the same meaing whatever I open which is easy on the memory!|pg||
nt|henryb:  slow going at the other table|pg||
nt|chilloncan: S ought to have been thinking that if W had heart queen 3N could easily fail, and if H queen is with E then that increases size of penalty |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  am I right that one table has finished in England WBU?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wendle: AS IT STANDS Wales 170; Ire 161; Eng 161 Scot 153; WBU 151; NI 102|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: so thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@C can make --but very agressive |pg||
nt|dagold: probably the same auction here|pg||
nt|idc: And when South didn't pass the dbl at those colours, perhaps North could have read him for unblanced hand, and corrected to safer 5@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|chilloncan: good idea but i prefer 4C, keeping slam in the picture|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|wilkinsona: nobody bidding clubs yet|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NI have a good result to come on 32|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I do not like 2@H--prefer 3@C by a lot |pg||
nt|dagold: same result likely |pg||
mb|2D|nt|spil: seems to have made the wrong response if asking in @C ... but moving sharply along :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 4@C a cuebid for @H's - not a new place for us to play after N has opened 2@C and shown primary @H's.|pg||
nt|dburn: fortunately for the defenders, South's diamonds are better than his clubs|pg||
nt|idc: E-W mounting quite a barrage here|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: lewê mu pucili|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Thanks to our operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: sorry board 16 too, Im a bit early|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, consevative 2 spade bid works for WBU|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems you can start with a double|pg||
nt|garnetts: if North leads a heart this will not make |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  But then you might lose a major suit  fit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not like double either strikes me that 3@C and then 4@H if thats what I need to bid get this hand over |pg||
nt|spil: absolutely...3@S may be natural but the 4 level should be a cue|pg||
nt|dagold: Wales need to get this right|pg||
nt|dagold: yes, rather random|pg||
nt|chilloncan: at these colours there is much to be said for a 4D overcall instead of 3D. that totally obliterates their bidding space and they may easily miss a slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS finding @s fit now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wendle: open room of match 5c will remain open to announce official result (also on www.camrose-bridge-wales.org.uk)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: the inevitable|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  how about @SK lead :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it gets the hand over|pg||
nt|garnetts: that works too and so does a club |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  So 6 cards beat it and 7 let it make |pg||
nt|garnetts: anything but a Johannisburg sparkler |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  curious decision to leave in X|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: weak NT opg is popular inn this part of the world|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 3 suits to beat it, one to let it make|pg||
nt|garnetts: might not get the clubs right |pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Oh well, opportunity knocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N no problem but 4@s may not be so easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Byrne must have been warned here that the support wasonly 3 cards|pg||
nt|idc: should be -3 though, so no big gain for Irish|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could be 3 off with perfect defence|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: leads wrong major a chance|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chilloncan: well, it is a barrage of sorts, but i think 4D is the pressure call|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ryskiel_: brrrrrrr|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idc: This reminds me of Board 5 - slam is a good contract, cards lie badly, and WBU avoid it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: as confession time, I am afraid I would have found the 3 spade  bid Sime did in the or|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: interesting hedre that south had a choice of leading frm either unbid suit and here the lead from the K may not have been optimal|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d ruff coming|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psridhar: will take @C finesse and go 2 off|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: and this hand looks like being a big result for WBU|pg||
nt|idc: Given East found an agressive raise to 5 level (which I like) maybe West worried that he go too high after a 4@d preempt by him|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: lead from unsupported homoyrs in general from K i think is the riskiest of all|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was a good trade her a @d loser being riffed from the long truimp holding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect connection problem rather than huge think by S|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: no long think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: a very good deal for declarer|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  reverse count in @d|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  trump exit best|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is going to have to break the @h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: stiff ace in NT contracts is not as valuable as other aces are-cannot hold up ! here if only declarer could have held up @h 2 rounds...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cannot believe North is really thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: yes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or mayb thinking about next trick|pg||

pc|d9|nt|wilkinsona: but with Scotland off in 3N why worry?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chilloncan: maybe, but 5D is the normal level to raise a preempt to. it takes out 4N and leaves 5 lvel open to opps, so it is the perfect plateau|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  10 Q K duck|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|henryb:  No hidden warriors in the belly of the horse|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry henry it was a scottish gift|pg||
nt|idc: Scotland lead v Ireland only 5 now, but WBU 39 ahead of England|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: brrrr Auguri jedzie na pe³ny regulator dwa zajazdy dwa zyski|pg||
mb|p|nt|spil: *trump break|pg||
nt|dagold: on a club lead, south tried to give north a promotion rather than playing for his own ruff in diamonds|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  last board - thanks everyone for watching|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: probably a flat board anyway|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now I see NO merir in this VUL opening|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: merit|pg||
nt|psridhar: bidding here doesnt seem consistent with cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: West  got a bit carried away next door |pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: Last board, so looks like a good win for WBU|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope there is an adequate supply of daffodill champagne :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|idc: A good comeback from WBU after they were 24-0 down early in the set|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a bid of interest from south|pg||
nt|idc: this is only approaching the half-way point of course, 2nd half begins in 30 mins|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  not sure i like east's double - more than half his points in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also like a bid here like 1NT  to get things stirred up--been known to try 2@H too |pg||
nt|henryb:  would you respond to 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: That's when it's time to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up - or if you're Ireland go straight to Monte Carlo.|pg||
nt|dburn: that won't happen on this bidding - if North leads a club, of course|pg||
nt|dagold: the 3@d bid is likely to make the defence easy if Goodman leads a club|pg||
nt|chilloncan: great result for wales vs endgland|pg||
nt|chilloncan: england LOL|pg||
nt|chilloncan: freudian slip?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wilkinsona: If this is a single suited major, trouble on its way..|pg||
nt|idc: IMHO, the 2@d bid shows 2 things:|pg||
nt|idc: spades and another suit|pg||
nt|idc: and that South has forgotten they aren't playing matchpoints :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, if they can get to 3 clubs, not so bad..|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the vulnerability is favourable but I still don't like the overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, this is the last board here.  Big thanks to Denis, to BBO's great and tireless Roland Wald, and to Stephen Peterkin and Liz McGowan.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: So thanks to all in Wales|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: double stirred thing up too it seems|pg||
nt|garnetts: dbl is a poor bid might as well pass or bid 1NT --if you must|pg||
nt|idc: I love it!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|idc: I guess 3@c is -3 probably?   as long as the defence lead trumps to prevent 2 spade ruffs in North|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and to specs for their comments|pg||
nt|spil: I guess trump promotion available here...|pg||
nt|jcwla: My thanks also to Michael Rosenberg for his analytic comments (and corrections), much appreciated.|pg||
nt|spil: A@S K@S A@C and spade through to give W a trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: When South removes the dbl of 2@d to 2@s, North knows the second suit is clubs|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: seems likely|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 4 card drury i suppose|pg||
nt|idc: Start a new craze - how about Germ many|pg||
nt|vugraphzzb: might just be an UCB?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: N having bid his hand bids again|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H is not my idea of a bid on Jxxx--why not 5@D  --perhaps he plays the cards better |pg||
nt|dburn: and after 4@h, I guess he might lead one|pg||
nt|dagold: 4@h may have been 'last train'|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yep. may have though 5 diamonds as encouraging|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  May have thought it was the least encouraging noise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  now has to take a good view in hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: he did|pg||
nt|dagold: so this should go down|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think so because on most rebids i can bidm clubs to play and i do not mind 2 spades contract as i have ruffing vlaue and bullet|pg||
nt|chilloncan: yes sorry didnt see the opening bod, too busy thinking up puns|pg||
nt|idc: 1NT down 3 by Wales in Open room not good, but looks like 10 tricks there in @s for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chilloncan: another freudian slip|pg||
nt|idc: not that will get to game of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: ³atwiej by siê rozgrywa³o 6 trefli ni¿ 3 BA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|idc: At this vulnerabilty, East will be thinking of the vul game bonus|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I dont think these situations are easy|pg||
nt|idc: trouble is, he worries about no club stop|pg||
nt|idc: I think he has to dbl - game may not be on for E-W or if it is, they may get 500 which is a decent consolation|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but maybe the inference is west would hardly x if not happy to defend|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hope you will be with us later.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|psridhar: N was trying to suggest a save, didnt know how , gave up in the end|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be more afraid of partner's strong rebids propelling us too high than his weak rebids|pg||
nt|lestergold: weid also be afraid of missing a game when pard has a maxi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will need @S lead + ruff to beat 6@c|pg||
nt|bambik: teraz juz latwiej|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'd be afraid of getting much too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: id also be reluctasnt to let oppd find ared suit comntract as well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: so well judged, and not easy|pg||
nt|idc: They can cash a diamond or two, then I expect a trump switch is needed|pg||
nt|garnetts: haven't got a lot of sympathy --there are two entries vai a club ruff|pg||
nt|chilloncan: most would double initially with N hand i think|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|idc: hmm, maybe 2 rounds of diamonds would be too much, leaves a ruffing entry to South hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: anyway, the auction screamed for a trump lead, and Walker was listening|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: undo|pg||
nt|garnetts: if he gets off play with a diamond--should  east get the hearts right?  |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: think so|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Ace of spades beats it if hook is on|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Well he could hardly lead a spade away from his ace...|pg||
nt|garnetts: It depends if East thinks North knows the heart position|pg||
nt|kamyk: opcja "pod mocny stó³" przewa¿y³a nad "w nielicytowany"|pg||

nt|garnetts: I mean Liz--he could cash the ace of spades and ace of clubs if South had Qxx|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: I think the club intermnediates swing the balance for me its not likely to be a disaster p-laying as high level club contract|pg||
