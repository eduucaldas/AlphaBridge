mb|p|nt|athene: people often push the upper limit for 1nt overcall over 1@H|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 5-8 HCP, @H or @S  --  no strong options|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the reason is they don't want to double and have to rebid 2nt facing a possible zero|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but you can easily miss games doing this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: systemically 1N was 15-17|pg||

pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: why?   Burgess has only confirmed 13 cards|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but that would be a bit wild since south can't have much to pass 2@H and will usually have a lot less than he has|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Bobby gave X a couple seconds of thought|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finally  a long @C suit is running|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: do you think South is in lebensohl situation where 3@D showed some values?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if south happens to have nothing, 3nt is getting doubled and so is 4@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would think 2N is scramble rather than lebensohl|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|athene: you might argue that with some values, south must do something over 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: unless he has a penalty pass of course, but he hasn't got that|pg||
nt|athene: so when he passes and then pulls the double, he is showing a pretty weak hand|pg||
nt|athene: of course there will be times when you would like leb to be on in these situations|pg||

nt|ahollan1: spies will get us an update on the Hans-Brown match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: using Rule of 11 -- seems the only time it would be right to continue @HJ is when partner started with @HA10843  and event then   partner must duck and South must regain the lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: always double to cater for the penalty pass, if you can do it without cost|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe DBL risks  4@H/@S from Richman -- which exposes @CKJx on opening lead|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm well you have a pretty good hand|pg||
nt|athene: if partner jumps to 4major you expect to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i was thinking before it was outlawed   some might downgrade West to a mere 1N opener|pg||

nt|athene: he is hoping for a major suit squeeze now|pg||
nt|athene: but two rounds of spades from north would break that up even if it were there at all|pg||
nt|athene: i mean he has 8 tricks with the spade finesse if he sets up the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for defense to err?|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs one more and the only hope is that north gets squeezed|pg||
nt|athene: he might be thinking about possibilities such as keeping the long heart|pg||
nt|athene: and finessing spade then played three  rounds of hearts to endplay north and simultaneously set up his long heart|pg||
nt|athene: *then playing|pg||
nt|athene: but that can't really work because north would surely have a third spade to cash so would make spade, heart, and @DK|pg||
nt|athene: you have to pitch a heart here and then just play a diamond and hope something good happens|pg||
nt|athene: but it can't ever work legitimately, on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and griffiths still needs to pitch something here|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. spade shift|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he has to decide which line he is going ofr|pg||
nt|athene: for|pg||
nt|athene: he either throws a diamond (if going for the throw in) or a heart (if going for the diamond establishment and squeeze)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)   instead of ofr    off|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Needs to hope Stephen to have the @H5 and insert it probably, in which case he can retain communication to his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in that case, courtney may just place @SJ in south  and shift to @SK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been non-force  [is that so bad?]  2@C game force   so  i guess 2@S or the mysterious 3@H|pg||
