nt|serhat: well he has enough for splinter for me.. what ever their method's is|pg||
nt|chilloncan: in fact, once S shows extras via 3H, i think he can backpedal a bit. with 3 aces he obviously should bid 4D, but over 4H i think 4S is enough in the context he has already created|pg||

mb|2S|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: but we can see @hKJ|pg||

nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|ianmcc: +1 and 3 to go|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|mb|3D|nt|athene: in the old days people had things called "biddable suits" so south would bid 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: then people realised, it's good to bid weak suits, because then opps don't lead them when you end up in notrumps|pg||
nt|chilloncan: and then people realized "oh yes we can|pg||
nt|athene: yes especially when they win the first heart and see dummy's "spades" :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: He might not lead S|pg||
nt|athene: 150|pg||
nt|mwigor: 120|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: except that 4@D all pass looks very reasonable|pg||
nt|serhat: if both minors dont break 3-3 then you need an extra trick before it is too late|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unless S can open 3N|pg||
nt|ianmcc: A big pre-empt here would be bad|pg||
nt|athene: if south opens a pusillanimous 3@D, then west will bid 3nt, i suppose|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|chilloncan: none so feckless as to oen 3D in Trials final, surely|pg||
nt|athene: well, some play 4@D shows a good spade hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: from the result shown the lead should stay at 2|pg||
nt|chilloncan: then they would open 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in OZ  3@D opening would have 2 less @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: in the other room west let declarer get a heart pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but it didn't make any difference|pg||

mb|1C|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ianmcc: I think these long matches should be played until result "conclusive", say 20|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|an|alerted|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@H not so bad for EW but down on a club lead i suppose - south splits his honours and gets a ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: interesting hand 4H will make ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S promises 4|pg||
nt|mwigor: danger now is 5@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|serhat: dbl?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: i prefer 2C with W hand. pd didnt overcall so they are likely to have spade fit and thus can probably outbid you. if od has anything there will be Ds in his hand and that is not ...|pg||
nt|chilloncan: bullish for game. so bid your long suit|pg||
nt|athene: ok, 3 back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: no 3 more to hans|pg||

nt|mwigor: still down i think|pg||
nt|babs59: Bill, how can you say it's all Hans when they are 2 IMPs apart?  what about the 172 IMPs that Courtney scored?|pg||

nt|andy_h: Spec points out that if Team Hans hold on here Nabil will overtake Gosney's record as the youngest ever Australian Open Team Representative at age 19 (Gosney was 21)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll   5 imp spread  but it is really this hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: well, hans can't lose on this board|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i thought Nabil turned 20 earlier this year|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: more likely another pickup the way they bid|pg||
nt|babs59: Nabil is still 17 isn't he|pg||
nt|babs59: I mean he's 18, turning 19|pg||
nt|babs59: 19 in May|pg||
nt|serhat: I think they will bid the slam now. Congrats to Hans team.. and very well done to 4men Courtney team..|pg||
nt|mwigor: they may bid 7 now|pg||
nt|babs59: it gets confusing because Adam Edgtton is 20 :)|pg||
nt|serhat: if no miracle last hand was a last chance for Courtney|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st/2nd seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|serhat: dbled 4s would bring them a victory|pg||
nt|chilloncan: 7 could go down on 8 of D lead|pg||
nt|chilloncan: unlikely but not impossible|pg||
nt|athene: refuse finesse - what, play for @HQJx?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: not enough other tricks|pg||
nt|serhat: 7 is on a finese isnt it?|pg||
nt|mwigor: i dont see what declarer's other chance is?|pg||
nt|chilloncan: clubs 33 and hearts QJx|pg||
nt|mwigor: not enough bill you need to find pitches for 3@d and a @c|pg||
nt|mwigor: ok|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw @C, ruff @C good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dare i ask -- is 1N going to make it TOUGHER to get to ANY slam?|pg||
nt|athene: but that is too thin|pg||
nt|mwigor: surely you just take the finesse|pg||
nt|serhat: for that also spade 2-2 needed.. what a 7|pg||
nt|chilloncan: pitch one club on heart then ruff out clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|athene: you just close your eyes and say "small please"|pg||
nt|serhat: poor Nabil.. he doesnt know 6s is good enough!:)|pg||
nt|chilloncan: much lower percent than finess of course but on 8 of diamonds lead N might assume no D king with E, as it is not as though E is leading thru the NT bidder|pg||
nt|athene: a spec points out you are a bit short of entries to north anyway for that|pg||
nt|mwigor: you cant even make playing for QJx of @h and 3-3 clubs not enough entries|pg||
nt|ianmcc: you could shut your eyes and bid 6@s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: i don't know if they play same conventions over the mini-NT as over strong NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|serhat: you can Micheal with spade finese|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot on Ian !!|pg||
nt|ianmcc: gotcha|pg||
nt|serhat: !:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he did! well maybe he shut his eyes and bid 7@S, but missed it and bid 6 instead|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find the right bid with closed eyes|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mwigor: finessing the @s8 gives you two entries to dummy - i believe you need 3 to do everything|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, @S2 a bit small|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
