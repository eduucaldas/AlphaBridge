nt|ady: easy game missed in CR for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: Blandat (Mixed in English) is kicking back, just 2 imps from its handicap|pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 17 so far (7 carryover and 10 more in the segment)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|kmb24: only 3 of the 15 boards this segment were played in partscore at both tables!|pg||
nt|kmb24: 1n overcall in the other room was a little weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: This event has a very nice trophy at the entrance of the main chilean Bridge Club where you can eventually print your team name if you win :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|espooz: standard 1nt here|pg||
nt|kmb24: especially with double so close to describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: finally, a makeable contract :)|pg||
nt|friggi: yes that is a bid odd to see that:)|pg||
nt|brobles: Slam is agressive but easily makes on this layout|pg||
nt|brobles: Yes, very odd|pg||
nt|kmb24: i think rafa should bid 1nt over 1s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: only 12 cards on E on board 17, so they play 18 now|pg||
nt|brobles: Yeah, partner could have enough values for game on this auction|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|kmb24: for sure, not to mention 1s could be a silly contract with 1nt cold|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
mc|9|nt|friggi: I dont like the lead|pg||
nt|friggi: 4@H is a far better contract then 3NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzwd: East is very annoyed with himself after not playing K of @S|pg||
nt|brobles: Welcome all back to the 2nd and last segment of the Final Stage of the Chilean 2011 Gold Cup. |pg||
mb|3C|an|d√©bil|nt|friggi: he should be:) why would S duck the King?|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: another partscore |pg||
nt|brobles: Caracci team leading by 16 imps going into the last 16 boards|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  2@S|pg||
nt|brobles: This event has been played in Santiago, Chile for many years (since before I existed at least)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brobles: West not really believing this auction|pg||
nt|Rafa: hubo un error en la sala|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brobles: Hi all and welcome to the final of the Gold Cup, live from Santiago, Chile.|pg||
mc|12|nt|barbyh: 4 card majors are not alive and well in the us|pg||
nt|friggi: no but they are in Sweden|pg||

nt|kmb24: especially if south's hand is a normal super accept for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brobles: NS aiming for normal 10 tricks (maybe 11 if hearts are untouched) in no trumps|pg||
nt|kmb24: fortunate make in 3n here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: seems like this session has had a lot of flatish partscore hands, not very exciting|pg||
mb|p|nt|kmb24: i don't really get the double|pg||
nt|brobles: odd double if it's meant for penalty|pg||
nt|kmb24: whatever double means, he surely doesn't have that!|pg||
nt|kmb24: i'm betting on plaut bidding 3N, since he always bids 3n.|pg||
nt|kmb24: but i would pass the double|pg||
nt|brobles: so far has worked out fine|pg||
nt|brobles: me too, I'm really happy if partner doubles 2@s and I have North's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: hi all|pg||
nt|kmb24: hi tez|pg||
nt|brobles: But this double with 9xx and support for @d is out of the book|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|friggi: you are very right Cornelia|pg||
nt|friggi: not the best lead|pg||
nt|barbyh: dont think it much matters 4 on any lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brobles: Paca must be like: THANK YOU PARTNER|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: n/s unable to keep in the bidding   have 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|kmb24: i'm a big fan of bidding 1@h on the south cards|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|friggi: decl is forced to take the Ace|pg||
nt|friggi: could be|pg||
nt|kmb24: good lead though|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: after this  honours on N easy to drop @cK|pg||
nt|brobles: me too, if you're not worth a game forcing it's better to always look for your major fit|pg||
nt|kmb24: now the defense knows a little more... this time doesn't make any difference|pg||
nt|tez: if hand is weak first majors|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: e/w  may make 10 here  and possibly 11 dropping K@C|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: but know decl has not problems|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brobles: with this lead declarer is likely to take 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|friggi: now|pg||
nt|kmb24: and paca correctly judged that his side's best fit was in clubs|pg||
