nt|psridhar: both tables engaged in 3rd seat opgs but NS hv 2 much strength to miss their game|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|psridhar: 2@c on 20 hcp is not my style-puts 2 much pressure on pd if he has no gr8 fit but say 6-8 hcp|pg||

nt|psridhar: that 2@h may be a trf advance to @s|pg||
nt|dslee: now souren does not have a role play|pg||
nt|psridhar: he has undisclosed @C support|pg||
nt|psridhar: gud chance for 6@C|pg||

nt|psridhar: (1@D)- X-(p)-2@S-(p)-3@c-(p)-4@c wd hv set it up nicely|pg||
nt|dslee: I can surely imagine that souren is in a two way thought, whether to pass or whether to disclose the @c support now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: that would be my style too P, 20 is too much for a simple overcall, in my opinion, souren would pass now|pg||
