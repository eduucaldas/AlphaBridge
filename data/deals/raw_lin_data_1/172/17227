nt|ahollan1: 1@C=forcing  usually 14+ hcp   could be 2@C balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|an|0-11, 4+!h|nt|kiwibridge: does he have a weak 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-2@H = 5+@H Game Force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if that's what you were asking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think fantunes 1@D has max of 9 HCP|pg||
nt|mrdct: there was a 1@h overcall in the other room which chnaged the context of the auction somewhat for south|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: maybe  9 max unbal  but could be 11 bal|pg||
nt|ritong: east might be disappointed if they go to 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct: with east having concealed his @h suit, there is danger now for NS if south choses to rebid his @h suit|pg||
nt|ritong: danger?|pg||
mb|1N|an|18-20|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=18-20|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|babs59: some call me conservative with my overcalls|pg||
nt|mrdct: and with west now know to be short in @d, the odds clearly favour east holding 3 @s |pg||
nt|peachy: If they play sup X on the three leve, but I think u right Dave|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: says Bergen 10-11 on CC|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: lol pinpointed the @C suit and now no problem|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: definitely no 3@D by E|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 3 back for the guess|pg||
nt|ritong: can t miss|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: ;)|pg||
nt|ritong: @h are 4/3 and trumps 2/2|pg||
nt|ritong: so even if, bizarrely, he plays @c 6 for a falsecard, will land on his feet|pg||
nt|henryb:  no guess: opening lead can't be from Q6|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D = 4+, (10)11+|pg||
nt|mrdct: this might've played a bit better in @h, but north probably a bit too good for a weak jump|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: canape response maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: canape, perhaps|pg||
nt|peachy: if S evalueted his hand not GF, then he cant 2C|pg||
nt|ianmcc: spade lead might sink this?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: retransfer|pg||
nt|peachy: Ans also, suit not good enough to insist on hearts via 2@H|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: IMO 2@D isa mor correct bidthan 3@C - butthey'll still end in game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superaccept -- there's a topic where you will get no agreement|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: impossible for nye to stop|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 10 count opposite superaccept at teams|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct: he usually is|pg||
nt|peachy: Ish certainly is|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: some play only 1, some always if 4 support, some will superaccept with 3, others will show shortness/source of tricks ....|pg||
nt|mrdct: 11 tricks is going to be a lot harder than 9|pg||

pc|sT|nt|kiwibridge: wasted pips in @C's|pg||

nt|mrdct: apart from the 4@s game they were preempted out of|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: i have to admit Andrew -- 2@D never came into my mind -- i'd pass before 2@D  and i'd never pass|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 2@D very old-shioned false prfernce - too weak for 3@C but 2@C still forcing|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s2|pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kiwibridge: yes a superb effort, led the final for a long while also|pg||
nt|mrdct: he would've only had a couple of days back home to recouperate before these trials|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mrdct: it takes a good 26-30 hours to travel from Louisville to Sydney|pg||

nt|pelepele: no thanks|pg||

mb|3D|nt|peachy: Hugh will surely give it the best effort in the odds|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugrapha3: North is limited by his failure to open a 2-suiter|pg||
