mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: South is Tom Bessis  [the younger]|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dror Padon, Israel, and Thomas Bessis, France|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Tulin playing 4@H West|pg||
nt|kareno: Nine tricks unless the defense cashes.  I suspect east will prefer to hearts.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond guess for 3nt n/s|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bagman: Padon can visualize short hearts opposite so invites with 4@D to go on over 4@H (I think)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helness 3N North|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  S might well have raised to 3N...or at least pass 2N ....with diamonds as good as KJxxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  Jx looks like a potentially useful tidbit in spades also|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi:  at IMPs, yes. at BAM, maybe pass 2N|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|kareno: Well, spades will go on heart and the lucky jack of clubs.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kareno: Declarer will no doubt get diamonds right playing into the safe hand.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must re-iterate  ANY difference in score is win or loss   10 or 1400 = same 1 board|pg||
nt|kareno: and It is board-a-match.  the scoring is by boards won, lost or tied. For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team and those are the only ...|pg||
nt|kareno: results ...  1 for a win, 1/2 for a tie and 0 for a loss|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|bagman: Bessis with short diamonds with AK on top and lots of side losers rather tries for 4 tricks|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|algraves:  so it is important not to completely lose it at your table. You want to keep your partners in the game so to speak. Other than that it is matchpoints|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|algraves:  very good game , board a match|pg||
nt|algraves:  some say the toughest|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|algraves:  it will be naturaly to play the diamonds correctly of course|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|algraves:  and with the club Q droping ten tricks are possible|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the board will be determined on teh over trick|pg||
pc|dT|nt|algraves:  the alternative play is play west for Sapde Q|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|algraves:  I am told they are in 3D in the other room so the board here was won in the bidding|pg||

nt|kareno: Kit :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Assael playing 3@H West|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi:  hi kit & a beltaed hi to karen and al & specs:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  belated|pg||
nt|kareno: Marshall :)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG  a) 4+@C  b) BAL|pg||
nt|kareno: Slam can make but unllikely to be bid.|pg||
nt|kareno: And always a pleasure to have Al, our system maven, with us @h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: A good Roland slam here requiring diamonds and spades to behave|pg||
nt|kareno: Only needs club jack onside :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  some would open 4@H - but too strong for me|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops. that is wrong.  Needs way more than that.|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S might lead a low diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  N hand not a thing of beauty, but team is trailing and anyway AR has maximally positive lifetime light-opener karma|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same auction  same lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: @D lead more likely at IMPs   at BAM, underlead of Ace much less likely|pg||
nt|bagman: Not any more as Versace decides to protect the @DK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler in 4@H|pg||
nt|bagman: Lauria probably denied minor suit controls|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: So here they are in 6nt which will fetch.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|kareno: Actually becomes a black suit show-up squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu:  now a squeeze against @SQ and @CK on the same hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer probably plays for some kind of black suit squeeze; might end up in show-up squeeze situation|pg||
nt|kareno: He probably needs to cash club ace, Vienna coup|pg||
nt|bagman: The easiest play is to win next trick and cash @CA (Vienna Coup), @SA and then run the hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We have voice now|pg||
nt|bagman: Then declarer needs to decide in the end what to play for|pg||
nt|kareno: gmta Pekka :)|pg||
nt|bagman: finesse or squeeze|pg||
nt|kareno: It is a perfectly normal opening far as I can see.  Not light.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|marlowepi:  the 2H overcall with that shape, mediocre suit & poor holding in opener's suit is likewise not a joy forever, but yuh gotta do wot yuh gotta do|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming North continues spades, which seems pretty automatic, this is slated for down 1.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes it counts to 13 HCP, but has 8 Losing Trick Count and a poor primary suit. we might all open, but it is still dreck:)|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, now going down 2 on the trump promotion|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nice play by Robson (club K) to make sure pard knows to go up Q clubs and cash spade|pg||
nt|kit: no, not true -- can pitch club on fourth spade|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond now produces the trump promotion with spade, spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: It is a loser then.|pg||
nt|kit: However, what if North leads a club!  now declarer has to take the diamond play, and then promotion will be there.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kit: so if they find the defense, Nunes will be punished for not just drawing trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: Don't forget to cash the diamond.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|nt|kareno: Diamond now has the same outcome.  three more tricks.  Or four if declarer ruffs low|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|nt|kit: But North failed to find the club shift, so will be down 1.|pg||
nt|kareno: That was the best Nunes could do.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: oh right -- North could have pitched both clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that's right.  North blew it for the second undertrick.|pg||
nt|kit: Surprising slip by North -- at the point South cashes 10 of spades, North should know whole hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: south never played, west showed his hand|pg||

nt|kareno: It is an indication of how hard this event is that both north players were tired enough to miss the club pitches.  |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  disciplines non-preempt by E, poorish suit & fauir cards in majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helgemo opened 1@H playing 4-card majors    now declaring 4@H|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW never in the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  AR going for blood|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Again, For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team and those are the only results that matter.  Tie is 1/2 point, win is 1, loss is 0.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if rita doubles Andrew will pull to 2H i think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  sorry, thought N had  only 3 spades, of course 3C|pg||
nt|kit: So South will be declarer after all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: I assume there are no running scores available?  |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  as i said, "Of Course" 3C:)|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like some kind of operator error -- or did this really happen?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is what happened|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi:  perhaps there was some misinformation|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|s7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bagman: The good lead allowed EW to cash all their red suit tricks; now there are two trump tricks to come|pg||
nt|kareno: I think we will have to wait for running scores until the Operator gets them.  He has asked but we don't know when they will arrive.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has the choice to play HTx onside or KQx onside; normally HTx is much better but....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last year, it seemed director handed out scores with 2 set delay|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense can go up with H from HTx and play low from KQx|pg||
nt|kareno: Written commentary will continue right here.|pg||
nt|bagman: There's nothing declarer can do against this layout but he has to consider the HTx vs KQx onside|pg||
nt|bagman: I guess he plays the @SJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Wheels within wheels.  Why is east giving you a second spade lead that you cannot get for yourself?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director announces 7 min left in the round|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess it happened.  Just another hiccup traveling south.|pg||
nt|kit: I think Shugart just forgot that if North wanted to play in clubs, would have doubled 2@C|pg||
mc|5|nt|marlowepi:  not sure if this is an argument against the original choice by N to play for poenalties in 1D:)|pg||
nt|kareno: After 1@d doubled was pulled by east, west might find the diamond lead against 4@h|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  attention specs -- my comment was meant to be facetious. please stop explaining to me that N could have doubled to defend clubs:)|pg||
nt|kareno: We are all educated by the specs from time to time :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sarchasm emoticon is located on the 4th floor|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  in a more serious vein, we have all had the experience -- or been opposite it -- of thinking a long time about what to do, deciding on the more conservative action, and inadvertently passing. very likely that is what happened there|pg||
nt|kareno: South obviously had a miscommunication folks.  There's no need to belabor it.|pg||
nt|kareno: We are waiting for the round to be called.|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|algraves:  North coud have pitched 2 clubs on the spades and then the ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: or jacoby if you prefer that |pg||
pc|s7|nt|algraves:  a lost opportunity as declarer could have just drawn trump for a sure down one|pg||

pc|cT|mc|10|nt|algraves:  in the other room in the 3H contract Robson also failed to pitch 2 clubs to defeat it two tricks|pg||
nt|algraves:  so two world class players miss the defense. so obviously not that obvious|pg||
nt|algraves:  and both declarers opened up the hand for that possibility , Interesting hand at board a match with a full half point at stake|pg||
nt|algraves:  at imps of course a hand of little consequence|pg||
nt|algraves:  hence why some consider this form of team scoring the best|pg||
nt|algraves:  so waiting for round to be called presumably|pg||

mb|1S!|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: people asking about  Nickell and Fleisher teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither made it to the Finals of the Reisinger in this their swan song under current roster|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: Peter Fredin is a very imaginative player and we can expect something extraordinary |pg||

pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfc: I will give scores as I get them|pg||
nt|kareno: 0-11??|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12+ forces to game via jump|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|bagman: Robson has been a pro for a long time and has played with Rita Shugart for nearly 20 years or something like that |pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he now the tallest world class player in the world??|pg||
nt|bagman: Might be|pg||
nt|kareno: in bridge perhaps, not in basketball :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many saying Bocchi is same height|pg||
nt|kareno: Bocchi is quite tall|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to set up 2 club tricks to go with 4 spades, two diamonds and one or two hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Robson think, obviously|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohler in 2N East|pg||
nt|bagman: This is a good duck forcing Freding to guess what to play now from hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Also incidentally takes away a possible entry from the east hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Freding might have passed the @C8 but that would have revealed his closed hand holding|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i'm sure we'll see Fredin with Fallenius tonight   the team had to play 5 handed unexpectedly|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bagman: Good read by Freding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sorry for misspelling Fredin regularly (my fingers tend to add a 'g' after in)|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will win, get the good news in clubs, and can then test the defense by playing a heart|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|pc|s2|nt|bagman: I know the guy and know hot to spell his name with a pen|pg||

nt|algraves:  so I should have said , L and V on the leading team at the half way point|pg||

nt|kareno: Kit if he did that they could take three tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Ten teams remain.  I am proud that twice in the past I finished tenth in this, the toughest game of the year (IMO)|pg||
nt|kit: how could they ever take 3 tricks?|pg||
nt|kareno: heart and 2 spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: well, I guess South might have played queen of hearts from AQx|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1N!|an|3-card raise|mb|2S|nt|kit: oh sorry -- I had spade position backwards in my mind|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: excellent point from spec   pre-duplicated boards changed the format|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that would account for going from 11 to 10 tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  the T/O double is far from clearcut, in my view. the danger is that both of us have passed and this gives opps a LOT of information about shape and the location of cards,|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   just scroll down to bottom of page to see updates from this session  [thanks nick]|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Correct.  When I played they came down to eleven tables.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: the running scores you see from BBO are meaningless because vugraph table hosts multiple teams throughout the session|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: E can count tricks for 6NT after the queen ask revelas @SQ and @HK (assuming that @CK scores and partner has 3 diamonds)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi:  of course if it helps us buy the hand in spades that is the upside. but as pd passed in 3rd seat NV maybe it isnt terribly likely the hand belongs to us. so after all a lot depends on partnership style in 3rd chair|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: With a larger entry, they have in the past ended with a bigger final as well.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C is a mystery to me   surely not an RKC response|pg||
nt|kareno: How about 1430?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but doesn't he have 2 keycards??|pg||
nt|kareno: Not in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   trump is SPADES|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kareno: Sorry to wake you up from your nap :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually my own snoring does that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room  EW never bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  the danger of the double is perhaps particularly acute at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|kareno: While I agree, sometimes it is necessary to 'balance live' to get your side into the auction or push the opponents higher.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  naturally that is the upsiode|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: This might go down now; well figured by Shugart that the @CK is E; now this is 5 or 7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|bagman: actually 4 or 7|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|bagman: First the defense has to discard a couple of times, though|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||

nt|bagman: I think that N has quite a clearcut action with his minimum and small singleton club|pg||

nt|ahollan1: natural @S but  expect at most 1@H trick with known 9 card fit there|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Grue also started the 2nd Final session  behind  EIGHT boards [and change]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the event is 27|pg||
