nt|kareno: It is board-a-match.  the scoring is by boards won, lost or tied. For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team and those are the only results ...|pg||
nt|kareno: ...  1 for a win, 1/2 for a tie and 0 for a loss|pg||

nt|kareno: I guess my proudest moment in a Reisinger was when playing with Lynn Deas, we took all six boards from the Aces forcing them into a playoff (they won) for the title.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=10-13, 5+@D unbal|pg||

nt|kareno: Again, For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team and those are the only results that matter.  Tie is 1/2 point, win is 1, loss is 0.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pace may be a bit slow today.   we have to wait for the next round, obviously, and players have to come to the VuGraph table|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Wolpert getting in with an unusual 2NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Seamon - Cayne play very sound weak twos|pg||
nt|kareno: Some do have singleton asks after weak twos.  I like to play an ask for controls in a particular suit after weak two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Grue is one of last who plays feature over 2M-2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either shortness ask or more likely some version of Ogust|pg||
nt|kareno: Jump-shift sets trump and asks about the suit jumped to a la Roman Alpha - 1st step no control, second step 2nd round control, third step first round control.  I would obviously ...|pg||
nt|kareno: ask about diamonds here.|pg||
nt|pelu:  u can combine that with Aces: 1 step = no singleton, 2. step, singleton - no Ace, 3. step : singleton + 1Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely  pairs need to clarify  number of TRUMP|pg||
nt|pelu:  this askingbids was invented more than 50 years ago by John Trelde - Trelde Askingbids - and used by a lot of - older:) - danish players|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice - so I could incorporate that into my asks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Mine are from a suggestion Paul Heitner gave me.|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that the Trelde asking bids were derived from Culbertson asking bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you have a 4th step opposite a weak hand, Peter. Control, no ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director has called the round; we are waiting for players to come to the VuGraph table|pg||
nt|pelu:  that was my 2. step :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last year, it seemed director handed out scores with 2 set delay|pg||
nt|bagman: the defense can go up with H from HTx and play low from KQx|pg||
nt|kareno: Written commentary will continue right here.|pg||
nt|bagman: There's nothing declarer can do against this layout but he has to consider the HTx vs KQx onside|pg||

nt|bagman: So South found the 3rd option to play the spades; probably influenced by Lauria's strange spade switch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 5 min left in the round|pg||
