mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Declarer has two possible lines after drawing trump: cash the @sAK and if the Q does not drop, fall back on a club finesse, or try to ruff out the @ck doubleton or third, and then try the @s finesse if that does not work|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Obviously the second line works|pg||
nt|henryb:  They may play this as RKC: one should play this as quantitative, and either use 4@s as RKC, or play Texas followed by 4N as RKC|pg||
