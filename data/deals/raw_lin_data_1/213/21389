nt|migry: unlucky split in the @s suit in the normal 2@s contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW carding  upside-down count & attitude   odd/even discard|pg||

nt|ahollan1: without a 2nd thought|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW play a lot of equal level conversions, but surely deWijs has MUCH more than promised on the auction|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|marlowepi:  in contrast, 2C uses up a lot of useful space, and the suit is better. at these colors the usual qualitative differential between one-level overcalls and a 2C overcall shouldnt hold as much water as usual|pg||
