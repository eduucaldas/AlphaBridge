nt|vugraphzsv: hi all|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning Ben|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|8+|nt|benjy:  I am amazed that he didn't bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|5+hearts + 4 card suit|nt|benjy:  That is completely normal in my view|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|enquiry|nt|odysseus69: 2C is a Gazzili variation -currently growing in popularity|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|benjy:  Morning Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: seem to be getting overboard    |pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/GazzilliND.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  18 pages, good luck!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: which spade should West lead - ace or Queen or 4th - I like the Queen|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the seven!     |pg||
nt|ady: spade lead    8 tricks at best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dkkello:  ok|pg||
nt|benjy:  The spots aren't good enough for the Q lead in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: with a definate entry  ace a decent choice|pg||
nt|benjy:  as he has a side entry I think the ace is correct|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this makes it certain down|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|benjy:  None of you guys have committed to whether you would have overcalled 2@S or not|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: neither oppo will have 4 spades so pips not too relevant|pg||
nt|benjy:  for me it's automatic, though Townsend is a notorious underbidder (as is Victor) :)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: particularly with qxxx hearts the 2S bid is the way to lose a penalty in a part score deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|ady: best for n/s  is a low contract in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: way overboard again|pg||
nt|benjy:  Tough to stop low here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: weak jump response seems to have misfired|pg||
nt|ady: what did north expect if 3@D is weak   needs AQJXXX  to have any chance|pg||
nt|benjy:  they have bid two 25 point games i wouldn't consider that overboard at all|pg||
nt|odysseus69: again a green card from me  on average Robson will bid twice as often as me|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy:  They would have got to 3NT even opposite a pass from robson, north would have reopened with 1NT and south would bid game|pg||
nt|benjy:  This could be making now....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this time a simple 4th highest is best - |pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjy:  declarer needs to win and play on @Cs before @Hs is that right?|pg||
nt|benjy:  if he plays a @H then the defence will prevail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he doesnt play the jack this will probably make|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays a club  defence can win and play a low spade|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||

nt|benjy:  the defence have to give a spade or a @D trick in the ending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and i have to get it in- the 1 spade overcall does not appeal to me|pg||
nt|ady: hand 9   also 3NT in CR    down 2|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|ady: just lose 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the point about doubling 5 of a minor is that it costs 4 imps when the contract makes but where the upside is unknown|pg||

nt|benjy:  having cashed a top C along the way|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: can they penaty double|pg||
nt|benjy:  :)|pg||
mb|d!|an|5m+4M or big|nt|benjy:  X is two way|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT alooks like making for e/w with a fortunate lay of KX diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: they may play 4@H    not so good|pg||
nt|benjy:  they may play 2@S X?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy:  if Bahkshi Xs for t/o?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am so old fashioned - I persist with penaty doubles|pg||
nt|odysseus69: usually they play most doubes are t/o|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might be nervous of playing 2Sx with only 1 spade|pg||
nt|benjy:  if he doesn't X then he could bid 3@C pass or correct perhaps|pg||
nt|benjy:  but then he might lose the @H fit|pg||
nt|benjy:  It's tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 2@S after X essentially undiscussed...Robson has left room while 'explanation' given|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and partner does not have to be so strong|pg||
nt|benjy:  If pd has 4@H then you want to play 4@H, if pd has 4@S then do you want to play for penalties?|pg||
nt|ady: Irens lost 100 in 2@S in CR   a reasonable result    but may lose imps if 4@H is reached here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i predict 3H -  my record very poor|pg||
nt|benjy:  2@S went down 1 in the other room when the defence lost its way|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: director at the table now...trying to get some clarification on NS agreement or lack thereof|pg||
nt|benjy:  I was wondering about this situation|pg||
nt|ady: if east bids 3@H    would not Townsend raise?   maybe not after all this time|pg||
nt|benjy:  Personally i play that if X is conventional then i play system on|pg||
nt|benjy:  and it is penalty then i play natural|pg||
nt|benjy:  but if it's two way then is it system on or off?|pg||
nt|benjy:  so it may be the case that 2@S is a transfer|pg||
nt|benjy:  No screens at the gold cup|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: I believe there will be from next year for semi final onwards|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy:  This is the time when your agreements have to be very clear|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to be that clear  taking so long |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|benjy:  for both n/s and e/w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjy:  though 3NT is cold|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: they have reached the making game|pg||
nt|benjy:  so thats fine|pg||
nt|benjy:  so a big swing for Irens to continue the comeback|pg||
