mb|p|nt|nkgupt: and systemically he invited 4@s not 3nt|pg||
nt|nsriram:  especially since he is showing only 4 hearts now|pg||
nt|dslee: might get in there - laltu has a raise now|pg||
nt|dslee: only hinderance from Laltu is his singleton @S|pg||
nt|dslee: probably in his thought he might feel that @S is not joining - hence there might not be a game|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: thats  the q:)|pg||

nt|nsriram:  knowing about that 5th H is important|pg||

mb|p|nt|raghavan: since Raju passed means accepted so i feel no difficulty in further bidding|pg||

nt|dslee: was on a call|pg||
nt|dslee: i am sure Sri would had taken good care in the meantime|pg||
nt|subhranp: this time a slam for EW|pg||
nt|subhranp: laltu has a very powerful hand, close to 2c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nsriram:  3N by N-S this time|pg||
mb|d|nt|raghavan: Manyawar gets 9 since other room they bid 4H X going 1 down|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|subhranp: if they play this 2h by sumit as weak raise, Laltu may not try for slam|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|an|1/4|mb|5D|nt|subhranp: 5d bid will make it easy for East to bid the slam|pg||
nt|subhranp: he would know that partner is likely to be ruffing diamond|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  but cant get in|pg||
nt|raghavan: thinking whether to X|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: If you all notice, several people are playing variable NT|pg||
nt|subhranp: well done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nsriram:  good lead|pg||
nt|dslee: for figo and Manoj, they play precision so 1NT would be a natural opening there|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: ..|pg||
nt|raghavan: may go to 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|subhranp: this result will not be easy to duplicate|pg||
pc|s7|nt|nsriram:  but opponents more likely to bid over precision NT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nkgupt: multi will do well on the hand ...6@s on from E and 6@h from W:)|pg||
nt|nsriram:  declarer should be held to 4 spades and 2 hearts|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|h2|pg||

nt|dslee: the rule of variable NT are 1. 10-13 when Fav Green 2. 12-14 when Equal Green and 3. 15-17 when red, 14-15 when both red|pg||

nt|panja: tricky rebid problem for South...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: hi :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|panja: I guess 2@H ART forcing, and 2@S non minimum ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@h AMERICAN INVENTION very strong 2nT also possible|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: with this beginning they are quite likely to reach 6 at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|bobholl: a push :)|pg||
nt|panja: so despite the artificiality.......they could not find the fit...|pg||
mc|13|nt|panja: usually, there is a self-preemptive effect that the strong 2@C bid carries|pg||
pg||

nt|raghavan: Manyawar get 2 by last hand|pg||
nt|subhranp: another interesting hand..|pg||
nt|subhranp: grand slam makes on the 3-3 break of clubs just what a trailing team would want|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d!|nt|raghavan: in 8 deals Manyawar is much ahead with 39 against 2 |pg||
nt|subhranp: NS probably playing precision. 1c-strong and 1d-(0-7)|pg||
mb|r|nt|nsriram:  what happened at other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|nsriram:  what does Sumit do now|pg||
nt|nsriram:  raise to 5c?|pg||
nt|dslee: sumit should come in 4@D - laltu clearly denied 4@S|pg||
nt|dslee: he has to work out laltu's hand - 5@C is always an option - no harm coming in with 4@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|subhranp: 2d showing a good raise since laltu has probably shown diamonds with the dbl|pg||
mb|2S|nt|nsriram:  bingo|pg||
nt|nsriram:  bridge is tough game :)|pg||
nt|dslee: if they have a system of -ve x is other two, I am sure laltu would had worked this out|pg||
mb|p|nt|nsriram:  Deb I dont see the results for this board at other table|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphztj: After 2nd session,Manyawar-50 vs Maya Mira- 15,Indian Railways A-85 vs Indian Mavericks-31,Formidables-58 vs Shree Cement-93,Malani-29 vs Poddar Developers-56|pg||
nt|sanjib: hi all|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dslee: i can see, go to the proper BBO version sri|pg||
nt|subhranp: hi sanjib|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  I am on the browser version|pg||
nt|nsriram:  so what was the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: Dr Srini would be smiling  - he will surely come out and say, keya chup baitha dekha :)|pg||
nt|sanjib: too many slams in this round, anything can happen ...there may be big swings |pg||
nt|subhranp: this will be another big loss|pg||
nt|sanjib: but here  slam is gone |pg||
pc|dK|nt|subhranp: lal should have now bid on|pg||
mc|13|nt|subhranp: he might not have understood 3d but after 4s he should have gone ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: break 2mins...|pg||
nt|subhranp: yes NS need to take the break, Sumit-laltu might want to continue though.|pg||
nt|subhranp: in the meantime Sree have closed in on B47|pg||
nt|subhranp: some specs feel that South hand too strong to just bid 4s|pg||
nt|subhranp: this has been an exciting set atleast from kibs point of view. slams/grandslams almost every other deal|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: they are not on this hand but 75% slams should be bid too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: one more 12 trick deal...needs one out of two finesses...so just about 75% or below...accounting for some ruff possibilities|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bobholl: true somewhat less than 75% but surely good enough :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 2@C probably drury (fit) |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|nkgupt: and 4@s unfit jump to game !!:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: this would have been very difficult to bid...needs @DJT, needs N to have at most two Hearts..and so on|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: South's rather|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|mc|12|nt|panja: South is too strong for that, a bit lazy, a bit tired bid at this stage of the game perhaps|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't see a clear  slam on the S hand only would also have bid 4@S :(|pg||
pg||
qx|c52|st||md|2SAK532HAQ2DAQ5C87,SJ7HJ875DK9743CQ4,SQ984HT9DJT62CAKJ,ST6HK643D8CT96532|sv|b|nt|dslee: i am not very sure if this would be a IM pickup - if 4@D comes on the way, its great - tough point are those 4 card @S |pg||
nt|dslee: 5@D - EW?|pg||
nt|nsriram:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|subhranp: one more slam board coming up. 6s makes for NS|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|henryb:  An easy 4@h to play; not so easy in 3N, but that too will make|pg||
nt|nsriram:  1D 1S 1N seems routine|pg||
nt|raghavan: another 7 to Manyawar as other room opp played in 3NT X 1 down|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nsriram:  what would Laltu do after that|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dslee: I would x with dr srini hand :)|pg||
nt|dslee: both red|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dslee: 2@C is the NF checkback|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  You really don't have many choices here|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, lots of choices, but only a low heart towards dummy makes sense|pg||
nt|nsriram:  so invitational now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dslee: yes|pg||
nt|dslee: cleaner system is 1NT-3@D|pg||
nt|dslee: show that 5-5|pg||
nt|nsriram:  wasnt 2N max?|pg||
nt|dslee: give some clues to ptr rather than going by the system always|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|dslee: 2NT was no 3 card @S and balanced|pg||
nt|nsriram:  nothing about strength?|pg||
nt|dslee: strength limited to 15|pg||
nt|dslee: this hand is a distribution play|pg||
nt|nsriram:  how would you bid if you had 4S and 5D Deb|pg||
nt|dslee: i am not sure if sumit and laltu plays 1@D opening as 4 cards|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@C indicates an inclination to @S|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@D would likely be 4@S+5@D|pg||
nt|nsriram:  right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nsriram:  first he has to check for 5-3 spade fit which is most prefered game|pg||
nt|dslee: i am sure if laltu heard 2@S instd of 2NT from sumit, he would had bid 4@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nsriram:  in trouble now|pg||
nt|dslee: depends on lead|pg||
nt|dslee: dr might lead 4th best @S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|nsriram:  doesnt matter|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|nsriram:  and this should make things easier for the defence|pg||
nt|raghavan: Club does not run so will be very difficult|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|subhranp: again, this is pretty conservative from NS|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|dslee: mind you, dr has to discard 4 cards now - what would he?|pg||
nt|nsriram:  hearts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dslee: then sumit is on :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nkgupt: N is trying but cant manage (to go shy):)  |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|raghavan: will he take CQ or keep it to avoid 2 tricks to Raju is the question But if he does not take CQ where are his other tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|henryb:  this is a truly strange line of play. Apparently N did not believe his luck when the @cJ won.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: sry he can:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  he needs to ruff a club and lead a heart now. All other line fail|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dslee: now no way they can defend|pg||
nt|nsriram:  oops|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|subhranp: gap has reduced further as Railway have gone down in the slam on 48|pg||
mc|12|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: they don't play the original precision 2@D opening :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 3Nt will play well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panja: note that NS in the Closed Room were undone by the stealth 1@C opening|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: 4@D 2@S 1@H 2@C = 9 :)|pg||
nt|panja: that stopped a simple 2@C overcall by S, and when S came in next time, it was too late to excite North|pg||
nt|panja: interestingly, same happend in the finals last year|pg||
nt|panja: or SF perhaps|pg||
nt|panja: where Milind Athavale of Poddar Dev had to wait one round to show his Club suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: and they missed 3Nt|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

pc|dT|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|nkgupt: esp. as u r not too averse to playing in @d/@h|pg||
mc|9|nt|bobholl: 12 imps (bad for tension)|pg||
nt|panja: so the match seems to be as good as decided...|pg||
nt|panja: 3 teams from Mumbai in SF this time...|pg||

nt|dslee: both red position, people would do on a 3rd hand opening :)|pg||
nt|dslee: seems funny, but the rule of the day|pg||
nt|nsriram:  they will probably find 5D then|pg||
nt|nsriram:  now they had them in the right spot|pg||
nt|nsriram:  just did not defend well enough to take advantage|pg||
nt|dslee: 3NT by Dr and DV?|pg||
nt|subhranp: sry I meant B49|pg||
nt|sanjib: but in other room the 6 @h was not bid|pg||
nt|sanjib: Stopped @@ 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dslee: this shows a weaker hand of dr|pg||

nt|sanjib: true|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  declarer does not have 9th trick|pg||

pc|s7|nt|vugraphztj: live video of other match on www.buddyshah.com|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|dslee: this is a deal where everyone bid and laltu's 1@S indicates 3 card @D support surely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nsriram:  so what does he do if he has a spade suit|pg||
nt|nsriram:  and no support|pg||
pc|cT|nt|raghavan: Live Video by Buddy shah - first time in India great|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|dslee: back|pg||
nt|dslee: rule wise, its a fit in the primary suit - if sumit if void, they can run back to @D|pg||
nt|dslee: deal 6, thanks to precision, its a pickup for IM|pg||
nt|nsriram:  you are at the one level, running should not be a big concern|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, just to reach the right spot sri - its always useful to be self sufficient or bid with a fit|pg||
nt|nsriram:  if you are playing fit jumps then 2S would be good, has some preemptive value too|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|dslee: might not be apt for a fit jump :)|pg||
