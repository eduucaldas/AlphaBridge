nt|dslee: might get in there - laltu has a raise now|pg||
nt|dslee: only hinderance from Laltu is his singleton @S|pg||

nt|vugraphztj: i dont  understand rules sir|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|dslee: for the sake of the kibbers - the system is 1m-2@H(4@H+5@S) and 1m-2@S(5@H+5@S) but the latter comes with 8-10 points for which Sumit might not had choosen to bid it|pg||
