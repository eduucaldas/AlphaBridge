nt|dslee: might get in there - laltu has a raise now|pg||
nt|dslee: only hinderance from Laltu is his singleton @S|pg||

nt|nsriram:  knowing about that 5th H is important|pg||
nt|dslee: well, I think it deserves a raise - 6-8 points 4@H +5@S - 3 would be sure with his points in other suits|pg||

nt|dslee: 3@D would likely be 4@S+5@D|pg||

pc|s6|pg||

nt|vugraphztj: 2mins pls|pg||
nt|sanjib: interesting hand..|pg||
nt|sanjib: actually slam there with @D 3-3 guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have put money on Jaggy to make that|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, he was at 5 level...was not going to make that!|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: true but on a spade lead, there is a problem|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no indeed E to blame it wasn't that great a hand|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|2D!|an|!h|mb|3C|nt|nsriram:  but vul is not good for N-S to try 5 minor|pg||
nt|dslee: NS has a good sac vs EW game|pg||
nt|sanjib: Thats it.. have to play trump Q then 3 rounds of @d pitching a @s|pg||
nt|sanjib: difficult guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  some version of dont?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dslee: why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|nsriram:  pseudo sacrifice because it makes!!!|pg||
nt|dslee: with @S and @H out in the field - Dr is surely going to have m |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  still a big risk Deb |pg||
nt|dslee: yes, risk of loosing 3 IMP vs Gaining 7|pg||
nt|subhranp: contract is kind of wrong sided, North has natural spade lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  loser in each suit|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  and possible 2 in @s suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dslee: go for the latter|pg||
nt|dslee: you loose at the most 3 if at all|pg||
nt|nsriram:  Norht could be sitting with a spade stack and not a  great fit for either minor|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|nsriram:  too much of a gamble|pg||

pc|sA|mc|8|nt|andyv:  if W initially suspected the actual position, he would have cleared the side suits hoping to get a 3 card ending and put N in to lead a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: 2@C  = @C and higher|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ah dont then (modified of course)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, I'm waiting for the 3-3 version to come out in paperback|pg||
