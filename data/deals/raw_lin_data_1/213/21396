mb|p|mb|d|nt|pjs_ch:  hi all|pg||
nt|benjy:  Gold might bid 2@S here|pg||
nt|benjy:  though they tend to have only 3@S when they reopen here else they bid 2@S in reopening seat|pg||
nt|benjy:  so he will prob bid 2Nt scramble and they might play 3@C or 3@D?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  good and bad; only 1 four card suit to choose and partner does have 4 of them, but  :(|pg||
nt|benjy:  both will play awfully|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the 2@S choice is the usual attempt at a cheap escape but here it's no bargain|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy:  Would you X as north Pat?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pjs_ch:  I think X is a bit too dangerous; for sure at this time in a close match ; other ways to win the hand exist|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|benjy:  If erichsen plays trumps at every opportunity this won't be much fun for declarer|pg||

pc|c2|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|benjy:  true|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the play of the @SQ might have rung some alarm bells, but 56xx is still unexpected distribution for E|pg||

nt|benjy:  but not when he was 56|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|benjy:  obviously the former was far more likely|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  reversing seems way OTT - needs partner to have a good 3cd spade holding for it to gain|pg||
nt|benjy:  they play gazilli so perhaps it shows a limited hand, but even so it's too much for me|pg||
nt|benjy:  Erichsen may take the 2 down by playing a @H|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  Although I play Gazilli (1@H-1N-2@C on arbitrary strong hands), the 2@S bid is still a reverse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|nt|pjs_ch:  since it does force preference at the 3-level|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  3@H here a transfer into spades, and there is still debate as to what the best style of response is|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  some say accepting the transfer promises 3, some say refusing it promises 3|pg||
nt|benjy:  i favour this style|pg||
nt|benjy:  as in 3@S would promise 3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  openignlead here interesting as a heart is only going to workout if partner has 3 hearts and|pg||
nt|benjy:  then partner can show shortage over that which is great|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it might even then need the hearts 2-2 for North-South|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pjs_ch:  differentiating between 3cd support and less helps when the responding hand wants to move on to a potential slam|pg||

nt|benjy:  and there was no entry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  West must avoid discarding a spade on the @CA as it will allow him to be endplayed in hearts if declarer cashes his @D and @S winners|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  2@D here a multi- weak two in major or other things too; will that be a narrow range weak two?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy:  yes i believe so|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|max with !h and !D shortage|nt|pjs_ch:  the 2@S response indicates a desire to go higher if partner has hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south may play double as a spade take out as defence to the multi|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and 3@D here shows a weak two in hearts - but what else?|pg||
nt|benjy:  Gold has a tricky bid now|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  A double would now show diamonds, but passing and then doubling will show all three suits|pg||
nt|benjy:  unless he chooses to pass and then X 3@H, the problem with that is it may go 4@H pass pass and now he would have a bid decision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: persumably x is available|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  doubling and then doubling?  Maybe that shows a stronger hand|pg||
nt|benjy:  i don't think he can show a good hand having passed, my guess would be that X would show @Ds here but i don't know, this is a very unusal multi auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy:  i bet they won't have discussed it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however he did pass 2D so maybe he is limited|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  maybe Gold didn't need to bid !?!|pg||
nt|benjy:  is this auction correct?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Giold must have acted over 3D|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  North knows that LHO has a weak two in heart and RHO is short in spades|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, thats some 4 spades with the auction as stated|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  so he feels sure of a fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: auction is as seen :)|pg||
nt|benjy:  he must have acted over 2@D or 3@D|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzsv: no...but had a think over 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Stephen|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: now director being called|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe a director call|pg||
nt|benjy:  even if X shows @Ds then thats fine and he could X again to bring the other suits into the game so well bid by north south|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I should think so, too|pg||
nt|benjy:  He really passed 3@D?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  there are 3 top tricks to lose in 4@S, and it might be hard work - but EW can't tell that the hearts are 1-1 and so from Wess't pov there might be little defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: think this will be adjusted to 4H-1|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  at other vulnerabilities - the sense of a spade fit would make the 4@S bid easier to find|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Im no expert on this, but Robson's 3 spade responce to 2 diamonds looks well judged to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: 3@S seems normal...|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  yes indeed - he would have raised a weak two in spades, so right tobid 3@S here|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  even if declarer rolls it back to 4@H, it's not clear that the auction would have ended there|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|pjs_ch:  South could still double and reach 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S was spot on - after passing North could double this |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|nt|benjy:  Victor are you saying that the X of 3@S would show @S after 2@D p 3@S?|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: for sure- you wil say that East has 6 spades and West has bid 3S on a doubleton - but never seen it in 40 years|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I suppose north could argue that since west bid only 2 spades on the aution, he was marked with short spades, so its safe to bid 4 spades|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|benjy:  N/S play intermediate jump overcalls here|pg||
nt|benjy:  not strong|pg||
nt|benjy:  hence the X|pg||
mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 4h is expensive but 4S ikely|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: not as expensive as 6 spades it seems|pg||
nt|odysseus69: finesse through weak 2 works|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: but almost :)|pg||
nt|benjy:  Won't Gold pass this?|pg||
nt|benjy:  he has a total minimum|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: he has an ace and 3 trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like a pass but he is certainly giving it some thought|pg||
nt|benjy:  the question is how weak can you be to X a 3Nt call here?|pg||
nt|benjy:  Victor any thoughts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: but already showed some values surely...only 3rd spade to spare really|pg||
nt|odysseus69: everfyone knew that East had big heart fit- so the pass of 4H did show a minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|wilkinsona: well there is a danger of the 3N backfiring ..|pg||
nt|benjy:  i agree with the pass 100% but the specs don't|pg||

mc|12|nt|odysseus69:  not many suggesting that South should bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzsv: thnx all...back at 2.15|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: a lot of us specs got knocked out in an earlier round|pg||
