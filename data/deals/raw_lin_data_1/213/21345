nt|nsriram:  nothing about strength?|pg||

nt|dslee: this hand is a distribution play|pg||
nt|nsriram:  how would you bid if you had 4S and 5D Deb|pg||
nt|dslee: i am not sure if sumit and laltu plays 1@D opening as 4 cards|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@C indicates an inclination to @S|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@D would likely be 4@S+5@D|pg||
nt|nsriram:  right|pg||
mb|p|nt|nsriram:  first he has to check for 5-3 spade fit which is most prefered game|pg||
