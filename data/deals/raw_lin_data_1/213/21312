nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Larsen in the other room and Pollack-Feldman play a strong @C|pg||
nt|fann4: Best lead here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  looks like a reasonable C slam....on all but the known heart lead|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||
nt|chip: EW have a good 5C save, but never got in the bidding.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for 1 down .. |pg||
nt|fann4: not necessarily, this can make.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: if only playing semi-forcing 1nt i would use one of the bergen raises to show a 3 card limit raise|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|chip: Same auction at the other table.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|warrens:  the 10 gives declarer an extra entry to dummy for ruffing out @h's|pg||
pc|dT|nt|atlantajon:  a little high now|pg||
nt|alchilds: lets see|pg||
nt|alchilds: yes|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  welcome to Chip and Al|pg||
nt|chip: So may be on their way to 7.|pg||
nt|alchilds: canthey stop in5 nt|pg||
nt|USBF: If it was RKC for diamonds, then he has 2 + Q|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: in fact NS can make 4 with some good guessing|pg||
nt|chip: not sure what 5S is.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: the team names are reversed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry folks, had to restart to reset the score, fell a bit behind|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi all :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: the real rarget for team hinden is to win the match by 14+ imps so as to win the event|pg||
nt|copeyj: big ask but 20 boards to go|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: something is wrong  EW pair play Larsen|pg||
pc|d8|nt|atlantajon:  welcome epsen|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||
pc|d2|nt|atlantajon:  push|pg||
nt|grebrof: same contract as open room - I think mainly S should have been looking for a cuebid in @hs from N to bid slam, but ok - weve all been there|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: This looks like a fairly normal result|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: Can't imagine N/S not getting to the 3 level in @C after W bids 2@H|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chip: Note that if N has Qxx of spades (so a 12 count) would be able to pitch a D and make 6.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bagman: did they fail to cash out?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|kareno: North obviously thinking about bidding here.  Dangerous to bid but also dangerous to pass lest you miss a game.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: queen could not gain|pg||
nt|chip: ?? play AK then go to dummy in clubs to take a pitch.|pg||
nt|grebrof: other than that, I dont know what agreements NS have, but 3@c is a bit of a stretch in my mind|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chip: yes, having opened that N hand I'd be eager to put a green card out over 2H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry folks, players are wrong n/s will adjust|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  leaping micheals for anyone?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|copeyj: 1@S froM Allerton and X from Forrester|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: board is being played inverted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C and 2@D openings for EW are Intermediate, but not sure about shape requirements|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  are they playing canape openers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Choice for Gold now but 2@H likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total trick followers need more than all fingers and toes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think it is the strong hand - or can be|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, the pitch discussion was assuming partner had the two aces he showed.  |pg||
nt|arunbapat: shall try after some time|pg||
nt|fann4: N would like to act, but at this vul and such a poor suit he can't|pg||
nt|fann4: But N did in the other room.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: not the time for passing the double out|pg||
nt|copeyj: and that will end things|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think Gold was even close to passing|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  perhaps rose thought the hand was TOO good for leaping micheals.....for the intermediate player.  leaping micheals is explained here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaping_Michaels|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kyle thought about dbling before passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mark asked about 3spades, Kyle wrote something about asking...|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c all the bal minimums - also including @ds|pg||
nt|psyck: N debating bidding game or only inviting maybe|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: certainly not with ARF as his pard:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: schermer took the high road with 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, interesting treatment|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  goingto be hard for him to bid 6h...after the 4d call.  |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: not that it helps much on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|grebrof: I saw the movie in last segment and they had some similar auction|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: it started with 1@d anyway...|pg||
nt|chip: Did he really open 1D here?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  we were just talking about that|pg||
nt|psyck: with 4333, poor trumps, & @s values, tries 3N instead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|atlantajon:  well done|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: i think auction has derailed now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mugsmate:  Also, if west bids there, he's likely to get that suit lead which is probably bad here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low club need declarer will have to play diamonds immediately to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: misclick sorry folks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 1h|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in retrospect....leaping micheals would have made it harder to get there....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: Yes I don't think you can introduce @D - you have enough that it is likely to be a part score hand so no prospect of really "stealing"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome John|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess they know what they are doing|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kjadams: system too good here?  3N a likely make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers intended 4@C as non-forcing is my guess, sequence so rare that followups not clear|pg||
nt|chip: 3N not a good contract (particularly on a D lead), but with hearts so friendly always makes.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|copeyj: 3 trumps 2@C i think declarer can manage the rest though|pg||
nt|fann4: The result here doesn't matter - Team 1 have won the board.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|atlantajon:  unlesss rose bid 4s...over 4h|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club return too tough i guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chip: J of spades lead shows the Q.|pg||
nt|psyck: this is comfortable with suits favorable (would have had to get @h right on say a @d lead)|pg||
nt|chip: There isn't a guess in hearts. Kx onside is the only thing that helps.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|psyck: Rusinov leads show the honor above the card lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: hmm the defence can previal now I think.. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: this was well judged auction by all   only way to do better would be slower paths that stopped in GAME|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: unless they give the @D ruff - i think that is letting it through again|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chip: Declarer can safely play a club to the 9 next.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: now declarer can claim leading up to @CQ|pg||

nt|bagman: Grue hoping either singleton diamond or to avoid heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I have asked directors to bring me the standings as often as they can|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure, Al.  Are they playing the same boards at the same time?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure  2N asked Feature and 3@S denied anything outside of trump suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Grue:  sorry if this is wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   everyone plays same boards at same time|pg||

mc|12|nt|Walddk2: 2-1 to Team 1 the most likely result of this match. I doubt that Cayne-Seamon bid the slam next door, but we shall see|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team and those are the only results that matter.  Tie is 1/2 point, win is 1, loss is 0.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: pace may be a bit slow today.   we have to wait for the next round, obviously, and players have to come to the VuGraph table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: won't it be Cayne: 1  Grue: 2   ??   Cayne starts in 1st place  Grue in 6th|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ohhhhhh Roland met   Team 1 per BBO display|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: np|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seamon did not open the South hand in the other room but jumped to 2@S after 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wolpert getting in with an unusual 2NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Seamon - Cayne play very sound weak twos|pg||
nt|kareno: Some do have singleton asks after weak twos.  I like to play an ask for controls in a particular suit after weak two.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Grue is one of last who plays feature over 2M-2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either shortness ask or more likely some version of Ogust|pg||
nt|kareno: Jump-shift sets trump and asks about the suit jumped to a la Roman Alpha - 1st step no control, second step 2nd round control, third step first round control.  I would obviously ...|pg||
nt|kareno: ask about diamonds here.|pg||
nt|pelu:  u can combine that with Aces: 1 step = no singleton, 2. step, singleton - no Ace, 3. step : singleton + 1Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more likely  pairs need to clarify  number of TRUMP|pg||
nt|pelu:  this askingbids was invented more than 50 years ago by John Trelde - Trelde Askingbids - and used by a lot of - older:) - danish players|pg||
nt|kareno: Nice - so I could incorporate that into my asks.|pg||
nt|kareno: Mine are from a suggestion Paul Heitner gave me.|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that the Trelde asking bids were derived from Culbertson asking bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you have a 4th step opposite a weak hand, Peter. Control, no ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director has called the round; we are waiting for players to come to the VuGraph table|pg||

nt|psyck: not everyones choice of a weak 2 1st seat with poor suit & outside Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N FG raise I am guessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman|pg||
nt|fann4: N is pretty much in the same position now as the other room. He can pot slam, hoping opponents don't lead a @H or partner has a singleton @D.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|copeyj: Osborne can now show @H shortage and extras|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: doesn;t fit well with Jeffrey;s hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but a lot of gharp values|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  This won't encourage Allerton.|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S weak, but disciplined, so this is likely to get to slam also|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|chip: On the last deal they played 4H making 650 to tie the match.|pg||
nt|warrens:  No slam try by North, so now it will depend on whether or not e/w push them there|pg||
nt|fann4: East has to do something here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I expect 5@C by E|pg||
nt|warrens:  even at unfavorable|pg||
nt|fann4: At this vul West is very likely to be 6-5|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree|pg||
nt|fann4: He just doesn't have that many points also.|pg||
nt|warrens:  E must be trying to figure out if bidding will cost 500 against a non-vul game (or, I suppose, he might think it can be beat)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or we are stuck|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thinking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: ah good|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Voice Commentary  [in both rooms]|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h normally being better than 4 - and S doesnt have a bad hand|pg||
nt|chip: 3N presumably some type of slam try. Not sure how they play it.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Is that a serious 3nt bid....|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  OK|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that came up just as I typed it|pg||
nt|grebrof: with a bad trumpsuit and a stiff @s, a nonserious slamtry seems like a good evatulation of Ns hand|pg||
nt|chip: No serious seems an underbid, particularly if 3H suggests an OK hand (though many sensibly do not play the 3H bid that way).|pg||
nt|grebrof: evaluation - spelling in the dark here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
nt|chip: I think 3 key cards and another king is too much for non serious, particularly as a 4C Q-bid makes things smoother.|pg||
nt|chip: 4H always cold. Takes a club lead to stop 5 (so 11 quick tricks now).|pg||
mb|d|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
nt|copeyj: a normal auction once Osborne had showed shortage - always a conundrum with singleton A|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Perhaps Osbourne should have showed the hand as strong balanced, but that's not ideal either.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed chip....after a 3h call from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: 4S is maybe RKC? or just a Q-bid?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  not 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D  2-way checkback  game force|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess old blackwood could be used - S cuebidding @s - equal to bidding 5@h which some kibs suggest - I think this is better|pg||

nt|kjadams: well done on auction|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kjadams: the play will be a form of Morton's fork.   If Robinson wins the diamond ace, that establishes two pitchs for spades, and if not,  e/w do not get a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads are always Rusinow  [2nd of touching honors]|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@h would be more: "bid 6 if you have good trumps p" - for me that is|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: thats funny Chip - bridge you never have what you bid anymore|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  lol|pg||

mb|3H|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card Drury.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rooms were opened incorrectly  and decision is to NOT close/reopen the Open Room which controls the situation|pg||

nt|grebrof: not sure that EW will figure out their good @c-fit, but we will see|pg||
nt|fann4: Operator, is it the same NS pair here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: yes, same n/s|pg||
mb|4D|nt|alchilds: game both ways|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h probably 2,5@s bid|pg||
nt|chip: EW can beat 4S with a D ruff, but not so easy with S declaring (this would be a bad hand for transfers by responder).|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  either side will need to find thier minor ruff...to beat a game|pg||
nt|grebrof: some suggesting fit jump in @cs by W - the law says you should have 4, but here it wouldve been nice|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chip: W also would like a better club suit than QJxxx. Odd that E passed over 3H.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  commentating now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yes, the 2@d being a good lift in @hs and E has a full opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Precision players open most 11 & many 10 hcp hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: some interest to the play here|pg||
nt|kjadams: Robinson had available a short suit GT/ST or a long suit ST, chose not to reveal anything.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after Schermer passed the first time, he put out 1D after Robinson bid :)|pg||
nt|fann4: East hand looks a bit heavy to me for a 2@H raise. Other room Lauria bid 2NT, showing some sort of good @H raise.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|copeyj: Forrester has a horrible hand to lead from|pg||
nt|copeyj: nothing attractive|pg||
nt|chip: I think he should bid 4D to get the lead.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  sorry....was talking to a friend,..|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see the @d-lead coming|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@h being some invitational hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: whats their nt-range anyway?|pg||
nt|chip: 2H is some invitational hand, now in NT, which I'm sure W will reject.  Notice the club spots give E a 4th round trick, but this does take the entry out of the dummy.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: probably try finesse here|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  right.....hard to find|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: so  really O'Rourke +10|pg||

nt|copeyj: as if it loses, the AQ@C take care of the @H losers|pg||
nt|chip: No chance now, could do it on A of hearts and a D shift.|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  hi all:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: i flipped both :(|pg||
nt|psyck: if precision, 1@d is (10)11-15 higher end if unbalanced|pg||
nt|chip: But fortunately for EW, the spade ace is doubleton and D Q onside, so still can make.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

nt|grebrof: @hs are well placed too|pg||
nt|fann4: Spectators are commenting that the score on bd 2 was incorrect, but it doesn't matter in this form of scoring. EW here won the board anyway.|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: finesse is %|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because south may have AQ8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3rd quarter score in the other match O'Rourke 110, Lall 73|pg||

nt|bagman: The easiest play is to win next trick and cash @CA (Vienna Coup), @SA and then run the hearts|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  agree that 2H was heavy, but BAM rewards cautious bidding, plus score is paramount|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the great shuffler has given us a lot of long suits so fare |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|grebrof: W was aware of both suits at the other table left NS guessing |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably shows 5+|pg||
nt|grebrof: Feldman not declearer yet, so we are in front of the other table|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mugsmate:  Another perfect fit hand - no diamond wastage, so E/W can manage 5C - unlikely to bid it.|pg||
nt|fann4: Too much for 2@H imho (in my humble opinion)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: North America the default treatment over 1m-(1@H)   DBL=4@S  1@S=5+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is NOT the norm in europe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores now include the result from 7@CX-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus 2@S probably 4-fit  since most play this as Support DBL situation|pg||
nt|grebrof: not that using a lot of time to think is wrong - after all: thats what this is more or less about|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: 1S ambiguous 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|chip: DBL is rather pushy. May lead to - 670.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@D?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yes....sorry Rose.....she is she...for sure!|pg||
nt|fann4: In the OR (Open Room)  Versace/Lauria are West/East|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree with Jeff , hand worth abouth 11 HP  or so |pg||
nt|marlowepi:  not sure which version of forcing 2N raise they are using. there are a million variants|pg||
mb|3D|an|asking|nt|copeyj: 2@C is either @C or 13+ bal or a good hand with @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@D from Osborne is a bad hand or good hand with @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think passing is more pushy - only 1 @s trick|pg||
mb|3S|nt|copeyj: 2@S shows the @S/@C type|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: NF|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, i am not thrilled with this treatment, loses natural diamonds and preempts the club suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: some scribbling that we can't see|pg||
nt|chip: E did well not to pass. This is probably down, but has some chances.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mugsmate:  2D is 0-7 or good with clubs|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think NS are ok with stopping here - even if it makes 9 - they easily  be ending in 4@s, which is no fiesta|pg||
nt|chip: Even if 3N goes down, a good save against 2S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: yikes this is not a balancing auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: this looks like a good result for Gold/Forrester|pg||
nt|kjadams: missing 2 key cards, would be really hungry to bid slam, but it does make.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, good bidding by Pollack|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  10 tricks probably - a lot of work to make 11 on diamond forces.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could roll the dice by asking for diamond queen but this is the normal approach|pg||
nt|dkkello:  much will depend on the lead , a small @S perhaps  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|chip: If Declarer wins this, goes to a club to take a D finesse, S can play the heart Q to force an entry to dummy (he will sort of know partner has Hxx of hearts).|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, force an entry to N.|pg||
nt|fann4: This is a very poor slam which happens to make, but both rooms have stopped in 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  slam might fail on low D lead:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 2D also promised 5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, maybe that makes too|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|chip: Of course looking at NS hands, much better to be in 4S which rates to make, than 2N which could easily go down.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: yes, but has to be done - the J of @cs falling is some noise for S|pg||
nt|chip: If S doesn't make that play, declarer can make by guessing the clubs.  It is harder for S now since he doesn't know declarer has 4 clubs.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, here he went for @dfinesse wrong|pg||

nt|bagman: the defense can go up with H from HTx and play low from KQx|pg||
nt|kareno: Written commentary will continue right here.|pg||
nt|bagman: There's nothing declarer can do against this layout but he has to consider the HTx vs KQx onside|pg||
nt|bagman: I guess he plays the @SJ|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  the idea is to make him think he does not need to discard hearts as he can hook the ten again later for one loser. so he might discard clubs when the club finesse was working all along|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but in BAM it  looks like the players are trying not to loose the board, more than trying to win it?! |pg||
pc|c7|nt|mugsmate:  Now Forrester has ducked, they can still kill the hearts, but declarer has one trick in the bag, so it's one off.|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  which means that she won three consecutive national BAM events, playing 4-handed|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  N unlikely to have 4 spades (though not excluded), and the REAL message that S wants to deliver is "i have a very good hand". so 2C seems well-advised, especially since the 3 small clubs are a poor feature for suit play, especially played by S|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:  For those not familiar with the event, each board is played by both sides of a team 0and those are the only results ...0 for a loss, 1/2 for a tie, 1 for a win.|pg||
nt|kareno: Al means, of course, 3@h shows values.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: and 10 point difference is same as 1400 point difference|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   3@H = values :(|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Bart with glum look|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again we see that the auction guaranteed a win/loss board  different contracts of partscore v game  and nt vs major  mean cannot tie the board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever seen Bart smile??|pg||
nt|kareno: OFTEN|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at the table ?????|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|kareno: Yes.  We played as partners for some events years ago. |pg||

nt|grebrof: well, you need the entry for the @cs and N must play the 4 or something to deny interest|pg||
nt|grebrof: so: with 2346, there are reasons to keep on the highest card|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: chambers should have ditched two diamonds, much clearer then|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  specs wondering about ace of C lead. i think E was reluctant to lead the queen lest dummy track with Jxx|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: auto raise to game by east|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  how many clubs by north?|pg||
nt|grebrof: which has to be the weakest holding setting a countract :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|psyck: @c's were running from top i thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1nt not double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: inviting what?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best choice   not alot of HCP, but 8th @C can't be ignored!!|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  looks like he took the low road|pg||
nt|jgc: 4@C for me, but i'm old|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by S to bid. Otherwise NS might buy the hand for 2S. Now EW might stop, but likely to get to 4H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: i had a Swedish jr for VuG|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: 2@H=?|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, I meant E to bid (though S also did well to open, they passed in the other room).|pg||
nt|grebrof: the other table, the 6 was lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: A PUPPET?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4333 hands dont belong in 43 fits, should be easy rule to remember|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: doesn't know how many partner has...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand a good test of methods.   Over a support X, what is 2D in your system?  I like non-forcing.|pg||
nt|chip: 2N is presumably a 4 trump limit raise type hand.|pg||
nt|psyck: with JT8 dropping|pg||
nt|grebrof: is same as leading 9 from 9xxx - your p tend to have JT alone|pg||
nt|grebrof: actually - P can have anything next to the JT except the 5|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|grebrof: JT7 leaves the 8 in declearers hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  many would open 2S, but i am not keen on it. first problem is that you have a poor suit, second is that you have playability in hearts, and thirdly you may wrong-side spades when pd has a strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for me need two top honours to invite|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  going to be hard not to bid 4hearts at imps|pg||
nt|chip: NV, not really much difference between imps and matchpoints. I think should let partner out when he had so much room to make a counter try.|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Frances Hinden says this is either to play in 2@S or 3 suited short in @S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: 2@H = to play 2@S or shortage in @S (according to Hinden/Allerton card)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this is a diamond slam try then they may well bid the slam - ouch|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The way he's bid it, he's showed WHICH 5 card minor.|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think they would reach a slam - a lack of @C control would be revealed at some point I would have thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   you need transportation of much better hand to accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bill says coward as he passes|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  when an action you are considering has one flaw, you can gamble on it. two flaws is swimming against the current, and three flaws is asking for serious trouble|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mugsmate:  Having an extra round of bidding can't help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but no matter what you cant pass 3nt with north hand lacking either top honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 2nt limitraise is more and more popular when holding 4 trumps|pg||
nt|chip: After club, club, ruff, declarer will still have to guess trumps to make 3.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mugsmate:  then Hedy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree with you about 2@D|pg||
nt|kjadams: the principle is that partner forced me to bid by doubling and I can Q with a good hand.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other options  1@D-2@C game force [ugh]   or 1@D-1N [natural, non force  OY]|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: they are behind in a match with 10 bds only to go - logic often therefore goes by the wall|pg||
nt|roswolf: still no adventures today|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a sllight variation here but another push|pg||
nt|psyck: needed @c7432  to defeat|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is fine, is not going all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Science of Bidding Mediocre 8 Card Suits     won't be on your bookstand anytime soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   what does   1@D-3@C//3N-4@C   show/ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably the north hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of 3@C=invitational [ so non-forcing]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice from high above  commenting on how Jacobus very capable of @HJ false card |pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  on the other hand , you did push your opponent to the 3 lewel |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|kjadams: neither diamonds nor hearts a happy contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Robinson would prefer a much faster pace|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too deep  but would be interesting if Jacobus duck @DQ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but otherwise i agree  3 flaws is to many  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|rmb1: More IMPs to Allfrey on board 6, 3Dx-4 by NS when EW here were in 5@C-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Gold-Forrester going to get coffee|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd6 e/w in the other room got caught badly and went fpr -800 nv|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is fizzling out - Allfrey will win the match and the event and will play in the Camrose etc - well done|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  given the spade holding is it is guess.  north has to have 6 queens to respond to the opener.   unless he did it on Kd and Qs only.....but that means south opened with a 10 count.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  3 queens|pg||
pc|h3|nt|atlantajon:  not 6|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  sure, any odds-against actions will have its successes. comments about strategy and theory here are meant to be independent of actual results on individual boards. any preempt can work|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kjadams: He could be playing against Feldman.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the duck was a legitimate possibility but jacobus probably did not expect a singleton given the ace opening lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  earlier comments about conservative BAM strategy may not apply to the trailing teams, who might go for the throat whenever an excuse presents itself. a preemptive hand always looks like such an excuse:)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
mc|10|nt|jgc: This contract is not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  now ...on this auction....north rates to hold the Qs......so it is either the end play in diamonds...or slam down the AK of spades.....whats your choice John?|pg||

nt|kjadams: but without 4H.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1D = hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S overcall please|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - did see some strange mistakes yesterday too - allowing Larsen to be in this final :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a swiss raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes!!|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3S would be shortness somewhere.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11   Meltzer opened the south hand 1N!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Larsen might just blast 5@C now|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: a skinny game in spades that figures to go down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@h wideranging hands with 1@h a limited bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 nt ..  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|mugsmate:  Well they get a chance to try again - thyey have the trump ace as an entry.|pg||
nt|chip: Seniors in ACBL events start at 55 (which is really much too young), though I think all the players here are 60+ .|pg||
mb|p|nt|jgc: Contrast Marc's 4@S bid here with his 2@C bid on the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: @S lead I should think|pg||
nt|roswolf: no scope for a hinden swing imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would expect that atypical 1N from Jacobus more than any other of our 8 players|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: well they might make a game which can be beaten Geoffrey|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that is scope for a swing|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  North may have a guess after taking the heart.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think i would pass over 3nt with south hand|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|chip: To be fair, also some great bridge last night. Feldman made a slam towards the end the commentators said couldn't be made.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: when Gold is in with @HA doesn;t he have to find @C switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope dont think so:(|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He can play his partner for the dK or the cA|pg||
nt|grebrof: a spectator has been told more or less the same as I have: "when he was born, was the last time arriving somewhere early"|pg||
nt|arunbapat: many|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  W did not lead hearts because no entry, plus fear of blowing a trick in the suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|mugsmate:  He'll probably duck one heart to get a signal.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He has.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|chip: NS need to lead spades to take out dummy's entry. Not easy (and not being done).|pg||
pc|cT|nt|grebrof: now the @ds are gone|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  thus trying instead to attack dummy's possible entry to club suit which looks to be breaking badly|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|atlantajon:  that was interesting|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chip: Declarer has a guess here since S could have Jxxxx instead of Axxxx (W knows S has the AW of clubs). Good guess.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|copeyj: well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: simples|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Good technique from Gold.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what bids were available -- but O'Rourke PASS seems very deep here|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d ruff and endplay S - bridge is easy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|grebrof: another low @h will still keep communications|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chip: Kib notes S didn't have to show the club Q, so probably should get the hearts right.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: hey difficults|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  often with that club combination S would duck the first club to retain communications. but here that is no use as a D will bhe taking entry off dummy right away. more important to drop stiff honor in E if one is there|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|copeyj: can make now|pg||
nt|copeyj: K@C ruff @C KJ@S pitching a @D and claim|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @h play from N must have been count, so I think S should have played one more|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: (3@S)-3N range is HUGE   so very real chance of missing slam with her collection|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|copeyj: there we go Geoffrey - your hand with no scope for a swing produced a game for Hinden|pg||
pc|h2|nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmm a misdefence from n/s a rtare event:)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfd: break time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 11   Larsen transfers to 3@C then raises to 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense tougher with West on lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentator just reminded his audience that Mark Feldman is father of Jason Feldman - a key player in the great web site  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 5@C  @SJ lead  so probably 5@C-1 in other room   [discard @D  lose 2@H & trump]|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|bagman: S has a devalued @HQ to go with his clubs|pg||

nt|psyck: could get too high here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: tempting|pg||

nt|grebrof: even I wouldnt have bid 3@s - even thou your P might have some aces and will lift, where does all those @cs go|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S looks fairly easy but on heart lead there are complications|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4d alerted by Pollack, not by Feldman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: when the opponents are bidding, you can play closer to double dummy and bid lighter games.|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one maybe a hair too light, but lucky lie of cards...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can certainly make 3|pg||
nt|chip: I think XX was like a NT bid (values, but only 2 spades).|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|grebrof: 2@cs - 1@h - 1ruff - hmmm|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jgc: 4@S is a maginal vulnerable contract here but they won't reach it|pg||
nt|grebrof: isnt it always 9|pg||
nt|chip: On a D or spade lead the club ruff goes away.|pg||
nt|psyck: this will be ducked & that would take the contract a couple down|pg||
nt|psyck: could even be more down depending on declarers line...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  3S non forcing with both opponents bidding is a perfectly normal treatment|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  And indeed is what they play.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west hasnt shown his 2 suiter - i would have bid 4@H instead of double|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 8, 4@h made by EW.  Apparently North lead @SA and south played K from Kx (?)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|grebrof: it us understandable that E makes this call thou - the @h suit could easily be better - not this time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|atlantajon:  should be 10 tricks|pg||

nt|grebrof: I get some messages about N might be QTxx in @s - thats the reason I would vote for the cut in @s - only when S has the Q alone or Qx were N made some strange nt-bid that would ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: been wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Most of the delay was Boyd's|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  1d..1s...1nt...newminor...then game|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - he was only in 2@s, so I guess he didnt see the danger or didnt think long enough|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: 5@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if pollack ends up on lead might even underlead spades|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  or 1nt|pg||
nt|grebrof: opposed to the other table I still agree with those that taking the cut in @s was the percentage play|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: not sure what I was saying there, but - I get votes for not thinking long enough :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  2h is some sort of D raise I guess|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: another part score swing possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: jumpfit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'd still like to see what north bids after 4@S-P-P|pg||
nt|grebrof: weak in @s or @d-raise?|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we can play Bergen as well |pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: or fitjump as they even call it|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: the inv minor bid at the other table might have been easier for EW to end in 3nt, but we will see|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure about their structure, but seems E might bid 2N with a spade stop and decent opening bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, he  didnt bid 2nt last times, is 3nt then right this time?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  right.....now east as to guess about a source of tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: strong raise they tell me here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: E/W ARE COASTING ON EMPTY -NO SPARK AT ALL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12   where O'Rourke passed (3@S)-3N    Meltzer took slightly different view    JUMPED to 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: aha - proved wrong once again|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  he hates it if west has KQxx of D and AQ of clubs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: ugh|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  KQxxx that is|pg||
nt|chip: 3D was probably a minumum and 3H and ask.|pg||
nt|psyck: Fit Jumps are more often palyed by passed hands or in competition, rarely in such cases|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: 3@S seems dangerous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: my misclick|pg||
nt|chip: 1D was precision, so 3D showed a real D suit.  To be fair, 3N is not exactly laydown (if spades were 5-3 would go down).|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, there are many layouts where 3nt wouldnt be right - maybe thats why he should have bid 2nt first|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, best to describe your hand and leave to partner.|pg||
nt|chip: Though inviting with the W hand a bit conservative too. Not sure how light they open (if light, then E should accept I think).|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kjadams: Q asks for attitude on the Jack.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that happens often|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  LOL|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think you should play transfers over 3nt overcall, so there is something in between pass and 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: especially to me|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, they slam is not great|pg||
nt|chip: A lot of bidding for two hands without much.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  or is a mini-spinter ?  kibz might be right|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|mugsmate:  3D is a normal contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - I guess 2nt would show a decent opener|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i agree Martin   but they still might get there|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|grebrof: which he has|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chip: gave E a chance to double several things, so easier for W to lead a D.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: a learned kib says 3@d asked & 3@h showed a balanced min|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  rehi all, sorry was disconnected|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jgc: After the lead it is really routine|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: or some machinery to learn about flavor of the 3N bid|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  ok ok It was a limited spilnter  , makes sense |pg||
pc|h4|nt|grebrof: balanced fitjump and minimum - thats new to me :)|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, rather, 3@d showed min, 3@h asked, & 3@s showed bal...|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok - they landed in a good contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: ok another push|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|ritong: besides of these tactical considerations, i do not think he has a clearcut action here|pg||
nt|kareno: Good play, the eight, telling north to unblock. But he doesn't.|pg||

mc|7|nt|kareno: As east I would be more inclined to run if south doubled than north.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 4 rounds   1) Cayne  11.34  2) Welland 9.59  3) Grue 8.25|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Bessis made a reasonable X with the clubs sitting over and having the @SA; N's double might have been based on previous boards (aka tilt)|pg||
pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players taking a break atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they just returned |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the 6 imp lead really belongs to O'Rourke|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  back and forth|pg||
nt|chip: So the lead flips again.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@cs was as Krishna says, not a fitjump, but the sequence after found S with a balanced minumum - here more tricks in @s NS|pg||
mb|1H|nt|grebrof: yepp|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's why we say  keep your seatbelt on until play comes to complete stop|pg||
mb|2H|nt|atlantajon:  one of the specs...asked me why run from 3nt.  I was explaining that this is not BAM...or match points....therefore an 8 card major fit is a safer.....most of the time|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: but now you can see match effectively over as no way for kasle to gain on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a great comeback for Larsen team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O'Rourke wins the other semi-final|pg||
nt|jgc: Hmm - I don't get 1@S|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Marc is getting bold here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D drury?!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/2 must be forcing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   other room has finished play|pg||
nt|chip: O'rourke beat Morse in last year's final.|pg||
nt|grebrof: like when they dont play the last session?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/2 means  2-over-2    i.e. new suit after 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: and now "everyone" watching is probably right it was only 10 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|jgc: 12 HCP outside @C and at least 3 card-support for any othe rsuit - I'm a doubler|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  got off the hook....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  K & R 22: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A543+AK83+A6+AQ4 |pg||
nt|kjadams: He had 2N available as 4 card raise with shortness.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  might be making with that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: All I can say is WOW!|pg||
nt|grebrof: there was this german pair that argued so much, they had to stop playing a session already started (which they normally never do)|pg||
nt|chip: After being conservative last hand, see if they can stay low here when it is right.|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are long days for operators too - and remember this is not official|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: board 62 makes only 4 will correct shortly|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: how about the way they played it at 58?|pg||
nt|psyck: with the match so tight, every imp matters :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I got some messages there too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator Dan (excellent work)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  actiontime   Geir might pass |pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: on  13  where Feldman didn't bid    Krekorian did transfer with @SKQJ @HJxxxx @Dxx @CT9x   but they stopped in 2@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - its almost MPs now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|kjadams: the singleton diamond would not have gotten them to game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to all the spectators for their comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks always fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think their 2@D opener rules out many of the hands that give Pollack good shot at game|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  this will bring it close again....as they tried 3nt in other room|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: note the distortion needed with 2 way stayman, 2@H equivalent of 2@D in regular Drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O"Rourke 129 ,Lall 95|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: some play all new suits forcing after an overcall, but i agree with kaplan rule only 2/2 forcing|pg||
nt|chip: and they do.. I think a D shift now might beat 2H.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|mugsmate:  I was having a sidebet with Hedy over whether he'd cue opposite a passed hand.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D sign-off in 4@H |pg||
nt|mugsmate:  She won.|pg||
nt|chip: North is hoping for Ax of spades in partner I guess.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: 2 way drury i mean :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|mugsmate:  He doesn't want to pick up any possible trump queen in his partner's hand or lead away from a King into a very strong hand.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d8|nt|grebrof: this late in the match, its dangerous to stay out of the games that makes - not that this is an obvious one to be in|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mugsmate:  Allerton may have deduced the spade King was more likely to be with south because of that club lead.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|kjadams: true, though finding the 4-4 heart fit not often needed given the 5-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|grebrof: a @c lead is often good - cause sometimes P cant bid them when he has them |pg||
pc|h9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jgc: As I said before Jake is a GREAT pro|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mugsmate:  With no spade King, perhaps south would have prefered to lead spades.|pg||

nt|chip: O'rourke likely to pick up 3 imps on the hand EW were -200 in 3N to make the match tighter.|pg||

mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  Marc should pick up the whole S suit now|pg||

pc|d6|nt|grebrof: his P could have had a better entry no matter if he passed the 2@h or not I guess|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, didn't matter much, not too much difference beteween @d partial making or @c contract -1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: 4nt may be forward going but what does it ask for, not clear he only needs diamond control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: players commenting on the strength of robinson's dummy. "wow!"|pg||
nt|kjadams: if 4N forward going, not sure what Robinson was waiting for.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW were near perfect till this last board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for a change i am in the right time zone|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I like winning the AH and cashing C then leading small Diamond.|pg||
nt|chip: If declarer guesses well can always make.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi:  if W held spades instead of hearts it is more likely he would have responded 2C|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  very tempting to bid 5C, but the 4H call could have been viewed as a daunting indication of bad heart split, and meanwhile W has more than adequate defense for a PH|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|mugsmate:  Well, if that's a singleton and the diamond is wrogn he has to rise. His problem is there is no entry to dummy after drawing trumps.|pg||
