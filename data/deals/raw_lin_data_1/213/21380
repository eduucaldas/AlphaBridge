pc|h6|pc|s6|nt|henryb:  Three point ranges are fine when there is an invitation available, not so when there is not.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  So I play 2!n = 21-22, 2@c-2@d-2!n = 23-24, and Kokish = 25+ and gf|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I have 20 and partner can't respond to an opening 1 bid we are quite likely to be short of game-going values|pg||

nt|dslee: i am not sure if sumit and laltu plays 1@D opening as 4 cards|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@C indicates an inclination to @S|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@D would likely be 4@S+5@D|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|nsriram:  first he has to check for 5-3 spade fit which is most prefered game|pg||

pc|s2|nt|raghavan: Live Video by Buddy shah - first time in India great|pg||

nt|nsriram:  you are at the one level, running should not be a big concern|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, just to reach the right spot sri - its always useful to be self sufficient or bid with a fit|pg||
nt|nsriram:  if you are playing fit jumps then 2S would be good, has some preemptive value too|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  depends what 4@c asked and what 4@d said|pg||

nt|sanjib: interesting hand..|pg||
nt|sanjib: actually slam there with @D 3-3 guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  I would have put money on Jaggy to make that|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, he was at 5 level...was not going to make that!|pg||
nt|tullo: is railways running away with the cup, or will we see a more inspired display by manyawar in the next set?|pg||
mb|p|nt|subhranp: true but on a spade lead, there is a problem|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no indeed E to blame it wasn't that great a hand|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|tullo: and specially with next 3 boards giving the railways some extra imps|pg||
mb|2H|nt|nsriram:  but vul is not good for N-S to try 5 minor|pg||
nt|dslee: NS has a good sac vs EW game|pg||
nt|sanjib: Thats it.. have to play trump Q then 3 rounds of @d pitching a @s|pg||

nt|andyv:  some version of dont?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dslee: why not?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|nsriram:  pseudo sacrifice because it makes!!!|pg||
nt|dslee: with @S and @H out in the field - Dr is surely going to have m |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  still a big risk Deb |pg||
nt|dslee: yes, risk of loosing 3 IMP vs Gaining 7|pg||
nt|subhranp: contract is kind of wrong sided, North has natural spade lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  loser in each suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andyv:  and possible 2 in @s suit|pg||
nt|tullo: think raju's initial passed did not help in this auction|pg||
nt|tullo: so now had to eneter again|pg||
nt|tullo: always best to bid ur hand first oppotunity|pg||
nt|tullo: otherwise u just doing catching up|pg||
nt|tullo: and as they say " 2 wrongs don't make a right"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dslee: go for the latter|pg||
nt|dslee: you loose at the most 3 if at all|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ah dont then (modified of course)|pg||
