pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|panja: this is not the best lead for defence, but certainly E was right to choose it..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  that was preemptive hoping the opponents have a game. Why they should have a game when you have defensive values and partner opened is unclear to me|pg||

nt|aramesh_:  Hi Gary wlc:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  I have a general comment: on high NT openings, e.g. 2N, 2@c-2@d-2!n, and this sequence, I believe that you should have a two point, not a three point range.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ara and everyone|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|henryb:  Three point ranges are fine when there is an invitation available, not so when there is not.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  So I play 2!n = 21-22, 2@c-2@d-2!n = 23-24, and Kokish = 25+ and gf|pg||
nt|henryb:  If I have 20 and partner can't respond to an opening 1 bid we are quite likely to be short of game-going values|pg||

nt|vugraphztj: yes|pg||

nt|nsriram:  4H is safe. defense cannot get a C ruff and setup a D trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dslee: Sitting NS is Dr K Srinivas from Hydrabad and Vijay Devadass from Chennai - sitting EW, I dont think they need any introductions - the Indian pair in Dhampur, Sumit and ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|panja: 4@S is best played from E hand|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|dslee: 2@H by sumit is 5-4 in Major - improvised it a little here|pg||
nt|nsriram:  4H can make but not likely to get there|pg||
nt|raghavan: will they reach slam|pg||
nt|panja: and it would be interesting to see if EW can manage that|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nkgupt: and systemically he invited 4@s not 3nt|pg||
nt|nsriram:  especially since he is showing only 4 hearts now|pg||
nt|dslee: might get in there - laltu has a raise now|pg||
nt|dslee: only hinderance from Laltu is his singleton @S|pg||
nt|dslee: probably in his thought he might feel that @S is not joining - hence there might not be a game|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: thats  the q:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: 4S is to play here 3S is to look further|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: with 3@S  now  Anal  should be   thinking slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|henryb:  Well, partner could raise a direct 2@s to 3 with that, and as Hamman said, if you need me to hold a perfect minimum, the odds are that I do not have it!|pg||
nt|nsriram:  knowing about that 5th H is important|pg||
nt|dslee: well, I think it deserves a raise - 6-8 points 4@H +5@S - 3 would be sure with his points in other suits|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kiwibridge: S almost cost it with the large @D pitches|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphztj: raju thinking  still|pg||

nt|subhranp: laltu has a very powerful hand, close to 2c|pg||
nt|vugraphztj: break 2mins.......|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @H was led early and 3NT did make for 12 back to railways|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think N fell asleep on that one since E played a @c to the J...N has to know what the @c situation is|pg||
nt|andyv:  E had to win the @s on board and immediately lead a @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  the trouble was that N knew E couldn't have more than 3@hs so it should have been safe to go up with the Ace of @hs and continue with the spades.|pg||
nt|panja: 6@H if EW could escape @D lead...|pg||

mb|2H!|an|!s+m|nt|subhranp: if they play this 2h by sumit as weak raise, Laltu may not try for slam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja: 8 if there EW can secure a @D ruff |pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|subhranp: 5d bid will make it easy for East to bid the slam|pg||
nt|subhranp: he would know that partner is likely to be ruffing diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: 2@H here is like Michaels..showing @S and another suit perhaps...|pg||

nt|panja: now, N hand is not really suitable for a 5@S bid...|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|nsriram:  good lead|pg||
nt|dslee: for figo and Manoj, they play precision so 1NT would be a natural opening there|pg||

nt|raghavan: may go to 5|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|subhranp: this result will not be easy to duplicate|pg||

pc|h2|nt|nkgupt: multi will do well on the hand ...6@s on from E and 6@h from W:)|pg||
nt|nsriram:  declarer should be held to 4 spades and 2 hearts|pg||

nt|dslee: i am not sure if sumit and laltu plays 1@D opening as 4 cards|pg||

nt|dslee: 3@D would likely be 4@S+5@D|pg||

nt|dslee: both red position, people would do on a 3rd hand opening :)|pg||
nt|dslee: seems funny, but the rule of the day|pg||
nt|nsriram:  they will probably find 5D then|pg||
nt|nsriram:  now they had them in the right spot|pg||

nt|nsriram:  and no support|pg||
pc|dK|nt|raghavan: Live Video by Buddy shah - first time in India great|pg||

pc|c7|nt|dslee: back|pg||
nt|dslee: rule wise, its a fit in the primary suit - if sumit if void, they can run back to @D|pg||
nt|dslee: deal 6, thanks to precision, its a pickup for IM|pg||
nt|nsriram:  you are at the one level, running should not be a big concern|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dslee: yes, just to reach the right spot sri - its always useful to be self sufficient or bid with a fit|pg||
nt|nsriram:  if you are playing fit jumps then 2S would be good, has some preemptive value too|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends what 4@c asked and what 4@d said|pg||

mb|p|nt|subhranp: true but on a spade lead, there is a problem|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|tullo: and specially with next 3 boards giving the railways some extra imps|pg||
mb|d|nt|nsriram:  but vul is not good for N-S to try 5 minor|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|nsriram:  still a big risk Deb |pg||
nt|dslee: yes, risk of loosing 3 IMP vs Gaining 7|pg||
nt|subhranp: contract is kind of wrong sided, North has natural spade lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  loser in each suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and possible 2 in @s suit|pg||
nt|tullo: think raju's initial passed did not help in this auction|pg||
nt|tullo: so now had to eneter again|pg||
nt|tullo: always best to bid ur hand first oppotunity|pg||
nt|tullo: otherwise u just doing catching up|pg||

mb|p|nt|dslee: go for the latter|pg||
