nt|vugraphznt: Hi all and welcome to this match from Veldhoven. Iceland vs. China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Play will start in a minute -- Einarsson and Jorgensen are discussing their defense|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: against the chinese system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|barnets:  morning all from florida|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy v USA in the Bermuda Bowl has a good ring to it. These events are enhanced by the decades of history behind them.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am watching the live video stream, but it is from the other table at the moment.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Utaly picked up three big wins on the first day, but they had some harder fights yesterday.|pg||
nt|hlortz: we are back again it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: witam ponownie|pg||
nt|hlortz: good evening David its 30 am inn seattle|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Hi all, we start now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: There we go|pg||
nt|ady: still leading?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphznt: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|gracelin: H all|pg||
nt|brolucius: China beat them by 1 IMP in a great match. (There was a very rare vice squeeze on the last board - worth looking up in the VG records).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|hlortz: er 130 i mean\|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to play 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score in diamonds  looks best|pg||
nt|brolucius: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|brolucius: .. for the live video pictures|pg||
nt|ady: could Bocchi get over ambitious in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: przekaz wideo z pokoju otwartego: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live|pg||
nt|kit: looks like we are starting with a very flat 4@S hand -- I'm sure there will be more interesting deals coming.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||
nt|gracelin: we sstart the match with a slam hand.  6S is cold and 7S on the D finesse which works.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy is now lying first comfortably with an average of 24 VP in the first 4 round.  China lies 13th at moment.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 c is 54 11-15, qualsiasi rever senza 3|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello all|pg||
nt|ady: sorry good evening for you|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D via a negative double is weaker than a direct 2@D on the previous round.|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: pokoj otwarty rozpoczyna gre z kilkuminutowym opoznieniem|pg||
nt|hlortz: they play strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there is a double dummy defense to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west considering   will likely raise in spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2d must be a relay and 2H probably shows 5D/4H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|ady: lost of wast paper in  south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gerbrand will enter the names asap|pg||
nt|ady: tricky for south    good opening bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|ady: defence could of course go wrong in 6 hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: GA all|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Daniel   Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi david daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: Jaap, David:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: hoi Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha great hoi Gerbrand:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
nt|ady: with spades breaking well there will be no problem|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi will have to cover, giving declarer the heart discard.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: to powa¿ny przeciwnik, który siê powa¿nie liczy w walce o awans do ósemki |pg||
nt|ady: not even necessary to do that       east unable to ruff any diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually they do not have a misunderstanding, wooldridge just giving all the info he can|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1 on the baad diamond split|pg||
nt|ady: will Bocchi try 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: even before madala asked anything about 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: A messy start to the match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good safe 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South commenting it was to difficult, north you probably did well|pg||

nt|kit: Not clear to me how he worked out to not cover.|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps he decided his partner wouldn't be leading from Kxx on this auction.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lets see if they find the "killing defence" here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apart from the club suit all looks well|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes and 5@D down on club leads so 3n the best spot|pg||
nt|psyck:  Results & Live Scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: lets try again :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: since they are in GF tempo, mabe south will rebid is spade suit and get a raise on the way to 6S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is easier now east has bid diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: and I guess thats not DD :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes that may work also|pg||
nt|ady: an extra diamond trick on that lead as well|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: so the 4NT might be Turbo, showing odd numbers of key-card, in the meantime cue in H.|pg||
nt|lechcold: Grzegorz hamowa³ jak móg³, ale Krzysztof mia³ za du¿¹ kartê....|pg||

pc|d4|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: but if east has one heart and two clubs you have to win first heart|pg||
nt|hlortz: just a hand for overtricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphznt: and now focus is on Einarsson|pg||
nt|ady: life made very difficult for n/s|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Our valiant operator is trying to recover from the crash (which of course was not his fault at all).|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||
nt|ady: I feel this should have been 300 the other way|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: declarer may have a guess at the end whether West has 3 or 4 cards heart.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson is now shaking his head -- he now knows he did the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gulyas: S knew his @SKQ was worthless, and he had no ace, so maybe his hand is not worth much|pg||
nt|ady: I am told 6@H in OR   A@S lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ruffed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has to block the diamonds so he can take another spade finesse, so he will make only 11 tricks.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|ady: only 7 obvious tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I'm surprised Stansby selling out to 3@C with a void.  Seems right to compete with 3@D.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: dubion cannot know east hand   of 7-4  or would surely correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West said 6-5 probably|pg||
nt|juror1: mo¿na obejrzeæ naszych w otwartym http://wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised he didn't bid Stayman with that hand|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: @h shift ought to get south off ay type of endplay|pg||
nt|hlortz: /any|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
nt|kit: It took a different lead to defeat this -- but E-W should be in 3@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H best|pg||
nt|hlortz: or perhaps a @D ruff for north?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
nt|ady: not best  as J@D will set up the 9    and low diamond will in affent mean north ruffing a loser  and then trumps 2-2|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-USA 2 seniorzyù|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
nt|barnets: works quite well|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry, hard to see the claims|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: And E is now in |pg||
nt|barnets: to force dummy|pg||
nt|idc: and there is a link there to his partner's profile, thanks to Brazil for the info|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bit weak of Gosney - Edgtton to pass this out|pg||
nt|famus: these US youngsters have improved tremendously--I remember Lall being there in Bejing Olympiad playing for US juniors--come a long way|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
nt|kit: Likely headed for 3NT -- the fate of that is not clear.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: could be 6 imps if both 2@h and 2s make|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes this is a team of [relatively] young stars|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|famus: @ds wud b the best lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: trump leads are best and so it was|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|famus: gr8--Grue heard us--prblm for declarer |pg||
nt|ady: bad club split will beat this|pg||
nt|ady: I think down 2|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats my guess -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not possible to see what they write down|pg||
mb|3S!|an|strong|nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the defense should be able to establish enough black-suit winners before declarer can set up the diamonds, but they will have to be careful.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
nt|kit: Nice choice to get to 5@D -- that will probably come home, although not clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  5 H's, 1@S, 1@C and 4 @D's (ruff one club in dummy, draw trump)|pg||
nt|kit: In principle declarer would have 3 diamond winneers in North, 1 ruff in South, 5 hearts, and two black aces, but club leads by defense could cause problems.|pg||
mb|6D|nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
nt|famus: bad everthing split i think-even trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Well, that call undid the good work of finding the diamond fit.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
nt|kit: Since declarer needs to ruff 1 club in dummy, it looks like his only hope is KQ doubleton of diamonds.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: finess the spade   and get J@C right|pg||

nt|fluffy: Hey hey|pg||

nt|rhelle:  East can only cross with a trump|pg||

nt|famus: Lall gotta underlead his @s for Grue to play another @D|pg||
nt|ady: otherwise down 1|pg||
nt|kit: In the other room N-S stopped in 2@H, making bidding the slam somewhat anti-percentage|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: now he does|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess he can just ruff and cash clubs then play another heart since li cant overruff or ruff anything|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S asks W about their leads when switching sut|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W tells S that they play 2.4.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W needs the @ha in south for 2 reasons now.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle:  the HQ will get ruffed|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and no attitude signals|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H has a chance, 4@S is down on the heart ruff |pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
nt|hlortz: well being from US i am rooting for them but its a tough road|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a normal 4@H hand -- should present no problems in bidding or play|pg||
nt|kit: amazingly enough, N-S stopped in 2@H in other room, so chance for big pickup for Italy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||

nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  north declined to balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Narkiewicz bardzo kaszle|pg||

nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now they can manage two heart ruffs if they diagnose the layout|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: So many plusses in bidding.|pg||

nt|hedyg:  1NT was raptor showing 4@s and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 5@C XC was a beauty play by Drijver in OR b2|pg||

nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Doesn't look likely.|pg||
nt|ady: careful defence will beat 3NT  2 hearts 1 club and 2 other aces|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: may cash club and try diamond to the 10|pg||

nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: dont think so Barnet   favour diamond to the 10|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lechcold: profesjona³:)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: in any case thats 3 spades 1 heart 1 club and A@D to lose|pg||

nt|rhelle:  that would be useful refinement|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and stops at 12|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed. It could be 7 if @h are 3-3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|boedhy:  no|pg||

nt|rhelle:  NL is taking a bid lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: italians always seem to be there at the end|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: south should force this to slam i think|pg||

nt|famus: I'm gettin msgs from involved kibtz--they got their money onn these boys winning--that b a gr8 morale booster for youngsters the world over|pg||
nt|kit: This is a bold bid at adverse vulnerability, but it is effective as it drives E-W too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: will west try science or a simple 5@d?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes @D the old joke what do u call an 8 card suit? trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  an aggressive 5@C works.  Kit, you must love this :)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for Stansby, but he would have done a lot better doubling and collecting 500|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||

nt|famus: how much is 6@s costing|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: So another 10 IMP's for Italy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||

nt|ady: now 13 tricks|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||

nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, it will be 12-14|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is an excellent interview to Bocchi on the net.  I just don't know how to copy to long address to present to you.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||

nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||

nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes so no @C lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: @DQ lead looks normal, then game is cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S forcing 1n 2nd neg like 0-5 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pass non-vul|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
nt|idc: after a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that is true|pg||
nt|gulyas: here she comes|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has plenty of problems in 3@H here.  Play at trick 1 itself is far from clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Due to the entry situation he will probably play hearts leading them twice from dummy, which is not a success on this layout.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
nt|kit: He will use this entry to make a spade play I'm pretty sure.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
nt|ady: good lead     may be able to force and entry to west hand in diamonds for a heart finesse |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
nt|pawel90: niestety treflowy tu obk³ada³|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
nt|famus: gets an additional entry|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides have used trump leads on defense well|pg||
nt|athene:  hi :)|pg||
nt|athene:  sry private :)|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 9@S entry   so should make 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|idc: Now declarer can claim, overtrick if @sK right|pg||

pc|h6|nt|malpaluche: @d j'aurais compris|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||

nt|jkotor: 4@s na przeciwnej, ³adnie naszych wyblokowali|pg||

nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||
nt|kit: will just have easy squeeze -- will not need to finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the t/o X was left in for 300 OR|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||
pc|sA|nt|barnets: he would be down|pg||

nt|barnets: on a spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp for USA|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess he will cross ruff to 10 tricks for the same imp as 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|twcho: best if EW plays non-leaping Michael here|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to decide if he plays for the @HA to be onside, or the @Ds to be good, but this is better, of course|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he got the hearts right considering the entry problems.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: club back too late|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is happy with 9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: now he might reject the H finesse for a safe 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: When declarer runs the trumps West will have to keep the @SA and so unguard the diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would allow declarer to pick up the suit when West held x-x-x (and had to throw one) and East started with Q-x. |pg||
nt|santyclz: China took a 5 imp lead when on bd 2 w chose to lead the @dk, s ruffed the 3rd round high and finessed into the stiff @cq.|pg||

nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||

nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||

nt|hlortz: i have this sticky n key lol|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: if it goes just something like 1@S 2@H [gf] 2@S 3@H, then north might find a 4@D cue or something to show a good hand for hearts |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North has a monster hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is why when you are in 2s you draw trumps and claim 3, so you dont do something stupid on the important boards|pg||
nt|ady: nothing nuch on here|pg||
nt|idc: So we have taken just 55 mins to play half the boards at this table, plenty of time left|pg||
nt|jaapfr: open room time problems are expected (only 3,5 boards played in 50 minutes)|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!S|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I doubt Campos, Villas-Boa have ever gotten a slow play warning, much less a penalty!|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
nt|barnets: looks ok to me|pg||
nt|idc: E-W task here to stop in time, since 4@s is as high as you'd want to get|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Brasilian player as a rule tend to be very fast.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad pics on the news, the south island of NZ is under flood waters|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||

nt|jkotor: ale z Kysiem to Jac gra³, ¿e to 4@d i 5+stary|pg||
nt|kit: Same 3@C call as made at other table.  I don't understand it.  It seem like game very unlikely opposite mere 2@C rebid.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
nt|famus: -1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||

nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
nt|kit: Not much can happen here -- 5 unavoidable losers.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|garden2005: Kuma kamufluje -1100 i nas zagaduje|pg||
mc|8|nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess the hearts|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT is just marked as strong raise on the cards, but must be GF or South would not have bid just 3@H. |pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt hasn't got many tricks even if the @DQ isn't found|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually 3nt is doomed anyway but the diamond makes it quicker :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: the main clue being north will already have shown two aces|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  6@ss fails on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system say 5 card major ask GF'|pg||
nt|kit: Good shift by Martel.  He can see that declarer, known to have a minor, needs to ruff clubs in dummy.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he didn't seem to think it was that hard :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play a (mostly) game-forcing 2/1|pg||
nt|idc: and no doubt the sequence to 3@h will be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: South has bid this as a minimum opener with little slam interest, so North may give up now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: and what if the answer showed @S|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: W has a tough lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to avoid leading a @D to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg:  might lead @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: that could work|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
nt|idc: Had South tried a courtesy cue bid of 4@d (as he might) then I think they would have gone on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After 2 boards with good chances for USA, one with a chance for Brasil.|pg||
nt|gulyas: anything but a @D really:)|pg||
nt|famus: @C double hook gives him 9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boedhy:  2@c minors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oh, that lead will make EW trump short|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  especially as the West hand is dummy, so the defence is much easier that way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D lead very unlikely imo|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rensph:  quiet 1NT for EW here, diamonds break 4-4 so will end up with 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south thinks to overtake and shift if north leads from doubleton K10, south has no entry to eastablish his spade anyway.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hlortz: so did we lose the comparisons hen we crashed earlier?|pg||
nt|famus: @s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead from N - and easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W pokazal 4333 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer might have been better off setting up a sure spade trick.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||
nt|famus: wht a lead Bocchi made--amazing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I am back after an alarming computer crash. All is OK again, thank goodness. Did I miss anything good? |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||

nt|kit: Martel fails to take his plus score -- big swing on his decision.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: What would he bid with 7-8 and a doubleton spade?|pg||
nt|kit: he would bid 2@H, transfer to 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. It is good to have such accurate methods.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS conducted a Gazzilli auction here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C is normal response to forcing 1NT or any 16-17 up hand, 2D is 8 p and GF|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@h shows 3 cards in @h|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s is probably natural|pg||

nt|brolucius: For the past few weeks I have been doing voice commentary instead of tap-in commentary. It is good to see that I can still type OK. |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That has the benefit of a rebid of opener's suit showing 6.  Using the rebid of opener's suit as the |pg||
nt|idc: The 2@s bid in this sequence is invitational, 5-cards @s and unbalanced|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@S was a fine bid by south|pg||
nt|barnets: holding just J high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: he kept a grandslam option open|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't have risked it with those trumps!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 5@S was less serious try then 5NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: than|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bob for the bidding explanations. How they find time for it, as well as putting in all the bids and plays, I will never know.|pg||
nt|ady: what is best lone in 7    ruff 4 clubs in south hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: with such good trumps perhaps north should have accepted the invitation to the party|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, east decide that slam is quite far-stretching and simply end the auction by bidding 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to bidding many slams is who has control of the high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: north knows his partner has invited a grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "bucket bid" is another popular method.|pg||
nt|idc: And I don't think it implies holding hearts as well as the spades|pg||
nt|ady: now can beat this|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah a safety play|pg||
nt|famus: going down cud b a big swing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: East (Sementa) lead @sA - but then in trick 2 @DA :(:(|pg||
nt|famus: cud b a swing|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame him.  He was looking at his 2 Aces, and these Chinese did bid slam off 2 Aces before.|pg||
nt|barnets: and he has AKQ of trumps|pg||
nt|twcho: just a matter of overtricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: they stayed ouy of trouble|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, even 4NT is not cold|pg||
nt|twcho: the 1@c opening has dissuaded north from leading his stronger minor|pg||
nt|twcho: and this lead immediately give declarer the 9th trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: so 11 to 14 IMP on way for China|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||
nt|gracelin: As north has not shown his 6th spade here, East may not find the killing defense.  However, without cashing SA, I thk 6C is still in trouble.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he has shown 6sp and 4H already|pg||
nt|pelu: will S pass to 4@s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t thk North will ass, South has shown 8+|pg||
nt|ady: not enough entries to ruff 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how important the 4@C bid was set the slam ball rolling. If you could only bid 4@C with a club control, it would be a tricky time for North.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you were joking.  |pg||
nt|ady: no safety   3 hearts 1 spade and 1 club|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|boedhy:  still @h stop|pg||
nt|gracelin: pass|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rensph:  North might very well have bid 6NT after discovering @SA and the lack of a club stopper in partner's hand|pg||
nt|famus: he knows 11@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: but could be UNsafety play|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: ruffing 3 diamonds in runs risk of 10@H making for defence   I think small slam is enough|pg||
nt|kit: some suggest West should have doubled 4@S -- but the 4@H call might have been a lot weaker since it is preemptive|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: what about N to X 2@C?|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: "He writes books about bridge, he can't possible be that stupid..."|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein handled the spade suit quite effectively|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: on this hand the @DKQ fall in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec needs only ruff 2 diamnds|pg||
nt|barnets: but that is fortunate|pg||
nt|ady: but grand slam not good enough |pg||

nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||
nt|idc: But then if that is a return short suit try, South will be discouraged|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E thinks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, am told 3@c is forced relay, then opener makes short suit try|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
nt|famus: 6@s does come home --i think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||

nt|jkotor: seniorzy taryfa w plecy na Duñczyków, tylko panie dobrze w tej rundzie|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
nt|famus: ya-4-@s stops it and a top @C ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: ty but then E 3@H not 4@H Gerbrand?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: nice invention/convention:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c4|nt|pelu: thats a mistake by S - sh take @DA and play 3x@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1 imp if he makes 4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Now will strip out hearts and clubs, and then try to duck a spade to West|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: By eliminating the side suits, he can survive when East holds @SQ-x.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Sementa decided his hand was worth game in @H, covered the black losers, nice @H fit and Kx in @d look pretty good|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gracelin: instead of taking 2 D tricks, Madala takes none by this defense.  He is not headed for -2|pg||
nt|idc: USA avoided the slam on failing finesse on Bd 8, so their lead up to 21 IMPs|pg||

nt|athene: after 1@S - 1NT, how many clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||
nt|famus: in 6 i think he might well lead a @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||
nt|rensph:  other table reached 3N and made it, so 7 imps to South Africa|pg||
nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
mb|2C!|an|GF|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|famus: probly xfer to NT|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks like the stopping place for e/w|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|rhelle:  2NT = balanced|pg||
nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Shi didnt dare to cue 4@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||
nt|idc: and 'weak-jump' became my nickname for a while (till I did something even worse)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||
nt|ady: may make 3@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  6@S makes on the rather fortunate heart position here, but they'll likely end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- big chance for USA1 here|pg||
nt|kit: The North hand sure doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
nt|kit: however, important for Martel not to squander 10 of hearts at trick 1!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
nt|kit: and ace asks for count or unblock I believe.  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
nt|kit: he got it right!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
pc|s6|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|hlortz: yes with both k and j diamonds with south i dont see how to make it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
nt|idc: I still admire the auction (by both sides) up till 6@d, then perhaps South did a little too much|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer will go up with the ace|pg||
nt|twcho: but he has to choose from finessing in @c or establishing the 4th @H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: down 3, and 14 badly needed IMPs for USA1|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|idc: but perhaps we should put it down to good E-W sac causing tough problem|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As was suspected, Brasil got to 6@h on  board 10.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South found out 3@C is making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that 4@s is not making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ady: south cannot afford to discard a spade as 5 clubs and a sspade can be cashed  and south then end played with a heart|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|twcho: nice smooth duck by south in the 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nigel is a classy young player with a great future'|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The bidding is not as we see it, obviously. Our VG operator is valiantly trying to recover from the crash (which is not fault of his). |pg||

nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
nt|famus: shud read him for 7@hs with that Vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: back to the double figure swings|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||

nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|twcho: and good effort by Gosney too|pg||
nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||

nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||

nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||

nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||

nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||

nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||

nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||

nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||

nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen great operating, thanks Henry and Tommy and all spectators for great feedback|pg||
