mb|1D|nt|kjadams: Hi Kit|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: hi Kit|pg||
mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|kit: The 1@C opener could be a doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: 1@S denies a major|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: So Fleisher can be fairly confident of getting some club support|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Fleisher writing down explanations for the alerted 1s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: back to thinking now|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C looks to make.   either get the heart ruff or the spade trick, not both.|pg||
nt|kit: if E-W get to 5@D, I believe a trump lead is necessary to defeat it|pg||
nt|kjadams: spades e/w pretty good too|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C is cold -- so plenty of chance for a swing on this deal|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Fleisher thinking|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|kit: 5@S can go down on a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Geo Tislevoll stopped in 4@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: live video and voice commentary from veldhoven vugraph room   http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at bottom of that page  links to live scores|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like he should|pg||
nt|kjadams: bid this nice a slow perhaps hoping to buy the contract.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Newell thinking|pg||
nt|kit: On this auction, Kamil just might find the trump lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards placed on the table...and thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: looking at the bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 teams qualify for Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  New Zealand currently 9th place  --  i don't think they've ever made it into KO|pg||
nt|kjadams: hard to guess that 5C making when they were pushed there.|pg||
nt|kit: Kamil can project West's hand being something like what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: stil thinking..staring at the bidding board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS use standard carding   which puts them in the minority|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards are on the table....so he is not in a hurry to make a bid yet|pg||
nt|kit: it is so often wrong to compete over enemy 5-level contract, but this time it is right to do so.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: this a very important match for the kiwis...so maximum concentration required |pg||
nt|ahollan1: kit's former partner wrote a great BOLS tip on that subject|pg||
nt|kjadams: takes a trump lead and a spade duck to have a chance at 5D.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards stil on the table....do not go away|pg||
nt|kjadams: chance at beating it.|pg||
nt|kit: Could be important for USA1 also -- if they lose by a lot, they will be in some jeopardy.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Good decision -- now Kamil has to be a good opening leader.|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done bidding.  now for the defense...|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: wow...action from the first board|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: If he leads a diamond, then ducks if declarer plays a spade, it can't make.  But he failed the test.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all tables from all 3 championship events play the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes for some great comparisons|pg||
nt|kit: So New Zealand will jump off to an early lead.|pg||

nt|vugraphzny: 12 for the kiwis ...good start for our neighbours|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S= 2-8 HCP, 5+@S, aggressive style|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This time it is a pretty normal weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: purely coincidental :)|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT by North seems normal|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kjadams: and then transfer to hearts.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D transfer and DBL from Reid?|pg||
nt|kit: Kamil has a problem here -- might be right to pass, might be right to transfer|pg||
mb|3D|an|hearts|mb|d|nt|kit: Looks like they will get to the same 3@H contract reached in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Fleisher won't accept transfer now  that would show 3-fit|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: RDBL  forces transfer|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: This is resumably a repeat of the transfer -- Kamil doesn't want spade lead through North|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: best defense looks to take 2 spades, 2 clubs, 1 Diamond, 1 Heart, so push possible.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: EW use odd/even discard  and maybe o/e trick 1 also|pg||
nt|kit: down 2 seems likely -- declarer will be pinning his hopes on the club suit and will be disappointed|pg||
nt|kjadams: after bd 1, NZ moved to 8th place.  Of course a lot of bridge to go.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer trying to force the defense to lead trumps|pg||
nt|kjadams: Low from the Ace keeps control of spade while possibly allowing for later spade ruff if the hand friendlier.|pg||
nt|kit: Keep in mind the North hand is concealed, so defense doesn't really know what the threats are.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @S4 was discouraging  whether or not it showed @C ... i'm not sure|pg||
nt|kit: This is helpful to declarer -- now West needs to play ace and a heart, and I doubt if he will do that.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Fleisher closed the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: asking about the spades ten....significance and so forth|pg||
nt|kjadams: better get clubs played soon else endplay possible.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|kit: Defense had another chance, but East thought it necessary to knock ace of spades out of dummy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: But declarer is still banking on the king of club being onside|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: oh dear -- if he finesses, it is down 3|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: the hand is much easier seeing all 4 hands|pg||

pc|c5|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Barbara-wlc:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
nt|alunand14: we watching the match between England (rank 1) with Indonesia (rank 4)....|pg||
nt|mamos: this might all depend on Spades|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: just saw this one go down    Pakistan North got diamond lead   and played spade to the king and trick 2  and conceeded 2nd spade tricke and spade ruff and K@H|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ritong: de nos jours, on dit 1SA 3SA dans les deux salles et on laisse les défenseurs se débrouiller|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is easy , but 3NT on a @h lead looks hard-to-analyse - should make 3NT maybe?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|mamos: ah the defence can get a Diamond ruff now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphznz: nice start|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Inm 3NT - win @HA then spade to nine or ace - develop a 9th trick in spades while @DA is in dummy as access to long spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: hello everyone :)|pg||

nt|chmitty: les Françaises sont à 4@s sur entame @d ... 11 levées probables donc|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|drorp: seems like only shot for south is to hope parnter has J@D, i dont really know why he's still thinking... anywyaz chagas will have to unblock (which isn't that hard either)|pg||
nt|mamos: well he can see Qx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe easier now after the lead of the K|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ady: has seen the possible difficulty  and decided on the club finesse    that has resolved any problem|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|grebrof: but ok - it should be easy and it was|pg||
nt|drorp: unblocking in the 1st trick is good techqnique, if you gonna unblock better do it 1st trick possible, just to make it easier on partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: careful now|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: flip-flop the players and Kamil does NOT open the north hand|pg||
nt|kit: If Newell bids 5@S and it gets passed to Fleisher, he just might bid on with the good double fit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thru board 3   NZ has moved into 7th place|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: now newell thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their remaning matches are  Egypt and Sweden|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5 spades gets out for down 3.    hardly seems worth the risk, but its a small profit if NS do not push.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards on the table...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA1 remaining matches  Guadalupe and Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that last match should be a great show|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|kit: Note that if East does bid 5@S this improves the odds on N-S bidding the slam, since they no longer have +650 or so available.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: they don't seem to have a bid for "mixed"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=PUP 3@C  a) weak @C/@D  b) @D, some shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: plusieurs options pour joanna|pg||

nt|chmitty: 4@c pardon|pg||
nt|chmitty: et on laisse jouer 4@s du coup|pg||
nt|ritong: c est ballot|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT - prev board - running off all the @D's looks best then --- W keeps Jxx, Qx void, Jx and has one discard to make, but discards after S who has a problem|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|drorp: seems kinda scary but he does have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: dziekuje za zwrocenie uwagi|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4S cheap|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cheap save against slam- at vulnerability maybe West should join in over 1D|pg||
nt|petergill: or could simply play N for @C10, that's easy looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S = good raise|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|lechcold: w PO Jassem gra 2@S w tym rozdaniu|pg||

nt|grebrof: some think that their opps read their conventioncard and often try to "fool" the opponents - not a good idea, cause you will most times only fool your partner|pg||

nt|joanem: cue of hearts |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin thinking at the moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if 4C was key card North may reaiise she gave wrong response and bid 6C now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Levin stil thinking|pg||
nt|joanem: levin very worried about spades as no cue there?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and no sac |pg||
nt|chmitty: Espérons que Levin entame @c pour nous laisser une chance|pg||
nt|chmitty: mais je n'y crois pas|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 4 in 3NT - S can keep K10x, KJ, void, Ax, so perhaps randomly trying to guess @C10 early is the best way to go |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it also allows NS to get into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Muller doesn't have any help from NS  so has to guess @S|pg||

nt|mamos: hate 5@c there - seems better to bid 4@c the previous round  Job done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||

nt|meargent: not such a good line if @Ss ly badly|pg||

nt|sybarra: but it ace of sp with W,  now would have to deal with @D ruff |pg||

mb|1N|an|weak|nt|lechcold: tu nasi graj¹ 5@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@H sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil held too many @S to duck the Q    i think|pg||
nt|mamos: so a quietish start to the match with a few overtricks and a small partscore swing|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin, pas tout de suite|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S + @C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 4 pik? a mo¿e co innego od Piotra?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Leaping Michaels   4@D=@D and @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3H from North now standard |pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 3 nt here ++2|pg||
nt|meargent: the trick here is to avoid slam|pg||
mb|2C|an|majors|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4333 in N, not source of tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: but I think I remember n/s can open some wild nt bids |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|meargent: hopefully for NS they wont find their @D fit|pg||
nt|chmitty: c'était très dur de passer 5@h pour Joanna : en disant 5@h Sud indique seulement son envie de jouer au palier de 5|pg||
nt|ritong: l alerte de 2@h passe signifie que passe dénie 3 @ss|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mamos: partscore board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but if 4C was keycard then ideal- provided North knows about it|pg||
nt|garden2005: spójrzcie na flagi, Indonezyjki wygl¹daj¹ jak lewe Polki :) nadstawi¹ siê zaraz|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 4 in 3NT - in the 6 card ending, S has to pitch something - @HJ looks like the only chance, now declarer exits in @C and the defence is awkwardly placed. Sp perhaps no ...|pg||
nt|petergill: need to guess @C10 in 3NT on Bd 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT weak |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 5 @s pewnie powie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to mo¿e wgoniæ w szlemika i wtedy trzeba broniæ|pg||
nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||
nt|lechcold: eee co Ty, bilety powrotne i tak maj¹ pewnie zarezerwowane na 30-go|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT  F1|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 14-17 and aggressive jump by Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz  could have game force strength    [zz  A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=a) 16-19 HCP, 5+@H  b) any 20+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 50-ka albo 100-ka w zale¿nosci od prze³yku|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone (specs) would prefer to have Q of @C be q of @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: then we might be looking at a decent slam|pg||
nt|chmitty: encore 5imps qui vont partir|pg||
nt|ritong: car, avec trois @ss on contrerait " de soutien"|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S longer spades than hearts - else Mike Ware bids 2@D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: sorry na 5 to albo polska 100-ka albo rosyjskie SPGie|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Jacek cos mowi pod nosem, ze chyba mogl spasowac|pg||
nt|grebrof: as I see there are others that are more updated than me - the 5th match has suddenly appeared on the site :D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my notes stop here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: South asked about 3@S, West: let me think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play the same 1@C structure as Bertheau-Nystrom  but  i don't have those 4th bids either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from one who KNOWS     3@S=it shows 3-4 zz, 5+H, 4S, void in C|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: is what west explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source confirms my guess about 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump lead makes sense but probably @SK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs asking about 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if it's exactly 5@s an 4+ in a minor. South confirming this|pg||
nt|barbyh: prob shows a nf distributional hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|meargent: from my point of view this is more than decent if NS bid it|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 sp squeaks home|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loool... i see now|pg||
nt|lokaty: treflowy tylko k³ad³ chyba|pg||
nt|lokaty: 3@S da³ Burek, bo graj¹ 1 NT 14-16|pg||
nt|joanem: but having an 8 card beautiful diamond suit is sad to be raising clubs on 3 small  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this link seems to work: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|mamos: not much to be said about this either|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo Tislevoll moved from Norway to Auckland New Zealand when he married Faith Mayer who lives in NZ but she sometimes play s bridge for her country of origin Philippines|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly this pair is not afraid to bid 'em |pg||
nt|meargent: EW will have to try really hard to let this one through and i for one dont think they can do it|pg||
nt|chmitty: Bénédicte a chuté 4@c|pg||
nt|chmitty: sans doute sur le flanc AR de @h suivi de petit @s ... elle a mal deviné|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: sorry missed the trump play :(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but 4C  allows to check on club honours - always going to play in diamonds |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: now @D9 will take a trick|pg||
nt|joanem: oh ok |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: sorry imissed play...i will claim at the end|pg||
nt|joanem: ran 2nd trump to dummy;s 9 |pg||
nt|joanem: then heart finesse|pg||

pc|h7|nt|kamyk: Polska czeka, my czekamy na zdobycie pierwszej bramy|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh  start with 2@C to set game force|pg||
nt|kjadams: starting with 2C will help|pg||
nt|kit: If Kamil splinters now, it should be easy.|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|kit: I think Fleisher will bid 4@D (RKC in clubs)|pg||
nt|kjadams: try finding the slam after 1H P 1S P 2C..  you have to mess around creating force and setting trumps.   2C a nice bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: writing down explanations for Reid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|alerted|nt|ahollan1: note for kibitzers   if you splinter and partner asks for key cards -- you must have agreement about whether or not to show void|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kjadams: worse after 1H 1S 2D  !|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Only possible danger would be if Kamil makes some void-showing response and there is a mixup -- but Kamil wisely just showed 1 keycard.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzny: voila|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment is to NOT show void -- partner probably had a chance to bid lower to give you chance to show it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: A practical, sensible, and effective auction.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good push|pg||
nt|kjadams: I get asked a lot, "how do you show voids in keycard"   my answer = I don't.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you KNOW that void will be helpful   use bids beyond step 4 [2 KC + Q]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but John's approach safest|pg||
nt|kjadams: Exclusion and inclusion are ways to handle voids.    You can use RKC+1 if you know where the shortness is.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: newell thinking....|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: this lead holds declarer to 12 tricks   other leads declarer makes just 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: lol|pg||
nt|kjadams: exclusion by the hand with shortness says "do not count the ace in my void"|pg||
nt|kit: seems like Reid's best chance is that that lead is a singleton|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kjadams: inclusion by the partner of the shortness says "count your void as an ace."|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: This seems like a strange play -- why couldn't declarer have, say, Ax, AJ, Jxxx, AQJxx?|pg||
nt|kit: Although there is some potential danger here if declarer tries to ruff 2 spades and use 2 heart entries, but I don't think that will happen.|pg||

nt|wstuart: Yes, they have a good chance at reaching 6@C if N doesn't discount his @S values too much.|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I was remembering Rolands instruction not to be too critical|pg||
nt|reisig: That's my job :)|pg||
nt|mamos: South must receive credit here  for 1Nt was indeed a horrid spot and 2@S  much better|pg||
nt|ritong: t as rien, ma fille|pg||
nt|ritong: dis 5@d paisiblement|pg||
mb|6C|nt|sybarra: pleasant little hand with @H's 2/1  and @D ace on side etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant @H's 2/2 |pg||
nt|meargent: not to mention the 32 @C break|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: do we know what 2NT showed |pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like good bidding to me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: south opened 1@D showing @H and thus they dived over 4S, here NS silent|pg||
nt|ritong: oy|pg||

nt|chmitty: le fait que Est n'ait pas dit 2@h ne leur facilité pas la séquence|pg||

mb|p|nt|bouncer: nice|pg||
nt|petergill: True, you need a 12th trick, so the play of 6@c will be interesting|pg||
nt|wstuart: They should be OK in 6@C; draw trumps, one @h goes on the @SA, and ruff teh 4th @D.|pg||
nt|petergill: Do you rely on @H 4-2 or do you ruff two spades in S hand, keeping @SA to control the suit? |pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I miscounted, there are 12 easy tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT 1430 |pg||

mc|12|nt|wstuart: Now if @D had been 3-3, south could have scored the beer.|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: he did cause west discarded a diamond and he claimed it|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|an|alerted|nt|kjadams: giving full value to the stiff Q to get to 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Fleisher always open these hands or is he preventing the weak transfer openings played by EW?|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT has real chances here if they get there.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|kit: They do open light, yes, and perhaps tend to open marginal hands here.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW play Michaels with weak or very strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess Newell sees this as intermediate collectio|pg||
nt|kit: On spade lead it looks like declarer will have to guess jack of diamonds, and likely he will guess wrong on the auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Newell did not pass..he is considering at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the trend seems to be    show the distribution with any strength|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|kit: Kamil overtakes since he wants to make first diamond play from dummy in case East has ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|kjadams: overtakes so he can lead D to Queen for a later misguess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|kit: yes, and it will be costly, since he can't run clubs first, so defense would then get 3 spades, 2 hearts, and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @S8 was discouraging @S  with @H preference|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: Unless declarer believes 8 of diamonds is honest card -- which he mike.  Kamil is very good card-reader.|pg||
nt|kit: there will be a lot of IMPs riding on the upcoming diamond guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Reid is thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: he took a card from the pack (i did not see it) but after some consideration put it back|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|kit: Even if Reid shifts back to heart, Newell should know to go back to spades.|pg||
nt|kjadams: can afford 1 heart cashed, but need to avoid setting up heart Jack.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kit: 7 of hearts relatively high spot, so South marked with jack.  And if South has 10 of spades, defense clearly dead.  So, spade should be clear here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: he has the hearts 10 prepared|pg||
nt|kjadams: spade Q now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: sorry he put it back|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: cards on the table|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kjadams: now no diamond finesse, so jack will drop.|pg||
nt|kit: well, that sure solved declarer's problems.  He isn't taking any diamond finesse now :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when would Reid lead @S from Jx  when @H continue is right?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: I think clue is 7 of hearts (and the 3NT call), among other things.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kjadams: diamond before the club and he would make 5!|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugraphzny: he did make 5|pg||
nt|kjadams: right, unblock D on clubs.|pg||
nt|kit: he can just discard a blocking diamond -- had all the spots.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd extra trick gets the pip|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: Fleisher went to the batroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: bathroom|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: need a french connection now|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 7 should be flat 1370 unless South rebids 2@D instead of 2@C, playing the Artificial Club system that Kamil and Fleisher play|pg||
nt|wstuart: Lew generally defends very well.  It's not often that I will be able to rib him:   about his poor beer defense on this hand.|pg||

nt|xenya: looks a bit strange as N has a fit in either major |pg||
nt|xenya: and things seem to be getting bleak for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: North explained 2@d as Majors. East asked 5-5, North said could be 5-4|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if West will start with the @SJ instead of the @H5?|pg||
nt|petergill: 8 tricks in 2NT on NS cards = just right for NZ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: no just the hearts - 52.5%|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they settled for game very quickly|pg||

nt|petergill: Mike Ware does not like (to put it mildly)  2NT as a contract - personally he would rather be in 3NT almost always - except for this hand :)  |pg||
nt|wstuart: EW are playing attitude leads vs NT.  However, I am suprised West didn't lead low from 3 since he hadn't raise.d|pg||
nt|petergill: If you guess @DJ after @HK, @H10 ducked, you can make 9 tricks|pg||

nt|eok: see my email?|pg||
nt|barbyh: north has to decide whether west has 6 or 7 clubs|pg||

nt|petergill: even if there is a spade switch at Trick 3|pg||
nt|petergill: as is likely with E being almost entryless|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: can N somehow tell his partner to choose the longer major?|pg||

nt|drorp: 2 way CB action, planning to pass 2@D|pg||
nt|mamos: safe partscore|pg||
nt|drorp: once east bid 1NT he has guaranteed 4 diamonds because they only open 1@D with 3 when they have 44 in the majors, and with that east would support spades, so Gino chooses the safe ...|pg||
nt|drorp: 8 card minor fit as his partscore|pg||

nt|garden2005: no ale w meczu gra siê na obk³ady|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that East was too good for 3C whatever it showed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|davidstern: A diamond lead would have been much better for the defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or a heart continuation to prevent a dummy reversal also|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am prepared to bet a coke that declarer will prevail|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: you are right Jos..can be a danger|pg||
nt|josj: trump lead was excellent|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: 5 hearts, 3 clubs and 1 spade obvious|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice fitting hands for EW|pg||
nt|joanem: so the US gals in other room did bid the slam on brd 8 viaa good 2 over 1 sequence with splinter in diamonds  |pg||

pc|sT|nt|drorp: good pass by chagas on 2@S, soft 15 count no realy chance of making game, and here comes the trump lead which is often the right lead in those kind of partscore auctions, specially ...|pg||
nt|drorp: with good holding in opener's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver opened weak 2@D North   that will make it tougher for the Egyptians|pg||

pc|d6|nt|xenya: this should be a quick 1 down|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like no swing here|pg||

nt|meargent: thof course the 1@D opening lead to a very playable contract and a probable 1imp pickup for canada:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||

nt|odysseus69: maybe 4C is natural - some play that 3S over 3H agrees hearts and 4C is just natural|pg||
mb|4S|nt|meargent: it probably will make:(|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT superaccept, 3@H re-transfer|pg||

pc|d2|nt|xenya: this will probably make -- foe 5 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess the longest suit @H's has least to lose?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Many pairs will bid a doubleton as their preaccept - unless the doubleton is the suit just below their trump suit which would prevent pard from re-xfring|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S still looks doomed, even after this lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|josj: hmmm...|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: hmm|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: cover to encourage @C finesse??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and i think same @C/@H layouts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   bad joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: might lead a heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference in other room though   @S to Queen Ace, lose @C, then @SK @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if the Q loses, then try @hA to see if the J drops|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and if not take the @c finesse|pg||
nt|mamos: good start for the defence|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||
nt|wstuart: Leading from the K in the 4 card suit is a little safer than lead from the Kx or the Kxxxxx.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: lucky 6@H   but correction to 6N puts opening leader in     the dog house|pg||

nt|barbyh: so a small pick up for usa|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: The doubleton bid helps the defence a lot - it can be better to bid in such a way that declarer's hand less "known" to the defenders. |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: perhaps if he'd lead a club earlier|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mamos: I do agree too - experts seem to upgrade for any reason -- " I had three fives?"  and when weaker players do it seems ineveiably to lead to trouble|pg||
nt|grebrof: the thing that maybe makes someone upgrade here, is the vulnerability + they might have an agreement always show 18 when they have 17 and a 5cardsuit|pg||
nt|wstuart: Kx also, will never come back.  It could win by getting a ruff if you catch the ace in the other hand, but with Qx in trumps, he might be getting that trick anyway.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barbyh: declarer can throw s in with a club to collect heart queen for d 1|pg||

nt|wstuart: that will get them to 6@S.  However, east is going to bid slam himself, and west will likely raise to 7 based on his likely source of tricks in @C.|pg||
nt|petergill: When playing against opponents who play a Forcing Pass over 5@D, maybe 4@d causes more problems for EW than 5@d does. I know it's normal to preempt to the max with a good fit, but ...|pg||

nt|petergill: The 5-0 break stops only the overtrick, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|wstuart: I know he had already showed some type of stopper with 2NT, but after 3@H he could have said he was a little happier about his @S holding.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in 3NT if declarer plays spade to 9 (unlikely) after ace of hearts then North has to switch to diamond|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Geo was worried about inducing a @D lead if he suggested very strong spades via 3NT - and what if partner has Kx in @D?|pg||
nt|wstuart: it's not clear he can't make an overtrick anyway?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|grebrof: well |pg||

nt|ahollan1: @HQ smother jack  needs extra entry to dummy to pickup suit for no loss|pg||

nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has 4 tricks in the side suits and needs to add six trump tricks.|pg||

pc|cA|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||

nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
pc|s7|nt|drorp: Ronpa is a big talent but started bridge somewhat late, so he missed on the junior circuit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would bet that Sadek is in the minority and that most won't be able to resist balancing DBL|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: needs to lead a trump to beat this, i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since the auction is forced to game, it can be difficult for the players to know if partner has extra values. 3NT is an important bid on the way to a major-suit game. The Serious ...|pg||

nt|chmitty: bon résultat des Américaines sur cette dernière donne|pg||
nt|petergill: I doubt if Bach - Cornell (2 big names of NZ bridge) have ever been possibly the 3rd (or =2nd) pair in a NZ team ever before |pg||
nt|petergill: Last board - whatever happens on this hand, a very well played match by NZ - a splendid effort by them under pressure|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this will be the last board of round 19, we will be back in 1 hour and 20 minutes (13:45 local time.) Thank you all for joining us|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and a possible last swing|pg||

nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||

nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
nt|pawel90: szlemik nie jest ³atwy|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when they said  you can't preempt with 4 of other major or a void  they forgot to say it was no-no with BOTH|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand   better to show suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this is the last board of the set.. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: no need to precise that south did not enter the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: not many big mistakes have been made in this match - no wonder they have started well these teams|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: so you have to mix the beer with coke?|pg||
nt|meargent: unless the rules are changed|pg||
mb|2H|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: wyniki kobiet: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-venice-cup|pg||
nt|chmitty: l'ouverture de 1@d en 3ème, que je trouve très normale, les a propulsées à 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||

mc|8|nt|wstuart: The theory being that bidding is more accurately after a strong 1NT opening, and if you have a pass in 1st seat, a strong qNT in 3rd seat will lead to better auctions.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Some pairs do adjust their range to 14-16 for their 3rd seat NT openings to cater to the pass from 1st seat.|pg||
nt|wstuart: It depends on what your initial opening bid style is.|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Vincent Broerson (top operator) and Wayne Stuart and cheers to any New Zealanders out there - it should be a great NZ weekend if their bridge and rugby teams perform the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: way NZ performed in this match|pg||
nt|wstuart: Thanks Peter.  It's been a pleasure talking with you.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Congrats to NZ.  They really played well this match.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 14 - Peetr Newell has opened 1@D to show hearts at the other table|pg||
nt|wstuart: I'm going to wander over to the other table to see the conclusion.|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 14: there may be a swing of a few imps on that board - I think EW make 3@H and for NS 4@C is not totally hopeless|pg||
nt|petergill: N is in 1NT on Bd 14, so one would expect 90 for a flat board|pg||
nt|petergill: 15 and 16 are also likely to be flat, which means NZ should have a 23-7 win. |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye everyone|pg||
