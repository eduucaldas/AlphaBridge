nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|vbman: plswelcome gad from usa|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: match is starting now, have fun watching|pg||
nt|vbman: an easy slam for a starter|pg||

nt|viren169: Nice quiet start for NS... 6/7@H|pg||
mb|d|an|t/o|nt|ahalim: Disini sudah malam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|3for3: 2 active pairs, who have played each other many times...|pg||
nt|alnanda: selamat malam.., good evening... here..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Hi Arifin and Arif|pg||
nt|ahalim: 2NT seems lebensohl|pg||
nt|vbman: when n opens slam is guaranteed|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach 7... but 6 should be a walk in the park for these guys|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: first board already an exciting board, minimal opening of N, but nice layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: simple J2N|pg||
nt|frankaus: Egtton in early 20's, Gosney just 30+/-|pg||
mb|4H|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: its a very good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: some problems... try to solve...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
nt|viren169: followed by shortage in @C which South will like!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i don t think kasle will lead @s A|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer really looks void in that suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: selamat malam semua disana|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Karin|pg||
nt|vbman: dont think 7 is in the bag|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome to Veldhovn|pg||
nt|henryb:  India is third in the Senior Bowl, USA 1 is tied for 7th|pg||
nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I really like the dble...|pg||
nt|viren169: ruff 4 clubs in North's hand...|pg||
nt|frankaus: the whole AUS open team under 50 quite unusual|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the 5th trump that make South's hand a great hand...|pg||
nt|vbman: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed young Australian players|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
pc|s6|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
nt|vbman: 5th trump also means the queen|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dizeñ dobry - witam spragnionych dobrej gry i zwyciêstwa dru¿yny polskiej...|pg||
nt|vbman: they might bid grand if they have the technology|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sorry, missed all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: an aggressive E could balance|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  greetings again|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: kasle is now aware about the five possible discards|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good start Indonesia|pg||

nt|viren169: should be a flat bd...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaapfr: but a bit shot into the dark|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H can be made here but not too easy|pg||
nt|ahalim: A small @H from N wbe very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: he played it I think|pg||
nt|otoj: I think that N did that |pg||

nt|vbman: ------------------18---------------------|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w piki to wet bez wistu w atu 12 lew by³o mozliwe do uskrobania:)|pg||
nt|viren169: N/S need to be careful on this one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|otoj: otherwise decl had time to establish club for down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they started with spade, than twice harts|pg||
nt|vbman: l cant see a way they stop at 3cl|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 2@H|pg||
nt|vbman: unless campos tries something clever|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: not an easy board for N-S to avoid getting too high|pg||
nt|frankaus: N had only 10HCP but 27 zars  - only need 26 to open |pg||
mb|1S!|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
nt|ahalim: hello don|pg||
nt|otoj: a discipline pass by N.. |pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello mr arifin|pg||
nt|otoj: hi Don..|pg||
nt|viren169: and more pressure from West|pg||
nt|viren169: dble again and pass the 4@C response?|pg||
nt|vbman: or pass out|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to zar points - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a good preemptive raise from W, S has 19pt and normally does not want to pass|pg||
nt|viren169: South may try (unsuccessfully) 3N|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
nt|vbman: think the raise will help him|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj - obawiam siê ¿e to nie obiegnie|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
nt|don_kapu: hi otoj|pg||
nt|josj: selamat malam dari Veldhovend ke Indonesia:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi mas Aria:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Laska powstrzymaj szalej¹ce konie proszê...|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble is best...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||
nt|3for3: east should be able to handle this...since south's trumps are so low|pg||
nt|don_kapu: and westjava|pg||
nt|vbman: but .....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks now after @H lead|pg||

pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: mosquito killed by Sabine|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kontrakt ma szanse jak reforma gier hazardowych w Polsce|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: sporty|pg||

nt|josj: hi Liliek, Arifin and Joto :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: eh ono Liliek|pg||
nt|vbman: l disagree with campos' raise|pg||
nt|szeryf: tu Ryszard Kie³czewski - muszê obs³ugiwaæ dwa pokoje st¹d drugi nick|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|westjava: Oom Jos apa kabar..?:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jaapfr: 5 for 11 and 1 for 10|pg||
nt|viren169: not a bad raise at that vul?!?!|pg||

pc|d2|nt|westjava: tuan rumah sibuk, ya..?:)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||

nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid over 3@h. 3@h is forcing - although it does not promise 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n might be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good lead from west here.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks to be down 1: 6 trumps and three aces. But maybe he can set up the long spade while he still has control|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hJ, @s ruff, @cA, @dA -- no. not quite|pg||

mb|3N|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||

nt|henryb:  Americans balance more freely than most others|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but there a @S discard was needed to make it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
nt|henryb:  but Hamilton made it because West mistakenly pitched a spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: probably playing on clubs until the cows come home|pg||
nt|viren169: or until the E/W give him an entry to dummy with a @D|pg||

nt|viren169: lol... the Q should have been on the table 5 mins ago!|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will do well to cash their hearts and clubs and exit a spade.|pg||

nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  on repeated trump leads, 2@h is probably down|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S anyone?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: @D to queen picks up Jx in either hand for 3 tricks, whereas @d to ten does not pick up 3 tricks if loses to king with 4-2 @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows 6 or more spades|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 2@H is a just a general force... (or an xfer to @S?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||

nt|petergill: No 2@H shows 6+ @S 100% for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: with it being a xfer... they should go more slowly to investigate the slam|pg||
nt|viren169: ok thks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North will probably move|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the south hand doesn't look like it's a slam on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: North can be very weak with 6 @S, so South has shown a really good hand|pg||

nt|viren169: North will make another move with 2 bullets |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||

nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@S, the best play is to draw trumps and try to get the 12th trick from @D, not to try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|viren169: South felt he has to catch up...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 round of trumps (finding they break) and ruff a @C?!?!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason Gos chose 5@C instead of 4NT is that it gave Nabil a way to stop in 5@S, if Nabil's 4@S bid had been a puint instead of the real thing |pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bobh1: USA finally scored some imps on 11 but they're running out of real estate|pg||

nt|henryb:  X says I want to bid 5@h, but not before you have a chance to defend|pg||
nt|viren169: more micheals cue bids here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Michaels, at least 5/5 in majors|pg||

nt|viren169: Noth might have muddied the waters here a bit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Willard must be very carefull here. Nice first step|pg||
nt|alpagavp: The goal is to lose 1@s 1@h and 1@c|pg||

nt|viren169: 4@H=cue|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: bon|pg||

nt|viren169: 4@S=cue|pg||

pc|s5|nt|3for3: down 1 here...and 5 more to germany.  quite a high scoring match!|pg||

nt|viren169: ok...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT said we have all the keycards - can you bid seven?|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|grebrof: if you can have 6 card minor in your 1nt - I rather bid it at the 3level|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: NS obviously using Rusinov leads|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading something else might have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: finding the @s Q is not important anymore - contract should be safe as there are no ruffs anywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, we all would lead @hs, but even that lead might not beat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and 6@C said that I think we are high enough!|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any endplay or squeeze - if there was one, Tony Nunn would almost certainly have found it|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe too high!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south kept the tray at the SW side for a while|pg||

nt|jaapfr: is it sure W will play @C when in with @HK?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: if P can bid some sort of Stayman - you normally can make 3@c/@ds OR it is a better contract than 1nt anyway|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C on @SQ lead: Clubs 4-1 is more likely than @D 6-1, so declarer would get that guess right|pg||
nt|viren169: And finally onto the last....|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks karen.....thanks jaap......thanks all :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  will A make a negative double? yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Karen, WBF and BBO (including all kibz and commentators)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is marginal at best|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rest of our friends did fall asleep:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C can be doubleton if 4432 or 5332|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|ritong: à partir de cette ouverture, ça ira|pg||
nt|ritong: bon choix philou|pg||
nt|ritong: en plus lassere est déclarant, ça le rassurera, à propos des @h|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre*|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est necéssaire|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 4 or 5 spades, not 6 spades|pg||
nt|viren169: what do you do with 6 spades?|pg||
mb|2S!|an|6-8 5!S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|3C|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||

nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I'm not sure if I read the explanation of 3@H right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: perfect pressure bid 5@D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
nt|lokaty: dwa ostatnie rozdania nieciekawe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if 5@H and expected @SA lead N has enough @S to falsecard and E might continue @D in tr 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||

nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the favorable location of both kings and good diamond break declarer should make 3 or four, winning 2 imps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth:)|pg||
