nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: as one may guess, 1@d was transfer and 3@d showing shortness with heart support|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer has his chances but has to deal carefully with the board, because we have 4 trumps with W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 teams that are very close in the ranking|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|skaftij:  In OR, Jonsson overcalled with 1@s|pg||

nt|andyv:  so declarer lost the 3 aces and made her game for a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the first big win for usa|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: open room: 4@h-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: some discussion in Swedish|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
mb|1D|an|weak|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer in the open room had played trumps, but without finesse, so 13 IMPs for USA, thanks to safety play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: missing 4@h by E/W?|pg||
nt|jaker: pretty routine 3n here|pg||
mb|3C|an|asking bid|nt|dburn:  and that is a weak hand with 5 spades and a minor by West|pg||
nt|dburn:  the New Zealand pair using Moscito, a system that does not allow very many passes in first or second or third position|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
nt|dburn:  some guesses for declarer - normal to pick up spades, will probably lose two hearts, so much will depend on clubs|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a partscore-battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio giving up very fast|pg||
nt|hobakan: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry wieczór wszystkim...panowie nie dostarczaj¹ nam chwil radoci,mo¿e chocia¿ panie siê nad nami zlituj¹|pg||
mb|3N|an|no 4/5 card Major|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
nt|star6ija: very high pressure by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
nt|star6ija: they may win some IMPs more, due to this 3@ss gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
nt|jaker: we'll probably see a range of opening leads across the various matches. I'd try a heart myself|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: great lead!!|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead even better - would kill dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 toptricks - and hard work to setup the 9.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cant see time to setup anything on the given lead|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact cant see any other game but ofr 5@d making on any decent def|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is looking at the convention card of E/W for leads|pg||
pc|h4|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S contract is actually better for EW|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
nt|dburn:  England rather fortunate on board 2, where they reached a somewhat ridiculous 3NT that had about eight or nine losers|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: @c10 now - or @H work for defense|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rhelle: so first blood to USA1|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|dburn:  this will be a swing one way or the other, since the contract at the other table was a part score|pg||
nt|dburn:  so, 10 to NZ or 7 to England depending on Wilkinson's view of the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really all that much to go on - the only suit whose distribution she knows for sure is spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  in W leads the Q@c and N ducks, W should lose 2 @d tricks|pg||

nt|dburn:  four hearts, not four spades, minor suit canape possible|pg||
nt|dburn:  choice of actions for South now|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: needs to play in @H here|pg||

nt|pelu: give N @DK and not @SK - then plsy for slam|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: DONT LIKE EAST'S PASS and 4@S is not the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then pick event/country to get partnership convention card|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, 2@c is supposed to deliver more of a suit and / or more of a hand|pg||
nt|benjy: So you would bid over 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn:  just about - could well have enough for 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: so I would like to pay more attention to the previous board|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn:  but this lead knocks out the entry to the clubs, so we may well not have enough for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  although other things are reasonably favourable (e.g. the diamonds), so this will be close|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: did east want a double from w?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N have to cash out immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  and the contract allowed to make|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpb: she is moving now to get a good seat, if possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: As Radoslav Radev pointed, 3 in Major weak is used by Eric Kokisch, who is a kind of advisor of strongest US players|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  a sizeable swing for EW|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|benjy: if she wins in dummy and leads a spade up east has to duck to give the defence a chance|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: Upmark had option to Relay to get information about South hand, but elected to show @C with some shortness|pg||
nt|dburn:  East opened at the other table also, and South elected to double|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn:  West bid 1NT, which ended the auction, and eight tricks were taken|pg||
nt|dburn:  but they were taken by the defenders, so NZ have a useful plus 200|pg||
nt|benjy: this is cold now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|jaker: if north had chosen to overcall EW might stumble into spades, which I think makes 10 tricks, rather luckily|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: unfortunately I don't know any of the NS meanings  after the 1st 2 or 3 bids|pg||
nt|cicus: seems they do|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - it may well have been cold anyway, but winning the first spade has certainly done no good for the defence|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: perfect contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this defence, declarer has his life easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: her life, it's the Venice Cup|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests west should pass 3@H - THAT GOOD EASILY BE RIGHT - but east isnt guaranteed to have the hand he has - east failure to double 3@H should have cost him a packet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, defenders cut spade communication with the opening lead|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: and actualyy has:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing the explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems ideal to me - and n/s have only themselves to blame for the disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by Brazil|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i meant e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec asks why td called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is asking sw for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo e/w were crazy in not doubling 3@H OR INDEED NOT PASSING 3@h out vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h could be hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: they played in the wrong suit and they should have just played bridge|pg||

mb|d|mb|3S|an|weak|nt|vugraphzpb: TD is collecting the written expl of 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a nice hand for the majors over a strong nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  North-South play a weak no trump, so this may be an upgrade|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Wests in both rooms chose diferent ways of acting, as well as Norths. US tactics was winning in both rooms, so deserved 10 IMPs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: ah hah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and leaves again|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: !:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16 [1/2/3nv]  15-17 [3vul/4]|pg||
nt|ahalim: two easy slams to id|pg||
mb|4S|nt|benjy: If i was playing a weak NT here then I would open one with the south hand|pg||
nt|benjy: Ok  you have 14 HCP and a couple of 10s but the 4333 is enough to keep me in range|pg||
nt|ahalim: bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: good morning to all|pg||
nt|jaker: the modern trend is more towards overcall and then double next with this hand type.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H NOT 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if the td rules in Brazil's favour it will almost certainly be appealed|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d will require guessing the @s suit or a @s lead|pg||
nt|benjy: and X in the pass out seems normal|pg||
nt|benjy: north will prob be glad to go back to clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: this variation of NT ranges is very fashionable|pg||
nt|cicus: among big clubbers|pg||
nt|andyv:  for up to the minute scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is interesting to see weak 2 openning with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|jaker: anyone else surprised by the 4 heart bid? |pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzpb: N says; we should not waste time with these hands; 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: but everything goes if the partner is warned|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h could have gone down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@dX was made in OR|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to approach diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: first spade, then diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking what the double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 12-15 was said|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she has 11pt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems hopeless on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS will win imps no matter what happens here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cicus: a good slam here - in fact laydown if S plays it at NT (not possible now)|pg||
nt|ahalim: EW have a sacrifice in the majors but will not bid it|pg||
nt|tomi2: non vuln / vuln with 55 in majors many will bid wests hand, even with that weak suits|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and then probably will find the save|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bessis took out 6@c but put it back in the bidding box|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cicus: 12 sure tricks without needing the spade finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but since @SK onside it doesn't matter who plays it -- yes, that's resulting|pg||
nt|jaker: defense needs to be careful,trump switch makes things easier|pg||
nt|jaker: q of hearts best now|pg||
nt|jaker: but I think any non-club is ok|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzpb: takes time to think, long|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other clue is that N has shown at least 9 cards in @hs and @cs |pg||
pc|hK|nt|hobakan: wd|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: this is maybe better than 6NT from N - but 2 IMPs less|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is still bidding  4 so can't say if 2 imps in play or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: nice switch to @h, but S has doubled giving values|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cicus: the risk of 6@C is a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all in all    6@C looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are some transportation issues after @D lead [we know, but Cullin isn't aware that @CQ is singleton]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  so, defence took their tricks in time|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @cQ looks the natural continuation|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  one more board of tiny decisions|pg||
nt|rhelle: on the previous board, it seems that the @d finesse is declarer's best hope|pg||
nt|rhelle: so a bit sloppy going 1 off ...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  First pickup by Japan, Baldursson bid 4 @d on bd4|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  a wild hand...5@d about par for hand but may be hard to stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW have to stop low|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn:  4-3-3-3 is actually a good shape for notrump - people have wrongly been downgrading it for years|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the tables do not seem to be connected and therefore their are no imp scores on each bd|pg||
nt|cicus: nice suit to overcall on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H lead director?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids 2@s. W may be able to bid 4@d (leaping michaels)|pg||
nt|jaker: declarer had 9 of clubs, so didnt matter|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4NT?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
mb|p|nt|alunand14: Sawiruddin-Hartono play prec|pg||

nt|skaftij:  CC says weak 2 in @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can't see what the players ar writing about 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like at partscore - better play in @s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpb: bidding is now faster.....than playing, as stated by Deas|pg||
nt|rhelle: however, North may now not find the @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: am I the only one who cant reach the official WBF page since yesterday evening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but D'Ovidio will certainly have a minmimum|pg||
mb|3C|an|gf, relay|nt|cicus: I guess W is bidding 4@S now - he expects more strength at the right place|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the limited 1@h opener, EW may be able to stop in 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn:  OK - North bid hearts, not West, but North showed spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: meaning of 3@s was asked; natural >3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is thinking to bid 6@c|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so far so good, though 7th trick is to be found|pg||
nt|benjy: i still don't believe you would have upgraded that hand though|pg||
nt|ahalim: I have it right now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think i can read 9-13 on one of the notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||
nt|star6ija: after ruffing will W underlead has @DAce for second ruff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down; @c A, @c, @h, small @d, @c and trumph again|pg||
mb|3H|an|asking if S has !d|nt|dburn:  might well have done - lots of intermediates|pg||
nt|pelu: can i explain 2@D - I cant find information on CC|pg||
nt|hobakan: minor investigation|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|4!h + 4!d|nt|vugraphzpb: and he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and he does cheap insurance!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
nt|pelu: tx :)|pg||
nt|pelu: = both majors|pg||
nt|jaker: 6d is an interesting spot. you have various choices for how to handle the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  better from South as it happens, this - West doesn't have an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but she may be put off a diamond by North's bid in the suit - not sure what that meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: according to the auction E may ask for Spade continuation though|pg||
nt|jaker: can hope for someone to have Kx or Qx, but if it's east, she can unblock the honor, so you normally try to cash it early, preferably by leading to it, before they see the danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is counting and counting and counting while looking at her cards|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|dburn:  she wasn't, but that has blown a tempo for the defence, and declarer can get the long diamond going before the defence can get a club|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is a little bit dangerous for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: politely asking the Japan for admittance|pg||
mb|5C|an|2 keycards and !d Q|nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  assuning declarer plays that way, of course, and does not rely on a heart to the king|pg||
nt|benjy: can't she try both by leading a @D now|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can certainly combine chances in some way, yes|pg||
nt|hobakan: what about 4NT.. it's 4 th step.|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4@d:0-3 , 4@h:1-4 , 4@s:no Q , 4 NT:with Q..|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|star6ija: we have to point out that 4@s is ice cold contract, so some swing (even double game) is possible|pg||
nt|jaker: can also play for east to have 10x, by leading low to the 8 or 9, and then leading the j (intrafinesse)|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5@c= 2 keys + @dQueen plus one king out side.. may be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that is not written on paper as expl.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N has given the decision back to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: has S 2 hearts??? Eastes problem now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or has he spades (2)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  @h start helped with this|pg||

nt|alunand14: yes :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tiny @h game for NS - easier to play than to bid, actually|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night...I hope we get some sleep:)|pg||
nt|benjy: If East had returned a club their would declarer have had to guess|pg||
nt|benjy: as if @Ds were 4-2 then she would have to lead up to the @H king?|pg||

mb|p|nt|alunand14: pagi mas wtee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3nt or not?|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: their range for 2@C=10-16|pg||
nt|cicus: many now play 2@C to show 6+ @Cs right away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be INV+ in @C, so 3@C=... less than invite  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: after a long thinking pause by Deas|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: i think Peter Weichsel started that trend when playing with Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like another 3NT contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@D = weak 2. 3NT certainly frisky|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit sitting favorably for declarer, 3@s should make...losing 1@s, 2@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W want to go to slam; 4@s is a cue|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: im sorry missed a pass,|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 club ruffs are enough to win (as we see)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in that 6m hand we see many tables bidding and some making contracts like 6NT or 7 in a minor. 7 Clubs oftn fails because the @SA is on lead, 7@D makes on some tables. Did not spot ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: that the French auction here is so good, but nowadays Blackwood is out of fashion, so well done to them ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bd 20 india gained 12 imps but it is subject to a td ruling here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slowly|pg||

nt|skaftij:  bd 5, East lead @d ace so 4@h making, 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: club ruff|pg||
nt|benjy: I'm afraid I have to go, goodluck England, thanks David|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
nt|hobakan: not a good time for rasing to 5|pg||
nt|jaker: perhaps a misunderstanding. When you play both Jacoby and texas transfers, normally one of them is a slam try, and the other is sign-off. The auction suggests that they may have ...|pg||
nt|jaker: been on different wave lengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: misunderstanding about 4@h bid, W thinks it was for slam, E to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they just discussed this (in Italian.... ;))|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :0|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||
nt|farrukh: and there was no need for a @h finesse actually...it was just a practice finesse:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @H finesse was an illusion|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: if FX stands for "special effects" we have had some fireworks already at this table|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|vugraphzpb: N states; well guessed to partner to take the @c finesse|pg||

nt|andyv:  and you are right...@c ruff was found..in OR, 3@h was a disaster, going down 3 and 9 more imps to Italy which has taken the lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well, you are missing an Ace and @hQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: this cant be right!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-7zz, some splinter  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 21 is another example of adantage of quick entering the auction...12 IMPs to USA1 because of openning 2@h with 2 Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so the notes are wrong  or Upmark misbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: players not alerting much. They discussed it before the match, so obvious alerts aren't made|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpb: issue with bbo|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice bid of 3@ss showing willing to play 3N with @s stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north must have opened 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing wrong with this contract|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, I also wonder why sawiruddin also play as a beginner?|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am not sure what this pass means|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|ahalim: yes trump Q missing, but you have a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but I will do them for the spectators|pg||
nt|pelu: how do u play that D? - most players: dont play my suit (they exp that partner often will lead the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Will probably end up in 6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  -1|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will probably need to set up @d suit to pitch a @h or a @c (or both)|pg||
nt|tomi2: west may hope partner has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jaker: propelled them too high. E and W both aggressive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpb: E thinks about his hand ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, N will actually not need any pitches from the @d suit as cards lie...but still, will set up the @ds for a @h pitch|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will another big swing for NS as 1N was bid and made in CR|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Cullin is just making forcing noises -- Upmark clarifying hand   we just don't know the specifics|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know yet how favorably everything lies for her|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Kibs - tell me - what do u normal play here?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: does 2@h show 6-card? then with 4 trumps can show @hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think they rebid 2@H with nothing extra to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E promised a stronger hand than she has|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: however clarification of 2@c opening unclear|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rhelle: 1@c is a stretch, as far as I'm concerned. I'd be happy to pass that West hand. 12 points, but such a load of cr.p ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the end , I think East does well not to make a further slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W wins @d and returns @h, N will have to put up the K|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: interesting bidding here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 6 OR: Jonsson plays 5@c D for a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached good contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s2|nt|andyv:  W will have to shift to @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: even if they tried to find better spot bidding 3N, I doubt E would leave them there having 11 cards in major|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
nt|pelu: most kibs: dont play my suit! - bit for sure here Fredin wont @C-lead :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a fast claim|pg||
nt|hobakan: 15 and 5 cards @c.. pd passed hand.. are u agree with 2 NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|hobakan: if 2@c-p-p.. pd can bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn:  1@h spades, 2NT spade raise|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Masood currently in 6@H but Ahmed still has a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: W explained his X as " I think it will go down" on the paper|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|hobakan: but of course unlucky diamond distribution..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it was possible for east to ask for aces and Queen, pls correct me if I am wrong|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|alunand14: ya, tp tetap lbh berrisiko kalo ga cabut trum :(|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which he's done|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing 3 rounds of trumps is wise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a groan from part of the gallery and cheer from the other|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: now relief|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: and trying to ruff the 4th @c in dummy seems called for|pg||
nt|rhelle: so now declarer is struggling, and needs to do some good guessing to avoid going down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you cannot do cue's and asking for trump Q|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: after 7 the score is 18-10 to india|pg||
nt|roswolf: after bd 23|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|s6|nt|cicus: I think drawing trumps is right because of the possibility of a singleton honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i confess i didn't even see option to ruff @D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @d 10 back seems obvious now|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cicus: make the screen brighter|pg||
nt|rhelle: this works too, but is riskier - if East had AK98 of @c, it would hand the game back to her|pg||

nt|andyv:  N's thinking should have been:  If I have to play @hs, I will have to lead to my King...EW are not here to help me so I should stick to my original plan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N/S are discussing that 3NT should have been the right contract, the 3@s bid was confusing (normally dbl would ask for a stopper)|pg||
nt|tomi2: lucky board for Germany here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzpb: then he had to bid 4nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: they play 3 sets per day with short breaks between matches  but then get to enjoy the evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a wonderful concept|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Anyone for balancing with East hand? Would end up in 4@s, unmakable|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
pc|d2|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: west worked out partner should be short in @D here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cross ruff seems an approach to take|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2: the small @D might be a mistake|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||

nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
pc|d7|nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually I don't think cross ruff is necessary here, because E knows where all the points are|pg||
nt|jaker: nice lead. Too bad for her the 8 and 7 of spades aren't reversed. As it is, suit is blocked|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, E has to find a way|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: trying to think single dummy ....   want to preserve QJ  so  win dummy @H to Ace, @C finesse     i think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm in a loop re: just playing @D now :(|pg||
nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||
nt|alunand14: bad lead from sawiruddin :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed a good lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: they could have let e/w play in 2@S quietly|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h made in OR|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  well done|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|nt|andyv:  K@c and @c, @h return and 3rd @c to take the maximum no. of tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|andyv:  this was not best for the defense|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: some credit to Nystrom for opening 1N=14-16  i think might be easier for North to bid more than 2@S than for South to take another call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm    remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy having a very big set against Bulgaria   that puts Italy almost half a match ahead of 2nd place Netherlands|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  I stand corrected...the @h play doen't cost anything|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|skaftij:  Needed an unprobable shift to a low @D to beat this certainly|pg||

nt|star6ija: another 2 IMPs for Japan|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: score is not correct of this match, sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: please watch the live scores|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H in other room   Bertheau overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW @S spots just good enough to allow this to make|pg||
nt|hobakan: normal with short in @h..|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2nt bid is not understood by Deas, acc. East|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: shaking her head (E)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again a long thinking pause ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: reply to 2nt was not expected|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and in the mean time, West is taking some chocolate!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: looks like 2@d was inverted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: confused|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 paretscore-swing for Sweden = 19 IMP|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: true glen|pg||
nt|glen: better to X 3@S to show support|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: but I am ultra aggressive in such situations, those not so crazy would bid only 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4@d, 2@c a @s and a @h E will have to find 2 tricks...one could come from the @c suit if either finesse works|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that will be tested first|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  first step done. what about the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think normal play is to get hearts wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there is no problem with @s guess - the A must be onside. the problem is in guessing @h correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: as playing heart to the jack also caters with AQx onside|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3nt is expl. as balanced, 12,13pt|pg||
nt|jaker: feels like N could have made it more difficult my playing the K of spades at trick one, although S didn't promise such good spots|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpb: 11 tricks from top with club A gone, 12 with spade finesse|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4 losers in the red suits - defence need to take their @s trick before it goes on @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle: great lead!|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h here depends on 3-2 trump break and successfu @c finesse|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: does E lead a @S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: from north's point of view couldnt south still have a small doubleton club?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h was Game forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will make on any lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: it also might be made if E decides to lead Q of Spades instead of @D Jack|pg||
nt|star6ija: or as Danny Sprung pointed via black squeeze, which on the actual layout doesn't work|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|glen: even though S is hort|pg||
nt|pelu: I cant seew any play for 2Nt - only if NS help declarer :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|glen: *short|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see if the ladies' secret weapon - intuition - will work|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpb: sorry error in the auction|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  not this time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 7, Jonsson led a @s. Now a @h shift was required but not found. tough defense|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in 3Nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Moment of truth in OR, |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h is slightly better because a @c can be ditched on @s Queen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  OR is 2 boards behind designated time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deals in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very long pause for the outcome, questions asked to N on bidding|pg||
nt|star6ija: some tricky move would be N to play small @c from dummy to put pressure over W if he had the King|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only reject  Pass and 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 11|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  E may well need the 9@s as a throw in card to endplay N in the @h and/or @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  acutally, scratch the last statement|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|glen: no, makes the good lead and its a push|pg||
nt|star6ija: he can afford to lose this trick|pg||
nt|star6ija: so let's see what it will be|pg||
nt|pelu: now 7 tricks on a endplay of S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  celand and China  got penalty for slow play |pg||
nt|andyv:  E up to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to avoid in this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|jaker: then, if declarer ducks a trump comes through, and if he wins and plays a spade, S can win and cash spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpb: south knows from the lead that west has another diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so shouldn't go wrong here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but possibility to go wrong still exists for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: north knows west started with 7 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: otherwise south wouldn't overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: depends on the point of view|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: N may find it fortunate :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpb: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is deciding in what order to play the tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: But E in OR in 3@C - not better|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  BD 8 OR, Kaku in East took the slow approach bidding 3@D iso 4@C. Ended in 3NT so Japan is levelling the match|pg||

mb|d|an|transfer|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||

nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with passive defense (@h lead) it will go down|pg||
mb|1N|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
nt|star6ija: also with C Jack or with @D JAck|pg||
mb|2H|an|++|nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||

nt|pelu: in OR Sweden has found the @S-fit as NS (:()|pg||
nt|pelu: playing 4@SD|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||

pc|s5|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|star6ija: at least 2 IMPs US thanking to the rifhtsided contract|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: France avoided the slam missing the ace and @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 10 imps were kind of randomly given to Germany depending on the position of the @HQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: this was not the most exciting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: would you have played a @d to the 10?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|skaftij:  10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS headint to 4@h, the vul may tempt W to sac in 5@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  heading|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that north hand isn't worth anywhere near the 10 HCP Walter the Walrus would claim|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sfoxa:  the lay of the cards isn't very pleased for EW (rather playing partscore in @s)|pg||
nt|ahalim: however N cd have @HQ singleton or @H cd be 2-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 6@D OBJECTIVELY is good once east overcalls|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect n/s might bid this|pg||
mb|2N|an|18/19|nt|glen: don't you need to play @S K83 opposite @S J72 for one loser?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that's a little over 50%, so kind of random swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: correct point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are honest about this to themselves and the opps|pg||
mb|3C|an|asking for 4/5 card major|nt|roswolf: yes it might not make!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: tough decision by S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|at least one 4 card major, no 5 card maj|nt|glen: 5@D = hand so bad I will remove room to bid blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed glen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction will NOT be duplicated since  Nystrom's 1/2/3 seat favorable 1N=10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  the QJ@d made N put on the brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this auction, the lead should be read as a singleton...W would otherwise lead a top @d|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  but defence isn't a pleasant walk, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: palmer not enquiring about the 1NT range here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: nice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W seems to be in trance now|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  this should make an overtrick or 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not read it that way|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is an interesting spot, they have two 8 card fits. in clubs they even have all spotcards but one defender holds the "straight flush"|pg||
mb|p|nt|hobakan: 5 card Majör include 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: apparantly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl was asked and given at the table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing the @sK, when you know the ace is behind, is that great a play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 9@D upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|star6ija: they avoided the risky contract of 4@h|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tomi2: @SK onside but spades 4-1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey everyone hey peter:)|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|tomi2: including the spade finesse and the dropping 8 they have 4@S 4@C and two aces, so they need two ruffs, but then trumps 4-1 might cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if i can read the notes correctly, south is telling that 3@h showed fit and short @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't understand wests double here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: at least i can read ' 4315' |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahalim: I think W thought E was on lead :)|pg||

pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing    DBL obviously takeout  a great treatment, especially in context of Big Club|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: double game swing for France here|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT, or 6@d for NS - depending on @d finess that works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s finess as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south resisting temptation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S indeed thinking about 3nt......|pg||
nt|glen: S pausing for effect|pg||
nt|hedyg:  3 card bergen raise..i believe only in France|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahalim: frankly speaking : i don't like these bergen type raises with only 3-crd support|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he resisted|pg||
nt|ritong: south had a tough problem to solve other table|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: sorry now i'm told both tables in Italy v Iceland played 5@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was not a bergen raise, it was simply an invitational raise with support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N unintentionally moved the tray, before E had bid; they are making a joke about this also|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and promptly E bid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im guessing one of the reasons would be his hand distrabution.. while 3@h would be weaker then 10-13 and can also hold 6@h aswell he wanted to show he "had something" |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2@H from W was contructiv: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S should not take the first @c trick|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  the sweedish team only stood in 3@s on board 29 making 10 tricks so now bulgarya is in the lead with 3 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
nt|tomi2: their aim was not to preempt opps out of the auction, they would probably not do this with 7hcp only|pg||
nt|tomi2: they wanted to investigate the 4@S game|pg||
nt|ahalim: i said bergen type raises not bergen raises :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: or not  but they both did better than defend 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  in OR, W did not overcall 1@h but contract was still 3NT|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||
nt|rhelle: this could be another partscore swing - 2@h vs 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  very close match!|pg||
nt|jaker: interesting result from USA senior 1 on board 6 where NS relayed but stopped in 5d. 6d was made on a heart lead when W pitched a spade and declarer guessed to discard a heart on ...|pg||
nt|jaker: the third spade from dummy, thus endplayed east to give a ruff sluff to get rid to the last  heart. that was nicely done|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: specs here missed a cool defense on  29|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: all that leads to ... should declarer duck at trick 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT are 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|pelu: very go0od lead - decl need @C-ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they surely have other bids for 7 hcps support, 3@c and 3@d bergen raises are not preemptive either, only 3M is|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|andreasw:  with @d ace well placed i think he will make anyway|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle: the @sK didn't paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|farrukh: there maybe some scoring fault on brd 8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|cicus: I have to go, thanks all, bye|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  and more imps for NS in this board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|farrukh: both teams made 6@s/6@h but score shows +11 for sweden|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|andyv:  N not happy here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: nice defense - if JHN overruff easy win|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @D 10 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W saying something about overtricks squeeze|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last board on the table|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: against 6@S  Tony Nunn led @CA then shifted to @DK    Simon deWijs misguessed and went down  huge swing against 5@S making in other room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|farrukh: maybe operator can guide us best |pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: ?? why not the @dJ first?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h4|pc|cQ|nt|farrukh: perhaps there was a ruling|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont think there was a way to beat this.. although N did good here|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: no he played the @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you're welcome :)  thanks all for the commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: daily bulletins at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes.... + 1|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D not 2@C???|pg||
nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Dennis, thank you for the hard work done |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you're welcome :) thank you for the commentary|pg||
nt|andyv:  whew|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rmb1: Chance for England at the death, 6@D looks reasonable|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks all for being with us|pg||
nt|star6ija: thanks for all helpful comments|pg||
nt|hedyg:  and to Arifin and Thomas for guiding us through these boards|pg||
nt|andreasw:  did east really pass?|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|sfoxa:  World Champioship is a unique opportunity to follow 10 tables in a while|pg||
nt|andyv:  final board of this match.  thank you Pim for an excellent job as our vugraph coordinator.  And ty to all the specs for their participation.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: for live scores; http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: weird = underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d is conventional|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty to Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 31 proved to be a big swing for USA1|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like South needs to show her @H for NS to have a chance|pg||
nt|star6ija: also to Rob for his terrific job and to BBO for making possible to watch online this remarkable event|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thank you!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: East lands on her feet ... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: in their big win over USA2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S kept the auction open with a 1@s bid and game was easily reached|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
nt|rhelle: as the axe was getting perilously close to her neck |pg||
nt|pelu: ok last board here - tx to Rob our hard working operator, to Andreas for his help and to all kibs for their fine comments - see u i 1 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N : "Sorry, could not resist"|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry Paul is our >Operator - :(:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hehe|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Paul - Rob .. almost the same;)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese women even bought the contract now|pg||
nt|rmb1: We don't have the open room auction but they avoid two spade losers|pg||
nt|ahalim: Dennis must be good, just like his family name says : Stuurman|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: see you tomorrow at 10 AM CET for the round 13...remember that places between 7th and 14th are in a 8 IMPs margin, so the interesting fights are stiil to come|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: likely end score Indonesia wins 49-39|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Note 26   2@C=6@C  no 4M but maybe 5M|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just in time|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: on repeated trump leads, this may not be fun either|pg||
nt|rhelle: and what do we do against doubled partscores, boys and girls? We lead trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N take the push?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  as cards lie this looks like +1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: usa will be more secure after this match|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s taps could easily destroy this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul may make E think twice about trying to make the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: VPs*|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: excellent!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board: thanks to operator (Karen?) and earlier commentators David Burn and Ben Green|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@d was gf checkback|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio shaking her head when dummy came down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here -1 (how to get @SQ SD:)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Egypt-Israel  USA2-Italy  Brazil-USA1   all BB on voice tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with @c cue they might...|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@H showed 4 @hs, did not deny 3 @ss|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  E will need to knock out the A of @cs first|pg||
nt|andyv:  then a 4th spade by S will set up a 2nd @h trick on the upper cut|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: indeed if no @D now still makes 4@S    IF IF IF:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: may be 13 imp's ...... ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA @DA @DK can as well|pg||
nt|alunand14: Romanski lead with @S 7:(|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is in trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD came in to check if we where busy with last game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: only 4 min. left|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|rhelle: that's more like it|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle: trumps, Pony ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: tries to work on double revoke I assume|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Willard worried about @D losers after the  non-descript opening from Palmer|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|andreasw:  now this is only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rhelle: the Q is a good card. If East ruffs @cs, the 2nd is with a trump winner|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  defense too friendly here...E will get off going down one|pg||
nt|hedyg:  yes she should have corrected to @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 50 mins approx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bye all, the next match starts in 1 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but will go 1 down|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: wonder if NS knew 4@D was length rather than shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty, see you!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpb: good defense play by Japan|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: ok 49-39 congrats Indonesia|pg||

nt|jaapfr: sudah malam:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok sore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at my table  Muller forgoe opening strong 1@C and bought hand at 4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...have fun the rest of this bermuda bowl.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Venice Cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: venice cup this table :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|hedyg:  4@s is the correct contract|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and so ends day 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everyone  3 more matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpb: probably expecting that bessis bid 2@s if she wanted to know 3-card support|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if she throws E in now there is an endplay to make the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg:  but no way she can see that|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i think 2@d followed by 3NT surely shows 5@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg:  else she could have bid 3NT directly|pg||
nt|tomi2: what else can she now play for? a revoke?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  how can she know that @cs are blocked?|pg||
nt|tomi2: she can hope for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but no defender will have bared the @sK|pg||
nt|ahalim: drop @SK singleton ??|pg||
nt|hedyg:  it is a miracle but only miracle can save her for sure|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|glen: thanks all, was fun :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h insted of @s trick 2 would have made the overtrick "if u can guess that cards lie pretty good lol";)|pg||
