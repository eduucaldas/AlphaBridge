mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|projekt1: hi,  guten Tag :) dzyen dobry|pg||
mb|d|nt|davidstern: Hi All|pg||
nt|vugraphzpc: hi welcome|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am at the venue if anybody has any questions please ask|pg||
mb|r|nt|lionberg:  both pairs plays natural, with 15-17 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: NS play polish club, EW better minor|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey all:)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Bo and Andreas|pg||
nt|vugraphzpc: hi Andreas|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: dzien dobry is the correct writing -  thx|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lionberg:  In this match, australia needs a result to qualifie.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpc: Australia on 8th place at the moment, Denmark on 3|pg||
nt|lionberg:  Denmark is qualified but needs a good result to end 1,.2. or 3.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lionberg:  the winner of the round robbin will pick there opponent for the next match and has a carrie-over|pg||
nt|davidstern: There are close qualifications in most divisions. Perhaps the most interesting is Venice Cup where France Netherlands and Germany are fighting it out|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Only choose opponents from 5th through 8th|pg||
mb|2H|nt|davidstern: So first takes a pick from 5th through 8th, then second third and fourth|pg||
nt|davidstern: As things stand now USA 2 would likely get USA 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|projekt1: three preempts: 3@c,  4@c  and 5@c|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: So 3NT N/S here looks the go|pg||
nt|davidstern: Or perhaps 4@S|pg||
nt|davidstern: I must say that the organisation, venue and operations here are absolutely the best I have been to|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@s has no chance unless Australia helps.. 3!n also need help but is better |pg||
nt|davidstern: Although 3NT looks to lose 3@C and two diamonds but West has limited enttries|pg||
nt|davidstern: Imagine 3NT by North what does East lead - a heart would be fatal|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: 4@S has no play as we can see but imagine after a transfer and a possible club lead and heart switch or heart lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Quite a tortuous auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpc: Jens writing for W..|pg||
nt|davidstern: If any of my Australian friends are watching say hello please - as I a homesick :( JOKING of course|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know.. let's say east led @c K against 3!n shoulnd W pitch @c J auto?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Should only pitch @CJ if he wants 3NT to make but normal to do so|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: in closed room no intervention ... |pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  3!n wont make if he pitches @c J?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  or she* im still not sure:-))|pg||
nt|davidstern: Suppose three rounds of clubs taken by the ace and five spades then East has to come down to five cards. Needs to keep two hearts only can keep one diamond and one club which would ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: be fatal|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: This looks like 6 imps to Denmark to open their bank account|pg||
nt|lionberg:  jens will surely make this. The auction has given it away for Australia|pg||

nt|ahalim: 2NT seems lebensohl|pg||
nt|vbman: when n opens slam is guaranteed|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach 7... but 6 should be a walk in the park for these guys|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: first board already an exciting board, minimal opening of N, but nice layout|pg||
mb|1N|nt|viren169: simple J2N|pg||
nt|frankaus: Egtton in early 20's, Gosney just 30+/-|pg||

nt|lechcold: dzieñ dobry|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome to Veldhovn|pg||
nt|henryb:  India is third in the Senior Bowl, USA 1 is tied for 7th|pg||
nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I really like the dble...|pg||
nt|viren169: ruff 4 clubs in North's hand...|pg||
nt|frankaus: the whole AUS open team under 50 quite unusual|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the 5th trump that make South's hand a great hand...|pg||
nt|vbman: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed young Australian players|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E is taking time to evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: jak to czêsto ostatnimi czasy bywa, seniorzy s¹ nasz¹ ostoj¹...|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go make sure my team is in place. be back shortly|pg||
nt|davidstern: .|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
nt|vbman: 5th trump also means the queen|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ryskiel_: dizeñ dobry - witam spragnionych dobrej gry i zwyciêstwa dru¿yny polskiej...|pg||
nt|vbman: they might bid grand if they have the technology|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  greetings again|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: kasle is now aware about the five possible discards|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good start Indonesia|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ryskiel_: banalne 10 lew choæ rozgrywaj¹cy jeszcze o tym nie wie, szczególnie po wicie w jego kolor...mo¿e zacznie co kombinowaæ ale szybko oka¿e siê, ¿e strach ma wielkie oczy tylko|pg||
nt|viren169: should be a flat bd...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: but a bit shot into the dark|pg||
nt|ritong: but he might find surprising declarer did not try for @s A on|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vbman: when opps are slamming it is seldom benefitial to dbl anything , only if u want to save vul vs. not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jacksond: poorish borderline game. looks like 2 losers in both diamonds and clubs even if Diamond ace was favourable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ryskiel_: nie kombinuje - praktyczny jegomoæ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: also, a @h cancels the fifth discard|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|henryb:  Declarer might have been better advised to start the crossruff without cashing the @hA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  declarer can now make 5 in several ways: on a club return, a double squeeze with hearts in the middle or a straight forward red suit squeeze against S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: now west has to give dummy an entry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|3for3: 110 and 1 imp to usa|pg||
nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|pelu: 6@d and 6NT almost the same - u need to play @D with no losers|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  now schaltx will for sure not stand under slam|pg||
nt|lionberg:  here 2 hearts is 8-10, which make it easier to guess diamonds |pg||

mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|projekt1: the excitement is high,  every point is important for the qualification|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@H here and for pd 4 card suit|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bouqets to NZ Open team: Their score was wrong and they went to the scorer two days after the error and pointed it out to them stating they didnt want to qualify under a scoring ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: error|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what would 4!n be now?|pg||

mb|p|nt|otoj: otherwise decl had time to establish club for down 1|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: I think they started with spade, than twice harts|pg||

nt|viren169: a heavy 2@H|pg||
nt|vbman: unless campos tries something clever|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: not an easy board for N-S to avoid getting too high|pg||
nt|frankaus: N had only 10HCP but 27 zars  - only need 26 to open |pg||
mb|d|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||

nt|otoj: a discipline pass by N.. |pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello mr arifin|pg||

nt|viren169: and more pressure from West|pg||
nt|viren169: dble again and pass the 4@C response?|pg||
nt|vbman: or pass out|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to zar points - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a good preemptive raise from W, S has 19pt and normally does not want to pass|pg||
nt|viren169: South may try (unsuccessfully) 3N|pg||
nt|jacksond: little harder to get to slam after opponents have pre-empted|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
nt|vbman: think the raise will help him|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oj - obawiam siê ¿e to nie obiegnie|pg||

nt|josj: selamat malam dari Veldhovend ke Indonesia:)|pg||
nt|jacksond: South going to bid 3NT surely|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Laska powstrzymaj szalej¹ce konie proszê...|pg||
nt|viren169: Dble is best...|pg||

nt|szeryf: witam polskich kibiców|pg||

nt|josj: hi Liliek, Arifin and Joto :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a really interesting bidding sequence, with good judgement from N to get out of 3@s x|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: eh ono Liliek|pg||
nt|vbman: l disagree with campos' raise|pg||
nt|szeryf: tu Ryszard Kie³czewski - muszê obs³ugiwaæ dwa pokoje st¹d drugi nick|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|westjava: Oom Jos apa kabar..?:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||
nt|henryb:  The US1 team had an easy time against Reunion in the same round|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: 5 for 11 and 1 for 10|pg||

nt|don_kapu: -1 or maybe -2|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if direct going for the cross ruff then 4@H C easily|pg||
nt|jacksond: Australia need a reasonble result in this match against Denmark the leaders in the RR to be sure of a KO match|pg||
pc|s4|nt|westjava: tuan rumah sibuk, ya..?:)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  Looks safest to do this: concede the diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid over 3@h. 3@h is forcing - although it does not promise 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n might be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good lead from west here.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks to be down 1: 6 trumps and three aces. But maybe he can set up the long spade while he still has control|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hJ, @s ruff, @cA, @dA -- no. not quite|pg||

nt|henryb:  E-W have an easy 4@h - or 500 from 5@cX|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4@s would be one down as well|pg||
nt|don_kapu: P - 1@S - X ? (Manoppo) or 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess 2@d is the majors|pg||
nt|grebrof: personally I prefer 2@c as majors - so that P can relay with 2@d to find the longest majorsuit|pg||
nt|grebrof: here, W has no problems|pg||

mb|2D|nt|3for3: 620 a good score for usa....4 losers, but defense will be under pressure to break a pointed suit, depending on the lead.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or three after 2 spades and a club shift?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N is not agreeing with S bidding on previous game and other way round|pg||
nt|jacksond: another slam hand. Very few high card points for EW but slam ok|pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: ok, 2@d was 4card @s and another +5card suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank you!|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I would have bid 6@d instead of 5@h with the south cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  est could then ask about hand quality with 3@d|pg||
nt|henryb:  and east would say "bad" by bidding 3@H|pg||
nt|hlortz: mosca may fear west was just joking with 2nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: putting the pressure on by E|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3@h = monimum|pg||

nt|jacksond: seniors dont overcall with Ron's hand. However in the BB and VC it is a different matter|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: this might keep EW out of @Ss|pg||

nt|viren169: Me too...|pg||
nt|viren169: Pass is the toughest bid to make in bridge!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: especially for a 20 year old aboriginal|pg||

pc|s3|nt|viren169: 5@S+3@D+1@C=9|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobh1: in the other room robinson did not balance with 2@H|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure I would bid on the N-hand (2@D = multi) . and I am senior :)|pg||
nt|jacksond: but not as long as Ron has been a Senior. Too stressful in long tournaments|pg||
nt|pelu: I played against Ron first time in 1972 im Miami (OC)|pg||

mb|p|nt|projekt1: Poland 3.  Germany 8. |pg||

mb|d|nt|grebrof: "the Viking club" played by Grøtheim and Tundal is probably the most famous system from Norway, but still few players in Norway actually play it|pg||

nt|ritong: thus poizat opts for showing directly the suit|pg||
nt|blewah: Manopo has more than just 2@c, obviously|pg||
nt|viren169: N may have dbled 3@C wishing to compete...|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Is this one of the pairs that play either precision or Polish @c depending on vulnerability?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i guess @Hs is better altho both make on this layout|pg||
nt|3for3: slam needs little more than a favorable lie in clubs, but as we can see, today they are not|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  On the other hand, even down 4 is only 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@D was 1 or both majors with invitational values and 3@S rejected spades|pg||
nt|jacksond: Well if they bid that one wiith so few points then the Australian EW pair will certainly bid this one |pg||

nt|hlortz: these days you cant tell if the north hand is a weak or strog nt|pg||
nt|projekt1: the biding in open room was 1@d-1S-1NT-3Nt |pg||

nt|blewah: you are doing great, Karen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if a bid of 1 @S was unbalanced and bigger hand by W?|pg||
nt|3for3: modern style is to bypass 1@S with 4333...I think this is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right,  she is 4333 |pg||
nt|3for3: east can still checkback for 4@S, i am sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the hand worth a check back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: and aceless 4x1 |pg||
nt|3for3: aceless 11, stiff king of diamonds...but it is a VUL game to shoot for|pg||
nt|sybarra: close  |pg||

pc|c8|nt|roswolf: that was well judged by north imo|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobh1: ood job backing into game |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I guess Peter (S) diddnt want to bid 1 NT with only xx in @h here, plus they maybe play 1 NT as forcing|pg||
nt|henryb:  Americans balance more freely than most others|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but there a @S discard was needed to make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@h was not absolutely necessary|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
nt|henryb:  but Hamilton made it because West mistakenly pitched a spade|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: probably playing on clubs until the cows come home|pg||
nt|viren169: or until the E/W give him an entry to dummy with a @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: egtton flipping over @cQ and @d4 in his hand|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... the Q should have been on the table 5 mins ago!|pg||
nt|viren169: E/W will do well to cash their hearts and clubs and exit a spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: now he also considers @sK|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like E/W are playing reverse cound so West will know the position when the 2nd club is played...|pg||

nt|viren169: Not sure this line can ever be right?!?!|pg||
nt|petergill: is reverse count, except is some situations|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|bobh1: for his part, N might have jumped to 3@S the first time, but he didn't want to hang his partner for balancing|pg||

nt|bobh1: good defense by giving a @D ruff|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|bobh1: he figured it out|pg||
nt|hlortz: down this time - selling the 6 imps that henry was talking about earlier if of team stays out of game|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Schartz and Finkel have been very accurate so far; can they continue -- not necessary to get a @h ruff, though, they have a natural @s trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: making 6 seems a lot |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  One of the advantages of Polish @c is that @d shows @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (1@d)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if S hits it can N sit?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that sud be just =|pg||
nt|3for3: very playable, and as the card lie, makeable 6@H|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: but it consumes lots of space when @hs can be the strain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  on repeated trump leads, 2@h is probably down|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S anyone?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: @D to queen picks up Jx in either hand for 3 tricks, whereas @d to ten does not pick up 3 tricks if loses to king with 4-2 @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows 6 or more spades|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 2@H is a just a general force... (or an xfer to @S?)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe hard to reach slam now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||
nt|jacksond: still lots of boards remaining|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: 6@H much better from north|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: A transfer: X of 1@H would have been 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: No 2@H shows 6+ @S 100% for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: with it being a xfer... they should go more slowly to investigate the slam|pg||
nt|viren169: ok thks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North will probably move|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the south hand doesn't look like it's a slam on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: North can be very weak with 6 @S, so South has shown a really good hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 6 looser hand opposite another 5-6 looser, may try|pg||
nt|viren169: North will make another move with 2 bullets |pg||
nt|pelu: B9: Australia in 3NT - Lead @H = making|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||
nt|3for3: since the clubs are with east|pg||

nt|3for3: i dont think they will sniff at slam|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like the 4@S bid...|pg||
nt|viren169: wd... now 6@S should be reached...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|vbman: 2h maybe at least inv'l|pg||
nt|viren169: ...5@D-5@H-6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil Edgtton correctly upgraded his 17 count as too strong for 15-17 1NT. That @D suit is worth more like 9 points than 7 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: as south I would write down I would push on to slam and bid 5@d|pg||

pc|h5|nt|blewah: if i read their CC correctly|pg||
nt|lechcold: gdyby Laska spasowa³ na tê kontrê...:)|pg||

nt|roswolf: i would rebid 2@D instead of 1nt - avoids this inelegant contract|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@S, the best play is to draw trumps and try to get the 12th trick from @D, not to try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|viren169: South felt he has to catch up...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 round of trumps (finding they break) and ruff a @C?!?!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4@d looks like a splinter.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  3@c like a mini-splinter but there are several other options possible.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason Gos chose 5@C instead of 4NT is that it gave Nabil a way to stop in 5@S, if Nabil's 4@S bid had been a puint instead of the real thing |pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer finds out about both black aces before playing trumps, he has a chance to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  but likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|3for3: once again...wrong :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s have to know they are behind in match, so maybe pressing |pg||
nt|ritong: good luck west|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong:  |pg||

nt|viren169: otherwise go back to @Ds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|alpagavp: For the moment France is 9th and China is 16th|pg||
nt|3for3: that doesnt really pay on the WBF scale.  You win or lose VP's regardless of the score of the match, until you are behind a very large amount|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E has a very unappatizing hand from which to lead and trys a little trickery.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|grebrof: a more agressive E would have bid the @s-suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Paul Gosney likes bidding 4NT 1430 as much as the rest of us, but there is a time (like here) to pass the captaincy of the decision to partner|pg||
nt|szeryf: only lead to make problems for declearer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: yes... I am sure he would have cue 5@H over 5@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|3for3: and -41 is not large enough....they would still get 6 vp's for that result.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am reminded,  n/s may not think they are behind,  this table has been pretty good |pg||
nt|3for3: well done...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: given explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy lead from E hand |pg||

nt|szalay: these cards better, but slam is harder|pg||
nt|ritong: ola ton|pg||
nt|don_kapu: why ruia play @C K|pg||
nt|jaapfr: senior moment?|pg||
nt|blewah: :)|pg||
nt|don_kapu: namanya juga udah tuek (from my teacher Kbayan)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as we all have now and then|pg||
nt|alunand14: ruia hope E lead from @D AJ10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: They are talking about it, he didn't want to make a mistake if it could go down|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil knew not to look for grand slam, as North would have bid 4NT if searching for grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  But he can ruff just enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@c was not a mini splinter, expl at table, 4 card support in @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N said: I did not know that when the cards from S where on the table|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult position for S - 3NT looks as a fair bid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx for asking karen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yw|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
nt|blewah: no game, but N may get anxious with his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@c from S, and then...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: you right aria|pg||
nt|don_kapu: -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt even|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but different if x |pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H-3nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w in the other room had clear sailing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Arnim writing a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as most operators will tell you,  they write in tiny little writing |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes they do :)|pg||
nt|3for3: better than tiny big writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: two entire little pages now|pg||
nt|viren169: Will E/W bid game here? And which one?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  no; 3@c something and 3@d = what?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4@s?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was wrong. They made 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A mini-splinter is typically something like 8-10 hcp, 4 card trump support and a singleton or void in the bid suit.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzpd: director in... 35 minutes left|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty vincent|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: unlucky 3nt no chance at all|pg||
nt|viren169: and neither will 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Villas Boas with his weak trumps wisely retreats to 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit of a leap into the unknown!|pg||
nt|petergill: The Dbl of 4@H will guide S to @H7 lead, I think |pg||
nt|petergill: S thinking whether to Dbl 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south asks west if they play stayman with 5@h4@s or the other way around, west confirming|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N i am sorry|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  So this may have been about the same range without the distributional information.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|don_kapu: 4@H and 1@D for defender|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nkgupt: i have seen many experts rebid 2@d on such hands and find it diff to catch up later|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 17 HCP 3 aces and 5/5 is enough to bid 3@d no?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||
nt|alpagavp: :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Cronier is looking at her @c and might think to play 6NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah 2@C = A MULTI|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3@H 2@S 1@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think she was going to pass anything Arnim bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has a 5 count opposite 10-12,  so she knows opps have more points|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was in mucking it up |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, i guess she would, doesnt seem to be other option, would have played in a 3 3 fit :)|pg||

pc|dA|nt|grebrof: if you can have 6 card minor in your 1nt - I rather bid it at the 3level|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|grebrof: NS obviously using Rusinov leads|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading something else might have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: finding the @s Q is not important anymore - contract should be safe as there are no ruffs anywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, we all would lead @hs, but even that lead might not beat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and 6@C said that I think we are high enough!|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any endplay or squeeze - if there was one, Tony Nunn would almost certainly have found it|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|grebrof: if P can bid some sort of Stayman - you normally can make 3@c/@ds OR it is a better contract than 1nt anyway|pg||

nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||
nt|blewah: you cannot take side, Pak Jaap. according to the handbook of commentators page 1034|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mikael_w: would be intrested to see how E/W do in @h. But there is a big risk it will end up in a bloodbatch when the trumphs starts to thin out|pg||

nt|sybarra: and thanks to all of the specs for your great comments,   lots of fun |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: last board of this match|pg||
nt|pelu: remember board 12 where S passed after the RD - in OR S bid 1@D - and NS played 3@D making|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: y thx harold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks likely|pg||
nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C on @SQ lead: Clubs 4-1 is more likely than @D 6-1, so declarer would get that guess right|pg||
nt|viren169: And finally onto the last....|pg||
nt|jacksond: Last board. If scores in all matches remain much as they are it looks like denmark will finish 4th in RR. Unfortunately for them that means they will nearly certtainly play USA 1 ...|pg||
nt|jacksond: in quarterfinals as USA look like finishing in 5-8 spot and the top thre in the RR will avoid picking USA1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: tom. the quarter finals will start|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks karen.....thanks jaap......thanks all :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  will A make a negative double? yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Karen, WBF and BBO (including all kibz and commentators)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is marginal at best|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rest of our friends did fall asleep:)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C can be doubleton if 4432 or 5332|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Rob.  A big hand for our operator Rob Jetten, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty for watching and see you later for the final round of 21|pg||

nt|ritong: lasserre*|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est necéssaire|pg||
nt|pelu: DEN 2 VPs from 3.place - still 4 boards in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 4 or 5 spades, not 6 spades|pg||
nt|viren169: what do you do with 6 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: east didn't even dare to support on his 4crd suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||

nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I'm not sure if I read the explanation of 3@H right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: perfect pressure bid 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: and again the last board is an exciting one.....|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
nt|lokaty: dwa ostatnie rozdania nieciekawe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if 5@H and expected @SA lead N has enough @S to falsecard and E might continue @D in tr 2|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Might nip this a trick but it's going to be closer than s expects.  Can e avoid a @s loser?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Double-dummy he can but in the real world...|pg||

nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  with the favorable location of both kings and good diamond break declarer should make 3 or four, winning 2 imps|pg||
