nt|vugraphznx: Round 8 of 21 in the Bermuda Bowl 2011|pg||
nt|ady: Bochi likely to open|pg||
nt|ady: may lead to a grand slam 1st hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Welcome , we are about to start with the first match of the day|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT call is risky, but passing is just as risky|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And the 3NT call worked well in a strange way, as it pushed the opponents too high|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|kit: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|kit: The 1@D response shows hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 1@s= unbalanced 5=@cs 4@ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 5+@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: it's west thinking. Not South of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: HI ALL|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ady: rehi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Rehi, problem fixed|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W thinking|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Good double by Kamil -- he didn't want to hear more, and judged that 4@S wasn't making|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witam w drugim w dzisiejszym dniu meczu polskiej dru¿yny - w porannej rundzie wygralimy 49:16 z Japoni¹|pg||
nt|xenya: well, W should be happy to pass now|pg||
nt|ady: suggested 4@S make    but should lose 1 trick in each suit |pg||
mb|3C!|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Joe.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: singleton kings often good enough as stopper but nothere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we dont know whether this is forcing or invitational|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i suspect invitational|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: it is invitational with 6 card @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: south thinking|pg||
nt|ady: north has decided to rescue   looking for a minor suit fit|pg||
nt|xenya: winning decision by N to run|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 3@c bid nearly on the table|pg||
nt|ady: need to ruff 4 clubs in north hand|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ady: good morning Bob|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C a make for n/s   2 hearts X would have been 300|pg||

nt|ady: east may try 3@D|pg||
nt|xenya: now W is in a quandary |pg||
nt|ady: though north did show minor suits|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: but not at N/E side of the screen|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good decision, this time by W|pg||
nt|xenya: the pass, i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Hi all // and sorry -- had technical problems -- should be fixed now :)|pg||
nt|kit: This is a messy 4-3 fit.  Diamonds would be better strain, but difficult to get there.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: We did not miss much - Fleisher is still thinking about the line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Fleisher did say before the match that he takes some time when he is declaring a board before playing a card|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: maybe I could learn something from that :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: both pairs using upside down count & attitude  [udca]|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: lol 5 yes|pg||
nt|kit: It may not make too much difference how this contract does, since in other room South is struggling in 5@D doubled!|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the re-match of the last match of the European championship in Ostende, 2010|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel has won then 20:10 and was as close as one slam hand to win the event instead of Italy|pg||

nt|timmy5:  good morning folks|pg||

nt|ady: good morning Taymour|pg||
nt|xenya: E had better convert to 4@S....  |pg||
nt|timmy5:  i was in the open room and this was played 2h x|pg||
nt|xenya: but might be tough for him...  |pg||
nt|xenya: remember that W passed over 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E still in tank|pg||
nt|timmy5:  i think he will pass|pg||
nt|xenya: so his club holding can't be that good|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks down 2|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S seems down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi Ron|pg||
nt|odysseus69: stopper after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hi Ron wlc|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|kit: He will cash club, then king of diamonds and diamond ruff -- he doesn't know how good South's hearts might be.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: would west dble with only 2 jacks?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it really doesn't matter much what he plays as he's due to get 2@d tricks without the ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: right, but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well what is W doubling on?|pg||
nt|kit: who knows -- but when I see a sure set I take it|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fleisher still thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: And if W is out of @S?|pg||
nt|kit: there is no way West would be leading queen of diamonds from Qxx on this auction -- it must be a short suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to predict this won't be a quick match.  Neither Kamil nor Fleishner is exactly a speed demon.|pg||
nt|panosk: very question i think is how high|pg||
nt|ady: in a grand slam  might start trying to set up long diamond   but that line does not work   but may be able to change mid stream and rudff 4 clubs |pg||

mb|7H|nt|ryskiel_: dzieñ dobry Pañstwu - rozpoczynamy d³ugi serial olimpijski - dzisiaj ogl¹damy mecz Polska - Egipt|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he is considering possibility of down 3 -- heart to partner's ace, diamond through, 2 diamond tricks, and partner having jack of spades|pg||
nt|ady: in any even it looks aplus for Israel in both rooms|pg||
nt|xenya: well bid by both sides i think|pg||
nt|timmy5:  other table went -1 in 2h x|pg||

nt|panosk: 8 teams|pg||
nt|ady: thx Panos     so Egypt in the running   they are 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 8 teams will qualify ,  Number 1 picks a team from 5-8 , then 2 , then 3 |pg||
nt|panosk: Egypt is 9th with 1.3 VP from 8th|pg||

nt|henryb:  for those of you suggesting I learn Gazilli, when it gets standardized, I will, but at the moment there are almost as many versions as there are pairs that "play" Gazilli|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: south will need keep declarer from 2nd heart trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: But I think he did the practical thing|pg||
nt|kit: This gets East a ruff, but still might not have been best defense.  East is now end-played, and declarer can crossruff a lot.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: the @D lead looks a bit dangerous to me but all is well |pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Cashing jack of hearts may cost.  Declarer should have known East is out of hearts, since otherwise East surely would have led another trump rather than a spade.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: AC and club|pg||
nt|ady: will clear doubts of easts shape|pg||
nt|timmy5:  9 of diamonds is still ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer was hoping for an endplay over W|pg||
nt|yuval10: but now E will cash all the @c's|pg||
nt|yuval10: for -3|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes but finally will end with 6 tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: big swing here as the contract was cold|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ady: 8 imps to Egypt|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: asking director|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see why N elected to return that heart, but of course he had given the problem more thought than i did  |pg||
nt|timmy5:  after  N bid 2nt it was almost clear that N had a singelton heart|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N called and explains, that his point is about the hesitation from W and the 4@d bid after 2 minutes of thinking from W|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|nt|kit: Now West can ruff in, play a trump, and the contract fails by a trick.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: 1 second|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: 1 second|pg||
nt|ady: good start for Egypt|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I missed west pitching a diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: They are making some noise , i called for director |pg||
nt|panosk: if a@D was discarded then this shud make i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Madala told Saaid  north showed 6-4  so he pitched a diamond right away|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: director is called|pg||
nt|ady: declarer in OR got spades lead and immediatel ruffed a club    and ruffed 3 more clubs  did not attempt diamond set up|pg||
nt|panosk: ahh that will take some time |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 3NT showed 6-4 he explained|pg||
nt|ady: this could fail if one defender had only 3 clubs and Q@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: But Bocchi explained the same i think|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I checked, Bocchi wrote down  minimum with 6@H 4@D  |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: West understands and director is taking it in consideration|pg||
mc|13|nt|ady: how was this made?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: So just made for now , and probably will stay like that|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: West pitched a @D on the second heart|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm told dbl was takeoy for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "Everyone must have QJ109xxx" of diamonds here /// says Kamil after the lead // laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Could make it anyway , but Bocchi went down when he played the 2nd heart ,  then west let it make, for him because he got information that north had exactly 4@D|pg||
nt|panosk: double and 2nt from S shoed 18-19 + but N cant help muchfurther|pg||

nt|ady: west will be end played with 3rd club   but 8 tricks still looks difficult|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: A@D*|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: check out Tony Nunn's 1st seat favorable 2@S opening with East hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 down most likely..|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|xenya: however the dummy is not what he expected perhaps, and the contract seems to be doomed|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|kit: and so he does!|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since 4@s makes unless West leads a trump, this is probably a good save|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW into truble here - @s and @s and @s will give N a good plus|pg||
nt|xenya: on 17, slam was duly bid in the other room -- 11 imps to Israel|pg||

nt|ady: 10@D looks best|pg||
nt|panosk: was just informed that USA 2 also lost to Singapore impressive |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: Bocchi play in 7@D   unlucky   can make with diamonds 5-2 the otherway   or any 4-3 break   but may have been able to combine rufffin 4 clubs and bringing in the diamonds  by not ...|pg||
nt|ady: drawing 2nd trump|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|vugraphznx: H6 lavinthal|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H by NS happens to be cold as the cards lie, but that is beside the point|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Now he will have to decide which opponent to play for the doubleton club|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: so 2 imps to Egypt on this one, due to the double in the other room|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|szalay: it was good detective work|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h7|pc|d7|nt|grebrof: should taken @h A too|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|szalay: the red and @C honours was known, with K of @S South wd have strong for 1@D|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: so declarer will end with 11 tricks for a push|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: this a good swing for italy |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|henryb:  He has to just concede South's South should have cashed the trump A before playing the third spade|pg||
nt|kit: however, he still has problems on what to discard from dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w played the nt getting a @h lead and continuation.|pg||
nt|kit: and the unfortunate club discard undid his good work.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: J@S  better  if switching to a spade|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Director is here|pg||
nt|ady: will not cost the contract|pg||
nt|panosk: again Bob tell him to stay a bit longer just in case :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Madala asked Bocchi in italian after the bidding on the previous hand  |pg||

nt|roswolf: 3nt by west seems normal|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: I think 3@S with the flat hand and owning the ranking suit is enough on the East hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|sunsamvar:  to slam ?|pg||
nt|xenya: he will after 5@H by N|pg||
nt|szalay: I feel it nearly automatic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4+@S   or maybe 4/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 2@c is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|twcho: =16+ any or natural |pg||
nt|odysseus69: north has shown a weak hand with support for either major|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: However, the 4@S call is effective, pushing the opponents overboard when 4@S was headed down.  Same auction at both tables.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The double with three only @H's does not seem to have a lot of upside and we see the danger here.  Would prefer to have a stiff for this 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Might not llike having only 3 hearts, but I don't think North can sit back and pass -- too easy to lose a double part-score swing when partner has a minor.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H is clearly in the picture|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT is probably some sort of @c fit if 2@c is @c|pg||
nt|twcho: now 3@h confirms that south has 16+ with 5+@s and 4+@H and nothing said about @c|pg||
nt|twcho: some info provided by our Icelandic spectators: 2N = minors, <9, short in @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: but not to slam, with possible 2 red losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st names around the horn   N:Paul  E:Ricco S:Nabil W:Louk|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerabilty wrong for 5@D save|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Kamil will probably compete to 5@S, and then it is anybody's guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I will enter the bids 2  and 2 .. so the players would not know who is hesitating|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Kamil has already bid|pg||

pc|h5|nt|szalay: I suggest 4@H as alternative|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S undoubled?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "I expected that bid by the way" Fleisher says|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "I am sorry in advance" was the reply from Kamil|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows declarer has 4 clubs and maybe diamond right - we see its worst play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: what an unusual way to steal the pot|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes 6@s undoubled|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can defeat 6@H with low diamond lead -- which might well be found.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H needs @H 2-2 or good news in @D's.. this is not happening here so 5 imps back to Italy|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@d is not without chance but certainly a very difficult contract. 4@h is another possible strain|pg||

mb|1D|nt|grebrof: E would normally draw Ss @s9, so theres no ruff in @h|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: South thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 enough for old timer|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: wb Geoffrey|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  small heart or @d10?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference  2@H = 4/5@H not 4@S   not sure after 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not alerted...so must be natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: With South's 5@C call under pressure, North has to guess whether or not to bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcwla: If 4@H would have been a cuebid, that's possible, or else just 5@C - now will N raise?|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps the 5@C bid should be stronger than pass followed by 5@C, but do they have that agreement?|pg||
nt|xenya: would be nice, Gy, of that describes W's hand -- long spades etc...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  nice crowding of the auction |pg||

pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|ryskiel_: chyba pod¹¿¹ do slemika w karo?|pg||

nt|xenya: and there it comes |pg||
nt|odysseus69: just enough from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North judged to bid 4D and South compounded the damage with a 5th|pg||
nt|twcho: did north pause long before bidding 2@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: It's probably about the speed of the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: south clearly thinks for a while before bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he gave it a thought, but not very long|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: think it's about south long pause, that's why he called director|pg||
nt|panosk: which you think is beter bid Madala's striaght 1@S or Sadek's 2@S balancing?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: i'm not so sure, Sunil -- after S's pass N can't expect him to have this kind of hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: change 'possible' to 'probable'  or  according to spec  'absolutely'|pg||
nt|twcho: east protects himself by calling director because he feels that the 3@h is slow|pg||

nt|henryb:  a trifle overboard|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure that i like the bidding in the OR, where South only asked puppet stayman and bided game|pg||

nt|henryb:  Declarer finessed the @d 9 and pitched att three of dummy's clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are either 1-suit or canape where 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's an oversimplification, but if exceptions come up i'll point them out|pg||
nt|roswolf: passive defence is hard - defenders naturally want to get busy|pg||

pc|h4|nt|athene: that lead might get the defence a sixth trick (club to go with @SAK, @DAQ, @HA)|pg||
nt|athene: east can't afford to lose a tempo putting his partner in for more leads through dummy|pg||
nt|kit: if 3@D is one minor, then probably 3@H asks which minor and 3@S shows it is clubs|pg||

nt|henryb:  probably in a forcing club context|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case it makes sense|pg||
nt|athene: that was certainly a weird re-opening double in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: north has a double of 2@C maybe? - not south|pg||
nt|szalay: small(!) trump as well|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: wow|pg||
nt|xenya: probably -2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course a club could be right|pg||
nt|jbgood: so this will likely be a push - making games in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: yes, south is obviously light for a normal jump shift|pg||
nt|athene: either it's strong club methods, or else they play Gazzilli so 3@C is just a decent 5-5, strong but not GF|pg||

nt|odysseus69: spade right if pd has diamond ace |pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: @H finesse is marked so declarer will need to finesse the K@C to make the double contract.|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: as he did|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fast claim |pg||
nt|ady: seems a strange play for Lauria in VR      A@H lead   and club switch   he played a club back rather than draw trumps and give a diamond    now further hearts shortened his trumps|pg||

nt|athene: well, 1@S - 1NT passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: w tempie|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: it was hard to defend, with the heart suit concealed|pg||
nt|kit: The South hand is an illustration of the value of playing 2/1 game-forcing.  What a rebid problem South would have it were non-forcing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile the Italians are piling on: averaging over 6 imps a board without reply|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S is a nice save oppsite 3NT/5@C|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kit: This is pretty poor.  North had to be worth something more than 4@H -- that sounds very weak, and North is loaded with primes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inference might be that Verhees has @D  since  he could have opened 2@S [their only weak 2 opener]|pg||
nt|twcho: he has a trump winner. So no need to attempt a @s shift|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: the defence decided to attack hearts viciously, including overtaking the @HQ with the king at one point :)|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: yes|pg||
nt|panosk: i think most of the imps gainned or lost are from par scores so they are quite important|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: The opening 1@D bid presents South with a problem.  Possible are 1@S, 1NT, and pass.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S with no "book" call over 1@d settles for a 4-card overcall.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D went down ---  i wonder what happened there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on board 21|pg||
nt|henryb:  XX = high honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: probably 17-19 or maybe 16+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ryskiel_: Acol w akcji - S pewnie pokaza³ 2 kontrole|pg||
nt|kit: Overcalling 1@S can lead to bad things when partner has 3 spades.  But this time it will work fine.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT has some chance on the lay    diamond lead would be best|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W wanted to bid over 3@c|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hope that double showed majors -it was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: no, double showed strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a Narkotyk dosta³ antybiotyk|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe couldn't handle bad @S break AND 3-1 trump|pg||
nt|timmy5:  diamond lead is not an option i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: finally decided not to|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S no chance if defence gets club ruff|pg||
nt|kit: skinny 23 point game, but all those 10's and 9's are going to help|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Declarer needsto get spades right - he will look suspiciously when North plays the 7 but will remember Souths 1 diamond bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: (must say I didnt understand much of the bidding - neither 2 NT nor 3 @s..)|pg||

nt|kamyk: na razie kontr¹ sam sobie wskaza³ wist treflowy:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 21H might show maximum of the 11-15 range, but with the misfits, S is unlikely to try for game... |pg||
nt|xenya: oh i'm completely wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   thought @D were 22|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: i am upset now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice contract -- many wouldn't think North hand good enough for 3rd bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1H was transfer to spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the alerting rules have escaped me again - a penalty double did not have much appeal|pg||
nt|ady: did well to make 1NT OR   must have been a low diamond lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: Madala couldn't open 1NT because they play weak notrump at favourable vulnerability|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphznx: arnolds explaining rdbl as a good hand|pg||
nt|szalay: some mistake in scriptbook|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told the 1@D opening is limited to 17, possibly 16 hcp|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: vriend did alert it|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be hard to make, but at least it's better than a no-trump contract|pg||
nt|kit: In the end this may depend on a spade guess.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going to get clubs wrong|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club to 10 likely|pg||
nt|timmy5: now this a time for a swing for egypt :)|pg||
nt|athene: but it was perhaps a little passive of him to leave 1@H, and not double it in the balancing seat?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ryskiel_: Ty Antoni ³atwiej trafiasz takie palcówki jak sam rozgrywasz kolor czy jak przeciwnicy Ciê wyrêczaj¹?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: South taking rosy view of his hand- presumably t/o now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ryskiel_: zagranie spod asa na szlemika nie przychodzi za czêsto...ostatnio tak wyszed³em w  maju....gdy kwit³y bzy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: @C ruff is certain now|pg||
nt|ady: mute point whether south should have proceeded after 2@S   and aslo taking out 3NT  with a flat collection|pg||
nt|kit: diamond switch probably most effective defense, but not very attractive into that diamond holding in dummy.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 4@h was cold, so -3 in this contract is a slightly better result|pg||
nt|twcho: we have almost identical auction in both tables|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|twcho: and I guess we will have another draw|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: If you pass with the S hand, you are hoping it goes 1@H, P, 2@H, so you have a perfect X on the next round.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and then p bids 2S, should you push to game?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garden2005: obstawiamy, trafi karo czy nie? |pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: i would be content with the 2@S contract as S, particularly non-vulnerable |pg||
nt|odysseus69: i missed the 1NT bid - N/S have been helpful|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has 9 sure tricks.|pg||
nt|henryb:  but declarer might go for 4|pg||
nt|athene: i guess with his partner limited to about 4 count he wanted to let sleeping dogs lie |pg||
nt|ady: should manag this in comforft    maybe an overtrick  around 5 to Egypt|pg||
nt|timmy5: iam being teezed by italian kibitzers:)|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: with such strong trump in the hand that would be tapped, the finesse was needed to maintain control|pg||
nt|twcho: even @sK onside, no use for declarer as he has no entry to dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|timmy5: lost in the open as he tried to ruff a club which is normal|pg||

nt|xenya: if he had won 1st trick in hand and played a club, N would have had to cash the black aces quickly, then declarer might have figured out that the @HA was with S|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: 2@H showed @S , 2@S = 3@S , or 4@S333|pg||

nt|xenya: but sometimes you can't do anything about that|pg||
nt|jbgood: but guess 2@c is for other purposes even over a 2 card opener...|pg||
nt|twcho: some more imps for Iceland|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|szalay: winner|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- for a huge gain|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for many this would be a weak hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe a good time for a system forget|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: W took his initial pass card to pass again causing some confusion because the 1@C bid had now appeared|pg||

pc|dT|nt|ryskiel_: ciekawe ile wyjani¹ w licytacji?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|pelu: Fredin is almost forced to play @DK - he cant imagina a @D-suit so weak|pg||

nt|ady: great scourse of tricks in 2 suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: what will be E rebid?|pg||
nt|twcho: transfer preempt|pg||
nt|ady: safely in 3NT OR|pg||
nt|timmy5: good score for E-W  in the open room - they were not over boardd|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sunsamvar:  3@S/3nt or 4 @d|pg||
nt|ady: and little wastage opposite singleton club|pg||
nt|roswolf: apparantly 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D is Mexican - down to balanced 18/19 or 18/20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and down on club lead I just noticed|pg||
nt|timmy5: and i expect same here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: probably has multiple meaning|pg||
nt|ady: Madala bidding his shape out|pg||
mb|d!|nt|odysseus69: or maybe a multi similarlu discounted|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S = a transfer to 2nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D = another transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|timmy5: very aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Normal but unfortunate lead.|pg||
nt|kit: Isn't it amazing how often dummy has the jack and declarer the ace when you make this lead.|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@H as choice of games?|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: deWijs won @DA and cashed @SQ    not sure what happens now in 6@S on 29|pg||
nt|kit: I must say that this is carrying leading your partner's suit to an extreme -- holding KQJxx of clubs and a natural trump trick anyway.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that wont trouble the scorers|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: On this hand the lead is best anyway, since North starts getting his small ruffs which is the goal for the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but damaged brain thinks he'll go down now|pg||
nt|henryb:  should be 7 imps for Brazil|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: west asking south abt his dbl|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: no entry to dummy to take the @C-finess|pg||
nt|pelu: I have seen: @SJ from hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: dont really think from north point of view it is better for south to be declarer  but to check up on controls had to go that route|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: That was interesting -- an unusual duck by declarer, and South "knew" declarer couldn't have ace of clubs -- so he continued, and that gave declarer the desired dummy entry.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember @DA already gone so can't establish @H suit|pg||
nt|timmy5: now -2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|antoniz: raz pika,kiera i AS trefli trefl|pg||
nt|pelu: but after 2x@H that more difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: only lead to defeat it - on a di lead E might have played the spade jack to make an entry for the club finesse to make 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: 8@H    may come into play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|timmy5: he should have been punished for this bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|odysseus69: potential gain for NZ|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jbgood: no...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess since East has singleton @S  it could go @HA ruff @C ruff, @HK|pg||

pc|h4|nt|garden2005: ja ju¿ pisa³em jak|pg||

nt|szalay: if it doesnt drop (her majesty)|pg||
nt|szalay: @C 3-3 can help|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@s is not makeable even dbl dummy now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is superior here of course as you might not to have to guess spades|pg||
nt|szalay: (of course, if trumps 3-3)|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to win @h king and run @S j|pg||
