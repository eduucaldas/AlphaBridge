nt|pbmarstr: ecatsbridge.com|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Off we go |pg||
nt|gracelin: Li and Liu in EW are Precision players with 13+ - 16 1NT opening.  1D opening is 3+ in 1/2 seat, and 2+ in 3/4 seat.|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the dutch east bid @D on his own to the 4 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: they put back their cards...waiting like usual for Wijsmuller probably :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: difficult to predict the outcome of a @c, @d or @s contract here|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: N has an opening presumably|pg||
nt|chmitty: 5@c defeated by the @h ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5D is likely to make.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S would seem to be ok|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|chmitty: 4@s probably cold despite the @d ruff or am I missing something ?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S!|nt|gracelin: unless NS find two club ruff via SA and CK as sntereis|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: 5 @C is on. The spade loser disappear if heart ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: entries|pg||
nt|chmitty: oh yes of course|pg||
nt|roswolf: i and more importantly my wife thinks opening the north hand is routine|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 1@S = take out without a major|pg||
mb|d|nt|pbmarstr: 4 @S can be defeated by underleading clubs for a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S MAY GO OFF ON A LOW CLUB LEAD|pg||
nt|gracelin: so the double by Liu probably showed spades|pg||
mb|2C|nt|josj: that's what Sweden did...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: well those he has got|pg||
nt|roswolf: east hiding in the undergrowth - slowly slowly catchee monkey|pg||
nt|josj: but E was declarer there...@D lead and low club back|pg||
nt|gracelin: eve north leads HK against 4S, he still has time to get two ruffs in time|pg||
mb|d!|nt|gracelin: even|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a very murky sequence - tarzan club all is forgiven:)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Interesting double, obviously not penalty|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|roswolf: north (and my wife)might regret opening the hand now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pbmarstr: I dont think North regret that. I think he has a very fine opening by the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Now EW is on the way to their 5D|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it looks like it|pg||
nt|gracelin: but in similar auction in closed room, West passed 4D|pg||
nt|chmitty: at 5@d, what about a trump lead ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: Hx in @D + AN ACE - riches beyond the dreams of avarice on this auction|pg||
nt|chmitty: East has to play @s immediately and South ducks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbmarstr: Doesnt work with a trump lead as long as Ace is doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, the trump lead may cause trouble, but will south find it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west makes it academic|pg||
nt|roswolf: an imp at stake|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am more surprised that south did not raise to 5C with such huge fit.  Maybe his double of 3D already showed his hand.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: Sorry trump lead defeats 5 @D. NS has communication in clubs|pg||

nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|ady: lost of wast paper in  south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gerbrand will enter the names asap|pg||
nt|ady: tricky for south    good opening bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@D showed a bal 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry that we missed this board, it was due to technical problems|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm almost certain no other table will be as shy as this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
nt|ady: with spades breaking well there will be no problem|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi will have to cover, giving declarer the heart discard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: to powa¿ny przeciwnik, który siê powa¿nie liczy w walce o awans do ósemki |pg||
nt|ady: not even necessary to do that       east unable to ruff any diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually they do not have a misunderstanding, wooldridge just giving all the info he can|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1 on the baad diamond split|pg||
nt|ady: will Bocchi try 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: even before madala asked anything about 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: A messy start to the match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good safe 5@H|pg||

nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||

nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||

nt|lechcold: 5@D mo¿e byæ bez jednej, ale trzeba trafiæ... zabiæ asem kier, odatutowaæ i wpuciæ|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gulyas: S knew his @SKQ was worthless, and he had no ace, so maybe his hand is not worth much|pg||

nt|fabsayc: heart ruffed|pg||
mc|11|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has to block the diamonds so he can take another spade finesse, so he will make only 11 tricks.|pg||

nt|ady: USA playing 3NT with n/s cards  OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pretty awful board for Italy, whatever was the cause of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to relog because open room was down|pg||
nt|pelu: I am back, and I see that Marrtel won 7@H on dummy reversal - the X of 3@D by W force him to that winning plan|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: No percentage in North entering the bidding.|pg||

nt|lechcold: Multi mocno wykrzywione...no ale podobno pasuj¹c nic siê nie wygra:)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like a pass out|pg||
nt|xenya: in a sense, both pairs should be satisfied with that result |pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: 1@S denies spades. With 4 or 5 spades he would double.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@C here equally most likely down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: trying to see how he could make the slam :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = contructiv 10-13|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C is surprising, most partnerships use lebensohl 2nt response to double with a hand of less than 8 points|pg||

nt|rensph:  seems we're back and good to go. :) Hello everyone.|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 down|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby could have bid 2@C stayman -- probably didn't want that doubled.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or big hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: but often the opponents will not believe they are given a gift|pg||
nt|psyck:  Live video stream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|psyck:  (you can mute the audio to hear voice commentary here)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few would bid 1@H, vul against not, on those South cards. |pg||
nt|ady: will try club switch|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ta¿ S nie ma negatu...raczej nie graj¹ transferem|pg||
nt|lechcold: wiêc Brenner nie móg³ od razu skakaæ na koñcówkê|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N looks reasonable enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|idc: Welcome all - BBO has decided that specs getting it too easy with just voice commentary, so you have to suffer written commentary too :)|pg||
nt|ady: lose control here|pg||
nt|hedyg:  for the livestream from the site: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|jaapfr: down 2 i suppose|pg||
nt|ady: only 7 obvious tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobra czêciówka|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: I'm surprised Stansby selling out to 3@C with a void.  Seems right to compete with 3@D.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true a natural bid.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: if 3@c constructive stansby must wonder why he's doubled with his 19 hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think it's for minors -- just a reasonably strong balanced hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H bound to fail as the cards lie, but what else could NS do?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: dubion cannot know east hand   of 7-4  or would surely correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West said 6-5 probably|pg||
nt|juror1: mo¿na obejrzeæ naszych w otwartym http://wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised he didn't bid Stayman with that hand|pg||
nt|hlortz: guess they dont play lebensohl :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: their file is big, no doubt somewhere this auction covered, but i dont have time to search|pg||
nt|pelu: cc: 2M -D - P: lebensohl - against weak 2M - but what if 2@H is constructiv?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
nt|hlortz: @h shift ought to get south off ay type of endplay|pg||
nt|hlortz: /any|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
nt|kit: It took a different lead to defeat this -- but E-W should be in 3@H|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H best|pg||
nt|hlortz: or perhaps a @D ruff for north?|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H and back would further damage N's plan to ruff @S.|pg||
nt|xenya: a kibitzer points out that 4@S might make -- possible in some variations, but certainly not on a heart lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it|pg||
nt|ady: not best  as J@D will set up the 9    and low diamond will in affent mean north ruffing a loser  and then trumps 2-2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hlortz: nah thats setting up a @D i told him wrong lol|pg||
nt|hlortz: whatever, it looks like they were not on same page 3@c prob not dbled & -1  this is going for 500 i think|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 2Nt here ask for better minor, so N is forced to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: i see. thx|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: -800 looming now|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Cards are not favourably placed for the contract.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: well he could have floated spade 9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg:  this is going to fall apart any moment now|pg||

nt|jaapfr: EW will have more problems to digest this board than the Dutch lunch they just got Gerbrand:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I Don't know what they had for lunch..|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he can make  3 more tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a bright start for Netherlands   as far as this table is concerned  they would think they did well to stop out of a slam hand 1|pg||
nt|hedyg:  @c ruffed high and claim -3|pg||
nt|famus: Hello everyone, David Henry|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs: why nor take the chance and bid 2Nt - hope for 3@C and if 3@D from S then normal 4 card suit (even 5)|pg||
nt|xenya: just continue diamonds, E pitching spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: or maybe i was wrong and a club was needed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-USA 2 seniorzyù|pg||
nt|pelu: what a start - 17 IMP in board 1|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it's funny, the Dutch have orange system cards...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@D is american multi, i am not allowed to say the real name|pg||
nt|hlortz: if this keeps up many IMPs will be scored since -500 figures to be a big swing also  not 17 tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
nt|barnets: works quite well|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Joe|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry, hard to see the claims|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect 3@D is some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play 3NT e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting hand and would require caution to stay at reasonable level.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
nt|ady: can the get a penalty in 1 heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||
nt|kit: I don't know the N-S structure here -- I imagine the follow-up will show a strong 5-5|pg||
nt|roswolf: because of the vul west didnt play for pens|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: at wbf.org|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX is also interesting|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: yes 5-4-3-1 convention after 1 NT|pg||
nt|ady: diamond game down|pg||
nt|roswolf: best game probably 3nt |pg||

nt|psyck:  who bid 3@c operator?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: only one makeable|pg||
nt|xenya: normal contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
nt|kit: Likely headed for 3NT -- the fate of that is not clear.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: could be 6 imps if both 2@h and 2s make|pg||
nt|roswolf: settles for the minor game - understandable enough|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This doesnt look like it can make|pg||
nt|ady: I think would need to drop bare A@D to have a chance in 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  no chance|pg||

nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes this is a team of [relatively] young stars|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best|pg||
nt|famus: @ds wud b the best lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: trump leads are best and so it was|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|famus: gr8--Grue heard us--prblm for declarer |pg||
nt|ady: bad club split will beat this|pg||

nt|hlortz: thats my guess -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not possible to see what they write down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like the defense should be able to establish enough black-suit winners before declarer can set up the diamonds, but they will have to be careful.|pg||
nt|ady: needs to keep to 2 trump losers  so a reasonable game   but not making|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play is likely to take some time|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately  evening knowing of diamond position still cannot make|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks are available here -- but that's neither here nor there|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can"t be bid though makes.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
nt|kit: Nice choice to get to 5@D -- that will probably come home, although not clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree.  5 H's, 1@S, 1@C and 4 @D's (ruff one club in dummy, draw trump)|pg||
nt|kit: In principle declarer would have 3 diamond winneers in North, 1 ruff in South, 5 hearts, and two black aces, but club leads by defense could cause problems.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
nt|xenya: club now planning to ruff a club and discard a @D on the @H K|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
nt|famus: bad everthing split i think-even trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: Well, that call undid the good work of finding the diamond fit.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
nt|kit: Since declarer needs to ruff 1 club in dummy, it looks like his only hope is KQ doubleton of diamonds.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: gives a heart and discards all the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: finess the spade   and get J@C right|pg||

nt|ady: should duck this|pg||
nt|famus: Lall gotta underlead his @s for Grue to play another @D|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: but 3nt big chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: again this is a chance for China.  EW  can probably make 3NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: lead @h and let declarer find his 9th trick by himself|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|gracelin: if defenders don't play club, declarer can establish one trick their by himself.|pg||
nt|gracelin: there|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chmitty: true, declarer can guess where is the @c10|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: if he starts with all his @D he kills his own dummy in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: in fact on a H lead, 6-round of D will make defenders discard revealing|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but dummy:)?|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H, 1S and 1C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 1@C very dangerous imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: but ok we play 3@D now |pg||
nt|gracelin: West's redouble mover the t/o double showed H.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: they use trsf response after 1D get doubled|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: safe lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: and effective to stop a club ruff, if declarer doean't guess C10|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Not always able to give every detail, not sitting directly at the table. Sometimes i can get it from the camera shot...not this time :)|pg||

nt|gracelin: West has been conservative twice in this match, passing in a D partial while game has good chance to make.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

nt|gracelin: maybe he figured the D return is also futile, he has no entry to play a 3rd round.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chmitty: may be to establish a @h before declarer can establish a @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: in case declarer is 2263|pg||
nt|chmitty: but that seems a very remote possibility|pg||
nt|gracelin: the C10 pla strongly asks for a spade.  Hw shud do so with Ax i spades, and not Qx.|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: He has not Ax in spades. Would have taken the ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a spade return will declarer an overtrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where i think the defenders should accept fate and conserve some mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: by playing faster|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now S is thinking as I did: why my pd played @H:)|pg||
nt|chmitty: these 2 never play fast :)|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: The next board is a small slam. Let us see if they have conserved mental energy|pg||
nt|gracelin: the early spde ruff may lose south's HK, north want to get their H before the Spade ruff.|pg||
nt|roswolf: they do at the end of the session to avoid fines|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pls brink surrender: there is no clear clue|pg||
nt|gracelin: but counting declarer's HCP, south shud know declarer must have SA to jump to 3D|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 4333 quite obviously not interested in stayman of any sort|pg||
mb|d|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H has a chance, 4@S is down on the heart ruff |pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
nt|hlortz: well being from US i am rooting for them but its a tough road|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a normal 4@H hand -- should present no problems in bidding or play|pg||

nt|kamyk: kiery ujawnione - mo¿na unikn¹æ rafy 3BA|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||

nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||

nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20  north declined to balance|pg||

nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Bob|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||

nt|rhelle: 1@d = 2+ in third seat Vul, because they up the 1NT range to 14-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: wd|pg||
nt|psyck:  well played|pg||

nt|rhelle:  that would be useful refinement|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|chmitty: but who would do that with West's hand ? let's see|pg||
mb|5D|nt|gracelin: when North didn't open, the slam is more difficult to reach|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5@H now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: or 6H|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: I think he cannot stretch to more than 5 @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East could sacrifice 6S a the end, if he has to.|pg||
nt|roswolf: now on this habd there IS something to think about:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: true:)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jaapfr vg: brave brave brave|pg||
nt|gracelin: if South wants to make 5D/5H Vs a passed hand  in terested to defend 4S, then his fitting cards in the red suit entitle him to bid slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but losing at least 2 imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  I'm pretty sure|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C is 3+ clubs and 11-21 points.|pg||
nt|athene: 14-16 notrump, fairly standard amongst strong clubbers these days|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Just an overtrick.|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||

nt|psyck:  other room did not find the play of going up with @cA trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: really -1 operator?|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: no way, must be 10 tricks|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: he finessed a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: -1 or +1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: down one|pg||
nt|ady: with 9 cold tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok -1|pg||
nt|rhelle: on Board 1 both pairs miss their 4@s or 5@d game and play in a partscore - clearly a tough board|pg||
nt|xenya: some action here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|boedhy:  well done then anyway :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NL is taking a bid lead|pg||
nt|hlortz: italians always seem to be there at the end|pg||
nt|bobh1: it seems declarer took an odd view in @Cs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: south should force this to slam i think|pg||
nt|athene: AJ10xx is a lot better than just 5 hcp|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1@S Narkiewicz?|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie s¹dzê|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W apologized|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D best|pg||
nt|roswolf: misere view|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I present West won't be silenced easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not vul should balance|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S alerted his 2@s bid - guess it show exactly 3@s and 8-10hcp|pg||
nt|ady: though 6@C also ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D usually unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: *predict*|pg||
nt|xenya: EW NV, so W will feel free to bid as many spades as he wishes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|boedhy:  bidding 3nt is really strange....|pg||
nt|gracelin: Madala-Bocchi use trsf response to 1C opening|pg||
nt|famus: I'm gettin msgs from involved kibtz--they got their money onn these boys winning--that b a gr8 morale booster for youngsters the world over|pg||
nt|kit: This is a bold bid at adverse vulnerability, but it is effective as it drives E-W too high|pg||
nt|lechcold: niestety w  2 Grzegorz przegra³ 3NT, które ju¿ móg³ zrealizowaæ:(|pg||
nt|psyck:  np Filipe, you got the important play right, was immaterial at end :)|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|hlortz: will west try science or a simple 5@d?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: What a hand |pg||
nt|ady: hearts best spot for n/s|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@H down because of @S ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may sac in @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 4N -- 2 suits|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good bid, 4NT.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interesting 4@s bid from East. There is a school of thought (I adhere to it) that suggests to always raise your partner's preempt with 3-card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes @D the old joke what do u call an 8 card suit? trump!|pg||
nt|warrens:  an aggressive 5@C works.  Kit, you must love this :)|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for Stansby, but he would have done a lot better doubling and collecting 500|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take spade and spade ruff   but nothing else|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes they may phantom|pg||
nt|roswolf: THE VUL MAY TEMPT THEM|pg||
nt|ady: 3 losers in diamonds  so can sacrifice at the 6 level|pg||
nt|oosmanb: into writing in all caps? :)|pg||
nt|xenya: even with a doubleton honour i would say...|pg||
nt|xenya: well, occasionally perhaps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H both make on @H finesse, may be difficult to bid.|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes. In this case, without the 4@s bid, South would have 2 rounds of bidding more, and could show his @s void|pg||
nt|rhelle: in the meantime North is regretting opening on an 11-count 4333 :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: a hand that Vul I'd never open|pg||
nt|xenya: he will be happy he did eventually|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting as well what 4NT actually means in this situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some will bid as W|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can save for around  eight or eleven hundred|pg||
nt|famus: how much is 6@s costing|pg||
nt|xenya: N has a choice of bids -- 5@C/@D/@H|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
nt|psyck:  2@c is 10-15, with some poetic license 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: silence|pg||
nt|roswolf: no caps lock on the blink:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's just hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|rhelle: although South is not allowed to draw this inference, he knows that North has a long think over 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawa rozgrywka|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie trafi³ po prostu po³o¿enia króla pik|pg||
nt|antoniz: 4pik by³o za 300|pg||
nt|psyck:  whatever it was, it worked|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will sac on insurance principles?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: how bad is 6@H without looking at ew cards i.e @S distribution|pg||
nt|bobh1: W will lead a @S but E will not know why|pg||
nt|ady: even without a spade lead   only can make 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: East probably doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: is it because he has a singleton or because of the rdbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
nt|psyck:  W did not want to bid his poor @s suit i presume|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not surprised if the director was called at the end of this board|pg||
nt|xenya: normal treatment|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: So another 10 IMP's for Italy|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But given 3@S was a singleton, really shouldnt venture 6|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||
nt|antoniz: 5karo mo¿na wygraæ,ale 4pik zawsze -1|pg||
nt|jkotor: znaczy jak w koñcu S otworzy kiera, co jest raczej oczywiste|pg||
nt|ady: now 13 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: good sac|pg||
nt|bobh1: he will work it out because of the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: and this makes -- somewhat fortituously|pg||
nt|rhelle: Now, how should East signal? He 'knows' the @sAce will be ruffed|pg||
nt|xenya: you normally don't bid a slam missing an ace and the trump King|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||
nt|kit: Still likely 1 loser in each suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually it has value|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêd¹ punkty w 19, nasi nie poszli w obronê pikami|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  and 109xx of @d helps bogtime with that lead|pg||
nt|idc: Hard ask for East to lead a trump from a singleton at trick one, but a @c lead would have given declarer more problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cAQ throw a @s on @cJ|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift now|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sweet choice for Poles|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes i think i would do so too at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: excellent save|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Need both king and 10 of spades onside|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S easy making, so looks like a +board for Sweden|pg||
nt|psyck:  also may have been worried of 3@s being passed if pd was weaker|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: long haul to 4th spade    meantime club switch best|pg||
nt|ady: then still 3 losers|pg||

mb|2D|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some won't with 4 cards in the other major, some won't with a void, some will with one of those flaws but not both.|pg||

nt|kit: tempting to bid game with 3 aces, even though only 12 points and 4-3-3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
nt|hlortz: fredin will NOT go down this time :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt : 4@Hs + 5 toptrricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: i predict...|pg||
nt|rhelle: so West's game try is aggressive|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes so no @C lead for declarer|pg||
nt|gulyas: @DQ lead looks normal, then game is cold|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@S forcing 1n 2nd neg like 0-5 i think|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll pass non-vul|pg||
nt|pelu: no bet from me :)|pg||
nt|ady: 100 to poland   rather than a dodgy 130 bidding on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S lead and off.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lechcold: akurat w przypadku otwarcie 1@D nazwa "Precision" nie jest zbyt trafna:)|pg||
nt|idc: after a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|ady: yes     that is true|pg||
nt|gulyas: here she comes|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has plenty of problems in 3@H here.  Play at trick 1 itself is far from clear.|pg||
nt|kit: Due to the entry situation he will probably play hearts leading them twice from dummy, which is not a success on this layout.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  5! is cold|pg||
nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no disrespect, but predictions involving fredin are precarious|pg||
nt|pelu: DD 6@C can make, but "impossible" to bid - and against all odds|pg||
nt|pelu: u are right, Martin, but when he see 9 "sure" tricks in 3NT - |pg||
nt|fabsayc: we see 9, he does not|pg||
nt|pelu: he hasa to be carefull in start - if @Ss 5-2|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure he "see" 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
nt|kit: He will use this entry to make a spade play I'm pretty sure.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if north has 5 spades there is no 100% line, but on hand just playing hearts will work|pg||
pc|s7|nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Fredin says "ill be very surprised if i get down on this one"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 pades, 3 hearts and @CA for the defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
nt|ady: good lead     may be able to force and entry to west hand in diamonds for a heart finesse |pg||
nt|psyck:  I don't think S had a further bid on 2N|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
nt|pawel90: niestety treflowy tu obk³ada³|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
nt|famus: gets an additional entry|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides have used trump leads on defense well|pg||
nt|athene:  hi :)|pg||
nt|athene:  sry private :)|pg||
nt|ady: in fact 9@S entry   so should make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: 3C is also making here, so either 9 or 10 tricks will result in a tied board|pg||
nt|idc: Now declarer can claim, overtrick if @sK right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: try this if you want to see live play, not very exciting http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|hlortz: this looks 2 off but i may wrong by a trick|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lechcold: 1@D to 11-15 punktów bez starszej pi¹tki i uk³adów pasuj¹cych do otwarcia 2@C|pg||
nt|kamyk: no i to w³anie jest precyzyjne opisanie charakteru rêki:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we agree on most pairs will bid this and most will make it?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malpaluche: @d j'aurais compris|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say north had K10xx in diaimonds and hearts were 4-2|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s na przeciwnej, ³adnie naszych wyblokowali|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||
nt|kit: will just have easy squeeze -- will not need to finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the t/o X was left in for 300 OR|pg||
pc|d6|nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: he would be down|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lechcold: w niektórych wersjach mo¿e byæ nawet renons karo|pg||
nt|barnets: on a spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: 1 imp for USA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: guess he will cross ruff to 10 tricks for the same imp as 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|twcho: best if EW plays non-leaping Michael here|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to decide if he plays for the @HA to be onside, or the @Ds to be good, but this is better, of course|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he got the hearts right considering the entry problems.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: club back too late|pg||
nt|xenya: if N goes up @CA on the second club that is|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gracelin: he is happy with 9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dK|nt|gracelin: now he might reject the H finesse for a safe 9 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck:  so the swings continue & the score reamins tight|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: When declarer runs the trumps West will have to keep the @SA and so unguard the diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would allow declarer to pick up the suit when West held x-x-x (and had to throw one) and East started with Q-x. |pg||
nt|santyclz: China took a 5 imp lead when on bd 2 w chose to lead the @dk, s ruffed the 3rd round high and finessed into the stiff @cq.|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|brolucius: The diamond position is known as a show-up squeeze, because East's @DQ-x may become 'shown up' after West has been forced to discard a diamond. When West follows low on the 2nd ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: round, his card is known to be his last in the suit.|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: sure they reach 6@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: 2@C  GF relay|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzns: 2D  less than 15|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|jaapfr vg: 6@H and 6@S are doomed|pg||
nt|gracelin: up to now south only showed his minimum 5H/4D.  It's time to show his 3rd suit club.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: 6@H 6NT:)|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: ok 6@C makes and 6@D6@H6@S6NT are doomed:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: 4@D shows  0544|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm they will do well to choose the right trump suit methinks|pg||
nt|pbmarstr: May be they have come a little high now showing distriution, so they might have problems with full control in bidding|pg||

mb|6C|nt|roswolf: hmm choosing the right trump suit is difficult methinks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: although the bidding may not be finished|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: it is now|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||

nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably South did not want to show off, by making such an erudite play.|pg||
nt|ady: to Italy    sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E: "@ss are always 5-0"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 1 out of 100 will find he deadly @C lead imo|pg||
nt|gulyas: after the @DQ lead, he would play for the likely @DJ onside|pg||
nt|ady: long diamond can be set up before club is established for defence|pg||
nt|famus: that was odd|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the lay  but cant see how only  6 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: its 2@S just made, so 8|pg||
nt|ady: did not see the play|pg||
nt|famus: did he go for @cs?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes -200 seems odd|pg||
nt|xenya: on 5, the Dutch NS alwso got to slam, 6@D, losing 2 imps  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 boards so far and close match.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|idc: The other table is slow so we won't be getting comparisons for a while, Brazil will feel that slam is a potential gain|pg||
nt|antoniz: ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|antoniz: 460|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  and then finding out he makes the contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 13 back looks like a match of big swings|pg||
nt|xenya: another slam for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|boedhy:  think this last one will loose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2h is supposedly 10-12, multi for weaker hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@h = 6@hs 10-12 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another interesting board. 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I can see the cards, too:) - but he may play for the @HA onside on, say, a trump lead|pg||
nt|pawel90: nam idzie 4@s - im 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: movie says plus 110 last hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: connection dropped out so maybe some data was wrong but the movie says 110|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Vincent --so it get made-good|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kit: Weinstein evaluates his hand too strong for 1NT opening due to good 5-card club suit and 2 aces.|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H call shows 5 spades, 4 hearts, invite values if I remember|pg||
nt|brolucius: The US South did enter on the @CK-Q-J-x-x-x hand and they then pushed E/W to 5@S for a 13-IMP swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lost connection, up to speed now|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H with the right guess of S, but they lack the points to go that high|pg||
nt|lechcold: to nie bêdzie prze³omowe rozdanie chyba..|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like another mildly swingy board|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   can make 5@D     |pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  against 5@s doubled|pg||
nt|pelu: can make - but not bid 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you were right Martin :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this has stolen the board|pg||
nt|gulyas: SD, not DD|pg||
nt|ady: likely heart game    12 tricks maybe without diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some would bid 2@S in W - but Es sk still stop in 3@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: or 6 possibly|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rhelle:  Normall NS play 1NT as a good 12-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but 3rd and 4th hand, vulnerable, they play 14-15|pg||
nt|rhelle:  to avoid unwelcome penalty doubles|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have the cc on my second computer|pg||
nt|kit: N-S in other room did well to stop in 2@S making|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he should raise, if only to block minor rebids|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay of diamond pips   |pg||
nt|bobh1: not on best defense|pg||
nt|xenya: but finding a 4-4 minor-suit fit is always a problem|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|boedhy:  with all the good tens and the @h king onsite he will make 9 tricks...|pg||
nt|jkotor: na 5@c co trzeba trafiæ|pg||
nt|famus: did*|pg||
nt|kit: Nice 2NT call by Martel -- that is a fine contract|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like to open the field for opp to bid - so 2@S from W from me every time (and pd know that its a weak support)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Many thanks to our excellent VG operator for the bidding explanations. Roland told us that the operators have been practising for a while and they have certainly been very good.|pg||
nt|kit: Routine 4@S contract, will easily make 10 or 11 tricks, and almost sure to be same at other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: so you are cheating|pg||
nt|psyck:  this could make a couple of o/t's or u/t's|pg||
nt|ady: 6 as A@H   and a trump trick to lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is not the worst contract ever but doomed here|pg||
nt|ady: has|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, not inconceivable that NS will end up in 6@h - which is unfortunate due to the @h break|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jaapfr: @D lead again:)|pg||
nt|ady: diamond bid by Sementa stopped any chance of 12 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@H NF |pg||
nt|gulyas: sry for those who do not know the terms yet: SD: single dummy (like a declarer at the table)|pg||
nt|pawel90: po pikowym trzeba dojæ od razu impasem kier do stolu|pg||
nt|kit: 3@D will make also|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 5@d looks like limit to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|3H|an|max 1534|nt|twcho: so a partial pick up by USA1|pg||
nt|gulyas: DD: double dummy, seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|famus: good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes 110 for east west is the correct score|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks if defence cash 3 clubs   otherwise 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Well 5@h also played in the other room..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just following the guidelines for commentators :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that great :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it is not always easy to see what the players are writing to eachother on their small pieces of pater|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: paper |pg||
nt|xenya: are they on a relay route -- seems like it |pg||
nt|xenya: that might help|pg||
nt|rhelle: from (sometimes bitter) eperience, these relay sequences can be tricky - especially with distributions that occur infrequently|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry for disconnection...|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing missed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no, tx|pg||
nt|rhelle: although the explanation isn't quite what South has got, it did locate the @c fit|pg||
nt|xenya: so N knows S's shape -- should be 6 clubs now?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: Hi Patrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ecatsbridge.com has cc for all participants|pg||
nt|ady: not much in this hand    maybe an imp|pg||
nt|idc: 2NT was a game-forcing hand with some @d support, 3@h we can only guess at|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s will pose no difficulty for Weinstein|pg||
nt|hlortz: difficult hands with big swings at stake - fun for the kibs, onot so much for the players|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will they stop?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lechcold: 4@S = minimum-minimorum, 5@C = 1 as z 5|pg||
nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks to our Operator, Paul, now we know 3@h showed a singleton|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: once your partners opens, you find the fit, you're unlikely to stop under slam with the N hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznt: ok we are up after some difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: now it should be ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx to my new glasses :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: commentators have to be careful not to get carried away with DD analysis: players can only see 2 hands, not 4|pg||
nt|xenya: N setting trumps, S cuebids @Ds..., |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: now South will bid 5@c, I guess. It's hard to be too enthousiastic with no aces|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I am still getting kibitzers querying that it was right to enter with 3@C over 2@C on that South hand. Everyone knows that they should interfere over a strong 1@C, but it is just ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: as effective over 2@C, when the opponents are almost certain to have a game and will want to show their long suit rather than double you.|pg||
nt|ady: well cashed|pg||
nt|psyck:  he may have placed E with a balanced hand on the lead|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|6C|nt|vugraphznt: Running scores as asked :|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm |pg||
nt|idc: Martel-Stansby play attitude leads v NT, hence the @s6 (lower the card the more leader likes his suit)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sssssss|pg||
nt|ady: meant in game|pg||
nt|roswolf: sensible|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: well bid!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there is a losing line right now|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Is s leading from jxxx or axxx?|pg||
nt|kit: Bocchi has easy jack of hearts shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Neither is high on the list of preferable opening leads.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb these 2 teams can be the ultimate finalists of the BB:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@S indicated duplication|pg||
nt|ady: 13 imps to Italy on the 3NT that should have been10 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: S's hand is limited to 15/16 perhaps, so N can't conceivably bid grand here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have to go - playing myself in 45 mins. Bye everyone, enjoy the bridge!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: may get a @H lead which would be natural looking for ruff. If @Hs are 5/3.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: So the curious raise to 3@s led to a reasonable but doomed contract.|pg||
nt|hlortz: call me chicken no aces no kings no singletons 3 trump only - i'd be more scared of partner than opps |pg||
nt|hlortz: ;0|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: it's all down the guessing S9 for either 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but with no cover would be anti-percentage|pg||
nt|xenya: if S had @DA instead of KQ, 7@C wouldn't be all that stupid -- depends on 3-2 @C and 4-2 @H -- but i'm not sure it's with the odds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|gracelin: SJ|pg||
nt|antoniz: zagra³ perfekcyjnie|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kareno: The play I would make in spades would be the ten.  Then you can pick up any Qx or Qxx in south (opener's) hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: Why not?|pg||
nt|athene: lauria thinking about south's distribution|pg||
nt|athene: he has only five clubs|pg||

nt|brolucius: E/W stopped in 2@H making, for China, on the board where we saw South make a pre-emptive raise to 3@C. 5 IMPs.|pg||
nt|athene: of course if he has a singleton spade you are down too :) but if he has doubleton, what are the odds it is Qx?|pg||

nt|fluffy: whata nightmare to play something at trick 2 from hand|pg||
nt|ady: not that great Bob   K@H missing as well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||
nt|barnets: a good pickup here for USA|pg||
nt|idc: Perhaps West could have tried 4@d instead, East cues 4@h, and they might stop in 5@c|pg||

nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||
nt|yke:  some players might just open 1NT. But maybe they play 13-15 NT since they play precision?|pg||
nt|famus: 4S not alerted looks like rkc?|pg||
nt|pelu: but 2@S making, so even down 2 could be a flat board|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||

nt|gracelin: bad lucks for China that HK is not on side.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is 71-0 after 11|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so that unbid heart suit was the only making slam|pg||

nt|bobh1: S's last bid was close but I can see why he raised|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||

pc|cA|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  on board 6 I was right lot of peaple in 5@s even 4@s doubled...|pg||
nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||

mb|1D|nt|athene: some would overcall 1nt here, but pass looks fine with that shape|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and indeed Prooyen Verhees also bid it and even made a uptrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: The KR evaluator program seems to take a bizarre valuation of jacks. Roland quoted an example where Q-J doubleton was allocated only 0.75 points, compared with x-x. Seems much too ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little for me.|pg||
nt|athene: wait till they bid hearts, then double for takeout :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1D shows H, as before|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I doubt Campos, Villas-Boa have ever gotten a slow play warning, much less a penalty!|pg||
nt|hlortz: usa2 started this match in 4th i think|pg||
nt|famus: :) i think they shud ALLOW it--bet- wud improve over all standard:)|pg||
nt|ady: thx for information kibs|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough  |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Their system got the bidding too elevated before south could describe his hand.|pg||
nt|antoniz: Walet kier by³ zlokalizowany,wiêc tylko 300|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup quiet hands now|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle:  1@d = 0-8|pg||
nt|athene: that's the classic recipe for that south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they started 10 minutes later|pg||
nt|famus: at present tying with Netherlands in 2nd spot|pg||
nt|oosmanb: thats a scary 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the dealer burned itself out with the grand slam|pg||
nt|ady: will this be 2@H X|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|roswolf: the poles have no fear|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very light 1@D, 3rd seat.|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|boedhy:  Apteker was very happy to be in it and played very save..|pg||
nt|rhelle:  1@h = 19+|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = 6-8, balanced|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can they get 6@s in south....|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so any 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|boedhy:  which is very good|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the Vul for weak NT.  North is in the range but decisde not to open on 5-4 distribution.|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h and 3@C sh make - but thats max|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north did not open weak NT or rebid NT, south knows north has an unbalanced hand and should have 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: China in 2@H in OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D = kiery|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N|pg||
nt|twcho: The south player, Edgtton, is only 19 years old and is probably the youngest player in this event.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  2@h = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@c = 4333 with a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but the system will let it play in North probably and |pg||

mb|2S|nt|athene: now versace runs to hearts and north doubles |pg||
nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||
nt|gracelin: and as usual, Bocchi judged correct;y to stop in 3C|pg||
nt|barnets: looks ok to me|pg||
nt|idc: E-W task here to stop in time, since 4@s is as high as you'd want to get|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Brasilian player as a rule tend to be very fast.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sad pics on the news, the south island of NZ is under flood waters|pg||
nt|ady: need to attack spades to beat this|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On this hand, East may have upgraded his hand to 18 points, with two tens that accompany other honours, and two 4-card suits.|pg||
nt|pelu: difficult lead for East|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, but with Bocchi beind the wheel, I thk he can hold his loss to at most 4 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: looks though they are heading for game|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: fast play --> fast dinner|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4 b 40 minutes then:)|pg||

nt|jkotor: ale z Kysiem to Jac gra³, ¿e to 4@d i 5+stary|pg||
nt|kit: Same 3@C call as made at other table.  I don't understand it.  It seem like game very unlikely opposite mere 2@C rebid.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle:  3@d = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s = 3-3-4-3|pg||
nt|rhelle:  as South promises at least 1 control (a king), the North hand is now looking pretty good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||
nt|kit: which would be needed for 4@S to significantly gain over 3NT.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point.|pg||
nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
nt|psyck:  KC is key card & kickback is bidding the suit above agreed suit as roman keycard blackwood...just don't ask me any more :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  this looks like a normal puppet stayman sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
nt|psyck:  not so normal rather|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@d likely denying 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|psyck:  & 3@s puppet back to 3N maybe|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D is a close call 5 to 7 tricks for S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: with @D 3-1 this cant make on any defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: i would never open as S 3rd in hand, no matter what|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
nt|famus: -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|jkotor: tu jest odwrotnie, wiêc co kto pomyli³ (3@h wygl¹da na "mam 33+ stare do 5+ partnera")|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: both 3NT  23 hcp|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very favourable placement of cards.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: but still some work to do|pg||
nt|twcho: running score can be found at http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||

nt|twcho: :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: not easy. 8 tricks there and work for the 9th.|pg||
nt|xenya: and, if i were told to open at gunpoint, it would be 1@H (prompted by a kibitzer)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you take @S or @C finesse?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  now...... sign of or low @d lead...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ai ... North may pass 4@s now|pg||
nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suspect declarer will play to ruff fourth spade if necessary|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
nt|kit: Not much can happen here -- 5 unavoidable losers.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo @S better.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||

pc|d3|nt|brolucius: 5@C doubled, I mean.|pg||
nt|ady: this a good save   4@H  makes   even on a low spade lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|psyck:  OK, 3@d just denied 5 card major for them & 3@s showed 4 card @h|pg||
nt|psyck:  this variation helps hide openers hand shape|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and the small @d lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  there are a zillion puppet variations out there...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|idc: It might have worked better to let that run I think, double dummy now to make it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kareno: Note the diamond ten, calling for a club (and why did north not play the spade queen on that first spade trick to show possession of the jack?)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand could have been made too|pg||
nt|idc: the @c8 run i mean|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: anyway, a game swing back to bulgaria when duboin made a costly lead of @CA from AQJ against the 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: sorry will make now|pg||
nt|ady: needed low spade from west|pg||

nt|barnets: same situation exactly in open|pg||
nt|barnets: @HK to ace|pg||
nt|barnets: the n@SQ|pg||
nt|barnets: from dec|pg||
nt|ady: north knows that east is aware of the diamond position and cannot afford to cash the queen  so would exit with a heart even with K@S|pg||
nt|barnets: brings home contract|pg||
nt|barnets: made by grue in open|pg||
nt|lechcold: pamiêtaj o tym Karolu|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: yes   that would be winning line|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes low @s from west was only way to beat now, as East has J@S and can get in with K@C|pg||
pc|c6|nt|idc: but this isn't an easy contract|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|boedhy:  thirst imps to south africa|pg||
nt|ady: but if the king was with east that would fail|pg||
nt|barnets: so in open dec decided west had @SK so corectly led the @SQ in case he had !KJXX|pg||
nt|barnets: @SKJxx|pg||
nt|xenya: now he will run diamonds i think. eventually squeezing S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now the squeeze.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|nt|twcho: and there is a live video stream at http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and @S ace and exit.|pg||
nt|xenya: he can even play hearts now|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|brolucius: His partner had opened 1@H and he could not believe that he would hold five spades.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S ace and small better and finally scoring AQ@C.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: so "only" 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: likely a push though |pg||
nt|xenya: BRB|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|psyck:  now cashing a @d & @s exit works|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Still, a heart switch looked OK, because East could then switch back to spades.|pg||
nt|gracelin: for the same effect.  9 tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: must get it right now|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe not|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  6@ss fails on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system say 5 card major ask GF'|pg||
nt|kit: Good shift by Martel.  He can see that declarer, known to have a minor, needs to ruff clubs in dummy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he didn't seem to think it was that hard :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play a (mostly) game-forcing 2/1|pg||
nt|idc: and no doubt the sequence to 3@h will be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: South has bid this as a minimum opener with little slam interest, so North may give up now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H?!|pg||
nt|pelu: I can see 6@S is on, but I dont exp NS to bid more that 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and what if the answer showed @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: w'll hurry|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: W has a tough lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to avoid leading a @D to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg:  might lead @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: that could work|pg||
nt|pelu: Kibs dont agree with me - they go for 6@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north has a huge hand actually they will bid slam|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel is pushing w/ north hand opposite 2n jump and @S support|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
nt|idc: Had South tried a courtesy cue bid of 4@d (as he might) then I think they would have gone on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After 2 boards with good chances for USA, one with a chance for Brasil.|pg||
nt|gulyas: anything but a @D really:)|pg||

nt|antoniz: ocena do kitu|pg||
pc|h5|nt|boedhy:  2@c minors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oh, that lead will make EW trump short|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  especially as the West hand is dummy, so the defence is much easier that way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D lead very unlikely imo|pg||
nt|garden2005: proby te¿ nie dos³yszeli|pg||

pc|hT|nt|rensph:  quiet 1NT for EW here, diamonds break 4-4 so will end up with 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south thinks to overtake and shift if north leads from doubleton K10, south has no entry to eastablish his spade anyway.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||

nt|ady: what is best lone in 7    ruff 4 clubs in south hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: with such good trumps perhaps north should have accepted the invitation to the party|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, east decide that slam is quite far-stretching and simply end the auction by bidding 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  luckly easy 3nt..|pg||
nt|barnets: the key to bidding many slams is who has control of the high trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: north knows his partner has invited a grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "bucket bid" is another popular method.|pg||

mb|5H!|nt|famus: may be--cant say till it ends|pg||

nt|ady: not enough entries to ruff 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how important the 4@C bid was set the slam ball rolling. If you could only bid 4@C with a club control, it would be a tricky time for North.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The advantage of doing the tap-in commentary is that you have a split second to check whether your comment is completely stupid before you press enter.|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but then when you do say something stupid you look so bad :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Against that, some duff comment is preserved for posterity on the VuGraph web-sites. If you say something clueless, no-one records it and you can hope that the spectators thought ...|pg||

nt|famus: he knows 11@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: but could be UNsafety play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ruffing 3 diamonds in runs risk of 10@H making for defence   I think small slam is enough|pg||

nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
nt|idc: We heard a comment at the table earlier that 'spades are always 5-0', so I guess this 4-1 counts as a favourable break|pg||

mb|p!|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: light opening from west|pg||
nt|hlortz: his was more tactical than technical imo he decided if he lost a @C right away def would be harder|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you are correct.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but many would just bid 3nt rather than use stayman|pg||

nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||

nt|jkotor: lepsza karta to tylko 55 z tymi samymi honorami|pg||
nt|xenya: he might double now, with the idea of converting 2@H to 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: low scoring match and China leading so far.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
nt|kit: Martel knows declarer doesn't have A10x of hearts or first trick wouldn't have been ducked, so continuing hearts is safe.|pg||
nt|kit: And he had to lead low, since Stansby might have started with ace-doubleton.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not if you're this NS|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: no top losers here  but 6@S may prove difficult with 4-1 split   |pg||
nt|ritong: he briefly considered a @s J switch|pg||
nt|kit: no need for that, since if Stansby has king of spades the jack of spades shift can come later.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Gawry nie mo¿e wymyliæ A@s u partnera, a bez tej karty szlemik zawsze bêdzie s³aby|pg||

nt|antoniz: to mo¿e wtedy od razu 2karo?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jaapfr: oeffff|pg||
nt|ritong: thus he sticked on @hs|pg||
nt|antoniz: wtedy AK karo i K trefl,te¿ niele|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @s are nice and friendly. will probably lose 1@C and 2@D|pg||

pc|d2|nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this strange looking play is quite good|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for running scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving spade king for a late discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
nt|famus: ya-4-@s stops it and a top @C ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
nt|kamyk: W ma wprawdzie minimum, ale dobre honory - mo¿e móg³ jeszcze zanêciæ przez 4@S?|pg||

nt|jkotor: AK@d i K@c to potrzeba dzia³ki atutów i ¿eby pik sta³ jak kara gorzej ni¿ 33|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: that lead made it easier|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 10, instead 4@S Netherlands played 2@S and earned very important 9 imps.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
nt|xenya: no longer, Rashed -- The Netherlands gained 9 imps on 10 when they stopped in 2@S and made 10|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oosmanb: but not straightfoward|pg||
nt|oosmanb: could perhaps insure contract by giving an open @S since he's missing entries to hand|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat ironically|pg||
pc|dT|nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba jednak 55|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: nice invention/convention:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: that's possibly the first time in my life I've predicted Duboin's line of play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|pelu: thats a mistake by S - sh take @DA and play 3x@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1 imp if he makes 4|pg||
nt|ady: playing safe for 10    still 11|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: Now will strip out hearts and clubs, and then try to duck a spade to West|pg||
nt|antoniz: zagrali poprawne 5tr|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|brolucius: By eliminating the side suits, he can survive when East holds @SQ-x.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Sementa decided his hand was worth game in @H, covered the black losers, nice @H fit and Kx in @d look pretty good|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: instead of taking 2 D tricks, Madala takes none by this defense.  He is not headed for -2|pg||
nt|idc: USA avoided the slam on failing finesse on Bd 8, so their lead up to 21 IMPs|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|kit: Levin will go up ace of spades, hoping partner has KQ -- only chance|pg||

nt|athene: i bet he bids just two|pg||

nt|psyck:  since 4@c often has other meanings, many would open 5@c here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rhelle:  2@c = 11-15, 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||

nt|hlortz: that will beat it --i think|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not stopping under 4@S now I think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|boedhy:  south will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck:  they did have 4@c available after all|pg||
nt|psyck:  cc says " Wide ranging preempt"|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would expect W to pass|pg||
nt|psyck:  with @s's & @d's breaking, 4@s could make here|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks far too easy to predict 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 1's to Aus with a flat inbetween each|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   have around 9 tricks in clubs|pg||

nt|kit: This is as flat a 4@H hand as you will find, it sppears.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and denies 4@S since o neg dbl perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I once made a weak jump on 7 to AK in diamonds, quite proud of it until my '@h'Q turned out to be a missorted diamond|pg||
nt|idc: a weak jump on AKQxxxxx was consider over-sound by my peers|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  q10xxx in the midnight swiss...|pg||
nt|hlortz: /no/|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fluffy: aat least with the club opening he will guess clubs|pg||

nt|gracelin: guess Lian will move on|pg||
nt|pelu: but Lian still looking for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: he had taken a bid but took it back|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 6@d = 500|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this doesnt look right|pg||
nt|ady: cant get there now|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
nt|ady: south will have to find 3 discards on the clubs|pg||
nt|ady: best to take the 1st heart   but a difficult play|pg||
nt|famus: can see only 8 tricks|pg||

nt|ritong: passing 3NT is a surprise, yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||

nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||

nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will probably shift to club, although anything but king of hearts works fine now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: It is in fact Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: many play 1x - 1y - 1NT now 2@D = GF, 2!x realy to 2@d and direct major weak|pg||
nt|roswolf: if it is now working!!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
nt|ritong: despite the superfavorable @s layout|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 11, China played at 6@S making 7 and lost 11 imps.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kamyk: jak nie idzie, to nie idzie - nawet tu stracimy impa|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hlortz: yes with both k and j diamonds with south i dont see how to make it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
nt|idc: I still admire the auction (by both sides) up till 6@d, then perhaps South did a little too much|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer will go up with the ace|pg||
nt|twcho: but he has to choose from finessing in @c or establishing the 4th @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make if he does not touch trumps early|pg||
nt|xenya: even with @H 5-0 it's an easy make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: down 3, and 14 badly needed IMPs for USA1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer losing a trump and 2 aces|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|idc: but perhaps we should put it down to good E-W sac causing tough problem|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As was suspected, Brasil got to 6@h on  board 10.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South found out 3@C is making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that 4@s is not making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ady: south cannot afford to discard a spade as 5 clubs and a sspade can be cashed  and south then end played with a heart|pg||
nt|roswolf: it isnt i am told!!:(|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N was a good alternative of course|pg||
nt|rnmalik: timely K @D. S needs to ruff a @D on table for the 10th trick.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
nt|ritong: hi ck hi all|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: nice smooth duck by south in the 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nigel is a classy young player with a great future'|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|psyck:  Salut Henri|pg||
pc|c4|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@c was indeed a fine anticipation|pg||
nt|ritong: and the best way to push opps to guessing|pg||
nt|ritong: other choices, like 4@h hoping to play there or pass, hoping that lho will make an error are way less clever, imho|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: The bidding is not as we see it, obviously. Our VG operator is valiantly trying to recover from the crash (which is not fault of his). |pg||
pc|h6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: H to dummy, run CQ, covered, ruff|pg||

nt|famus: wd China|pg||
nt|pelu: so S has to discard a @h, but then again @D to K, @H-ruff and S can be endplayed on @s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey my half hearted prediction came true|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
nt|famus: had he taken the first @H --had a possibilty in !endplaying S|pg||
nt|ady: was a difficult hand to make  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: he would have done better to lead low spade on third round|pg||
mb|2H!|an|weak|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
nt|famus: shud read him for 7@hs with that Vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: back to the double figure swings|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a z kim nam tu sz³o?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
nt|pelu: me me thats absolut minimum for a Michaels 2@c -|pg||
nt|hlortz: true. it was a difficult hand to play. i expected trump leads w/qj09|pg||
nt|ritong: here lall/grue had a shooting auction, "helped" by a 2@h opening in east|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
nt|pelu: but @H 10 9 make the hand better|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: let s see what happens with a quieter start|pg||
nt|psyck:  3@h fit jump|pg||
nt|ritong: hurd certainly would prefer chunkier suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H on heart queen being right|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
nt|ritong: his action has the merit to place his hand immediately|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, should be better @h suit normally...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will not participate further if unsollicited|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play in game|pg||
nt|oosmanb: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: Meanwhile: New Zealand doing well against USA1 (23-7VP), Sweden-USA2 almost even, Singapore vs Australia -- same  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a playable level.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: just a X to help opponents :) - he has shown @h+@s why D - extra values?? NO|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
nt|antoniz: ³adna odzywka Piotra|pg||
nt|ritong: so we land in the 8 cards fit, relatively low level |pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry, 4@C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|ritong: looks healthy|pg||
nt|psyck:  this should also go down for a more or less push board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|ady: this looks tough to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they did well to stop there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
nt|roswolf: my link does work if you get NO SEVICE press F5 on your computer:)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
nt|ritong: yes trumps are cruel|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
nt|xenya: not an easy hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i think he will just claim|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: a bit late with time|pg||
nt|oosmanb: yes keep refreshing the website, it'll work |pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|lechcold: po kierowym ataku konieczny by³by impas i damy i ósemki pik|pg||

nt|ady: looks 1 down|pg||
nt|ady: clubs being 4-1|pg||
nt|xenya: but now EW can score a @D ruff|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||

pc|c4|nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|bobh1: otherwise he might fear duplication|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||

nt|kamyk: pechowe rozdanie - N mia³ prawo liczyc na dubla karo u partnera|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: this might be a fast board|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kareno: Diamond needed|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate sing. club is the 10|pg||
nt|bobh1: both slams depend on the @H Q and 32 @Hs|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Poland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: perhaps they were influenced by the need to do something|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|xenya: was not clear though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
nt|bobh1: to get back in the match|pg||
nt|ady: well 13 imps wasted|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding 6@C didnt seem to be in the picture for a long time during the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
nt|antoniz: dlatego wist karo jest niedobry,moim zdaniem|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||

nt|oosmanb: haha for those watching Open room webcast|pg||
nt|roswolf: this slam is of rolanf proportions!:)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Versace was toying with his final pass card over 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: redouble is a better bid than a mere 2@h bid in OR|pg||
nt|psyck:  I would have expected a 1N opening by N here|pg||
nt|ritong: holding south hand, you know that this rates to be painful|pg||
nt|ritong: a strong NT, you mean?|pg||
nt|ritong: ow|pg||
nt|ritong: very painful, even|pg||
nt|psyck:  1N=(13)14-16 for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: not sure about the meaning of double|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I could not see explanation, sorry|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H plays well here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: ok back to earth now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: signalling he really doesnt want to pass|pg||
nt|ady: but a slam here may be flat|pg||

nt|pelu: u cant tell them that!!!|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: @H-lead against 4@S, then @D to K, @S to A @hQ to K and ruff, @CA and @C .. to K @hJ disc @C-loser, and so on = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: heee  24-44 China (lucky or deserved:)?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||
nt|idc: Looking at the E-W heart intermediates on last hand, you might just hope for 2-2 trump split rather than a partial cross-ruff|pg||
nt|famus: he needs to ruff a @D for a push board i think|pg||
nt|ady: absolutely|pg||
nt|xenya: despite the grand slam swing we still have the lowest score as compared to the other matches|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good stop and 8 tricks are, may make 9.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: "there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||
nt|kit: operator -- this is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Normal 4@H contract -- should make along crossruff lines, taking at least 6 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: i know, kidding|pg||
nt|psyck:  I'm told 15-17 3rd, no mention of it in cc though|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think stefanov would miss an occasion to open 1NT if system allows it|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, same contract same lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|twcho: wow, they bid it|pg||
nt|kit: Most natural play is to lead diamond to king at trick 2, and another diamond.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|boedhy:  well stopped|pg||
nt|kareno: Clubs behave but not much else.  Good lead - actually Bridge World has an article this month about the benefits of major suit leads against notrumps - and their general success.|pg||
nt|athene: versace wondering whether to start clubs with small towards the ten i suppose|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great|pg||
nt|twcho: no matter what the double means, it must show some useful value. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they will realize after finished|pg||
nt|ritong: a top @s, that is|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6N?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6NT|pg||
nt|ady: not straight foward though  if spades 4-2|pg||
nt|ady: even in hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: then @C finesse?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@H 3@S 2@C 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6NT either on spades 3-3   or club finesse |pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: This is the last board of the session. I would like to thank Dirk, our splendid VG operator. Excellent session and many thanks!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: drive out @D ace before tackling @S |pg||
pc|h5|nt|boedhy:  4nt quantitative|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, unless you're in 6NT and you get the wrong lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  could be 12 tricks played from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the spectators all know how to make six, declarer does not|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: another down 1 EW joke|pg||
nt|hedyg:  very lucky lie of cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Sementa: this the match for 3@H and 3@S|pg||

nt|oosmanb: cant East atleast bid 4NT |pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: great bid by Edgtton|pg||
nt|kit: this really feels wrong to me.|pg||
nt|psyck:  @sQ from KQ or QJx|pg||
nt|ritong: varying from K to Q according to agreements|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think they may have just given back the slam swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can lose also @D switch.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rensph:  3@C puppet stayman here, little to the play in 4@S> Declarer will draw trumps and then requires the @HK to be onside|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kiwibridge: 1 @C ruff and the 1DA onside|pg||

nt|ady: and clubs splitting|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Chance was there to make 8 tricks but did not accept.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rensph:  he might be able to play for a throw-in|pg||
nt|kamyk: w sierpniu 80 Rosiewicz piewa³: "Bulgarija,Bulgarija, u Polijaka awarija"|pg||
nt|brolucius: One down will be fine, against a making 2@H. Madala was unlucky to find only two trumps in the dummy. His bid was fine.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction a variation on mexican 2@D, west showed 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|xenya: of course the legitimate plan was to rely on 3-3 @S -- the line adopted by declarer works if the defence err twice -- not sure how good that is  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: another chance.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: Also, many thanks to Kit and Joe, my fellow commentators. We were awarded a fair bunch of boards - neither excellent, nor hopelessly boring - somewhere in between.|pg||

nt|twcho: and good effort by Gosney too|pg||
nt|hlortz: and @c 3-3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rensph:  should the throw-in fail (If S holds the 3rd spade) he can still finesse the hearts himself|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  yes, someday you will have to tell me about it|pg||
nt|twcho: this will be a serious blow for USA1|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: He will still survive, but it seems so much more natural to set up at least 1 diamond trick first.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: the balancing double is absolutely normal by west|pg||
nt|twcho: but north had bid it much better than his counterpart in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there is so otfen when it is wrong too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: denied 3@S I think|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lechcold: bez 2...a dobrego dnia mog³o byæ swoje|pg||
nt|bobh1: but what strength?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: up to 17, bad 18 probably|pg||
nt|oosmanb: <18|pg||
nt|bobh1: then how can E pass?|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: that is in 1 hour|pg||
nt|rhelle:  this is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes do you know there agreements|pg||
nt|rhelle:  they play dstructive preempts this vul(doesn't everybody?)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  what is the range|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but the temptation to bid 6@c must be strong|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt overcall perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: would be interesting to see how lauria-versace handle such interference|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has preferred a double to 1@H (the modern choice) and may escape a penalty.|pg||
nt|ady: great result for USA here in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course they opened 1@D at the other table.|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Gerbarand you were great as always|pg||
nt|hedyg:  our thanks to our outstanding operator in Eindhoven, Gerbrand Hop, well done! to my excellent fellow commentators David , Daniel , Gonzalo and Jaap as well as CK, William and Ralf on voice for donating their time to guide us through these boards|pg||
nt|jkotor: ¿e tylko jedna para z tej reprezentacji gra³a ostatnio wszystko razem i gra w lidze razem|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  getting to 6@d now is too hard, I think|pg||
nt|rensph:  Even if spades break 4-1 taking the ace and returning a spade works equally well|pg||
nt|antoniz: bardzo trudny po otwarcie przeciwnika|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about the time they finish in open room :)|pg||
nt|psyck:  That is extremely fast for 1N|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|kareno: So many thanks to Bob Drijver our excellent Operator.  To the specs for their wit and wisdom.  To Bill Frisby for his contributions and, of course, to WBF for allowing us to watch ...|pg||
nt|kareno: their marvelous production of the world championships.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Opened room started 10 minutes later than this room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are bidding 15 there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: because the match is on VuGraph|pg||
nt|ady: slam to finish|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty all, it was an exciting match here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: bocchi pointing out 3H makes|pg||
nt|idc: Last board at this table (the Open room have 4 more though) so time for thanks:|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rhelle:  4@d may be an artificial slam try in @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will bid 5@c now expecting @h points|pg||
nt|athene: traditionally, this double shows a desire to penalize opps, but my guess is EW just use it to show some values|pg||
nt|barnets: I prefer the unfortunate 1@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: last board for this round|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a memorable victory for Australia|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
nt|psyck:  David Bird would be pleased with that speed though|pg||
nt|ritong: talking about this slam:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: defence helped too:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||

nt|psyck:  yes N will get to slam opp a positive response|pg||

nt|psyck:  1@c is 17+, so 8-9HCP 5332 for the 3N maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: anyway stefanov will drive on|pg||

nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
nt|hlortz: thx David, Hasan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Felipe and to my co-commentators Peter and Henry|pg||
nt|ritong: sober|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
nt|psyck:  whichever strain he chooses will work as cards lay|pg||
nt|psyck:  6@c the normal choice to protect @dK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: If @D lead to ace, then on @CJ at Trick 2, S must rise ace OR underlead @SA when @D is ruffed|pg||
nt|lechcold: Brazylijczycy zagrali dobrze|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli nawet, to nic nie t³umaczy gry katastrofalnej, a tak¹ w nadmiarze tu ogl¹dam od 4 dni|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: jutro o 10.30 przekaz z meczu seniorow Polska-USA 2|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: a o 16.45 - mecz open Polska-Izrael, rowniez z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this result wont help Sweden, who are borderline for qualifying to KO stage|pg||
nt|hlortz: thanks msrtin peter and our great kibs & operator.. it was a 2 board match for usa team...|pg||
nt|ritong: pard can hold @s KQJxx and an ace, perhaps|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
nt|hlortz: /martin/|pg||
nt|ady: not many top losers in hears with J9 doubleton   but spade force may deadent the club suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Vladimir and Harold and all the specs, absorbing bridge.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: been called worse|pg||
nt|psyck:  well, if 3N limited hand, he is not looking fro grand|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
nt|famus: Thnks Henery--and i go along with the n key:)|pg||
nt|ady: clubs in fact blocked if the play 3NT    4 spades safer|pg||
nt|hlortz: :)|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know it Italy in slam on hand 31?|pg||

nt|ady: apparently ye    tht so|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Rashed, Harold -- and everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wlc|pg||
pc|hA|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Lauria did bid 4NT as East|pg||
pc|h7|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Versace has bid 6@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±' ±'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i try to smile but fail............±)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ty everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CJ to king at Trick 2, then on @DK N will play @D9 as suit pref for @SA underlead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D plsssssss|pg||
nt|ady: may know shape   but needs KJ hearts as well as QD|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is also worried about clubs because he has @cQx and partner could have 2 low|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kontrze w 3tr,chyba lepsze 4tr|pg||

nt|hlortz: lol my typing gets worse at 3:40 am|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they are|pg||
pc|h8|nt|idc: I should also thank the players - been a lot of good bridge to watch|pg||
nt|ady: has he shown the vital Q@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes but his hcp are so beautiful|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
nt|ady: thx Henry Hasan|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|fluffy: his hcp are maximum yes jaap, but partner could have anything|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|hlortz: bye|pg||
nt|famus: byee|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
