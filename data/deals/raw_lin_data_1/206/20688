nt|ahalim: 2NT seems lebensohl|pg||
nt|vbman: when n opens slam is guaranteed|pg||
nt|viren169: tough to reach 7... but 6 should be a walk in the park for these guys|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: first board already an exciting board, minimal opening of N, but nice layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: simple J2N|pg||
nt|frankaus: Egtton in early 20's, Gosney just 30+/-|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Welcome to Veldhovn|pg||
nt|henryb:  India is third in the Senior Bowl, USA 1 is tied for 7th|pg||
nt|otoj: hi all|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I really like the dble...|pg||
nt|viren169: ruff 4 clubs in North's hand...|pg||
nt|frankaus: the whole AUS open team under 50 quite unusual|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the 5th trump that make South's hand a great hand...|pg||
nt|vbman: exactly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed young Australian players|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E is taking time to evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: jak to czêsto ostatnimi czasy bywa, seniorzy s¹ nasz¹ ostoj¹...|pg||
mb|5C|an|cue for !d|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to go make sure my team is in place. be back shortly|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
mb|r|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
nt|vbman: 5th trump also means the queen|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: dizeñ dobry - witam spragnionych dobrej gry i zwyciêstwa dru¿yny polskiej...|pg||

nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||

pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer can now make 5 in several ways: on a club return, a double squeeze with hearts in the middle or a straight forward red suit squeeze against S|pg||

pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|viren169: I agree...|pg||

mb|1N|nt|otoj: otherwise decl had time to establish club for down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: I think they started with spade, than twice harts|pg||
nt|vbman: l cant see a way they stop at 3cl|pg||
nt|viren169: a heavy 2@H|pg||
nt|vbman: unless campos tries something clever|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: not an easy board for N-S to avoid getting too high|pg||
nt|frankaus: N had only 10HCP but 27 zars  - only need 26 to open |pg||
mb|2S|an|transfer to !c|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||

nt|otoj: a discipline pass by N.. |pg||
nt|don_kapu: hello mr arifin|pg||
nt|otoj: hi Don..|pg||
nt|viren169: and more pressure from West|pg||
nt|viren169: dble again and pass the 4@C response?|pg||
nt|vbman: or pass out|pg||
nt|frankaus: link to zar points - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zar_Points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a good preemptive raise from W, S has 19pt and normally does not want to pass|pg||
nt|viren169: South may try (unsuccessfully) 3N|pg||
mb|2N|an|maximum|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
nt|vbman: think the raise will help him|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||

nt|viren169: Dble is best...|pg||

nt|josj: hi Liliek, Arifin and Joto :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: a really interesting bidding sequence, with good judgement from N to get out of 3@s x|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
nt|ahalim: eh ono Liliek|pg||
nt|vbman: l disagree with campos' raise|pg||
nt|szeryf: tu Ryszard Kie³czewski - muszê obs³ugiwaæ dwa pokoje st¹d drugi nick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|westjava: Oom Jos apa kabar..?:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||
nt|henryb:  The US1 team had an easy time against Reunion in the same round|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5 for 11 and 1 for 10|pg||

nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 2@c is precision|pg||
nt|lokaty: niestety trefle siê s³abo dziel¹ i przyjdzie polec|pg||
nt|otoj: what will be the lead by W?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 3!v from lasut as a sm and goes to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
nt|ritong: so they deserve some suffering|pg||
nt|ritong: so do their opponents next room, by the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: very quickly bid by the Australian|pg||
nt|henryb:  This can make against a spade lead if declarer guesses well in @d|pg||
mb|4C|an| |nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
nt|henryb:  North has a tough rebid over 3@h. 3@h is forcing - although it does not promise 5|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n might be right|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: good lead from west here.|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h looks to be down 1: 6 trumps and three aces. But maybe he can set up the long spade while he still has control|pg||
nt|henryb:  @hJ, @s ruff, @cA, @dA -- no. not quite|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: indeed theres a lack of communication for it i guess without loosing trump control|pg||
nt|henryb:  without the trump lead its easy.|pg||
nt|vbman: lead cl win 1 imp|pg||

nt|jaapfr: if taking @DA as 3rd|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did now for the obligatory tank|pg||
nt|ritong: can t cancel 40 years of routine so easily, can you?|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@C in fact|pg||

mb|5H|nt|henryb:  roy is trying to see a way home|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer's best line now is to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|westjava: 4th best without honour|pg||
nt|viren169: Match will be all square after this one...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D jeszcze wychodzi³o na wpustce|pg||

nt|henryb:  Americans balance more freely than most others|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but there a @S discard was needed to make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@h was not absolutely necessary|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
nt|henryb:  but Hamilton made it because West mistakenly pitched a spade|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||

nt|viren169: Some specs want to see some fireworks!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 1@d and 1@h was bid at the same time by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: bidding card sticked, luckily it was seen before the tray was moved to the other side|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: Sweden went out vs the later winners China|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is on the @h guess|pg||
nt|henryb:  what do N-S play over 1N? We will find out!|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: 3@s for EW|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@d double pass 3@s would show that kind of hand|pg||
nt|blewah: 2NT?|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but - 1 if they bider|pg||
nt|garden2005: no i zupe³nie inny nastrój ni¿ wczoraj|pg||
nt|garden2005: s¹ zyski i cienie na nastêpne zyski|pg||
nt|henryb:  double is negative|pg||
nt|viren169: Could be here...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: making 6 seems a lot |pg||
nt|santyclz2:  One of the advantages of Polish @c is that @d shows @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (1@d)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if S hits it can N sit?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that sud be just =|pg||
nt|3for3: very playable, and as the card lie, makeable 6@H|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: but it consumes lots of space when @hs can be the strain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
nt|henryb:  on repeated trump leads, 2@h is probably down|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S anyone?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25: @D to queen picks up Jx in either hand for 3 tricks, whereas @d to ten does not pick up 3 tricks if loses to king with 4-2 @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H shows 6 or more spades|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 2@H is a just a general force... (or an xfer to @S?)|pg||
mb|3C|an|4+ !s fit|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe hard to reach slam now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H much better from north|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 2@d|pg||
nt|petergill: A transfer: X of 1@H would have been 4 or 5 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: No 2@H shows 6+ @S 100% for sure|pg||
nt|viren169: with it being a xfer... they should go more slowly to investigate the slam|pg||
nt|viren169: ok thks|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North will probably move|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the south hand doesn't look like it's a slam on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: North can be very weak with 6 @S, so South has shown a really good hand|pg||
nt|vbman: 6 looser hand opposite another 5-6 looser, may try|pg||
nt|viren169: North will make another move with 2 bullets |pg||
mb|4D|an|gf, cue|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||
nt|3for3: since the clubs are with east|pg||
nt|blewah: as they don't play puppet stayman |pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i dont think they will sniff at slam|pg||
nt|viren169: dont like the 4@S bid...|pg||
nt|viren169: wd... now 6@S should be reached...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
nt|vbman: 2h maybe at least inv'l|pg||
nt|viren169: ...5@D-5@H-6@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil Edgtton correctly upgraded his 17 count as too strong for 15-17 1NT. That @D suit is worth more like 9 points than 7 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: as south I would write down I would push on to slam and bid 5@d|pg||
nt|viren169: ... I MUST....|pg||
mb|4S|nt|blewah: if i read their CC correctly|pg||
nt|lechcold: gdyby Laska spasowa³ na tê kontrê...:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe S should pass with his whole hand in @Ss|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then a slam chanceless|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³aby masakra|pg||
nt|lokaty: ko³o 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|viren169: lol... why waste time!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would rebid 2@D instead of 1nt - avoids this inelegant contract|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@S, the best play is to draw trumps and try to get the 12th trick from @D, not to try to ruff a club|pg||
nt|viren169: South felt he has to catch up...|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 round of trumps (finding they break) and ruff a @C?!?!|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  4@d looks like a splinter.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  3@c like a mini-splinter but there are several other options possible.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
nt|petergill: The reason Gos chose 5@C instead of 4NT is that it gave Nabil a way to stop in 5@S, if Nabil's 4@S bid had been a puint instead of the real thing |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer finds out about both black aces before playing trumps, he has a chance to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  but likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|3for3: once again...wrong :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s have to know they are behind in match, so maybe pressing |pg||
nt|ritong: good luck west|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong:  |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|viren169: otherwise go back to @Ds|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|alpagavp: For the moment France is 9th and China is 16th|pg||
nt|3for3: that doesnt really pay on the WBF scale.  You win or lose VP's regardless of the score of the match, until you are behind a very large amount|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E has a very unappatizing hand from which to lead and trys a little trickery.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|grebrof: a more agressive E would have bid the @s-suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Paul Gosney likes bidding 4NT 1430 as much as the rest of us, but there is a time (like here) to pass the captaincy of the decision to partner|pg||
nt|szeryf: only lead to make problems for declearer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|viren169: yes... I am sure he would have cue 5@H over 5@D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|3for3: and -41 is not large enough....they would still get 6 vp's for that result.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am reminded,  n/s may not think they are behind,  this table has been pretty good |pg||
nt|3for3: well done...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: given explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy lead from E hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: with screen up so both oppenents are clear|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 500|pg||
nt|kerasidis: should he unblock K@s before playing club?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: good point..from NS things are ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, I was not looking at leading a club|pg||
nt|3for3: auken has a tough guess, but she cant go wrong...MY kind of guess|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|viren169: Aussies have the lead!|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: They are talking about it, he didn't want to make a mistake if it could go down|pg||
nt|petergill: Nabil knew not to look for grand slam, as North would have bid 4NT if searching for grand slam|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  But he can ruff just enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 3@c was not a mini splinter, expl at table, 4 card support in @ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N said: I did not know that when the cards from S where on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx for asking karen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yw|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||

nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
nt|blewah: no game, but N may get anxious with his hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@c from S, and then...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: you right aria|pg||

nt|jaapfr: or 3nt even|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but different if x |pg||
mb|3C|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H-3nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w in the other room had clear sailing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Arnim writing a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as most operators will tell you,  they write in tiny little writing |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes they do :)|pg||
nt|3for3: better than tiny big writing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: two entire little pages now|pg||
nt|viren169: Will E/W bid game here? And which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  no; 3@c something and 3@d = what?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 4@s?|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes|pg||
nt|henryb:  I was wrong. They made 2@s|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A mini-splinter is typically something like 8-10 hcp, 4 card trump support and a singleton or void in the bid suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: director in... 35 minutes left|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty vincent|pg||

nt|petergill: Villas Boas with his weak trumps wisely retreats to 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit of a leap into the unknown!|pg||
nt|petergill: The Dbl of 4@H will guide S to @H7 lead, I think |pg||
nt|petergill: S thinking whether to Dbl 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south asks west if they play stayman with 5@h4@s or the other way around, west confirming|pg||

nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|no preference|mb|d|nt|bobh1: USA finally scored some imps on 11 but they're running out of real estate|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoa    |pg||
nt|sybarra: can she find a way to make it Danny?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont see 10 tricks  with the way the hand sits|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even 3@S can go -2|pg||
mb|p|an|asking which one|nt|vugraphzpd: I would be very tempted to bid on with east|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north will/should take insurance|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he didnt|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably right on reflection|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Not from his bridgepartner, very good atmosphere here|pg||
nt|henryb:  X says I want to bid 5@h, but not before you have a chance to defend|pg||
nt|viren169: more micheals cue bids here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Michaels, at least 5/5 in majors|pg||
nt|santyclz: I wonder what s's nt range is.  That looks like a weak nt to me.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ritong: en tout cas, les américains ne feront pas preuve du même optimisme que leurs homologues|pg||
nt|jaapfr: razorblade 4@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Good pass by S and now can bid 2@S over 2@C.|pg||
nt|3for3: sorry was off doing work :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but down i suppose with this @C lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C typing error|pg||
nt|viren169: Noth might have muddied the waters here a bit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Willard must be very carefull here. Nice first step|pg||
nt|alpagavp: The goal is to lose 1@s 1@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|nkgupt: sud be easy w/ a normal safety play |pg||
nt|nkgupt: the @h k might induce a @c underlead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: E is not understanding the 2NT answer of his partner|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks, I'm told their range is 14-16.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, its 14-16ù|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: cant say I agree very much with this sequence|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H=cue|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 14-16pt|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: it was already in an earlier game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N is asking in detail about the bidding and the bids not done by E-W|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks as if it would be much better off in @cs on the lead of a red suit.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT = 3 keycards so East looks for grand slam |pg||
nt|viren169: 4@S=cue|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S was RKCB|pg||
pc|s3|nt|3for3: down 1 here...and 5 more to germany.  quite a high scoring match!|pg||
nt|ritong: ça sauve les meubles, deja|pg||
nt|jaapfr: from his @HQ I meant|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: ok...|pg||
nt|petergill: 5NT said we have all the keycards - can you bid seven?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: if you can have 6 card minor in your 1nt - I rather bid it at the 3level|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|grebrof: NS obviously using Rusinov leads|pg||
nt|grebrof: leading something else might have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: finding the @s Q is not important anymore - contract should be safe as there are no ruffs anywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, we all would lead @hs, but even that lead might not beat this contract|pg||
nt|viren169: and 6@C said that I think we are high enough!|pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot see any endplay or squeeze - if there was one, Tony Nunn would almost certainly have found it|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe too high!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: south kept the tray at the SW side for a while|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  an imp rides on the lead|pg||
nt|ritong: pas mal le chien, hein philippe?|pg||
nt|ritong: on sent bien que le type de gauche est coinceman|pg||
nt|ritong: plus ça dure et p)lus on a envie de lui dire " abandonne"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is it sure W will play @C when in with @HK?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|grebrof: if P can bid some sort of Stayman - you normally can make 3@c/@ds OR it is a better contract than 1nt anyway|pg||
nt|santyclz: On a @s lead they would appear to have 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|petergill: Obvious and important lead has been made|pg||
nt|ianmcc: needs @h contin|pg||
nt|viren169: Non-heart lead... you have a chance!|pg||
nt|petergill: else S might be squeezed without the count, on say a manic (over-safe thus unsafe) trump lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: mais la question des atouts n est pas résolue|pg||
nt|viren169: switch will also give Declarer 12 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Needs to continue with @HQ |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|viren169: oh dear... now a chance for declarer to shine...|pg||
nt|petergill: 920 and 50 will be 14 imps to Brazil|pg||
nt|santyclz: NEXT!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: Sweden is resting their youngest players: Rimsted-Sjoberg while the youngest english pair is seated at the other table in this match|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good signal @S9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|nkgupt: wd there|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs to discard the heart|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|grebrof: so far youth have been better than experienced, but as a scandinavian, I hope Sweden will make some comeback in this :)|pg||

nt|blewah: not maximal defense maybe but down is down|pg||
nt|henryb:  a sensible 4@h that even the 4-1 heart break should not disturb|pg||
nt|westjava: nice defence...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD looks so simple but SD it was not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Schwartz explaining he 1st played @SA, because he only had 2 clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: You win the 2nd @H, play @CK, spade to ace, all the clubs then @DA to squeeze South|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: if south continues in hearts, he's also squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: W claims for 9 tricks|pg||

mb|r|nt|roswolf: that opening seems desperate|pg||
nt|ritong: les américains ne vont pas se gêner pour déclarer 4@h, ici|pg||
nt|jaapfr: satu mati tutup boleh|pg||
nt|alunand14: sementara ladies unggul 42 imp dari NZ :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb:  N-S apparently play "Negative free bids" so North has to start with double on any good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 4@s now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here we go. and I am sorry I cant tell the meaning of the bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: so nt range varies as to vulnerability we see |pg||
nt|jaapfr: mata|pg||
nt|petergill: So it was good technique by Miguel Villas Boas, rectifying the count for the squeeze by ducking Trick 1|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: yuck i hate this kind of auction|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, thx all|pg||

mb|3D|nt|jaapfr: last 2 boards go India go|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 15 HCP is a bit many for 3NT|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@d = 12-14?  Perhaps they mean 12-14 if balanced?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: little bit unsure what went wrong for Sweden at board 26, but they were unable to copy the slam bid at this table by England - to my suprice I must say|pg||
nt|grebrof: even surprise|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the most intresting so far woulb be W choise to pass the hole way|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@SX-2 5@H C|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@d acctually would make!|pg||
nt|henryb:  this should be 2 down, I think|pg||
nt|blewah: lol i was confused when u sai mati, Oom Jaap|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT = spades = normal in Brazil|pg||
nt|viren169: Wrong side the spades to lose 2 imps (or more!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: but playing with such a partner I would take it easy too|pg||
nt|henryb:  Morse should bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: the best contract is 6@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: down grade by lasut, 8 hcp full bal|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@SX-3 best both pairs can do here|pg||
nt|petergill: and 1@S response to 1@H = forcing 1NT, so 5332 hand can rebid 1NT = standard expert bidding in Brazil|pg||
nt|santyclz: No, their nt starts at 14 so that's probably not it...  I give up.  Suggestions?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: N waved his hands in such a way that 1@d is a weaker opening|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: fielders choice  declarer has only a few tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: good save|pg||
nt|blewah: *said|pg||
nt|jaapfr: therefor I corrected|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@s is artificial, looks for 4 trumps, min/max|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: everyone at the table laughing out loud|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|bobh1: i guess this is the last board of the match|pg||

nt|bobh1: oh 16? thx|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: wlc|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Again 11 for France. neve won 3NT|pg||

nt|jaapfr: an OPTIMAL score|pg||
pc|c2|nt|grebrof: nice layout in @hs for NS here  10 easy tricks should be made here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|grebrof: trumps 2-2 too, so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||

nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
nt|lokaty: dwa ostatnie rozdania nieciekawe|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if 5@H and expected @SA lead N has enough @S to falsecard and E might continue @D in tr 2|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|h5|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
