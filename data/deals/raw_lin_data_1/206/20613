nt|vugraphzpd: here is something wrong... |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: will sort out... going out..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sorry for inconvenience.. |pg||
nt|henryb:  good day all from Veldhovn|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: hello everybody, welcome to the last match of today|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ritong: bonjour|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4S|nt|3for3: 2 active pairs, who have played each other many times...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: its a very good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: some problems... try to solve...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i don t think kasle will lead @s A|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer really looks void in that suit|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: an aggressive E could balance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  greetings again|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: kasle is now aware about the five possible discards|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: but a bit shot into the dark|pg||
nt|ritong: but he might find surprising declarer did not try for @s A on|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|ritong: also, a @h cancels the fifth discard|pg||

mb|1C|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||
nt|3for3: east should be able to handle this...since south's trumps are so low|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks now after @H lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be quick i hope|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||

nt|jaapfr: bets on now : 10 or 11 tricks kibs:)?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||

nt|henryb:  hello|pg||
nt|ritong: france leads 2/0 for disastrous leads|pg||
nt|ritong: time to take a deep breath|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: most likely 4@S-1 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: almost impossible to reach DD par 6@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  Strong NT  - Stayman - 2@h or possibly transfer and 2@s as final contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i expect 3@S/P/P/3NT to be very common on this hand|pg||
nt|3for3: east could double but..|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm another 4@s this time for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. so many options.|pg||
nt|ritong: oommmmmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|henryb:  North may raise 2@h to 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
nt|ritong: so they deserve some suffering|pg||
nt|ritong: so do their opponents next room, by the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt is down with @C lead whilst no entry in E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if taking @DA as 3rd|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did now for the obligatory tank|pg||
nt|ritong: can t cancel 40 years of routine so easily, can you?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jaapfr: good 4@S but a pity down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ods 99-1 it is down 1 here:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||

nt|ritong: ommmm² needed now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: will not be easy to get to a @h game after that nt opening|pg||
mb|1H|nt|grebrof: the scores are not updated yet http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding many close games does put pressure on the defense which sometimes slips|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: now all the more diff ...even impossible|pg||
nt|roswolf: expect the same here it is a vul game |pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D looks more normal with the 8 bagger...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: probably shows both minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north considering a slam try!? hardly worth it|pg||
nt|roswolf: and again using up more mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||

nt|szalay: these cards better, but slam is harder|pg||
nt|ritong: ola ton|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
mb|2C|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H-3nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w in the other room had clear sailing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Arnim writing a lot|pg||
nt|sybarra: and as most operators will tell you,  they write in tiny little writing |pg||

nt|3for3: better than tiny big writing|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty vincent|pg||
nt|henryb:  and there is really no way for declarer to make this|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|nkgupt: i have seen many experts rebid 2@d on such hands and find it diff to catch up later|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 17 HCP 3 aces and 5/5 is enough to bid 3@d no?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||
nt|alpagavp: :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Cronier is looking at her @c and might think to play 6NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah 2@C = A MULTI|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3@H 2@S 1@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  someone misbid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with the splinter coming into play 6@H ensured. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sabine tells redouble would show 4sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: just think what "War and Peace" would look like on tiny little pages  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (suggested by a spec)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Levin asked if Sabine had nothing she is pretended to pass over 2d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i dont know what intentions had Sabine when saying 2 clubs seeing her hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: just claim 3nt+1:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|alpagavp: well done|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this board would be REALLY intresting playwise in pairs :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: 2@s shows the @c suit I am told - thank you|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think she was going to pass anything Arnim bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has a 5 count opposite 10-12,  so she knows opps have more points|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was in mucking it up |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, i guess she would, doesnt seem to be other option, would have played in a 3 3 fit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  my guess also |pg||
nt|sybarra: from her hand opps likely to have game anywhere |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: that opening seems desperate|pg||
nt|ritong: les américains ne vont pas se gêner pour déclarer 4@h, ici|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S apparently play "Negative free bids" so North has to start with double on any good hand|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|szalay: 4@s now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here we go. and I am sorry I cant tell the meaning of the bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: so nt range varies as to vulnerability we see |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yuck i hate this kind of auction|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: me neither...|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|grebrof: little bit unsure what went wrong for Sweden at board 26, but they were unable to copy the slam bid at this table by England - to my suprice I must say|pg||
nt|grebrof: even surprise|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the most intresting so far woulb be W choise to pass the hole way|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@d acctually would make!|pg||
nt|henryb:  this should be 2 down, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: fielders choice  declarer has only a few tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: good save|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: i guess this is the last board of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 1 after this board..|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh 16? thx|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzpd: wlc|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Again 11 for France. neve won 3NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here has been alot of relä-bids and finaly they will play the same contract as everybody els :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|grebrof: nice layout in @hs for NS here  10 easy tricks should be made here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|grebrof: trumps 2-2 too, so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|grebrof: and the obvious @h-switch comes|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer still has some guessing to do|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|c3|nt|henryb:  2 down is 9 imps; 3 down is 5 to the US|pg||
nt|ritong: enfin bon, la route est longue et tout le monde a un match creux, c est inévitable|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|alpagavp: on board 28|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|sybarra: couple of imps for the cushion |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: would be intrested to see how E/W do in @h. But there is a big risk it will end up in a bloodbatch when the trumphs starts to thin out|pg||

nt|3for3: last board of the day...tx for watching, and tx to VGoperator and Shorley|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 that is |pg||
nt|ritong: on pourrait sauver un peu sur celle ci, mais ça me semble très difficile|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Danny always a pleasure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Felipe,  great job   |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|3for3: big club|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thanks to all of the specs for your great comments,   lots of fun |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: y thx harold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks likely|pg||
nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: à partir de cette ouverture, ça ira|pg||
nt|ritong: bon choix philou|pg||
nt|ritong: en plus lassere est déclarant, ça le rassurera, à propos des @h|pg||
nt|ritong: lasserre*|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est necéssaire|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the results are here|pg||
nt|alpagavp: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: this looks like a good save for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobh1: EW have a @S game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth:)|pg||
