pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the minor suit 10s and the weak hearts suggest a pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|joanem: now they will have a bad time in the 43 breaking 42 |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: this can be a swing board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: IF you agree to play the convention with your partner -- make sure you know if 4minor bid is forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller has a good hand now with 2 aces, 4 trumps and a singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: though he would prefer to have more high card points in the red suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in the other room  elAhmady running trump interesting squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and LOTS of pressure on defenders to discard properly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump to 6@D very reasonable here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if there is any scientific way to investigate staying lower or getting higher|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: but with the hearts the way they are, even 5@d is a difficult contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S|pg||
mb|1S|an|allerted|nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: partscore board|pg||

mb|1N|an|alerted|nt|ryskiel_: 5 @s pewnie powie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: to mo¿e wgoniæ w szlemika i wtedy trzeba broniæ|pg||
nt|drorp: other table bidding started with north opening and then rebidding clubs, so this result might be duplicated, but i didn't see how the bidding ended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 4@S=slam interest @H  and 5@C=slam interest @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the double pprobably was 4 or more spades where 1S would deny 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 14-17 and aggressive jump by Ware|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-4 zz  could have game force strength    [zz  A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my notes stop here :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: South asked about 3@S, West: let me think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play the same 1@C structure as Bertheau-Nystrom  but  i don't have those 4th bids either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from one who KNOWS     3@S=it shows 3-4 zz, 5+H, 4S, void in C|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: is what west explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reliable source confirms my guess about 4@S/5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice stop!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump lead makes sense but probably @SK|pg||
mb|2S|an|alerted|nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs asking about 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if it's exactly 5@s an 4+ in a minor. South confirming this|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznz: 4h did not make at the other table....so another big chunk of imps for france|pg||
nt|josj: they were in 2nt...:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C=relay   4@S=3zz  4630|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many still play that 1S promises 5 and double is no more than 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so they're already doing better than the Canadian EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D was pushed  so only imps from 1st board of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and potential swing here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink opened south hand 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a number of pairs play "leaping Michaels" over 3-level preempts too|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: probably not being able to show a 2-suiter over a 3@s-opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: including Sadek who alerted his 4@D overcall :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady bid 4@S and Brink 5@C!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Sweden bid the slam so 13 imps in the bag|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the story i heard   the original notes used ZZ as place holder  but so many people saw draft it was too late to come up with better name|pg||
nt|joanem: good lead - may have to take heart finesse now - that works too |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lechcold: niestety 2BA wypuszczone w  55|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: south africa made 6@d on a @d-lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|drorp: Israel defended and doubeled in both rooms on board 21, setting by 2 tricks both contracts, for a 13 imp swing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: this will be discussed in the postmortem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impressive|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|xenya: now he will just take his 7 tricks, losing 1 imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but easy to understand Cullin being worried about 12 tricks in 6N|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now @D9 will take a trick|pg||
nt|joanem: oh ok |pg||

nt|joanem: ran 2nd trump to dummy;s 9 |pg||

nt|ahollan1: very low scoring match   with netherlands picking up overtrick imp on last 2 boards|pg||

nt|drorp: with good holding in opener's 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver opened weak 2@D North   that will make it tougher for the Egyptians|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H was reached in other room|pg||

pc|hT|nt|drorp: east decided to upgrade his hand to an 18-19 balanced hand, not sure it would be my choice, but rebidding 2@C isn't that appealing either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   south hand is either a 2@S or 2N rebid depending on partnership|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and i think same @C/@H layouts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   bad joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: might lead a heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: difference in other room though   @S to Queen Ace, lose @C, then @SK @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if the Q loses, then try @hA to see if the J drops|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and if not take the @c finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: the delay in the 4D bid suggests a possible doubt about the meaning of 4C - maybe I am completely wrong|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: perhaps if he'd lead a club earlier|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in 3NT if declarer plays spade to 9 (unlikely) after ace of hearts then North has to switch to diamond|pg||
pc|cT|nt|drorp: running the diamond with 10 top tricks could've been seen a bit embarassing if it went K@D, @D ruff, @C to A and @D ruff|pg||

nt|ritong: declarer is supposed to hold 7 @hs, for starters|pg||
nt|xenya: settling for 2 off is not a problem here -- just ruff a club, losing a club and a trump -- but if he tries for something better he mat regret it|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard contributed @h Q on the lead, so no trump trick for his side|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: England is running out of time i think|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oh  the @C lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i take back everything|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: they are speeding up a bit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in north america  1m-(1@H)-DBL would show exactly 4@S, 1@S=5+   europe DBL=4/5@S and 1@S=0-3|pg||

nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess a fit jump to 4@h was unavailable...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: forcing or semi-forcing|pg||

nt|ritong: fine move by north|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: needs guts to do that|pg||
nt|xenya: good decision by N not to compete further|pg||
nt|jbgood: GeO was not as tempted as Lall at the other table - and passed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a useful 8 to the Kiwi with 1 to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: interesting choice by Gino here, deciding to go slow so he can represent his shape, rather than making a wild preempt at a big level (like 5@D :))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sadek's PASS looks much better to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs is known for his agressive bidding in competition, doesn't let the opps play at low level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably forcing|pg||
nt|joanem: 4s is aggressive thought she woudl bid 3s after 1n|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no bad breaks so no problems|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: south must feel he hasn't shown his hand|pg||

nt|drorp: Ronpa is a big talent but started bridge somewhat late, so he missed on the junior circuit|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||

nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||

mb|1S|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||

nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||

mb|2D|an|alert|mb|p|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||

nt|drorp: woahh i didn't expect that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze dziwniejsze 3@s|pg||

nt|jfanha: vão perder 16-14 em vez de ganharem 18-12...acontece aos destemidos barrativos desta vida...|pg||
nt|drorp: partner went over 4 level, how can he not have 2 aces|pg||
