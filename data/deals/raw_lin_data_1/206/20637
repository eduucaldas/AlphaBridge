nt|vugraphznx: Round 8 of 21 in the Bermuda Bowl 2011|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kit: 3NT call is risky, but passing is just as risky|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: And the 3NT call worked well in a strange way, as it pushed the opponents too high|pg||

nt|kit: This is a messy 4-3 fit.  Diamonds would be better strain, but difficult to get there.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: We did not miss much - Fleisher is still thinking about the line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Fleisher did say before the match that he takes some time when he is declaring a board before playing a card|pg||

nt|yuval10: this is the re-match of the last match of the European championship in Ostende, 2010|pg||

nt|xenya: but might be tough for him...  |pg||
nt|xenya: remember that W passed over 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: E still in tank|pg||
nt|timmy5:  i think he will pass|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ron_sc2002: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: hi Ron wlc|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: He will cash club, then king of diamonds and diamond ruff -- he doesn't know how good South's hearts might be.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: would west dble with only 2 jacks?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Although it really doesn't matter much what he plays as he's due to get 2@d tricks without the ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: right, but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well what is W doubling on?|pg||
nt|kit: who knows -- but when I see a sure set I take it|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: fleisher still thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: And if W is out of @S?|pg||
nt|kit: there is no way West would be leading queen of diamonds from Qxx on this auction -- it must be a short suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm willing to predict this won't be a quick match.  Neither Kamil nor Fleishner is exactly a speed demon.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|timmy5:  with a good defence:)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: to s¹ oczywicie zawody Bernuda Bowl - czyli Mistrzosa iata - sorry za pomy³kê|pg||
nt|jcwla: The preempt really put E in a tough position - 3NT would have more appeal with a more trick-taking hand to say nothing of more values. 4@S seems normal for S.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: bezpiezny kontrakt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can view other tables without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not a good start for Australia...in the other room they made|pg||
nt|ady: east was certain to have only 4 diamonds with 6-5 would have bid them earlier  so A@C and another would have cleared the problem of easts shape|pg||
nt|roswolf: italy of the mark|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: classic NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: top 12 tricks with  4-3 @Hs with a club finesse in reserve, also some squeeze chances|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garden2005: celna akcja 5@h|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: do³aczy³ Grzegorz gardynik - witamy Grzesiu|pg||

nt|kamyk: dzieñ dobry|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Karola Mykietyna - we dwóch bêdzie raniej|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 4@S here|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Bach held the 2@C bid in the air for a while before bidding it|pg||
nt|yuval10: what would you bid from N now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: 1@S response denies a major, usually shows diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm afraif i can't explain this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: x means i think diamonds|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pas - pas - ktr?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that method also lets you listen to BBO Voice Commentary  of Venice Cup  USA1 vs France|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent spot e/w    unlucky to fail|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ron_sc2002: X is ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: possible to bid 1NT too|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Martel bought the contract at 3@S in the open room so USA 1 takes the early lead.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: upraszam liczne zastêpy swoich blinich....dalej nie bêdzie kontynuacji z Tuwima tylko ...¿eby ju¿ mnie nie pozdrawiali....nie jestem w stanie wszystkim odpowiedzieæ|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 6 tricks with diamonds coming in -- but will need a second club trick|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told dbl was takeoy for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "Everyone must have QJ109xxx" of diamonds here /// says Kamil after the lead // laughs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and 3nt will be bid and routinely made|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brazil surely eager for a revenge after they were blitzed by Italy the last match|pg||
nt|jbgood: and they got a flying start...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garden2005: Jassem Martens graj¹ agresywnym stylem otwaræ 2@h = 4-8PC, 5+@H 4+m|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row we see NS treatment after overcall where lower bid and other major are flip-flopped|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm ok 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: all roads lead to 4@h, it seem|pg||
nt|warrens:  how about Pass?!|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: Rdbl probably saying I am max hand from 0-8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: So he may have to lead 9 of diamonds to king, preserving the 2 for a late entry to play club to jack.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so here 2@D=@S  and last hand 2@C showed 5+@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: N Ophir Herbst|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznx: arnolds not letting them play 2@h here, lifting them one level for probably 1 down|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: A@D*|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: check out Tony Nunn's 1st seat favorable 2@S opening with East hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4 down most likely..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: however the dummy is not what he expected perhaps, and the contract seems to be doomed|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|kit: and so he does!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  Since 4@s makes unless West leads a trump, this is probably a good save|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW into truble here - @s and @s and @s will give N a good plus|pg||
nt|xenya: on 17, slam was duly bid in the other room -- 11 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|xenya: spade now followed by another club ruff for 2 off|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  hi all|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: Now he will have to decide which opponent to play for the doubleton club|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c8|nt|xenya: so 2 imps to Egypt on this one, due to the double in the other room|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: it was good detective work|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|grebrof: should taken @h A too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: the red and @C honours was known, with K of @S South wd have strong for 1@D|pg||

pc|d8|pg||

nt|szalay: I feel it nearly automatic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=4+@S   or maybe 4/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 2@c is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|twcho: =16+ any or natural |pg||
mb|3H|nt|kit: However, the 4@S call is effective, pushing the opponents overboard when 4@S was headed down.  Same auction at both tables.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The double with three only @H's does not seem to have a lot of upside and we see the danger here.  Would prefer to have a stiff for this 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Might not llike having only 3 hearts, but I don't think North can sit back and pass -- too easy to lose a double part-score swing when partner has a minor.|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 4@H is clearly in the picture|pg||
nt|twcho: 2NT is probably some sort of @c fit if 2@c is @c|pg||
nt|twcho: now 3@h confirms that south has 16+ with 5+@s and 4+@H and nothing said about @c|pg||
nt|twcho: some info provided by our Icelandic spectators: 2N = minors, <9, short in @s|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: but not to slam, with possible 2 red losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st names around the horn   N:Paul  E:Ricco S:Nabil W:Louk|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Kamil will probably compete to 5@S, and then it is anybody's guess.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I will enter the bids 2  and 2 .. so the players would not know who is hesitating|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Kamil has already bid|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h promise 5+@H|pg||
nt|twcho: so north shows minors and south has majors|pg||

mb|p|nt|szalay: I suggest 4@H as alternative|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S undoubled?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "I expected that bid by the way" Fleisher says|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: "I am sorry in advance" was the reply from Kamil|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: what an unusual way to steal the pot|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: yes 6@s undoubled|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can defeat 6@H with low diamond lead -- which might well be found.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H needs @H 2-2 or good news in @D's.. this is not happening here so 5 imps back to Italy|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@d is not without chance but certainly a very difficult contract. 4@h is another possible strain|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 14-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: E would normally draw Ss @s9, so theres no ruff in @h|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@D asks West to bid his major -- nice pressure call|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks a routine 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: South thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3 enough for old timer|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: wb Geoffrey|pg||
mb|2D!|an|good !h raise|nt|henryb:  small heart or @d10?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference  2@H = 4/5@H not 4@S   not sure after 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: not alerted...so must be natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: With South's 5@C call under pressure, North has to guess whether or not to bid the slam|pg||
nt|jcwla: If 4@H would have been a cuebid, that's possible, or else just 5@C - now will N raise?|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps the 5@C bid should be stronger than pass followed by 5@C, but do they have that agreement?|pg||
nt|xenya: would be nice, Gy, of that describes W's hand -- long spades etc...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  nice crowding of the auction |pg||
nt|szalay: South was timid, I think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jbgood: missed the game in the OR (most pairs will)|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: i can't ask them|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  north too |pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  ;0|pg||
nt|xenya: S was definitely timid, yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's part of the YBYSIBM convention|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@S bid might help NS to reach 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: EW also playing 2/1 natural|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: south almost passed, giving it a 2nd thought|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@d promise 4+|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: south asking about 1@D opener..|pg||
nt|twcho: he should give a try unless their partnership can have light overcall even when red|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb:  I think that was mis-scored: declarer lost 2@H, 1@c and 3@s|pg||

nt|szalay: this game is optimized for VULNERABLE game bonus|pg||

nt|twcho: OR NS has the same auction up till 3@h when south pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: chyba pod¹¿¹ do slemika w karo?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is possible that Verhees PASS denies @D stop and says nothing else   and that vP DBL says  answer stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: and there it comes |pg||
nt|odysseus69: just enough from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North judged to bid 4D and South compounded the damage with a 5th|pg||
nt|twcho: did north pause long before bidding 2@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: It's probably about the speed of the 2@H bid|pg||
nt|twcho: south clearly thinks for a while before bidding 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: he gave it a thought, but not very long|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: think it's about south long pause, that's why he called director|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: i'm not so sure, Sunil -- after S's pass N can't expect him to have this kind of hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: change 'possible' to 'probable'  or  according to spec  'absolutely'|pg||
nt|twcho: east protects himself by calling director because he feels that the 3@h is slow|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: In the open room e bid at the 3 level so when s bid 5@c n bid the 6th.|pg||
nt|timmy5:  ace of hearts lead?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S   fails to heart ruffs|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S is quickly down on a heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: as a matter of fact, it has little chance regardless of the lead...|pg||
nt|henryb:  a trifle overboard|pg||
nt|yuval10: not sure that i like the bidding in the OR, where South only asked puppet stayman and bided game|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: now i think 3@H denies partial stop|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: @S lead will earn 2 imps|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: not easy|pg||

pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Hover your cursor over the open room result to see the bidding at  that table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: italy won 96 out of 100 in 1st 4 matches, but lost to China in round 5|pg||

mb|p|nt|jbgood: NS conv. card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||

pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S are either 1-suit or canape where 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's an oversimplification, but if exceptions come up i'll point them out|pg||
nt|roswolf: passive defence is hard - defenders naturally want to get busy|pg||

nt|sunsamvar:  now high cross ruff|pg||
nt|lechcold: punktujemy:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- playing East for KQ of spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: to bid 4@h you have to open 2@h with the N hand, and many players tend not do to so with 2 aces in hand and a rather poorish suit|pg||
nt|twcho: Iceland is lying 5th after 13 rounds and looks quite safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  then when E gets in another low @h might induce a misguess|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 6H good but is it easy to get there?|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+!C|nt|grebrof: the "not so natural" @h lead holds @d to 11 tricks|pg||

mb|1S!|an|2-3(4)!S 11-13 bal|nt|ahollan1: 1@D is the only ambiguous opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@S is sort of a lucky make it appears, but somehow bold game bidders are the lucky ones|pg||
nt|twcho: while Egypt is fighting with many other teams for the qualifying spot|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: now some chance for EW?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 6+ or very good 5|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: woow...we scored 17 on 3...thats a handy number of imps|pg||
nt|jbgood: might make 4 spades here if defense dont attack clubs in time - a club loses goes on the 4th diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: they do NOT have weak opening for @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: every imp count playing the favorites|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the transfer has wrongsided the contract for slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: Fredin to Brenner laughing... you are Vul....|pg||
nt|yuval10: the bid here from the Italian side was effective|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Unlikely low @D lead to beat it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@HX was only 1400|pg||
nt|henryb:  problem for E is whether to bid 6. I would have|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the trouble with those tactical passes with a fit in partner's suit  you don't know what to do later|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  true|pg||
nt|ady: seems this hand suitable for 1NT|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|antoniz: nie wiadomo kto w ataku,kto w obronie|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: Classic "bulldog" bridge as the Granovetters coined it. Defense is already a trick harder on every hand, but to have to do it under maximum pressure at all times is extremely ...|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm not clear on this auction -- perhaps Taymour could help? |pg||

nt|odysseus69: I expect that 4H is a sign off and end|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have stayed low -|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: West opted for hearts so that he could be declarer|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: EW have a nice double fit but they lost the biding|pg||
nt|yuval10: this could go down 2 in best def.|pg||
nt|yuval10: but hard to underlead A@d|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E should play the 2 of @C|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: signaling @D honor|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: maybe @c2 for @D??|pg||
nt|yuval10: even if W has a 1@s bid ( showing 5+ cards ) , still hard to see them bidding over the 3@h - 4@h|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E may think that his partner has the A@S and then @S switch will be good|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: Bach enquiring about the methods used in the other room|pg||

nt|henryb:  probably in a forcing club context|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case it makes sense|pg||

nt|athene: north has a double of 2@C maybe? - not south|pg||
nt|szalay: small(!) trump as well|pg||

pc|s5|nt|athene: some people might be wondering how south made so many tricks in 1nt in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: well, 1@S - 1NT passed out|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: w tempie|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: it was hard to defend, with the heart suit concealed|pg||
nt|kit: The South hand is an illustration of the value of playing 2/1 game-forcing.  What a rebid problem South would have it were non-forcing.|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile the Italians are piling on: averaging over 6 imps a board without reply|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S is a nice save oppsite 3NT/5@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: This is pretty poor.  North had to be worth something more than 4@H -- that sounds very weak, and North is loaded with primes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inference might be that Verhees has @D  since  he could have opened 2@S [their only weak 2 opener]|pg||
nt|twcho: he has a trump winner. So no need to attempt a @s shift|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: the defence decided to attack hearts viciously, including overtaking the @HQ with the king at one point :)|pg||

nt|athene: these things happen when you defend a "blind" 1nt|pg||

pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: and by extrapolation  exactly 5@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: The opening 1@D bid presents South with a problem.  Possible are 1@S, 1NT, and pass.|pg||

nt|vugraphznx: W wanted to bid over 3@c|pg||

nt|xenya: @C ruff is certain now|pg||
nt|ady: mute point whether south should have proceeded after 2@S   and aslo taking out 3NT  with a flat collection|pg||
nt|kit: diamond switch probably most effective defense, but not very attractive into that diamond holding in dummy.|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 4@h was cold, so -3 in this contract is a slightly better result|pg||
nt|twcho: we have almost identical auction in both tables|pg||
pc|c7|nt|twcho: and I guess we will have another draw|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcwla: If you pass with the S hand, you are hoping it goes 1@H, P, 2@H, so you have a perfect X on the next round.|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: and then p bids 2S, should you push to game?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garden2005: obstawiamy, trafi karo czy nie? |pg||

nt|szalay: winner|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- for a huge gain|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for many this would be a weak hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||

mb|d|nt|twcho: probably has multiple meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: or maybe a multi similarlu discounted|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@D = another transfer|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|santyclz: Normal but unfortunate lead.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: deWijs won @DA and cashed @SQ    not sure what happens now in 6@S on 29|pg||

nt|roswolf: well that wont trouble the scorers|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: On this hand the lead is best anyway, since North starts getting his small ruffs which is the goal for the defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but damaged brain thinks he'll go down now|pg||
nt|henryb:  should be 7 imps for Brazil|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: west asking south abt his dbl|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: no entry to dummy to take the @C-finess|pg||
nt|pelu: I have seen: @SJ from hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: dont really think from north point of view it is better for south to be declarer  but to check up on controls had to go that route|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: That was interesting -- an unusual duck by declarer, and South "knew" declarer couldn't have ace of clubs -- so he continued, and that gave declarer the desired dummy entry.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember @DA already gone so can't establish @H suit|pg||

nt|jbgood: spade queen dropping - club king had to be single or double by north to play the other line|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@H in OR|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kamyk: wszystkim z priv dziekujê - teraz i ja to widzê:)|pg||
nt|ady: seeing the cards can make 6@D   but that is taking the right black suit finesse   finessing the diamond  after playing heart to the king    |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the kind we can manage|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kit: 1@D shows hearts|pg||
nt|kit: 1@H shows 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: e/w are busy  I tht n/s might get to 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznx: I cant read the written explanation by W|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may  play 5@D |pg||
nt|ady: or 4@S doubled by e/w|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznx: or may be not lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and everyone will wonder about how many tricks available in @H|pg||
nt|ady: tempting to double 4@S with north hand|pg||
nt|ady: now double|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: anyway, another 7 imps to Israel. who have built up a comfortable lead with 2 boards to go |pg||
nt|vugraphznx: my computer is not working ... sorry have to go out|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: 5 more imps on bd 14 when n made a t/o x of 2@c and s jumped to 3@h-1.  Egypt has a healthy lead.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: I don't know what 3@H was -- maybe some kind of transfer to 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznx: yesindeed|pg||
nt|kit: A favorable lead -- but declarer has to take advantage of it by ducking, which isn't so clear.|pg||
nt|timmy5:  thats a good saving|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|ady: west I feel very agressive on this hand|pg||
nt|xenya: still a level higher than it might have been|pg||

pc|c8|nt|kit: However, with clubs 3-3 it is hard to see how he can go down.|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm told same contract in OR|pg||
nt|ady: cant draw trumps with any damage as hearts will come in    looks like down 2|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead while there is the club communication can be down 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: sureky the 8 should have been played at t1|pg||
nt|pelu: but dont go away - last board could create a swing|pg||
nt|jbgood: one imp for Fredin's lead:)|pg||

nt|szalay: if it doesnt drop (her majesty)|pg||
nt|szalay: @C 3-3 can help|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4@s is not makeable even dbl dummy now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is superior here of course as you might not to have to guess spades|pg||
nt|szalay: (of course, if trumps 3-3)|pg||
nt|psridhar: he had to win @h king and run @S j|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  YES gY... GOOD POINT|pg||
