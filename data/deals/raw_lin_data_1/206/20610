mb|p|nt|xenya: 1H -- 1@S -- 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all 3 events  Bermuda Bowl (open), Venice Cup (women), D'Orsi Cup (senior)  have 22 teams|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|famus: NS might get enticed into over bidding|pg||
nt|famus: excellent 4@s for israel--which they wud get to--i think|pg||

mb|3S|nt|famus: next|pg||
nt|josj: well, 3nt is definitely easier, with the @D behaving...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|josj: but another push coming up on this one...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|famus: Barel has no idea--everything works for him--wud b pleasently surprised|pg||
nt|famus: looking at 4 possible losers|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the open room we have Newell and Reid for NZ vs Grue and Llall for USA|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: and they landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: East after @h3; ok..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Hello Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both tables in Bermuda Bowl USA1 vs Brazil  have BBO Voice Commentary that is accessible with that link|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: imps are converted to VPs [victory points]|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and top 8 teams advance to Knockout Phase|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Barel now sighing and puffing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: probably DBL=game force with no clear bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: we are about to find out|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphznz: prawdopodobnie znowu problemy z internetem w innych pokojach|pg||
nt|xenya: At last! |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|josj: if there is a ruff, she is down two after all but if the spades break, it;s just -1|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i believe the other dutch pairs play Raptor NT overcalls  so North will bid 1N to show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doubt it will make any difference in final contract/result|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|vugraphznz: coffee hand ?|pg||
nt|josj: even better would be 1 top trumps and then @S|pg||
nt|fokal: this may make|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lechcold: w 18 sorry:(|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: juz powinno byc dobrze|pg||
nt|josj: and it may go down|pg||
nt|fokal: because of the @h suit |pg||
nt|fokal: but has to guess corrcty in @d|pg||
nt|josj: E will duck the @DA and create a little problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: loose 1h,1d and 1c...|pg||
nt|fokal: and not start with @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: yes true|pg||
nt|fokal: tough board|pg||
nt|josj: hi Olivier, welcome to join into the commentary :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: my bet is on Willard... she will make this|pg||
nt|josj: I tend to agree...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: Lall's fit showing jump shut out the @S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HT falling means 2nd stopper in the suit -- and natural attack of @C kills entry to long @H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kiery z góry?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Drijver did PASS   maybe dislike combination of 2425 and vul|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jbgood: only need to find the killing defense|pg||
nt|jbgood: i am told it is not difficult - but i would also say it is not difficult to bid something with GeO's hand - and he didnt:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: just saw this one go down    Pakistan North got diamond lead   and played spade to the king and trick 2  and conceeded 2nd spade tricke and spade ruff and K@H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|vugraphznz: nice start|pg||
nt|josj: first hurdle surmounted|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|mamos: hello everyone :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|mamos: well he can see Qx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe easier now after the lead of the K|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - Im a beginner at this|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: has seen the possible difficulty  and decided on the club finesse    that has resolved any problem|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|josj: and the @D return should clarify the position in that suit|pg||
nt|josj: E had better ducked the ace|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats how it is when you are thrown into a board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius led his singleton @D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h8|nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|grebrof: but ok - it should be easy and it was|pg||
nt|drorp: unblocking in the 1st trick is good techqnique, if you gonna unblock better do it 1st trick possible, just to make it easier on partner|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: careful now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after @D lead  Brink won Ace and shifted to @H|pg||

nt|xenya: S under real pressure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true vlad|pg||
nt|xenya: a so-called show-up squeeze|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|xenya: both N and S that is|pg||
nt|xenya: well not quite, sorry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last 3 cards @SK4 @HT   E @HA8 and @CQ so N squeezed on @SK IF now @D@D|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: S is auto squeezed|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean the squeeze does work but perhaps a simple finesse has better chances|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it's a double squeeze|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is very much hesitating|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: he almost played @S9 fast.. but now he started thinking again|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you can smell the tension there:)?|pg||
nt|xenya: has to throw a spade now for a squeeze -- but then he gives up on the finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzny: I can hear the sighing...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how NS do look?|pg||
nt|panosk: if S chooses to let go 2@H in decl 2@D how is he squeezed?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12-15|nt|xenya: operator just catching up|pg||
nt|jbgood: still not a crime to be lucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably too good for 15-17 NT  especially since they note: frequent upgrades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=good preemptive raise but i don't think this hand qualifies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they don't seem to have a bid for "mixed"|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: good pre is about the same as mixed?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  what does south do with 5 card support an 10 losers????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15 HCP   usually denies 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|an|forces 3!c|nt|grebrof: I agree Dror - no pointy delaying the signaling|pg||
nt|drorp: chagas didn't open 1st seat, will he overcall now?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: weak 2 either major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't be surprised if 2@H IS the winner in long run|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=PUP 3@C  a) weak @C/@D  b) @D, some shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: seems kinda scary but he does have a 6 card suit|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|lechcold: w PO Jassem gra 2@S w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|mamos: albeit not a very good suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: some think that their opps read their conventioncard and often try to "fool" the opponents - not a good idea, cause you will most times only fool your partner|pg||
nt|jbgood: but supposed to be a weak weak 2 - I think that one is rather normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: south will give credit to that vul lvl 2 overcall, i think he'll compete to 4@C atleast|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N=6@D, short @C, NF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs could show same shape with stronger hand by bidding above 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady opened East hand 1@D so that will wake up his Sadek|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: north counting tricks at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: thanks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it also allows NS to get into the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here  Muller doesn't have any help from NS  so has to guess @S|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|drorp: not easy decision for Amaral, and he gives a lot of credit to the vul overcall|pg||
nt|mamos: hate 5@c there - seems better to bid 4@c the previous round  Job done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real way to force defense to break @S or @D   [frozen suits]|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|josj: best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live results under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d4|nt|drorp: double dummy this contract makes, double finessing the JT of hearts, and chagas might actually make it if he can place Gino with the A@C from the quick double on 5@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel is unbeaten so far - 16, 25 and 15, while Brasil have scored 18, 14 and 20 |pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 1 off double dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fokal: probably counting on 3 @h tricks with the finesse|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|josj: the @C shift|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphznz: welcome back all |pg||
nt|vugraphznz: play was very slow until now, so we did not miss many boards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: good|pg||
nt|xenya: so 11 tricks coming|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@C is a big gamble that they make 4@S when u have 2 sure defensive tricks, unless he actually thought he can make 5@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: that also lets you see result from ALL tables of any given hand|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|mamos: it seems a bit umnlikely to make after Pass by dealer|pg||
nt|fokal: she will still make 3 @h tricks, but not for that reason :)|pg||
nt|josj: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jbgood: another gain for NZ - should be 6 imps|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: Lindop led @S so that gave declarer  10|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznz: back in the tank now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: she closed the screen asking about the count|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 66 teams all playing same board  makes for great comparisons|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: if south doesn't have the @sJ he might now underlead the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CJ to show more points and maybe get Muller to place @SA in north??|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: in fear of giving 2 discards on @c if declarer had @c KQT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: unless declarer gors fot ultra safety -- which he did|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c7|nt|grebrof: the 4th match (the internetsite is finally up again), Israel scored 22 and Brasil 25, so both these teams have started off very well|pg||
nt|drorp: heading towards 2 off now, had to play a heart, now he won't have 2 entries anymore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cullin just convincing himself that nothing can go wrong with @D play|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should have gone with gut|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: rightly perhaps|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now forced to play Nabil for @SJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and the longer he thinks, the more convinced Muller will be|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|drorp: and in the 5th Israel tied while Brazil scored 18, it's a clash between 3rd and 4th places|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but @H played by West    so there is risk of @S ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZZ   simply  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with trump lead can still make 12 tricks by guessing south singleton trump and ruffing finesses in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is that reasonable play when contract is 5@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: elAhmady still playing   21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rare situation having Muller table faster than other room|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: many pairs playing 4@h on this board|pg||

nt|grebrof: I think basically you should have a @h-stopper for the 1nt-bid anyway - the dbl mainly shows length and it is a suggestion only - S wasnt fooled to pass :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3major openings normally asks for aces in Ps hand - S has everything|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but 3@h really is mysterious|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: if the play record is correct, S won 4@s in the other room - 2 down may be a wrong entry |pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: with the @hs 3-3 this would be an undebid with this lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: he has 6@s, he has a @d super stopper, but he elects a third possibility with @h xx  strange|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Cullin's 4/5 approach good save against game but very lucky he didn't push them to a makeable slam|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had this auction in my notes but no others, so didn't know options/alternative replies|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: but it's a double-edged sword for sure...|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I mainly lead offensively and I cant say that I have lost on it - I think its the same with these players: its better to lead something you have than lead something you dont want ...|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: last board of the match...w ewill restart in 1 h from now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: thx all for watching and join us again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the day for us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of this round    Round 11 scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and a possible last swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: the story of this match is the one big swing on Board 21|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so last board, grateful thanks to our great operator Pim, Jon for his comments and a big thanks spectators for your great feedback|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: with what looks like a good result for Israel, when 4@h is cold|pg||
nt|ritong: that would tie the match  not sure 2 imps is worth 1 VP|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how 4@H went down in the OR|pg||
nt|ritong: relatively naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: north led a @c, ducked|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see|pg||
nt|yuval10: he didn't have an indication from the bidding|pg||
nt|ritong: then grue draw @h A in order to avoid a possible guess later|pg||
nt|ritong: then the roof fell on him|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it looks like South would bid|pg||
nt|jbgood: the Americans have been a disappointment to me in this match - but quite a long way to go before the KO stages|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you can probably guess I'm wearing a broad smile at this stage Jon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 more rounds tomorrow will get us to the halfway point of the Round Robin|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
mb|1S|nt|drorp: pachtman had very good hand for hearts, but didn't realise the 7-5 distribution, looked more like 6-5 or 7-4|pg||
nt|mamos: and a few small swings mostly to Israel|pg||
nt|grebrof: thats true Mike|pg||
mb|d|nt|lechcold: tu nasi s¹ w 3BA, wist kierowy - musz¹ wygraæ|pg||
nt|yuval10: wow. did he ever|pg||
nt|drorp: Gino's tactic didn't work out, personally i would just blast a big diamond bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: muller not opening strong club here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H actually could be 5@H 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: with 5-5 they rather open the Major first, before they are being preempted to 4@s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: opposite passed hand   better to show suits|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: no need to precise that south did not enter the bidding|pg||
nt|grebrof: not many big mistakes have been made in this match - no wonder they have started well these teams|pg||
nt|drorp: last board of the match now, about an hour before the time is over|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a huge hand for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: Thanks to Jon and Gary|pg||
nt|jbgood: you too, Gary:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  Dennis got there first|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: chagas may have found the bid that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|drorp: needs to find another bid now|pg||
nt|drorp: very tough slam to bid, based on the 10 card diamond fit|pg||
nt|grebrof: hardly Chagas "duty" to bid slam, but I guess S has one more bid if Chagas can dig up some @d-support|pg||
nt|mamos: Will EW pass if he bids 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: woow..the french team are looking for english blood at the 1 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Kevin was our great operator, apologies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@H with 5@S may just apply to 1st/2nd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: de Wijs passing, probably expecting 2@s with Muller, since the opps didn't overcall 2@s or raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
pc|d7|nt|xenya: that 5@C overcall is somewhat -- er -- exotic... |pg||
nt|drorp: great stuff from Chagas|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll never know|pg||
nt|drorp: passing the 4 level, impressive|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - very good bid|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@D coming now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lechcold: dziwny rebid Yokoi (2@S zamiast 1BA)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ryskiel_: karo - wróg bez atu!|pg||
nt|grebrof: its hard with no aces|pg||
nt|drorp: woahh i didn't expect that|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeszcze dziwniejsze 3@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s now ( more likely than @d ) means 4 off|pg||
nt|jfanha: vão perder 16-14 em vez de ganharem 18-12...acontece aos destemidos barrativos desta vida...|pg||
nt|drorp: partner went over 4 level, how can he not have 2 aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been weaker hand with @H/@S  [or strong with one minor]|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lechcold: po karowym te¿ wychodzi|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ryskiel_: ale trzeba na co zagraæ|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale jest palcówka rozgrywkowa -jeli kara s¹ 5-3- trzeba trafiaæ piki|pg||
nt|lechcold: mamy zatem ³adne zwyciêstwo..punkty bardzo siê przydadz¹|pg||

nt|vugraphznz: leaping michaels again in the other room over a weak 2@d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: West could never imagine South bidding 5@c with 6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: and who can blame him...|pg||
nt|ritong: saving at least 1 Vp|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: north in the tank now|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: all spectators are getting impatient lol|pg||
nt|josj: what about you?|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: cronier said j'arive j'arive|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: compared to 4@h made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if other room 2@S=@S + minor   does west hand pass or ask for minor?|pg||
