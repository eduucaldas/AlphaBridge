nt|jaapfr: w europe 1100 morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: here is something wrong... |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: will sort out... going out..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sorry for inconvenience.. |pg||
nt|henryb:  good day all from Veldhovn|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: hello everybody, welcome to the last match of today|pg||
nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|ritong: bonjour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Welcome|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|3for3: 2 active pairs, who have played each other many times...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: its a very good slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: some problems... try to solve...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: gm all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: i don t think kasle will lead @s A|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer really looks void in that suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: selamat malam semua disana|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Karin|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  a close question whether to double or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Ruia took back his pass and bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p!|nt|henryb:  On the surface 4@s is a very reasonable contract -- down because of the bad red suit breaks.|pg||
nt|3for3: north south play canape with a big club...|pg||
nt|3for3: ew 2/1 american style|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @d in dummy's suit is not attractive either|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: this sort of auction usually suggests a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: remains a trump|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: Hi Jaap|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: an aggressive E could balance|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  greetings again|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: kasle is now aware about the five possible discards|pg||
nt|ritong: and the @s 6 shows an odd count|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, 5 when west bid 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so..|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good start Indonesia|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a bit shot into the dark|pg||
nt|ritong: but he might find surprising declarer did not try for @s A on|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: also, a @h cancels the fifth discard|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 4@H can be made here but not too easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@S C NS depending @SK first|pg||
nt|henryb:  South's vulnerable overcall is unlikely to be duplicated in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: 4@S looks good here but down on bad breaks @S 4-1 k@C offside|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|blewah: Hi Oom Jaap :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi mas Aria:)|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||
nt|3for3: east should be able to handle this...since south's trumps are so low|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 11 tricks now after @H lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be quick i hope|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: mosquito killed by Sabine|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: sporty|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, for some questions, Indonesians NS play precision|pg||
nt|blewah: so 1@c is 16+|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|ritong: 1 imp away|pg||
nt|blewah: and 2@c stayman. 2@s must be @h|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: my hopes are misplaced - this tanl is unnecessary|pg||
nt|roswolf: tank|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bets on now : 10 or 11 tricks kibs:)?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  Of course if the N-S cards were switched, 3!n would not look as good|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|3for3: it looks like declarer can prvail, trump a heart in hand...even though the 3d club gets ruffed, and overruffed, the long diamond can be the10th trick... I think!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5 for 11 and 1 for 10|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: next|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: if direct going for the cross ruff then 4@H C easily|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d5|nt|henryb:  Looks safest to do this: concede the diamond|pg||
nt|henryb:  now S has to cash or lose the @hA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 11 wins|pg||
nt|blewah: N doesn't know that @cJ is with W|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d8|nt|roswolf: claim and next|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|blewah: he tries anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|nkgupt: hi all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|nt|3for3: looks like levin will do what i suggested, and prevail...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|blewah: so 10 tricks are visible|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||

nt|ritong: time to take a deep breath|pg||
nt|blewah: 11 is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: He claimed 10|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. i meant 11 imps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jaapfr: most likely 4@S-1 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ah, sorry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my Spanish connection tooooo weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: almost impossible to reach DD par 6@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  Strong NT  - Stayman - 2@h or possibly transfer and 2@s as final contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3: i expect 3@S/P/P/3NT to be very common on this hand|pg||
nt|3for3: east could double but..|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm another 4@s this time for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. so many options.|pg||
nt|ritong: oommmmmm|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|henryb:  North may raise 2@h to 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
nt|ritong: EW do not play stayman followed with 2@s as invite, visibly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
nt|blewah: yes. 2@c is precision|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
nt|ritong: so they deserve some suffering|pg||
nt|ritong: so do their opponents next room, by the way|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||
nt|blewah: 6 card 11-15 or 5@c 4M|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: 4@H -1|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|jaapfr: 3nt is down with @C lead whilst no entry in E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if taking @DA as 3rd|pg||
nt|roswolf: he did now for the obligatory tank|pg||
nt|ritong: can t cancel 40 years of routine so easily, can you?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: good 4@S but a pity down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ods 99-1 it is down 1 here:)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  I think 5@s does not make if E-W tap dummy before both their spade winners are gone|pg||
nt|henryb:  declarer's best line now is to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: 4@S phantom safe|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|grebrof: hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: so USA wins 6 more imps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: 9 or 10 tricks is same result|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|3for3: meyers will fear going down here...but the ace of hearts is right so all is well|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: but looks realistic to me to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|grebrof: this is the second match in Venice cup - I know for sure Sweden won their first match, but I am not sure about England|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: @DA @C@S@S@C@C|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: no point in not ruffing|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: mb a bit naughty 1nt there:)?|pg||
nt|blewah: clearly Lasut see his hand differenntly, though 2@c is totally different than 1nt|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nkgupt: will not be easy to get to a @h game after that nt opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: the scores are not updated yet http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding many close games does put pressure on the defense which sometimes slips|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blewah: i think 1nt with 5M is gaining popularity|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: now all the more diff ...even impossible|pg||
nt|roswolf: expect the same here it is a vul game |pg||
nt|3for3: 4@D looks more normal with the 8 bagger...|pg||

pc|c8|nt|roswolf: north considering a slam try!? hardly worth it|pg||
nt|roswolf: and again using up more mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: True. Lose a trick in every suit except spades.|pg||
nt|don_kapu: Hai, blewah|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb:  i suspect it is too complicated for declarer to get it right|pg||

nt|blewah: 2@d is any M weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I guess 2@d is the majors|pg||
nt|grebrof: personally I prefer 2@c as majors - so that P can relay with 2@d to find the longest majorsuit|pg||
nt|grebrof: here, W has no problems|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h - P - 3@h looks about right|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  2N asks about the 2@h bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: sorry for the Indian kibs  too many Indonesians here:(:)|pg||
nt|blewah: Hi Karen, come join in :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Thx:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|3for3: 620 a good score for usa....4 losers, but defense will be under pressure to break a pointed suit, depending on the lead.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: ok, 2@d was 4card @s and another +5card suit|pg||
nt|grebrof: thank you!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  est could then ask about hand quality with 3@d|pg||
nt|henryb:  and east would say "bad" by bidding 3@H|pg||
nt|hlortz: mosca may fear west was just joking with 2nt|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h = monimum|pg||
nt|henryb:  I play a different set of responses where 3@h says bad suit, bad hand, and the E hand would bid 3@c to show a good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: mosca thinking, he hasnt passed yet. my bad.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blewah: but as commentator we strongly maintain our impartiality|pg||

nt|blewah: the downside of multi|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|3for3: not sure club was safe, if declarer had AQx would have blown a trick|pg||
nt|ritong: then decide about @ss|pg||
nt|jaapfr: system problem|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|3for3: she might have thought partner had Ax@C and a trump or 2 remaining, for the easy quick beat|pg||

pc|s5|nt|roswolf: that spade buck was neat |pg||
nt|roswolf: duck:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|grebrof: the @s being 3-3 makes this contract kinda boring to watch - the play was superior with no single H dropping in @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: @h 4/4 known now|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: koz is not sure about @h Q|pg||
nt|blewah: if E passed, Manoppo could bid 2@s pass or correct|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Klumpp is being very pushy with his prime 17|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: 4@S, with another foul break in spades.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|szalay: I predict 2@S, making here|pg||
nt|sybarra: +d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: ok, I cant find the system now, But N/S plays a system far from normal, but we will do our best|pg||
nt|hlortz: these days you cant tell if the north hand is a weak or strog nt|pg||
nt|projekt1: the biding in open room was 1@d-1S-1NT-3Nt |pg||
nt|blewah: but very well paid Oom Jaap, compared to us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: But a very nice one to do at an event like this:)|pg||

nt|blewah: you are doing great, Karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|projekt1: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if a bid of 1 @S was unbalanced and bigger hand by W?|pg||
nt|3for3: modern style is to bypass 1@S with 4333...I think this is best|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are right,  she is 4333 |pg||
nt|3for3: east can still checkback for 4@S, i am sure|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the hand worth a check back? |pg||
nt|sybarra: and aceless 4x1 |pg||
nt|3for3: aceless 11, stiff king of diamonds...but it is a VUL game to shoot for|pg||
nt|sybarra: close  |pg||
mb|4S|nt|hlortz: must have been strong like 14-16?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: that was well judged by north imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: ood job backing into game |pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, I guess Peter (S) diddnt want to bid 1 NT with only xx in @h here, plus they maybe play 1 NT as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: a matter of style whether west shows 4@S or 3@H first|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: here 2@C forced 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/saopaulo.09/Asp/CrossTableRank.asp?qtournid=783|pg||
nt|grebrof: the results of last years RR Venice cup|pg||
nt|ritong: sh...h appens, especially when you ask for it|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|grebrof: England wasnt qualified and Sweden ended 10th - I guess both these teams want to be in the top 8 this year|pg||
nt|alpagavp: The eighth top teams will be qualified |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|vugraphzpd: sabine asked if she could have 4 sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: S opened the hand 2 @D in other toom |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think the answer was yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: South has a really nice hand but no good bid over 1@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: once he passed, he had to bid 3@S because his balancing double could have been much weaker|pg||
nt|alpagavp: in the quarter final, I am pretty sure that both teams here will be qualified|pg||
nt|3for3: well, that is one benefit to bypassing spades!|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes i would play on spades too|pg||
nt|sybarra: no real lead attractive in the N hand |pg||
nt|3for3: meyers is up to 7 top tricks, with lots of play in clubs and hearts for the other 2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobh1: for his part, N might have jumped to 3@S the first time, but he didn't want to hang his partner for balancing|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's got to get the @Hs right|pg||
nt|bobh1: good defense by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: North in deep thoughts...|pg||
nt|bobh1: he's probably wondering where E's opeing bid is|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|bobh1: he figured it out|pg||
nt|hlortz: down this time - selling the 6 imps that henry was talking about earlier if of team stays out of game|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  Schartz and Finkel have been very accurate so far; can they continue -- not necessary to get a @h ruff, though, they have a natural @s trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaapfr: place your bets|pg||
nt|alunand14: 6 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: Sweden went out vs the later winners China|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h is on the @h guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|nkgupt: 3@s for EW|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@d double pass 3@s would show that kind of hand|pg||
nt|blewah: 2NT?|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but - 1 if they bider|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sybarra: making 6 seems a lot |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: if S hits it can N sit?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that sud be just =|pg||
nt|3for3: very playable, and as the card lie, makeable 6@H|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D a transfer|pg||
nt|ritong: but it consumes lots of space when @hs can be the strain|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|blewah: it's 20-21 bal in their system|pg||
mb|3C|an|Stayman|nt|roswolf: a quiet partscore|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe hard to reach slam now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@C puppet 3@H etc i suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 6@H much better from north|pg||
nt|ritong: therefore 2@d|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: tough at imps|pg||
nt|3for3: since the clubs are with east|pg||
nt|blewah: as they don't play puppet stayman |pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: i dont think they will sniff at slam|pg||
mb|3N|nt|blewah: if i read their CC correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: maybe S should pass with his whole hand in @Ss|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then a slam chanceless|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would rebid 2@D instead of 1nt - avoids this inelegant contract|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: y|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: lucky guys!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzpd: Yes they play stayman|pg||
nt|blewah: puppet, Karen?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no|pg||
nt|alunand14: no, stayman|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: this is a good contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  If declarer finds out about both black aces before playing trumps, he has a chance to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  but likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|3for3: once again...wrong :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: its the commentators curse|pg||
nt|sybarra: but n/s have to know they are behind in match, so maybe pressing |pg||
nt|ritong: good luck west|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong:  |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|alpagavp: For the moment France is 9th and China is 16th|pg||
nt|3for3: that doesnt really pay on the WBF scale.  You win or lose VP's regardless of the score of the match, until you are behind a very large amount|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: a more agressive E would have bid the @s-suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|3for3: and -41 is not large enough....they would still get 6 vp's for that result.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am reminded,  n/s may not think they are behind,  this table has been pretty good |pg||
nt|3for3: well done...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: given explanations|pg||
nt|sybarra: not an easy lead from E hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: with screen up so both oppenents are clear|pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: good point..from NS things are ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, I was not looking at leading a club|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: better to have played @Ds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
mb|2H|nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure poizat reopens|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
nt|blewah: no game, but N may get anxious with his hand|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|ritong: reasonable|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
nt|ritong: passed pard, etc|pg||
nt|blewah: 4@c from S, and then...|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: you right aria|pg||

nt|jaapfr: or 3nt even|pg||
nt|lontoh 63: but different if x |pg||
mb|3N|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@H-3nt?|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w in the other room had clear sailing|pg||

pc|h2|nt|nkgupt: i have seen many experts rebid 2@d on such hands and find it diff to catch up later|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 17 HCP 3 aces and 5/5 is enough to bid 3@d no?|pg||

nt|sybarra: I think she was going to pass anything Arnim bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has a 5 count opposite 10-12,  so she knows opps have more points|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was in mucking it up |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, i guess she would, doesnt seem to be other option, would have played in a 3 3 fit :)|pg||

nt|blewah: right|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now life?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3: 2@D showed hearts, I assume..Arnim probably will bid spades at her next chance.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|nkgupt: think if raising to 3nt sud have a K if done w/ only 4 hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @D looks like transfer  |pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: you would think so but east liked his hand :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would raise to 3@h|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even to 4|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would be wrong on this hand|pg||
nt|ritong: weird alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: perhaps " i do not have 2@h and 5@s"|pg||
mb|p|nt|don_kapu: but East will not agree with 3nt contract|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H depends but normally it is down 1|pg||
pc|h9|nt|grebrof: light opening from N |pg||
nt|blewah: if @s is not led, dec has to guess @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true mas:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a normal declarer will finesse|pg||
nt|blewah: how do you like the @h lead, Oom?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  depends a little on whether E could have shown a constructive @h hand in some other way|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bobh1: this lead doesnt help the defense|pg||
nt|3for3: other room had a very old fashioned auction, with opponents passing throughout; 1@S/2@S/3@S/4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: 2@d was hearts yes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|jaapfr: amat baik:)|pg||

nt|blewah: :) bagus :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|grebrof: the swedish players are not the only ones with conventional methods at this table'|pg||
nt|grebrof: this can only make if ruffing out all the @cs/@hs and endplaying E at the @s A -so, I @s to the K early is smart|pg||
nt|nkgupt: but is likely to be duplicated|pg||
nt|don_kapu: normal for pasif lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|alpagavp: Dummy is now very far|pg||
nt|henryb:  In assessing "blame" on this, I would assign most to E for responding in the first place|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpd: 2h bid tends to be doubleton but it was a thinked 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: she ducked inmediately|pg||
nt|3for3: now declare can prevail, via a partial crossruff|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|d4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y yhe only doubt i have is about the 4@H bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: I think E will take the A in @s early - because she will not be able to play anything when she is in on it later|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nkgupt: sud end up w/ -2|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes w might have raised only to 3  but 1n + 2@h was toomuch|pg||
nt|don_kapu: E just try go fing @C 3-3|pg||

nt|don_kapu: not work|pg||
pc|s8|nt|grebrof: a @s at trick 2 would have been better|pg||
nt|grebrof: now it was easy for E to find the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  so four down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzpd: changed it to down 4|pg||
nt|hlortz: if you go 1 down, you might be unlucky -3 or -4 suggests bidding error|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: misclaming|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sabine claimed but shouldnt|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: the play at board 22 was as I predicted possible to do better - which Larsson proved at the other table|pg||

nt|henryb:  Schwartz should be warned off a @c lead|pg||

nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
nt|ritong: ah haa|pg||
mb|2C|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks karen.....thanks jaap......thanks all :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
nt|ritong: allez allez!|pg||
nt|blewah: thanks Karen, WBF and BBO (including all kibz and commentators)|pg||

mb|p|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
pc|c3|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the results are here|pg||

nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
nt|ritong: il est vraiment rassuré:)|pg||
nt|ritong: le score final devrait être 18/12|pg||
nt|ritong: pas de gros bobo|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
nt|ritong: il va tabler très vite|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: EW have a @S game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
nt|alunand14: jaap, good news from Indonesia ladies : board 28 play 3NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||

nt|sybarra: thx feliipe for info |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|grebrof: as pointed out by kib - the lead was normal and difficult for E |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobh1: S's hand is borderline for 2N...it's a little too good, if anything|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he decided to go with the colors and bid it out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzpd: bbye all, thanks for wtaching..|pg||
