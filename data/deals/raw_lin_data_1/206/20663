nt|xenya: some action here|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to tell where all that will end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I will enter the bids 2 and 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so that the players have no chance to know who might be fast or slow at the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|ady: with such a big fit might get pverboard|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Jan on vugraph|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||

nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South is still a junior, don't know his age exactly|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|lechcold: M-J graj¹ silnym treflem przed parti¹, WJ po partii|pg||

nt|jbgood: the EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ryskiel_: USA 2 ogra³o W³ochów...jak poradzi sobie z nimi nasza dru¿yna?|pg||

nt|ady: defence got of to good start  so down 1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: maybe not ... I guess he will still come to 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exiting first hand // a gameforce relay bidding here - and an Ice-relay bidding in then open room|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: and there still could have been Qxx of trumos off side|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|panosk: may make 6|pg||

nt|boedhy:  hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just before the match started Drijver said that I had to turn on the heat in the room|pg||
nt|boedhy:  exciting board to start with indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess thats not needed just now :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Ruud and yes indeed Iceland have also bid grand|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll back Drijver to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Brink has just given his partner a glass of water |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes he is a very good declarer|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah so now he wants teh heat turned off...|pg||
mc|9|nt|jbgood: Fallenius will have no problems in winning 3 @c - S may even get squeezed for the overtrick|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and declarer accepts 11 tricks // I dont think he should have|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was my fault...so you can blame me :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yet more action on this one|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not a terrible contract but it wont make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C probably can't either|pg||
nt|lml: well double dummy you could draw one trump|pg||
nt|lml: and ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|xenya: i think both contracts are makeable, DD |pg||
nt|panosk: interesting board competition wise|pg||
nt|desinka: 2@D overcall is not that bad..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  2+@C any bal hand (without 5M)?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: 1@H was a bid of convenience for West|pg||
nt|lechcold: nasi w 3N s¹ tutaj|pg||
nt|olegario: a double is to come soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||

nt|ady: n/s with balance of strength not in auction|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H|pg||
nt|desinka: now |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: np Traiian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@d was non-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and E had an easy pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but with Qx@S .. in vuln..|pg||
nt|desinka: just my thought|pg||

mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||

nt|desinka: now...hard contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has 6 top tricks needs to develop 1 more|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to infer that East can have this hand from EW Convention card|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes, was the answer, normally|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: some discussion in Swedish, and after that sorry from Fredin|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: better than 3N so 5 more to NL|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi Skaftij|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems the hans are playing are correct.... just my boards are not correct|pg||
nt|skaftij:  his match is a great opportunity for iceland: if they win it, they will be relaxed tomorrow, because ranks 7-8 will be fairly far away, not chapping at their heels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 19 is not correct as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes, also 19 incorrect|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will stop for the moment... i will ask what is happening|pg||

nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 6 @c .....|pg||
nt|lml: West will likely open a weak 2 in spades|pg||
nt|udo: good morning|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@Sx skoñczy³o siê bez dwóch|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they managed same next door-well done both|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: USA1 is winning the breakage so far|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would be 12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt= 20-22|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|jbgood: S contemplating some slam invite? |pg||
nt|boedhy:  guys are playing very fast :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: what bid do you like by south?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will end in 4@h making probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym razem 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  plus 1 even |pg||
nt|ady: Bulgaria got 6 immps on hand 1   losing 50 in 4 diamonds   5@D doubled in OR   300|pg||
nt|ady: obvious down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
nt|alnanda: there is no difficulty reaching 4@h, i think..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: noooo Jan is catching up after the tech problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: These guys are good, and VERY FAST |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well, we will find ou later how 3nT was made erhaps duck a @d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||

pc|sQ|nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||

nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the live scores is down so hope we get that back soon|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best lead is @d probably|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: in 10 minutes or so he will be brought back to cruel reality|pg||
nt|lml: south asked for a heart earlier|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah trying to make it...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: with the high spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: he saw KJ@d KQ@s in N, K@h can't be with him as well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boedhy:  well their is the advatage of being known as a good player......|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||

nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
nt|ady: request for link  for scores please|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Duboin thinking now|pg||
nt|andersk: I wonder if 3 @S would be stronger than 4 in this auction?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||

nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||

nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like at least a small pickup for USA|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
nt|ady: best defence down 3   but 4@H should make|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||

nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another fast one|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe the will get an early dinner today:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
mb|2H|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||

nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
mb|d|an|alerted|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||

nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
mb|4C|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
pc|h8|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||

nt|ady: looked like only 9 tricks as it went|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live scores  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011   remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  as you can see @d back not best defence|pg||
nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H|pg||
nt|andersk: Falleinus probably tried to show equal length  majors, and passed 4 @H and Fredin probably took it as somethin else|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
mb|d|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||

nt|boedhy:  NS can make 3@c tho|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||

nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but did you watch the tempo|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no really they are very very good|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: the reason that the slam works is that north-south dont have quacks they have controls|pg||

nt|ady: souths trumps not high enough to defeat this|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: a possible alternative was to finesse the @CJ earlier, before knocking out the second spade|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: half of the match played in 40 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh  thanks for explanation Traian|pg||
nt|wild card: well played, but on this layout it was an easy board|pg||
nt|kamyk: ostatnio w Wilnie ktos mówi³ pó³¿artem, ¿e na Krzysztofów powinno siê graæ kontrami karnymi - oni faktycznie sie kulom nie k³aniaj¹:)|pg||
nt|xenya: so 1 imp to USA1|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: trying to get some time back|pg||
nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/s have a slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably some "polite" words being exchanged in Italian now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not after the board -- it was during the board -- I dont speak italian so I am not able to translate|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: they bid spades which was not the best slam|pg||
nt|lml: but the suit broke|pg||
nt|antoniz: Pawe³ to normalny kontrakt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||

mb|2H|nt|lml: well done |pg||
nt|lml: to get to slam :)|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H a make e/w|pg||
nt|panosk: gd result for Sweeden a bit fortunate too|pg||
mb|p|an|alerted|nt|vugraphznv: blame me |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: fleisher showing a 12-14 hand with four spades, I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For NS 3 NT can make.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 again sorry to say but a very good result for the boys|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: on this board David or ?|pg||
nt|ady: thats 7 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: How strong is it asks W|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have made it tho...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S answars "Usually 15-17"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Jan, you could give Sementa a piece of paper to alert and explain his statements :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very aggresive 3NT in OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see which line is best but ruffing 2 @c in dummy was possible...|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes 3@s down one|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||

pc|hT|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok some play in 3Nt here|pg||

nt|pawel90:  na czesciowke z kontrÄ w atu. teraz bez wielu.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but @h are friendly, @C ace is on|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but he might try to find J@S instead of playing on @h 3-3, lets see|pg||
nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl this link will work i'm told|pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Ruud and all |pg||
nt|boedhy:  hoping to get off for 2 down or so..|pg||
pc|c2|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||

nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||

nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
pc|cT|nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Upmark jest lekko wpuszczony|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oni graj¹ w BA nie wychod w singla Wikingu|pg||

nt|xenya: got to believe in his luck|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||

nt|yuval10: Gyorgy sazaly, in an earlier match, suggested that the US teams will be tougher to beat during the KO team, also the Italian one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time a max NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will he have visions of that after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|boedhy:  he should if he hears a fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||

nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||

nt|ady: yes    |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: vwd NL|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for quarter final they have big problems. Maybe the Netherlands will choose them (because of the carry-over...)or they will be playing USA 1 |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 24-24 |pg||
mb|1D|nt|leao:  they got off it cheaply at 200|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I really though this would be closer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: The icelandic pair in this room was yesterday sure that the Netherlands would pick them if they had a chance to do so|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Might be a small pick up for Sweden last board|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: pakistan might get an imp on 24|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: martel has a good hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: szlem graniczny, zobaczymy jak naszym pójdzie|pg||
nt|oosmanb: if they stop in 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H both majors - popular weapon|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can read more about the Bermuda Bowl, particularely the US teams and the Israeli one too, plus expert analyzes, on www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|lml: I am quite impressed with the bridge in this match.  What do you think?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||
nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to Splinter karowy jak s¹dzê|pg||
nt|antoniz: splinter karowy|pg||
nt|leao:  \i expect board 24 will show a tidy profit for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat 4 @H  but have to take their tricks  |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||
nt|ady: may do|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: West said : only this partner|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||

nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
pc|h3|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: after the lead declarer claims making 5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
pc|h6|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||

nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||

nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
pc|h9|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||

nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||

nt|ady: not surprised  not in game here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North plays 3NT in OR, looks like going down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: important board|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: would you bid 2@s or 2@h now?|pg||
nt|wild card: we can see 2@h is a much better contract|pg||
nt|kamyk: mozna go zrozumieæ: zacz¹³ od Staymana, bo jak znajdzie st. 4-ke, to OK; po 2@D nie mia³ jak sie dowiedzieæ o ficie pik, wiêc zaryzykowa³ Smolenia - nie widze tu wielkiej winy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mmm could be down on the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what would you lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S looks appropriate however could bid 2@H, matter of judgment.|pg||
nt|lml: Martels 1NT is 15-17|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: 3@D promising 4-card major(s) but not 5|pg||
nt|ady: the 2@C rescue might also have been painful on good defence|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karo i brawa za agresjê|pg||
nt|ady: some play inverted minor raise not forcing to game|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will make 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or 11|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: new leader after this|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|famus: good for u Jan--coz all those must b which u wudn't want ur young son to hear!!!:)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: not that :)|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: West you didn't. maybe something good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ai|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  played too quickly there|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sr FOLKS -- should never have complemented them -- always ends this way when I do -- SORRY |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky for NL 5C was allowed to make OR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||
nt|ady: this could bring in some imps for Bulgaria|pg||
pc|hK|nt|desinka:  still early to say that :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|udo: still,,,9 tricks ,,hmm,,,,may need some endplay|pg||
nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||
nt|ady: needs to get club right|pg||
nt|ady: bad situation in either minor might have meant slam going down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: it appears west is trying to sign off but east is persisting|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: tht this was glong to be played in clubs    but this will also come home|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: down now - right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade ruff   will beat this |pg||
nt|desinka:  lucky - 6@C/6@D are almost the same in this positions of the cards|pg||
nt|ady: not down in clubs    6NT would have made as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I would like 6@c a lot more|pg||
nt|desinka:  for sure|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||
nt|desinka:  sorry|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d5|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|desinka:  stupid comment|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, but ... if W has 4 trumps with 9 promotion is already done|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||

pc|cK|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||

nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||

nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  must show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c is a transfer to 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a possibilty for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C the limit for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 3N on 9 was made in the OR -- 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Dubion had PASS out of the box more than once - and chooses to stay with it|pg||
nt|bardo: no il +1 non c'è stato|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
nt|leao:  NS have 4@s|pg||
nt|leao:  and EW do not have 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Play in @h. low to 8 first |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When entering dummy second time, run the 10|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
pc|h3|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
pc|d4|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
pc|h4|nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
mc|12|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||

nt|lml: and 9 tricks in a normal 1NT contract|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: why not 1N from Karaivanov???   i thought 9-12 in this situation|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand 4@S and 5@D.|pg||

nt|ady: -300 in 4@S    dont thin n/s can be sure of 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: they have taken the push|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||

nt|skaftij:  With no obvious fit, East lacks intermediates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west stil thinking|pg||
mb|6C|an|alerted|nt|vugraphznv: 6@c for iceland on board 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||

nt|desinka:  yes|pg||

nt|panosk: just a diamond ruff in dummy needed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Kibs tell 5NT pick a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well they picked one that makes lol|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will pull the match like 16-14 in Iceland favour|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a looot of explanation going on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil explanations|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: nope..cards on the table..... and thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  sry missed that Israel raeched the slam too, I get so many comments, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his head is burried inside his palms|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better than 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
pc|s5|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||

pc|h2|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||

pc|hT|pg||

nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: please rejoin us for more wonderful matches from veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym wicie nie ma problemu z wygraniem 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Drijver and Brink are a great pair and have had an excellent set here|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||
nt|skaftij:  possible swing to Italy |pg||
nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
nt|ady: specs suggesting diamond lead  and 4@C is down   but  can still make|pg||
nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwne decyzje obu naszych graczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie sympatyzujê ze Splinterem z rêk¹ S....kompletnie nie sympatyzujê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jassem chyba pomylil sie w systemie|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿ nie|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Martens zrozumial 3@s jako splinter @h|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale mecz przegramy:(|pg||
nt|kamyk: zamiast podsumowania: jak sie tak patrzy na BBO, to sporo widaæ...|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o kilka naprawdê bardzo ciekawych rozdañ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jutro przekazy z meczu Polaków o 13.30 i 16:45 - tak jak dzisiaj zapraszam z ca³ej si³y...mo¿e wreszcie zobaczymy prawdziwych polskich husarzy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: o 13.45 :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³uszenia jutro,dobrej nocy:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: o 13:45 dziêkujê Nataly...pewnie nei wiecie ¿e opeartorem jest nasza dziewczyna - Natalia Bana od pewnego czasu mieszkaj¹ca w Holandii|pg||
nt|kamyk: powiem za Wañkowiczem: Dziekujê Uprzejmie, Przybêdê Akuratnie:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes this and it finished 40:36 and 16:14 for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to guage|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ady: took the save non vul against vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might also |pg||
nt|boedhy:  dont think he would have led that against 3nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  and that was the 8th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli to tak mia³o byæ, to jednak nie bêdê wkuwa³ systemu M-J:)|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have tried 6@D here|pg||
nt|panosk: our thanks to our very able operator Pim, great job indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: AFR Points: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might be a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saved by e|pg||
nt|skaftij:  N temted|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tempted|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, @d King was led|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably a double will come after|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make setting up spades    just 2 sspade losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board of this match - and tomorrow the Round Robin continues|pg||
nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passes|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznv: thank you to Panos|pg||
nt|panosk: not as good as 4@S but it ll make|pg||
nt|panosk: thank you Pim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good victory the Netherlands|pg||
nt|skaftij:  420 + 140?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  11 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it will be close to a draw|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both teams happy i would say|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next round in 1 hour approx|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think most of us understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: A=3point, K=2points Q=1point|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 4@s bid showed 2K and 1Q |pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: he really has a pretty good playing strength hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: still 6 matches left for the teams to qualify for the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: top 8 will advance|pg||
nt|ady: I thin might have done better playing diamonds   forcing dummys trumps  to try and nulify the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to beat this now|pg||
nt|ady: diamond led would have been better for defence|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 14.15.16 all good vps to have :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both teams need to be steady tomorrow|pg||
pc|c7|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but there you see even another disadvantage for the double...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|lml: so a pickup for the usa|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
nt|lechcold: mecz skoñczy siê 16:14 dla nas|pg||
nt|lechcold: wynik chyba lepszy niz gra|pg||
nt|lechcold: i jak na historiê naszych potyczek ze Szwedami  -ca³kiem niez³y|pg||

nt|lml: 10 Imps I think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
