nt|vugraphzpb: indeed, nicely played|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011 for live feed of another table in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|andyv:  so declarer lost the 3 aces and made her game for a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
pc|sK|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: takes time to think, long|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other clue is that N has shown at least 9 cards in @hs and @cs |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|cicus: this is maybe better than 6NT from N - but 2 IMPs less|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: the other room is still bidding  4 so can't say if 2 imps in play or not|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|cicus: the risk of 6@C is a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all in all    6@C looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are some transportation issues after @D lead [we know, but Cullin isn't aware that @CQ is singleton]|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  one more board of tiny decisions|pg||
nt|rhelle: on the previous board, it seems that the @d finesse is declarer's best hope|pg||
nt|rhelle: so a bit sloppy going 1 off ...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  First pickup by Japan, Baldursson bid 4 @d on bd4|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  a wild hand...5@d about par for hand but may be hard to stop there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW have to stop low|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: the tables do not seem to be connected and therefore their are no imp scores on each bd|pg||
nt|cicus: nice suit to overcall on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H lead director?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids 2@s. W may be able to bid 4@d (leaping michaels)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
mb|1S|nt|alunand14: Sawiruddin-Hartono play prec|pg||
nt|rhelle: disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|skaftij:  CC says weak 2 in @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: bidding is now faster.....than playing, as stated by Deas|pg||
nt|rhelle: however, North may now not find the @s lead|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess W is bidding 4@S now - he expects more strength at the right place|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the limited 1@h opener, EW may be able to stop in 5@d|pg||
mb|5D|nt|vugraphzpb: meaning of 3@s was asked; natural >3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is thinking to bid 6@c|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Link to CC's: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=2011Veldhoven&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so far so good, though 7th trick is to be found|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzpb: and he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and he does cheap insurance!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
pc|d7|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E has @h A and @s 9 for replay|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: which of the two he will play|pg||

nt|glen: http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3555|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi glen|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: sry for this|pg||
nt|glen: np, sometimes hard to tell the cast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that treatment was defined in the 1970s|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@D = weak 2. 3NT certainly frisky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||

pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||

nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||

nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||

nt|rhelle: but a deserved 10 IMPs to Germany, IMHO|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzpb: then he had to bid 4nt|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a wonderful concept|pg||
mb|d!|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||

nt|andyv:  sorry, misread the opening bid...simply a negative dbl|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north might regret re opening|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they can use 2NT here to get to 5-3 @C fit|pg||
nt|glen: or pass|pg||
nt|glen: to get N to pick|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Anyone for balancing with East hand? Would end up in 4@s, unmakable|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
mb|d|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: some of my partnerships would play pass by S here to play 2@SXX|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  so, E has to find a way|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: trying to think single dummy ....   want to preserve QJ  so  win dummy @H to Ace, @C finesse     i think|pg||

nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||
nt|alunand14: bad lead from sawiruddin :(|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: they could have let e/w play in 2@S quietly|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h made in OR|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@c and @c, @h return and 3rd @c to take the maximum no. of tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|andyv:  this was not best for the defense|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: some credit to Nystrom for opening 1N=14-16  i think might be easier for North to bid more than 2@S than for South to take another call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm    remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy having a very big set against Bulgaria   that puts Italy almost half a match ahead of 2nd place Netherlands|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  I stand corrected...the @h play doen't cost anything|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|c3|nt|skaftij:  Needed an unprobable shift to a low @D to beat this certainly|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: score is not correct of this match, sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: please watch the live scores|pg||

nt|remo: di là Italia ha trovato la difesa su 4@H. In effetti non ho capito il "non 2@S" di S in questa sala|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: TD has arrived and asks EW about their stayman system|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: W explains that she bid 2@c as an attempt to avoid a @s lead|pg||
nt|remo: e qui cresce un po' il naso :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: and W was not afraid that partner would bid 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: because if W had a 4card @s she could have asked E if E had a 4card @s suit|pg||
nt|remo: credo non sia stato spiegato che l'apertura di 1nt può contenere quinte nobili, altrimenti la discussione non avrebbe senso|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: so the 2@c bid from W was an attempt to prevent a @s lead against 3nt - and declarer is ruling now asking about other parts of the system for EW |pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: collecting informations about the whole system for EW|pg||
nt|remo: e se non può contenere quinte nobili allora è ancor meno giustificata la discussione|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: a lot of discussions is going on |pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: I will tell the ruling when the TD makes one|pg||

pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  first step done. what about the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think normal play is to get hearts wrong|pg||

nt|glen: but south is happy with just one|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: claimed quickly when W had also @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky for West|pg||
nt|cicus: well, I lost 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, I can hardly imagine N's reasoning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but well done by palmer to give them a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: south will have shown her diamond count, so north's only chance was to cash @cA|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 15 HCP|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may be, N hoped for @s trick if W were 3-7-2-1?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but you saw that Mohiudd bid it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  most likely 3N will be final contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
mb|1N|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: a 9 count 2/1 in the open room got EW to 3NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|glen: even with @H Qxx behind AK not enough|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: north re-opens again - this time with justification|pg||

pc|c2|nt|alunand14: X of hartono already make slam missing from S|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11-25 (bra-ind) now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this more like a pairs auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||
nt|alunand14: 11 imp's for indonesia and draw now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpb: this does not seem to be well played|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson needs to play on @d now....|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i don't see how she can make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and the scorer of the usa has fallen asleep again....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|skaftij:  Does he have a hunch about the @s position?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 1@S response wouldn't occur to me either -- unless playing Kaplan Inversion where 1@S=forcing NT equivalent|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|glen: at 50 for the extra down trick, he will take the @C finesse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|d7|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Bertheau bid 3@C over a Forcing 1N     and Nystrom alerts as 5@C 5@H   uh oh|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Go Holland go... :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|skaftij:  Declarer can couter every move|pg||
nt|skaftij:  counter|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: for a second  Nystrom was in 4@HX East!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unbelievable, now the scorer and dias are taking a short nap|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: short  breaks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: 2 more bds after this|pg||
nt|cicus: oh my !|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the light overcall will steer NS away from the @h suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may well bid 2N here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|skaftij:  East intended to show 1819 bal - W is using transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@CX is better but still 5 top losers vulnerable will be 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: did it end there?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is whether she feels she has enough to try for 3N.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzpb: short breaks of sleeping|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  If S had bid 2N, N would have an easy 3N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cicus: odd that N did not X this - can it be that would als have been T/O?|pg||
nt|rhelle: go, Pony, you never find KJ9x behind you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but even played by west is likely to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky N found @dA by partner, not the @cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1N bid may actually have helped NS|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  good lead to knock out an entry into the N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they have time trouble 3boards in 15 minutes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: now can develop @C suit for @D discard|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson could bid 3@D = 18-19 with 4 card support in @H, wonder why he shunned that|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's a 10-imps gain for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11 even|pg||
nt|rhelle: I daresay that there is a case for South competing with 2@s after the 2@c bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzpb: he asked how much time was left; maybe he was in a hurry :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|alunand14: 6 imp's again for indonesia|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rhelle: but it all worked out in the end|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: but on that lead should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very good switch to @h|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: @S765 nothing to brag about -- no defense if EW run  ...  take the non-vul plus seems right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|glen: could lose @S, @C, @H only|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpb: making again a new playing plan?|pg||

nt|roswolf: should only lose etc:)|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: double game swing for France here|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT, or 6@d for NS - depending on @d finess that works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s finess as well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: south resisting temptation|pg||

nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: or not  but they both did better than defend 4@S|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W did not overcall 1@h but contract was still 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||

nt|vugraphzpa: W says it is not a psyke bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzpa: TD says You would always bid 3nt after E has bid |pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: or|pg||
nt|vugraphzpa: TD argues that the purpose for the 2@c bid was made to deceive the opponents|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: weird = underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d is conventional|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty to Andy|pg||
mb|3H|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 31 proved to be a big swing for USA1|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: East lands on her feet ... :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kiwibridge: in their big win over USA2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S kept the auction open with a 1@s bid and game was easily reached|pg||
mb|p!|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
nt|rhelle: as the axe was getting perilously close to her neck |pg||
mb|4H|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese women even bought the contract now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: likely end score Indonesia wins 49-39|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Note 26   2@C=6@C  no 4M but maybe 5M|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just in time|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: on repeated trump leads, this may not be fun either|pg||
nt|rhelle: and what do we do against doubled partscores, boys and girls? We lead trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N take the push?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s taps could easily destroy this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul may make E think twice about trying to make the hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: excellent!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
