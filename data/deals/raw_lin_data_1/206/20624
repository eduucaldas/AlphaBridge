mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cicus: they are. 1@D promising 4 came in handy for EW here|pg||
nt|farrukh: yes indeed|pg||
nt|cicus: if NS can find their @Hruff this goes down so no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello again, now we have all the information correct here, the names the results, etc, right Rob?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NS should get to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s now showing a weak raise, a direct 2@s would probably be constructive|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzpb: had to restart, sry, all ok now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: result of the first board is 3@c=|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: welcome again to this session|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: declarer now sees the 0-5 trump split and is not happy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  will be tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to play it now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c finesse might see him through|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: as one may guess, 1@d was transfer and 3@d showing shortness with heart support|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer has his chances but has to deal carefully with the board, because we have 4 trumps with W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 teams that are very close in the ranking|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|rhelle: hello everyone|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|farrukh: but even then e/w should pick up a few imps |pg||
nt|rhelle: this contract will not overly tax declarer, especially with this lead and the @dK right|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Jonsson overcalled with 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: must prevent S from taking a trick, so he can draw trumphs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: each country has his or her own shirts here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Iceland is in yellow, Japan in light orange|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes, bot are on the right side of the line, so we exect tight match here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rhelle: however, there are some mild communication problems|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|nt|star6ija: both*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E is playing with another partner today then yesterday|pg||
nt|star6ija: this play of the spades ensures only 1 loser if E was with 10x Q10, K10...the most persentage play|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|star6ija: at this high level declarer is warned somehow for bad trump break, because otherwise trump lead is obvious according to the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N is reading the extended version of the convention card of E/W|pg||

nt|roswolf: big misfit danger lurks for everyone|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks more interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and the Netherlands in Orange of course :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Furuta plays 1NT in OR so pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Nice play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed, nicely played|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011 for live feed of another table in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|andyv:  so declarer lost the 3 aces and made her game for a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the first big win for usa|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: open room: 4@h-1|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer in the open room had played trumps, but without finesse, so 13 IMPs for USA, thanks to safety play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: missing 4@h by E/W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  and that is a weak hand with 5 spades and a minor by West|pg||
nt|dburn:  the New Zealand pair using Moscito, a system that does not allow very many passes in first or second or third position|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
nt|dburn:  some guesses for declarer - normal to pick up spades, will probably lose two hearts, so much will depend on clubs|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a partscore-battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio giving up very fast|pg||
pc|d3|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
nt|star6ija: very high pressure by North|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
nt|star6ija: they may win some IMPs more, due to this 3@ss gadget|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
pc|d6|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S contract is actually better for EW|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
nt|dburn:  England rather fortunate on board 2, where they reached a somewhat ridiculous 3NT that had about eight or nine losers|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|rhelle: so first blood to USA1|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn:  this will be a swing one way or the other, since the contract at the other table was a part score|pg||
nt|dburn:  so, 10 to NZ or 7 to England depending on Wilkinson's view of the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really all that much to go on - the only suit whose distribution she knows for sure is spades|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  in W leads the Q@c and N ducks, W should lose 2 @d tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: a solid rresult for India|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|andyv:  S tried for the uppercut which would have worked if N's @hs were A8x|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s succeeded in OR for NS|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|andyv:  W will need to hold this to down one in order not to lose board...and now will do just that|pg||

nt|dburn:  four hearts, not four spades, minor suit canape possible|pg||
nt|dburn:  choice of actions for South now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@s was indeed a preemptive bid, making it imp. for E/W to find @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: needs to play in @H here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|dburn:  she can bid 1@h as a distributional takeout, or double as a more balanced takeout, or overcall in her long suit|pg||
nt|benjy: how do you feel about her choice david?|pg||
nt|dburn:  would have doubled myself, with 1@h as second choice - not all that keen on 2@c|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm suggesting a heart lead (showing shortage)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and of course @C support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: even now 3@h is alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: late|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal    1@S=5-7 zz, a) 5+@D, some shortness  b) 4@D(441)|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't be sure but I think S showed @Hs and game forcing values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zz points are:  A=3 K=2 Q=1  [unless short]|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, thanks Al ,you are prepared|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: deas is not looking perfectly healthy; in a electrical chair, hand in bandage|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dburn:  but double nd 1@h lead to murkier later auctions than 2@c, which may have influenced matters|pg||
nt|benjy: super agressive 2NT bid by Fiona|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like no troubles for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will probably double and in due course bid 4@H|pg||

mb|2S|nt|roswolf: DONT LIKE EAST'S PASS and 4@S is not the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then pick event/country to get partnership convention card|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, 2@c is supposed to deliver more of a suit and / or more of a hand|pg||
nt|benjy: So you would bid over 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn:  just about - could well have enough for 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: so I would like to pay more attention to the previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but this lead knocks out the entry to the clubs, so we may well not have enough for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  although other things are reasonably favourable (e.g. the diamonds), so this will be close|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: did east want a double from w?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N have to cash out immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  and the contract allowed to make|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpb: she is moving now to get a good seat, if possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: As Radoslav Radev pointed, 3 in Major weak is used by Eric Kokisch, who is a kind of advisor of strongest US players|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  a sizeable swing for EW|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|benjy: if she wins in dummy and leads a spade up east has to duck to give the defence a chance|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Upmark had option to Relay to get information about South hand, but elected to show @C with some shortness|pg||
nt|dburn:  East opened at the other table also, and South elected to double|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn:  West bid 1NT, which ended the auction, and eight tricks were taken|pg||
nt|dburn:  but they were taken by the defenders, so NZ have a useful plus 200|pg||
nt|benjy: this is cold now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: unfortunately I don't know any of the NS meanings  after the 1st 2 or 3 bids|pg||
nt|cicus: seems they do|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - it may well have been cold anyway, but winning the first spade has certainly done no good for the defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: perfect contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this defence, declarer has his life easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: her life, it's the Venice Cup|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests west should pass 3@H - THAT GOOD EASILY BE RIGHT - but east isnt guaranteed to have the hand he has - east failure to double 3@H should have cost him a packet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, defenders cut spade communication with the opening lead|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: and actualyy has:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||

nt|roswolf: a spec asks why td called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is asking sw for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo e/w were crazy in not doubling 3@H OR INDEED NOT PASSING 3@h out vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h could be hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: they played in the wrong suit and they should have just played bridge|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok thx Rob|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: TD is collecting the written expl of 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a nice hand for the majors over a strong nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  North-South play a weak no trump, so this may be an upgrade|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Wests in both rooms chose diferent ways of acting, as well as Norths. US tactics was winning in both rooms, so deserved 10 IMPs|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: !:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16 [1/2/3nv]  15-17 [3vul/4]|pg||
nt|ahalim: two easy slams to id|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: If i was playing a weak NT here then I would open one with the south hand|pg||
nt|benjy: Ok  you have 14 HCP and a couple of 10s but the 4333 is enough to keep me in range|pg||
nt|ahalim: bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: good morning to all|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H NOT 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if the td rules in Brazil's favour it will almost certainly be appealed|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d will require guessing the @s suit or a @s lead|pg||
nt|benjy: and X in the pass out seems normal|pg||
nt|benjy: north will prob be glad to go back to clubs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|cicus: this variation of NT ranges is very fashionable|pg||
nt|cicus: among big clubbers|pg||

nt|star6ija: now it is interesting to see weak 2 openning with 2 Aces|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzpb: N says; we should not waste time with these hands; 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: but everything goes if the partner is warned|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@h could have gone down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@dX was made in OR|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to approach diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: first spade, then diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking what the double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 12-15 was said|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she has 11pt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems hopeless on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS will win imps no matter what happens here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|cicus: a good slam here - in fact laydown if S plays it at NT (not possible now)|pg||
nt|ahalim: EW have a sacrifice in the majors but will not bid it|pg||
nt|tomi2: non vuln / vuln with 55 in majors many will bid wests hand, even with that weak suits|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and then probably will find the save|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bessis took out 6@c but put it back in the bidding box|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cicus: 12 sure tricks without needing the spade finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but since @SK onside it doesn't matter who plays it -- yes, that's resulting|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpb: takes time to think, long|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other clue is that N has shown at least 9 cards in @hs and @cs |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|cicus: this is maybe better than 6NT from N - but 2 IMPs less|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room is still bidding  4 so can't say if 2 imps in play or not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: the risk of 6@C is a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all in all    6@C looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are some transportation issues after @D lead [we know, but Cullin isn't aware that @CQ is singleton]|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  so, defence took their tricks in time|pg||
nt|rhelle: the @cQ looks the natural continuation|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|rhelle: on the previous board, it seems that the @d finesse is declarer's best hope|pg||

nt|skaftij:  First pickup by Japan, Baldursson bid 4 @d on bd4|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  a wild hand...5@d about par for hand but may be hard to stop there|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  EW have to stop low|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  4-3-3-3 is actually a good shape for notrump - people have wrongly been downgrading it for years|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@H lead director?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids 2@s. W may be able to bid 4@d (leaping michaels)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: can't see what the players ar writing about 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: bidding is now faster.....than playing, as stated by Deas|pg||

mb|2C|nt|tomi2: am I the only one who cant reach the official WBF page since yesterday evening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but D'Ovidio will certainly have a minmimum|pg||

nt|andyv:  with the limited 1@h opener, EW may be able to stop in 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn:  OK - North bid hearts, not West, but North showed spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: meaning of 3@s was asked; natural >3|pg||

nt|benjy: i still don't believe you would have upgraded that hand though|pg||
nt|ahalim: I have it right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think i can read 9-13 on one of the notes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||
nt|star6ija: after ruffing will W underlead has @DAce for second ruff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down; @c A, @c, @h, small @d, @c and trumph again|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  might well have done - lots of intermediates|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and he does cheap insurance!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
pc|cK|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  better from South as it happens, this - West doesn't have an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but she may be put off a diamond by North's bid in the suit - not sure what that meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: according to the auction E may ask for Spade continuation though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dburn:  she wasn't, but that has blown a tempo for the defence, and declarer can get the long diamond going before the defence can get a club|pg||
pc|c2|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is a little bit dangerous for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: politely asking the Japan for admittance|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn:  assuning declarer plays that way, of course, and does not rely on a heart to the king|pg||
nt|benjy: can't she try both by leading a @D now|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can certainly combine chances in some way, yes|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|star6ija: we have to point out that 4@s is ice cold contract, so some swing (even double game) is possible|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|star6ija: 4 IMPs Japan as far as US pair i the OR played in 5@d for 1 down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  lol..sorry, private:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C Precision  6+@C or 5@C & 4@H/@S|pg||

mb|2D|nt|alunand14: pagi mas wtee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3nt or not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: their range for 2@C=10-16|pg||
nt|cicus: many now play 2@C to show 6+ @Cs right away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N would be INV+ in @C, so 3@C=... less than invite  :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpb: after a long thinking pause by Deas|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think Peter Weichsel started that trend when playing with Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|rhelle: this looks like another 3NT contract|pg||
mb|2S|an|NF|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@D = weak 2. 3NT certainly frisky|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit sitting favorably for declarer, 3@s should make...losing 1@s, 2@h and 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: the USA women play slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [having played some form of big club since 1971]|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ohoh, S trying to create entry for a @D lead, no luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: im sorry missed a pass,|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 club ruffs are enough to win (as we see)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in that 6m hand we see many tables bidding and some making contracts like 6NT or 7 in a minor. 7 Clubs oftn fails because the @SA is on lead, 7@D makes on some tables. Did not spot ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: that the French auction here is so good, but nowadays Blackwood is out of fashion, so well done to them ;)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: bd 20 india gained 12 imps but it is subject to a td ruling here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slowly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he has to develop a @c|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 5, East lead @d ace so 4@h making, 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: club ruff|pg||
nt|benjy: I'm afraid I have to go, goodluck England, thanks David|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||
nt|farrukh: and there was no need for a @h finesse actually...it was just a practice finesse:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @H finesse was an illusion|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|glen: if FX stands for "special effects" we have had some fireworks already at this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Farrukh's comment got there first|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hope, EW methods allow them to bid a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...@c ruff was found..in OR, 3@h was a disaster, going down 3 and 9 more imps to Italy which has taken the lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well, you are missing an Ace and @hQ|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|roswolf: this cant be right!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-7zz, some splinter  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 21 is another example of adantage of quick entering the auction...12 IMPs to USA1 because of openning 2@h with 2 Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so the notes are wrong  or Upmark misbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: players not alerting much. They discussed it before the match, so obvious alerts aren't made|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|vugraphzpb: issue with bbo|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice bid of 3@ss showing willing to play 3N with @s stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north must have opened 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing wrong with this contract|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, I also wonder why sawiruddin also play as a beginner?|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am not sure what this pass means|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: but I will do them for the spectators|pg||

mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will probably need to set up @d suit to pitch a @h or a @c (or both)|pg||
nt|tomi2: west may hope partner has 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: E thinks about his hand ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, N will actually not need any pitches from the @d suit as cards lie...but still, will set up the @ds for a @h pitch|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will another big swing for NS as 1N was bid and made in CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Cullin is just making forcing noises -- Upmark clarifying hand   we just don't know the specifics|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know yet how favorably everything lies for her|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: does 2@h show 6-card? then with 4 trumps can show @hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think they rebid 2@H with nothing extra to say|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle: 1@c is a stretch, as far as I'm concerned. I'd be happy to pass that West hand. 12 points, but such a load of cr.p ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the end , I think East does well not to make a further slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W wins @d and returns @h, N will have to put up the K|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: interesting bidding here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 6 OR: Jonsson plays 5@c D for a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached good contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  W will have to shift to @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: even if they tried to find better spot bidding 3N, I doubt E would leave them there having 11 cards in major|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a fast claim|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn:  1@h spades, 2NT spade raise|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Masood currently in 6@H but Ahmed still has a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it was possible for east to ask for aces and Queen, pls correct me if I am wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: there is a toiletbreak now, they will be back in a few minutes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and they are all back now.|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a deserved 10 IMPs to Germany, IMHO|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's thinking should have been:  If I have to play @hs, I will have to lead to my King...EW are not here to help me so I should stick to my original plan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N/S are discussing that 3NT should have been the right contract, the 3@s bid was confusing (normally dbl would ask for a stopper)|pg||
nt|tomi2: lucky board for Germany here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzpb: then he had to bid 4nt|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: they play 3 sets per day with short breaks between matches  but then get to enjoy the evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a wonderful concept|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl looks like it's game forcing|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting point...all this depends on agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that was expl. at the table|pg||

nt|andyv:  sorry, misread the opening bid...simply a negative dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: north might regret re opening|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they can use 2NT here to get to 5-3 @C fit|pg||
nt|glen: or pass|pg||
nt|glen: to get N to pick|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Anyone for balancing with East hand? Would end up in 4@s, unmakable|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
pc|d2|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: some of my partnerships would play pass by S here to play 2@SXX|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: west worked out partner should be short in @D here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cross ruff seems an approach to take|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: the small @D might be a mistake|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
pc|hK|nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually I don't think cross ruff is necessary here, because E knows where all the points are|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  so, E has to find a way|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trying to think single dummy ....   want to preserve QJ  so  win dummy @H to Ace, @C finesse     i think|pg||

nt|cicus: S was extremely conservative in OR|pg||
nt|alunand14: bad lead from sawiruddin :(|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: they could have let e/w play in 2@S quietly|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h made in OR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  well done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||

pc|cA|nt|andyv:  this was not best for the defense|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm    remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy having a very big set against Bulgaria   that puts Italy almost half a match ahead of 2nd place Netherlands|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||
pc|d7|nt|glen: does E lead a @S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: from north's point of view couldnt south still have a small doubleton club?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h was Game forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will make on any lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: it also might be made if E decides to lead Q of Spades instead of @D Jack|pg||
nt|star6ija: or as Danny Sprung pointed via black squeeze, which on the actual layout doesn't work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glen: even though S is hort|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  let's see if the ladies' secret weapon - intuition - will work|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpb: sorry error in the auction|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sfoxa:  not this time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 7, Jonsson led a @s. Now a @h shift was required but not found. tough defense|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in 3Nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Moment of truth in OR, |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h is slightly better because a @c can be ditched on @s Queen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  OR is 2 boards behind designated time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deals in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very long pause for the outcome, questions asked to N on bidding|pg||
nt|star6ija: some tricky move would be N to play small @c from dummy to put pressure over W if he had the King|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: only reject  Pass and 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 11|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  E may well need the 9@s as a throw in card to endplay N in the @h and/or @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  acutally, scratch the last statement|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|nt|glen: no, makes the good lead and its a push|pg||
nt|star6ija: he can afford to lose this trick|pg||
nt|star6ija: so let's see what it will be|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|skaftij:  celand and China  got penalty for slow play |pg||
nt|andyv:  E up to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to avoid in this bidding sequence|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzpb: south knows from the lead that west has another diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so shouldn't go wrong here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but possibility to go wrong still exists for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: north knows west started with 7 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: otherwise south wouldn't overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: depends on the point of view|pg||
pc|s5|nt|star6ija: N may find it fortunate :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is deciding in what order to play the tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  BD 8 OR, Kaku in East took the slow approach bidding 3@D iso 4@C. Ended in 3NT so Japan is levelling the match|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s3|nt|star6ija: what about the slam...3-2 is 68 % and @c King onside is half of this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rhelle: now another @h takes the trump entry away before @cs are unblocked|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  so, the chances till the end|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: but you saw that Mohiudd bid it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  most likely 3N will be final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: half time now|pg||
nt|star6ija: even at this high level (World Championship) W may not duck, having doubleton King|pg||
mb|1H|an|can have longer !d|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with passive defense (@h lead) it will go down|pg||
mb|2C|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
nt|star6ija: also with C Jack or with @D JAck|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||
nt|star6ija: Danny Sprung clearified this openning of 1 @d...always unbalanced with 5+@d or 4441|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|glen: a 9 count 2/1 in the open room got EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am wondering if they can stop here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|glen: even with @H Qxx behind AK not enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north re-opens again - this time with justification|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/BoarddetailsCondit.asp?qmatchid=2545|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: for match scores|pg||
nt|star6ija: obviously not|pg||
mb|p|nt|alunand14: X of hartono already make slam missing from S|pg||

nt|rhelle: save her partner's ass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl. of 4@d was not correct apparently|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 11-25 (bra-ind) now|pg||
nt|star6ija: ah...4@d is may be Blackwood (Gene Saxe's statement)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: this more like a pairs auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||
nt|alunand14: 11 imp's for indonesia and draw now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: at least 2 IMPs US thanking to the rifhtsided contract|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: France avoided the slam missing the ace and @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 10 imps were kind of randomly given to Germany depending on the position of the @HQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpb: this does not seem to be well played|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson needs to play on @d now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking about leads and signals now by E|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: and the scorer of the usa has fallen asleep again....|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  Does he have a hunch about the @s position?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 1@S response wouldn't occur to me either -- unless playing Kaplan Inversion where 1@S=forcing NT equivalent|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: at 50 for the extra down trick, he will take the @C finesse|pg||

pc|c2|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||

pc|d2|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|tomi2: this is an interesting spot, they have two 8 card fits. in clubs they even have all spotcards but one defender holds the "straight flush"|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing the @sK, when you know the ace is behind, is that great a play|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 9@D upside-down attitude|pg||

nt|cicus: oh my !|pg||
nt|hedyg:  light overcalls on 1 level accepted everywhere now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the light overcall will steer NS away from the @h suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may well bid 2N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  East intended to show 1819 bal - W is using transfer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 5@CX is better but still 5 top losers vulnerable will be 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: did it end there?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is whether she feels she has enough to try for 3N.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@c was negative freebid, nf|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they alerted 2@c because it was not-forcing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzpb: short breaks of sleeping|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  If S had bid 2N, N would have an easy 3N|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|cicus: odd that N did not X this - can it be that would als have been T/O?|pg||
nt|rhelle: go, Pony, you never find KJ9x behind you|pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: with no trump lead now the cross ruff is open|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: but even played by west is likely to go down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky N found @dA by partner, not the @cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1N bid may actually have helped NS|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead to knock out an entry into the N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they have time trouble 3boards in 15 minutes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: now can develop @C suit for @D discard|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson could bid 3@D = 18-19 with 4 card support in @H, wonder why he shunned that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  it's a 10-imps gain for NS|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  3NT, or 6@d for NS - depending on @d finess that works|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: south resisting temptation|pg||

nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was not a bergen raise, it was simply an invitational raise with support|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
nt|tomi2: their aim was not to preempt opps out of the auction, they would probably not do this with 7hcp only|pg||
nt|tomi2: they wanted to investigate the 4@S game|pg||
nt|ahalim: i said bergen type raises not bergen raises :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: or not  but they both did better than defend 4@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  in OR, W did not overcall 1@h but contract was still 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||
nt|rhelle: this could be another partscore swing - 2@h vs 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: specs here missed a cool defense on  29|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: all that leads to ... should declarer duck at trick 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT are 3rd/5th|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they surely have other bids for 7 hcps support, 3@c and 3@d bergen raises are not preemptive either, only 3M is|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Note 26   2@C=6@C  no 4M but maybe 5M|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just in time|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: on repeated trump leads, this may not be fun either|pg||
nt|rhelle: and what do we do against doubled partscores, boys and girls? We lead trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N take the push?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: usa will be more secure after this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s taps could easily destroy this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul may make E think twice about trying to make the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: VPs*|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: excellent!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board: thanks to operator (Karen?) and earlier commentators David Burn and Ben Green|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@d was gf checkback|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio shaking her head when dummy came down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here -1 (how to get @SQ SD:)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Egypt-Israel  USA2-Italy  Brazil-USA1   all BB on voice tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with @c cue they might...|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@H showed 4 @hs, did not deny 3 @ss|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  E will need to knock out the A of @cs first|pg||
nt|andyv:  then a 4th spade by S will set up a 2nd @h trick on the upper cut|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: indeed if no @D now still makes 4@S    IF IF IF:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: may be 13 imp's ...... ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA @DA @DK can as well|pg||
nt|alunand14: Romanski lead with @S 7:(|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|rhelle: that's more like it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|rhelle: trumps, Pony ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: Willard worried about @D losers after the  non-descript opening from Palmer|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|rhelle: the Q is a good card. If East ruffs @cs, the 2nd is with a trump winner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  defense too friendly here...E will get off going down one|pg||
nt|hedyg:  yes she should have corrected to @s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 50 mins approx|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzpb: bye all, the next match starts in 1 hour|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: wonder if NS knew 4@D was length rather than shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty, see you!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good defense play by Japan|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: ok 49-39 congrats Indonesia|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks all...........|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks Jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: selamat siang semua disana|pg||
nt|alunand14: selamat pagi di Veldhoven :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sudah malam:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok sore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at my table  Muller forgoe opening strong 1@C and bought hand at 4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...have fun the rest of this bermuda bowl.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Venice Cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: venice cup this table :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|hedyg:  4@s is the correct contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: and so ends day 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everyone  3 more matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1 down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: probably expecting that bessis bid 2@s if she wanted to know 3-card support|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if she throws E in now there is an endplay to make the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg:  but no way she can see that|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i think 2@d followed by 3NT surely shows 5@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg:  else she could have bid 3NT directly|pg||
nt|tomi2: what else can she now play for? a revoke?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  how can she know that @cs are blocked?|pg||
nt|tomi2: she can hope for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but no defender will have bared the @sK|pg||
nt|ahalim: drop @SK singleton ??|pg||
nt|hedyg:  it is a miracle but only miracle can save her for sure|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|glen: thanks all, was fun :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: running score shows final is 25-22 India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: but South makes this hard, by taking the @h Ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: if she takes the King, North will know to play another trump|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpb: cy|pg||
nt|star6ija: good bye all see yot tomorrow|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|nt|rhelle: well done Pony|pg||
nt|rhelle: ok, thx all|pg||
nt|rhelle: bye!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thanks, see you at 16.45 hours|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bye for now, tx Rob|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: both defenders discarded spades, so playing the ace would only worf if clubs are blocked and one defender manged to see this and bared the ace|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c9|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|pc|sA|nt|hedyg:  wd Catherine|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as usual|pg||
nt|hedyg:  ty all :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: she is not playing this game for the first time, well done :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio asking why Bessis didn't bid 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Bessis replying that she thought she showed them this way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio said something about 4333 and values|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the other room still have to play 3 or 4 boards, i leave this room open until they finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: for if they have a problem with loading the boards, they can re-enter by connecting to this room without losing the scores|pg||
