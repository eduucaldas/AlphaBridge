mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this is a feisty auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  3!n or 5@d look really cold|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|henryb:  Schwartz-Finkel play 2/1 with many special agreements in various auctions|pg||
nt|henryb:  Vivaldi-Mosca also play fairly straightforward methods but unusual 2-bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  3!n is better|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|jaapfr: a safe 6@H save for ew with 6@HX-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I expect Schwartz will bid 4@s and probably play there|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: south being cautious|pg||
nt|roswolf: rightly so|pg||

nt|roswolf: this will be quick i hope|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jaapfr: the crux here is how can EW enter the bidding with their @C@H fits (almost impoossible)|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 1, which is actually a good save against a making 4@h for N-S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hlortz: was mosca's pass over 4@S forcing?  maybe|pg||
nt|3for3: levin doesnt want arnim in to play 2 more rounds of trump|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S failed in open room...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: this is where players err -south knows no defence works therefore play quickly and conservr mental energy - there is a lot of bridge left to be played|pg||

mb|1S|nt|3for3: i expect 3@S/P/P/3NT to be very common on this hand|pg||
nt|3for3: east could double but..|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmmmmmm another 4@s this time for n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand. so many options.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|henryb:  North may raise 2@h to 3|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W make 6@h unless N-S negotiate a @c ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@H makeable and 6@S by NS a good save.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jaapfr: best to pass as E but tough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: best=best result|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well if 4@C IS A CUE IN THEIR SYSTEM I WOULD BID IT|pg||
nt|roswolf: but many play it as a big 2 suiter even in this type of sequence|pg||
nt|henryb:  N-S, I think, might make 4@s or 5@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They make 5@S, max.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: now 3nt in right hand whilst @C lead very unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: that will still lead to 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3: I'd lead a club here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: also if 2@S would be a wjs - a slam try is indicated|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H clearly slamming|pg||
nt|roswolf: noryth signs off with his load of trash|pg||
nt|roswolf: SHOULD sign off|pg||
nt|henryb:  or four in a "death wish|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3? that's for wimps lol a bold 4!|pg||
nt|3for3: but a spade could have easily been right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaapfr: 3nt now imo|pg||
nt|hlortz: well all that wasted @D stuff a bit unlucky but pressing for game not vul seems 'optimistic'|pg||
nt|henryb:  wimpishness has a lot so say for itself: if you had to choose between 2@h and 4@h, 2@h would be most people's choice on the N-S cards :)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|grebrof: the scores are not updated yet http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: thinnish 3nt bid and made in the other room|pg||
nt|hlortz: bidding many close games does put pressure on the defense which sometimes slips|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: now all the more diff ...even impossible|pg||
nt|roswolf: expect the same here it is a vul game |pg||

nt|roswolf: and again using up more mental energy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible - what is he thinking about - the number of angels you can get on a pinhead!?|pg||
nt|henryb:  meanwhile you sell several 6-7 imp losses to gain one 10 imp or 6 imp gain. not a good tradeoff, imo|pg||
nt|henryb:  close whether to respond 1@h or pass. I would pass. but if he bids 1@h, as he did, partner will raise to 4.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: an ace and J, I would respond.|pg||
nt|henryb:  not an easy hand to play. but cards lie favorably|pg||

pc|c8|nt|grebrof: "the Viking club" played by Grøtheim and Tundal is probably the most famous system from Norway, but still few players in Norway actually play it|pg||

nt|szalay: these cards better, but slam is harder|pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: This board is again dangerous, 6@d is a good contract but from north hand|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: Sabine writing about 2 clubs|pg||
nt|3for3: the dreaded 10-12 nt...makes life tough on the opps..|pg||
nt|3for3: most play that double of 2@C here is a good hand...says nothing about clubs.|pg||
nt|3for3: Like she had penalty doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: you need real methods with this range of nt,  and defending it |pg||
mb|1H|an| |nt|grebrof: S does have a huge hand + its not pretty bidding a suit topped by the JT|pg||
nt|alpagavp: quasi impossible to reach|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s might get to 6@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  a good slam well reached by the germans in the other room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: make 7, has to ruff 2 D on the table as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i think Levin wrote as if i had doubled 1nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: but this is the Venice Cup,  so all systems "on"  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mikael_w: yes, almost posible to beat 3 NT if dec makes alot of missguess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|grebrof: so it should be possible to copy this|pg||
nt|nkgupt: any slam played by N will be cold (not 6@h/@c) :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: and if we play 6@d for south hand the only lead that beats the contract is @c no?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would bid 1N as West, but it is very unclear|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Double would be reasonable|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: which doesnt have much play even on a non spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2NT (Jacoby) or 4@D?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure what version of Jacoby the Americans play|pg||
nt|henryb:  Much too good for 4@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@C short and 3@D short.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: W not into bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the best is to play 6NT from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H shows a smattering of hcp i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: no 2@H is preference for weak with both majors|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: Arnim writing a lot|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|nkgupt: i have seen many experts rebid 2@d on such hands and find it diff to catch up later|pg||
nt|alpagavp: 17 HCP 3 aces and 5/5 is enough to bid 3@d no?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: well is wat i said ....a good 3@d bid|pg||
nt|alpagavp: :)|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Cronier is looking at her @c and might think to play 6NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah 2@C = A MULTI|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3@H 2@S 1@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  someone misbid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with the splinter coming into play 6@H ensured. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: sabine tells redouble would show 4sp|pg||
nt|sybarra: just think what "War and Peace" would look like on tiny little pages  |pg||
nt|sybarra: (suggested by a spec)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: Levin asked if Sabine had nothing she is pretended to pass over 2d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: i dont know what intentions had Sabine when saying 2 clubs seeing her hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: just claim 3nt+1:)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|alpagavp: well done|pg||
nt|mikael_w: this board would be REALLY intresting playwise in pairs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: 2@s shows the @c suit I am told - thank you|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think she was going to pass anything Arnim bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: she has a 5 count opposite 10-12,  so she knows opps have more points|pg||
nt|sybarra: she was in mucking it up |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: yes, i guess she would, doesnt seem to be other option, would have played in a 3 3 fit :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep  my guess also |pg||
nt|sybarra: from her hand opps likely to have game anywhere |pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: that is one game swing (vul) |pg||
nt|3for3: i predict no big swing here...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: that opening seems desperate|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  N-S apparently play "Negative free bids" so North has to start with double on any good hand|pg||
mb|d!|nt|szalay: 4@s now|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here we go. and I am sorry I cant tell the meaning of the bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: so nt range varies as to vulnerability we see |pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: yuck i hate this kind of auction|pg||
nt|szalay: gotta go, thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: me neither...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: little bit unsure what went wrong for Sweden at board 26, but they were unable to copy the slam bid at this table by England - to my suprice I must say|pg||
nt|grebrof: even surprise|pg||
nt|mikael_w: the most intresting so far woulb be W choise to pass the hole way|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@d acctually would make!|pg||
nt|henryb:  this should be 2 down, I think|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: fielders choice  declarer has only a few tricks|pg||
nt|hlortz: good save|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|bobh1: i guess this is the last board of the match|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: wlc|pg||
nt|alpagavp: Again 11 for France. neve won 3NT|pg||
nt|mikael_w: well, here has been alot of relä-bids and finaly they will play the same contract as everybody els :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|grebrof: nice layout in @hs for NS here  10 easy tricks should be made here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: trumps 2-2 too, so|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be an easy make.|pg||
nt|3for3: well, 10-12 at unfavorable is pretty loony, imo.  No offense to those who do so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: he could have ducked the @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes with certain dbles you could go for 800 or so |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: almost none playing 12-14 vul, 10-12 would be too much|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|grebrof: and the obvious @h-switch comes|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: couple of imps for the cushion |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mikael_w: would be intrested to see how E/W do in @h. But there is a big risk it will end up in a bloodbatch when the trumphs starts to thin out|pg||

nt|vugraphzpd: this is the last board of the set... hope you enjoyed..|pg||
nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our operator, Vincent. Great Job! Our appreciation to all the organisers for bringing this festival of bridge to our screens. ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: Many thanks to you, the specs, for your company and perceptive comments. |pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Danny always a pleasure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Felipe,  great job   |pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: big club|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thanks to all of the specs for your great comments,   lots of fun |pg||
mb|1H|nt|bobh1: y thx harold|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks likely|pg||
nt|hlortz: and its 3:35am here in seattle so i'm off to bed. enjoyable comments and some action hads|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D multi overcall?|pg||
nt|sybarra: something special |pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: ty! lets see if we get to 100 imps on this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: I think mainly your P has to be able to dbl/bid 1nt or so if a balancing with those 10hp should be right - but ok|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bobh1: on 13, where NS had a shapely 11 opposite 8, they did bid 4@H in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@h is 5+@h, 5+ second suit, less than opening strength|pg||
nt|hlortz: hands that n key is nnnnnnnnnnnnnnot going to behave :)|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3C|nt|bobh1: and lost 5 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpd: see you all tomorrow for the next matches, starting at 10.30 hours|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may use the "multi overcall" vs a big club system |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am guessing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpd: I think they are yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: difficult auction for n/s to get into, but then do they really want to be "in" |pg||
mb|p|nt|alpagavp: Last board|pg||
nt|alpagavp: the results are here|pg||
nt|alpagavp: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobh1: this looks like a good save for NS|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like down 1, no tragedy when 4@d makes E-W|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: power bidding|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|grebrof: 4 @s must be better than this|pg||
nt|3for3: meyers cant be sad defending with 6 trump is always fun|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Sabine passes,   might have been -2 and tied match?|pg||
nt|3for3: i think it would have been better than that for ew.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hlortz: even better 3n makes ew also lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D can make except for super defence, @CA and small @S.:)|pg||
nt|projekt1: again a possibility for phantastic defence : @cA -10, low @s -  @c ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: EW have a @S game|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2N made it awkward for them to find it|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|grebrof: as predicted, the swedish kids at the other table werent fooled into bidding 3nt on board 30 - with a luckyer layout it would make, but streching at nonvul rarely wins you ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: teammatches|pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: unfortunately, the lead makes the contract for NS|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: wow-wd.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: to me this is a very odd line|pg||
nt|roswolf: and will cost an imp|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra:  brazil made 2 sp against usa |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx feliipe for info |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|grebrof: as pointed out by kib - the lead was normal and difficult for E |pg||
pc|cK|nt|bobh1: S's hand is borderline for 2N...it's a little too good, if anything|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he decided to go with the colors and bid it out|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzpd: bbye all, thanks for wtaching..|pg||
