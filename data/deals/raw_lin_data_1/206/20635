mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||

nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: np Traiian|pg||

nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but with Qx@S .. in vuln..|pg||
nt|desinka: just my thought|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree 2@D seems beter with this hand |pg||
nt|desinka: now...hard contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: some discussion in Swedish, and after that sorry from Fredin|pg||
nt|panosk: hats off to Nystrom for his fighting spirit|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: and with a diamond fit you may keep the opponents out of the bidding ... as here|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||
nt|desinka: Hey, Momchil@h|pg||
nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brasil strugling to get to the first 8|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|pawel90:  nie poprawiam Rysiu :) - chyba sie nie zrozumielismy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: decyzja Jassema ca³kowicie zrozumia³a|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie bardzo tanio|pg||
nt|lechcold: a wist @D2 to hazard straszliwy|pg||
nt|lml: bit of action here.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pawel90:  my tu gadu-gadu, a tu 3BA, na oko swoje|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass is an often underestimated bid...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I'm told NS play mini 1N opening 1st and 2nd seat fav|pg||
nt|panosk: or maybe it will|pg||
nt|panosk: ?|pg||
nt|panosk: NS need to get a heart as well to defeat|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 4@Sx|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as long as defence does not play a 4th heart this may go down|pg||
nt|jbgood: 9-12, yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
nt|pawel90:  4@s chyba bez trzech, ale trzeba kiera trafiÄ|pg||
nt|lechcold: raczej bez 4 na promocji @S9, ale obrona zb³¹dzi³a|pg||
nt|antoniz: stoj¹cy As kier to 9-ta lewa|pg||
nt|lechcold: jest szansa na -500 i 3 impy zysku|pg||
nt|xenya: it would seem 4@C is about as good as 4@S here|pg||
nt|lml: well 4@S has one big advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 4@c has another - @d lead gives 2 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|lml: and here they pushed north-south too high|pg||

mb|1N|an|11-16|mb|p|nt|vugraphznu: the 1@s opening more difficult for North than 1@D|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: 3N in the other room not really the right contract, but west expected a real @d-stop in south|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: so he didn't pick up all 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he didn't lead a top @D that asked for count or unblock??|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: he led @dK, but switched @s10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe @DK asked for attitude   otherwise  there will be long discussion after the match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old days  only @DA asked for count/unblock   now  you have to check opponent's convention card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i strongest lead of King is most prevalent now|pg||

nt|lml: USA1 is winning the breakage so far|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would be 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|jbgood: S contemplating some slam invite? |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: what bid do you like by south?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will end in 4@h making probably|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym razem 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  plus 1 even |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
nt|alnanda: there is no difficulty reaching 4@h, i think..|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|vugraphznu: chagas now catching up as well|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|an|forcing|nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
nt|vbman: brave 4sp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: encouraged by his 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vbman: pard who is short in hearts must have sp support|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: pass = forcing, but  X would show interest in 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 1@C .... i wouldn't have found it  [but would have opened 2@S :)]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in some circles that is called a Cokin DBL |pg||
nt|vugraphznu: south already bid 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: but i cannot enter, because the mouse clicking would give information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since opening bid so descriptive, the 4@H bid was wide range |pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|an|!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's why they use the DBL as Dennis described|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wants to defend if responder bid game on HCP  want to save if distributional|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: interesting whether Verhees's DBL shows interest in 5@h again or is just penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: he circles his previous explanation (x = interest in 5@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought  Cokin only applied to Opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vbman: confirms cl void|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: strange choice with 2542|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: vProoijen saying he had no defense|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: maybe worried no defense with @HAK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opposite length|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not any more -the early club play usually indicates a singleton - else declarer would try to find out more before guessing club|pg||
nt|lml: so 2NT goes doen 2 both ways|pg||
nt|xenya: just 12 imps -- well played by Stansby|pg||
nt|lml: curious hand says oscar the owl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  starnge bidding tho|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||

nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: seldom right for a team to play 2NT in both directions|pg||
nt|jbgood: they also use 2@d for the real garbage|pg||
nt|panosk: NS have a minor slam EW will compete |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: is he thinking for 6 go to 7 or just pass?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: sure to hear 5D now|pg||
nt|ady: Italians got to 5@D   and guessed the J@S   after the same take-out double from south|pg||
nt|ady: thx    good morning all|pg||
nt|panosk: also clubs beter in case a club ruff |pg||
nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: with 33 HCP most pairs should reach a slam somewhere|pg||

nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||
nt|panosk: club ruff if in diamonds that is|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||

nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||

nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
pc|s2|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||

pc|h3|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  as you can see @d back not best defence|pg||
nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
pc|hT|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||

nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
nt|lml: declarer in 4@H makes an easy 5 |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: trying to get some time back|pg||
nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: they bid spades which was not the best slam|pg||
nt|lml: but the suit broke|pg||
nt|antoniz: Pawe³ to normalny kontrakt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: well done |pg||

nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: fleisher showing a 12-14 hand with four spades, I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For NS 3 NT can make.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 again sorry to say but a very good result for the boys|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
mb|d|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|2H|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||

nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||

nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||

nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||

mb|4S|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||

nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||

nt|olegario: ohoh now :) too high up again|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||

pc|dK|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||
nt|lml: I like a trump lead and so does South!|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reasonable action by Stansby but it worked out badly|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|leao:  300|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: defence just has trump tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||

nt|stoffers: Got to go, thx all and see you :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True Viking attitude :-)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry five|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs dont break he has 9 if the diamond finesse is on - nothing works|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||

nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||

nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: exactly what he said when the first trick was over :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Let there be light|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and not dull borads|pg||
nt|skaftij:  boards|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 170 nie przysz³o nam do g³owy)|pg||
nt|lml: south hope he could make it 3 hearts and 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is a possible call with that south hand|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Henri--congrtas for France reaching the Rugby Finals|pg||
nt|ehsana: $S on fro N/S|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
nt|skaftij:  rathe heavy 3@s|pg||
nt|lml: but of course he couldnt|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess we are the speed table today |pg||
nt|leao:  board 24 coming up at the other table|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2H|nt|lechcold: 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c=6-9hcp 4@ss|pg||
nt|leao:  minus 11 for brasil, as predicted|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West asks about the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 20/25 min offcial|pg||
nt|leao:  4@s looks cold for NS as cards lay|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
pc|h2|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west claims|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||

nt|lml: this should make the endplay obvious|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: well done by North but ducking club jack was VERY anti percentage|pg||
nt|panosk: actually trying to discard hearts from dummy and ruff his heart loser in hand|pg||
nt|panosk: *from hand|pg||
nt|panosk: also found out that spades arent 3-3 |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|antoniz: oby tak skutecznie jak ze Szwecj¹ do tej pory:)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: Isreal in 6@S in previous gained them a hefty 13 imps , new leader|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wild card: now his only hope is for west to have only 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: played for K@C with south when north played low   and king to come down in 3|pg||
nt|panosk: if N had K@D cud have made |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or jack|pg||
nt|panosk: well not really if N ducked heart ruff decl wud have to play diamonds himself|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: so who wants to be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pachtman did wait for it - he just claimed 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: double squeeze now|pg||
nt|ady: north has to keep a top club  and south has to keep heart  so 3rd diamond is a trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk: i learn as i go :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|mc|10|nt|wild card: well done, smelled his chance to make|pg||

nt|yuval10: note how both W's answered with only 1 point over 1@c|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 imps to Isreal for not quitting desperate contract|pg||

mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: [sorry  or unbal 5+@C 15+ HCP]   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria need the points much more than Israel who were 3rd over night|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: not mentioning @h Kxx, always a small problem to hold Hxx in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  making here n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: if you cancell out 2 slams one gained and one lost for each team the vast majority of imps were scored by part scores|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
mb|4H|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
nt|leao:  NS have 4@s|pg||
nt|leao:  and EW do not have 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||

nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
pc|s6|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||

nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||

nt|leao:  rite... always -2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: he needed to float @S to make  but hard to picture Martel's shape|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart  then a@C and a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: 10 tricks claimed very shortly |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  good sacrifice|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawie na jedno wychodzi:)|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make and be flat|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thats true but then again it depends were you stand |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even I could make this one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: do you like bypassing diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it did work to get them a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lead is asked @d 6|pg||
nt|athene: it's definitely not a bad 15 count|pg||
nt|wild card: I guess he'll lead Q of @c|pg||
nt|ady: need A@D right     predictably both rooms in game|pg||
nt|yuval10: running scores :  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q alright but @D:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
nt|leao:  if i can, u surely can :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznv: i do :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would like to see auction after  P-1N[9-12]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when you have to open 1 heart you hold your breath |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30, Lauria in 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|ady: happy A@S with west    split aces  hopefully now|pg||
nt|panosk: just a diamond ruff in dummy needed here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
pc|cT|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||
nt|boedhy:  his @h are too good so no problems indeed|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: he still has nine tricks though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes drijver will probably get a @h trick at the end|pg||
nt|leao:  hell have to time it carefully|pg||
nt|leao:  but miguel is a careful player :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: it appears|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|leao:  see?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: spectator suggests and I agree - facing a passed partner North should open 4H|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: trumps splitting   so ok     not the greatest game|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: now he can happily crossruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: and probably now has full count on hand |pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: he cant lose more than 2 hearts |pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|lml: so good line for the contract|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of te session    thx Victor   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|yuval10: heading to the last board|pg||
nt|lml: nice result for north south ... lets see how Pachtman-Ginossar handle it|pg||
nt|panosk: that is our last board for this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|1H|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
mb|d|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||

nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||

nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||

nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
