nt|xenya: some action here|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to tell where all that will end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I will enter the bids 2 and 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so that the players have no chance to know who might be fast or slow at the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|ady: with such a big fit might get pverboard|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Jan on vugraph|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usa2 tied for 2nd, sweden 9th and needing to move up to qualify for KO stage|pg||

nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
mb|d|nt|lechcold: wa¿ny mecz z konkurentem do awansu i medalu(?)|pg||
nt|xenya: but he opted for a natural bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|vugraphznv: hi all - and wlc to Veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
mb|4H|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South is still a junior, don't know his age exactly|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lechcold: M-J graj¹ silnym treflem przed parti¹, WJ po partii|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie trudno wybroniæ siê mniej ni¿ bez 3|pg||
nt|lml: so both north-south's are feeling pretty good about their start|pg||

nt|jbgood: the EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||

pc|d8|nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||

nt|olegario: this should be a flat hand, nothing exciting expected|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if they score heart ruff then he has pitch for spade loser on fourth heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer accepts 11 tricks // I dont think he should have|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was my fault...so you can blame me :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yet more action on this one|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not a terrible contract but it wont make here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|stoffers: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C probably can't either|pg||
nt|lml: well double dummy you could draw one trump|pg||
nt|lml: and ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|xenya: i think both contracts are makeable, DD |pg||
nt|panosk: interesting board competition wise|pg||
nt|desinka: 2@D overcall is not that bad..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes i was mistaken 5@C always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  2+@C any bal hand (without 5M)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 1@H was a bid of convenience for West|pg||
nt|lechcold: nasi w 3N s¹ tutaj|pg||
nt|olegario: a double is to come soon|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||

nt|ady: n/s with balance of strength not in auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||
nt|stoffers: iceland needs some wp's here to hang in there: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H|pg||
nt|desinka: now |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: np Traiian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@d was non-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and E had an easy pass|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but with Qx@S .. in vuln..|pg||
nt|desinka: just my thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or this one> http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Another straight forward auction|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree 2@D seems beter with this hand |pg||
nt|desinka: now...hard contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has 6 top tricks needs to develop 1 more|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to infer that East can have this hand from EW Convention card|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: does 1@h show a 4 card suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes, was the answer, normally|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mam podpowied, ¿e w meczu gra 6 finalistów fina³u M juniorów w Australii parê lat temu - 4 Amerykanie oraz Buras i Kalita|pg||
nt|olegario: it seems he is not going to have any trouble|pg||
nt|olegario: very risky in this auction mainly being vul|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is not the correct board|pg||
nt|olegario: but I suspect some would have doubled in between bids|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: brd 18 on my screen not the same with brd 18 they are playing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well it was interesting wasn't it :-)|pg||
nt|olegario: what should be a flat 2@h may become a bit better now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Seems OK in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director here checking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The cards shown here bd 18 do not match the cards that the players hold|pg||
nt|skaftij:  New kibs are puzzled, and so were we|pg||
nt|barbyh: hi all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: 2 black aces looks the only likely losers|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Hello Barbara wlc :-)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: but this, i'm almost certain, won't make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a 2nt bid as at the other table would have helped a lot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: wyniki live: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|odysseus69: routine game - no issues - Bulgarians playing strong club or maybe Polish club- will find out later|pg||
nt|desinka: hard to stop in 3@D anyway with those bids|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|athene: east's double obviously says "i want to bid 3@H, but i am doubling just in case you happen to have a big club stack,  so you can pass"|pg||

mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: north has a pretty obvious 4@S bid, i would have said|pg||
nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||

nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||

nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they'll win it there probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: folks, try to analyze like the players, not as double dummy :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they end up in their best fit with good controled bidding it seems. |pg||
nt|andersk: Hi |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi Anders|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: of course a double by north-south would have worked well but that was hard to do|pg||
nt|ady: tht there may be a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: decyzja Jassema ca³kowicie zrozumia³a|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie bardzo tanio|pg||
nt|lechcold: a wist @D2 to hazard straszliwy|pg||
nt|lml: bit of action here.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in Usa 2 vs Bulgaria board 2.. 1NT is being played by West!|pg||
nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|pawel90:  my tu gadu-gadu, a tu 3BA, na oko swoje|pg||
nt|jbgood: pass is an often underestimated bid...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I'm told NS play mini 1N opening 1st and 2nd seat fav|pg||
nt|panosk: or maybe it will|pg||
nt|panosk: ?|pg||
nt|panosk: NS need to get a heart as well to defeat|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: Apparently they were not on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|ady: diamond will be from east   but likely|pg||
nt|ady: bad|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 4@Sx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: as long as defence does not play a 4th heart this may go down|pg||
nt|jbgood: 9-12, yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
nt|pawel90:  4@s chyba bez trzech, ale trzeba kiera trafiÄ|pg||
nt|lechcold: raczej bez 4 na promocji @S9, ale obrona zb³¹dzi³a|pg||

nt|lml: well 4@S has one big advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and 4@c has another - @d lead gives 2 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: nice play|pg||
nt|lml: no peeking!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||

mb|1S|an|3!S|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||

nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||

nt|ahollan1: or was it USA lost 10|pg||

nt|yuval10: if you say the name it'd probably turn into a best-seller in a moment :)|pg||
nt|bt: grue had a brain melt in 6@C doubled and lall gave up a second spade finesse, thanks|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andersk: no chanse to set now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|alnanda: i think 2@c is drury|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi-madala play quite an active game so i would not be surprised if bocchi bids 5@C in that same position|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|kemperg: seeing bears on the road|pg||
nt|lechcold: atak atutowy spod trzeciej dziesi¹tki winien zasugerowaæ Martensowi, ¿e w innych kolorach Upmark ma niewygodne do wistu konfiguracje|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak mi sie wydaje|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not any more -the early club play usually indicates a singleton - else declarer would try to find out more before guessing club|pg||
nt|lml: so 2NT goes doen 2 both ways|pg||
nt|xenya: just 12 imps -- well played by Stansby|pg||
nt|lml: curious hand says oscar the owl|pg||
nt|boedhy:  starnge bidding tho|pg||
nt|ady: might make 4@S on last hand   but unlikely contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thought the 4-1 was too much but the @h lead helped a lot|pg||
nt|boedhy:  just loosing two imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now everyone has got the heat up -- also the operator :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: preetty amazing to hold it to -2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now we hope to calm down a little |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h quickly beaten on a @s ruff in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: 5@C bid would win 4 imps and maybe more if EW will bid to the 5 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|bt: on a heart lead he has some work to do|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when you suit is running bid 3nt, dont worry much about stoppers or where 9th trick will come from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I just love watching these competitive auctions, with world class players making the decisions.|pg||
nt|bt: i assume decl got a diamond lead at the other table here and gave up on the heart finesse, lall doesnt believe much in finesses we already know|pg||
nt|brolucius: It doesn't actually improve my own success at such decisions, but I kid myself that it does.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphznv: 2@s+5@ss+4@cs|pg||

nt|kemperg: should fear a ruff|pg||
nt|wild card: or 4/1 with the 4card with the 3 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: seldom right for a team to play 2NT in both directions|pg||
nt|jbgood: they also use 2@d for the real garbage|pg||
nt|panosk: NS have a minor slam EW will compete |pg||
nt|bt: 4@S might have worked better here, but 1@S is normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is the modern style to overcall 1@S rather than 4@S.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||

nt|oosmanb: moderately straight forward hands so far, and almost all the tables playing v fast|pg||
mb|d|nt|panosk: is he thinking for 6 go to 7 or just pass?|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double shows some spade support (or a doubleton honor) but denies the values to bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and theres always the guilty pleasure in seeing others go wrong - gives us hope :)|pg||
nt|bt: now fallenius should get diamonds in there to involve partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a great fit for both red suits, as you see.|pg||
nt|bt: luckily for sweden fallenius would normally, only god knows what fredin would do with that hand|pg||
nt|bt: not even god actually|pg||
nt|bt: fredin has a great mind but for us mortals its hard to understand|pg||

nt|boedhy:  2NT looks natural tho and that is imo strange but absolutely Brink like....|pg||
nt|ady: request for link  for scores please|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: duboin giving his partner quite a bit of leeway for 2@C at favourable|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 2@H is a fine contract|pg||
nt|lml: lots of tricks here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 2/3@S|pg||

mb|d|nt|lml: more than 13|pg||

nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||

nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||

nt|ady: e/w taken the non vul save|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you were right :)|pg||
nt|bt: you have to make your mind up if you want to involve partner or do guesswork, sometimes informative bids helps opponents also|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: Martel's pass shows equal length in the majors |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 3@H got it in the OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, North doubled 5@d and South pulled to 5 @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||

nt|fabsayc: can someone please give me the running scores link|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||

nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|jtr: Nice game to reach|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: that's true|pg||
nt|udo: north discarded all hie entries to @HJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: think they have free drinks anyhow :)|pg||
nt|udo: otherwise would hve been -4|pg||
nt|stoffers: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|stoffers: F5 for refreshing|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another fast one|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe the will get an early dinner today:)|pg||
nt|bt: i get lots of messages but i cant comment on all, but i try :-)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  1     ITALY  3582   NETHERLANDS 342    USA 2 3424   ISRAEL 314.35   USA 1 310.56   ICELAND 308.57   NEW ZEALAND 2998   CHINA 295.5|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: they play 14-16 I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|jbgood: Bermuda Bowl running scores: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a good idea to bid NT as soon as possible with a balanced hand. Here North rebids 1NT to show 11-14.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
nt|hlortz: good result ew in OR here |pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when opponents have the ranking suit, show your second suit, when they dont is less important|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
nt|lechcold: 11 lew jeli rozegramy kara przed kierami (konieczne z uwagi na blokadê kar)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only problem is if somebody has 5@s so will hold up once|pg||

nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  still not working on my mac..|pg||
nt|brolucius: The team cominb 1st can choose their opponents from those 5-8. The team coming second has the next choice, etc...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boedhy:  but with the @h 4-1 you better not be in 3..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I thought that would be flat at all 60+ tables|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with some restrictions, top four teams get to select their opponents from the other four|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lechcold: 12 sry:)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bt: this is a soft result by ew but bidding game and making it was not in the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone post the web-address for the ruinning scores?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
pc|c6|nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
nt|lechcold: jak mi siê zdaje, Kalita móg³ po³o¿yæ graj¹c kiera w lewie drugiej!! to dlatego, ¿e N mia³ za mocne kiery:)) ale to by³oby zagranie dla nadcz³owieka|pg||

nt|bt: we have 5 teams battling for last two spots|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
pc|d2|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he claimed down 1 , saying sorry for misplaying @D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: for now i dont say anything...|pg||
nt|stoffers: oh, wrong claim|pg||
nt|stoffers: correct|pg||
nt|boedhy:  9 tricks at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that site works folks so use it instead of the official|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d7|nt|ady: spade favourate now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  probably same result at the other table....Muller playing?|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: this should be a bidding contast for NS|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S!|an|preempt|nt|jbennet: a invitational sequence to 3NT. North had majority of the outstanding cards. = Risk is huge that a agressive lead costs a vital trick|pg||

mb|5S!|mb|p|mb|5N|an|0544 says Grue|mb|p|mb|7C|nt|oosmanb: excellent bid by Justin, the acelessness mightve subdued some of us (hint: me)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: was about to say there's a danger here...|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4sp good bid ; should pinpoint a sort of autosplinter telling north "we have a trump suit"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and Grue agrees that its very unlikely that his pd has NO aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yuval10: the 5-1 @h distribution will deem the contract even without a @d lead, it seem|pg||
nt|jtr: Escaped the lead|pg||
nt|jbennet: 7 clubs a wild gamble. |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Bertheau probably pressing the panic button right about now|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  as you can see @d back not best defence|pg||
nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H|pg||
nt|andersk: Falleinus probably tried to show equal length  majors, and passed 4 @H and Fredin probably took it as somethin else|pg||
nt|bt: for the british isles i can inform there is a rugby WC ... :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: This site allows you to look at the leaderboard in all three events (links at the bottom of the page:    http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bt: not that u guys care about that|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
nt|bt: anyway i think lall bid way too much at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
mb|5C|nt|lechcold: silny trefl u Szwedów..dalej pewnie masa sztucznoci, których nie znam:(|pg||

nt|lechcold: kierowy by³by morderczy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  NS can make 3@c tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You can see the other auction by putting your cursor over the Open Room result.|pg||
nt|bt: unless their firm agreement is that 5NT in all auctions is "pick a slam"|pg||
mb|6C|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
nt|bt: anyway the ns auction at the other table was one of those toughies and they failed, it is good for my team so i am happy|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||

nt|oosmanb: As demonstrated, Grue-Lall have a very aggressive opening style|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And it works for them|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: 2@h explained by W as "exactly 4@hs and a longer minor"|pg||
nt|yuval10: so we can expect 2NT from him now|pg||
nt|vugraphznu: and by E to N as "5@h5@s 10-15|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: I cant see exactly what Duboin wrote|pg||
nt|brolucius: The young USA2 team is some 30 VPs ahead of USA1.|pg||
nt|bt: sweden might play 3@C in both rooms here|pg||
nt|bt: which is generally a bad concept|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: and the italians don't like 1NT with a 5-card major, for some reason|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||

mb|3D|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||

nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||

nt|oosmanb: but he might try to find J@S instead of playing on @h 3-3, lets see|pg||
nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||
nt|bt: looks like a nice game but on a diamond lead it gets difficult, south is under a lot of pressure though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra: hoi Ruud and all |pg||
nt|boedhy:  hoping to get off for 2 down or so..|pg||
nt|brolucius: This affected the draw for the KO-stage and in fact allowed England to progress to the final.|pg||
nt|bt: fredin is famous for leading aces against 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||

nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||

nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: all four players now leave the room |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going somewhere for themselves|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so I am all on my own|pg||
nt|yuval10: can you fix the board so that will enable 4@s to make here?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Everything has a price|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flat board :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  the pass over 2H probably denied 3 card support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow...unusual 400 in the open room|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is the link to the E/W convention card. (Many thanks to the excellent ECATS site).|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also they might just bid 1NT - 2@H; 2@S pass in the other room|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3N bez biletu w PO:(|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Back with more action|pg||
nt|leao:  scoresheet must look pretty depressing at the table from the brazilians perspective...|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Brink have a gadget here?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looks liks 6@s|pg||
nt|bt: iceland is getting closer to the struggle for 8th spot, and usa1 might if they drop some more to NZ|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: not automatic to reach the game with that 7 facing 17|pg||
nt|lml: looks like 3@S ... lets see|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  I believe either 1 suited in clubs   are clubs and a major?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ady: another flatish hand   part score|pg||
nt|yuval10: Gyorgy sazaly, in an earlier match, suggested that the US teams will be tougher to beat during the KO team, also the Italian one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time a max NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will he have visions of that after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|boedhy:  he should if he hears a fit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 1NT will help them win auction in 2@H probably|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths pass over 1NT in OR is a matter of style, lots of points but no suit to attack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S substantially better played by south|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kemperg: Pakistani wont feel well :(|pg||

nt|ady: probaly 1NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Zack will want to become invisible - uncharacteristic careless play|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi leao:) |pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S is not a silly contract but the cards lie unluckily for N/S.|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table i think the bids were normal until north bid 4@S, @HQx is really bad on that auction|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||

nt|oosmanb: dont know if 2@S makes for NS but its close |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a w RP?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  doubleton @c helps but the good @d arent that much help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. The 5th trump is worth a couple of points, to compensate.|pg||
nt|brolucius: My comments are struggling to make it to the Netherlands, appearing after a time-delay of a few seconds. Perhaps someone is censoring them on the way.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: still, he has such a nice hand, i think he SHOULD go past game|pg||

nt|olegario: Hello all, Thank you leao! olegario from Belo Horizonte, Brazil|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will W bid spades? or diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: north considering playing the king|pg||
nt|bt: we have the same contract here, east will lead @HA and west discourage, then diamond shift|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||

nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: pretty clear to make 3 except if stansby gives a trick away on a diamond lead for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jbgood: the queen of spades was lead in the OR - and the slam made|pg||
nt|boedhy:  some sort of maximum now |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they found a 44 fit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW CC does not reveal their escape methods|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ryskiel_: grali 1 BA - 3 BA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly as Lars predicted.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, East should see that it is the main chance of beating the contract (if no trump trick is available). |pg||
nt|bt: every now and then i find a diamond in the rough, right?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lechcold: 3 by³o szwole¿erskie:)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: indeed they did'|pg||

nt|pawel90:  raczej sami bÄdziemy wistowaÄ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can he make it?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1 NT showed 14-16 so W could have a minor jack |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in hand now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South has 2 entries to dummy in @c so will play towards @sAJ since East is known to have @SKQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and back on the table they go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he does not know te @c layout yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards in hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||

nt|bt: now some people can bid 2@S strong on that hand, wouldnt that be nice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In NT it is a 5-or-7 hand, depending on whether the clubs come in. 7@S much better, because you can establish the clubs against a 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a very biddable grand slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H now would suggest diamond support, because he is a passed hand.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||

nt|yuval10: me too Linda, those are very strong 2 teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: as I said earlier -- they were being beaten heavily in the test match |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores > http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is usually the case. 4@D does not show more than 4@S. It shows one of the reasons WHY you are worth 4@S. |pg||
nt|bt: if north bids 5@D it would have been tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
mb|5H|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: after the lead declarer claims making 5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
mb|5N|nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
nt|bt: 5nt then 7@S looks easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now after all the key cards are known 5NT will invite a grand and West will accept with those clubs.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
nt|lechcold: karach:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - looks as if 2@h was gf...|pg||
nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|pawel90:  trzeba karo trafiÄ|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karko i super|pg||
nt|leao:  not a chance now|pg||
nt|desinka:  looks like flat board to me|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  EW play kind of polish club|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lechcold: podzia³ kar i trafienie palcówki potrzebne|pg||
nt|xenya: hmm|pg||
nt|lml: Matel has to pick a major with 3-3|pg||
nt|desinka:  depends from the vuln|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Is it Ilan or Ophir who is South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he has just shown the @CK. I was not expecting that.|pg||
nt|bt: now if east thinks and does bid 6@S ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT not only asks for kings, also for a trick source which woolridge has|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes no sense if West bids 7@S now. Why not on the previous round?|pg||
nt|bt: i thenk the us2 coach should do some work here|pg||
mb|7S|nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ilan is south|pg||
nt|bt: if east thought and then bid 6@S they are toast|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Against aggresive teams as India for instance yesterday you can loose because of some slem boards who happen to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||
nt|lml: I like a trump lead and so does South!|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reasonable action by Stansby but it worked out badly|pg||
nt|hlortz: and 6@s must be in temo or 7S ot allowed|pg||
nt|hlortz: /tempo/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, they got there but no 'points for style'.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i dont think tempo matters since 5NT confirmed all the key cards|pg||
pc|dT|nt|leao:  300|pg||
nt|ady: can cash the diamond now or have it later     east will finesse 10@D for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: defence just has trump tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: well, if bocchi-madala play 6nt from north side, Pakistan can feel it is just not their day|pg||
nt|stoffers: Got to go, thx all and see you :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  True Viking attitude :-)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||
nt|athene: so one down|pg||
nt|athene: west didn't want to shift to the @CQ because declarer could have stiff king (four clubs with east for the double)|pg||
nt|athene: sorry five|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs dont break he has 9 if the diamond finesse is on - nothing works|pg||
nt|boedhy:  two off....|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thx Christer|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: We wroc³awiu poci¹g jest ko³o po³udnia...zaraz sprawdzê dok³¹dniej|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: low heart lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 NT the safest game|pg||
nt|jbgood: defense made it easy at the other table|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: lucky for NL 5C was allowed to make OR|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||

nt|bt: i think we have sweden-nz in the last round also|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||

nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||

nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: he claimed ...he said I will take the club finesse|pg||
nt|bt: some interesting cards here, ns better stay at the 4 level|pg||
nt|bt: or get to nt|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is a possible call with that south hand|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Henri--congrtas for France reaching the Rugby Finals|pg||
nt|ehsana: $S on fro N/S|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
nt|skaftij:  rathe heavy 3@s|pg||
nt|lml: but of course he couldnt|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess we are the speed table today |pg||
nt|leao:  board 24 coming up at the other table|pg||
nt|ady: may be over 20 imps swing on last hand being in diamonds rather than clubs or no-trumps|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Yes jan shut up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I will from now on|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|brolucius: Sometimes very difficult to decide between NT and a 5-3 major fit. I usually solve the problem by always playing in the major. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c=6-9hcp 4@ss|pg||
nt|leao:  minus 11 for brasil, as predicted|pg||
nt|boedhy:  serious I think Brink made a mistake there...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C was cold of course sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@c= 5@ds + 4@ss  OR  6@hs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  easy 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bt: i follow kantar-eisenberg on that|pg||
nt|bt: with overstrength always play 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West asks about the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 20/25 min offcial|pg||
nt|leao:  4@s looks cold for NS as cards lay|pg||

nt|xenya: 12 imps to Sweden on 8 (5@S -4 here), when Fredin-Fallenius got nowhere a club slam but got away with it |pg||
nt|oosmanb: which Ace do you lead against 5@C !!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, also 6NT instead of 6 of a suit (which may break badly)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
nt|bt: so if u have like 26 hcp and 53, get to the major, u need the extra ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: I wrote what Jorgensen wrote to N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@d void probably|pg||
nt|bt: with 28 or more get to nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, there is no threat of an adverse ruff in NT, of course.|pg||
nt|bt: at least thats my interpretation of how they played, must ask them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S according to cc is GI-relay [15]|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course and that is what he has :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  have to go have fun all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores |pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no i dont know what that means :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told by a kibitzer that a recent analysis showed (in world championship play) that 3NT played better than four of a major when the hands are balanced. He says that Glyn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liggins (of England) was the author. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have 25 minutes left|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have not read it, but it would be interesting to see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand south has no reason to play 4@H for sure|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bye Ruud and thanks from all of us'|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
nt|bt: i also never look for a major w 4333, its just so i dont waste my energy deciding or give up information |pg||
mb|3N|an| |nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to imply that responder should bid Stayman (rather than make a transfer bid) when he is 5-3-3-2 with a 5-card major and sound game values. |pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
nt|ady: looks good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick:  and the Venice Cup for those interested:   http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|andersk: well I do not lead @H A|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
nt|andersk: 4 sp makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he did not play|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few people do that, though.|pg||
nt|hlortz: south has both xtra high cards and no aces - that points me to 3n also|pg||
nt|bt: so 3nt was slam invitaional presumably|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
nt|bt: hurd has no clear lead here, i would try that too|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think this auction makes ducking @DA a difficult play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean so you dont have to lead?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|andersk: now even easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is ducking something that West should consider?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the scorebaords again http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as we near the end of this round|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west claims|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||
nt|ady: not going well|pg||
nt|lml: this should make the endplay obvious|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: well done by North but ducking club jack was VERY anti percentage|pg||
nt|panosk: actually trying to discard hearts from dummy and ruff his heart loser in hand|pg||
nt|panosk: *from hand|pg||
nt|panosk: also found out that spades arent 3-3 |pg||
pc|c6|nt|antoniz: oby tak skutecznie jak ze Szwecj¹ do tej pory:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: Isreal in 6@S in previous gained them a hefty 13 imps , new leader|pg||
nt|bt: mainly because he has nothing to play back, and maybe north will play for a @D underlead|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|wild card: now his only hope is for west to have only 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
nt|andersk: Upmark not happy with that, however the split makes it easy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: played for K@C with south when north played low   and king to come down in 3|pg||
nt|panosk: if N had K@D cud have made |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: or jack|pg||
nt|panosk: well not really if N ducked heart ruff decl wud have to play diamonds himself|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lml: so who wants to be endplayed|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pachtman did wait for it - he just claimed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: did not bither with club finesse|pg||
nt|ady: bother|pg||
nt|xenya: so the par here is 5@CX -1|pg||
nt|ritong: he has something to play back|pg||
nt|brolucius: West hoped that partner had a top trump and a doubleton club. He could then win and cross to @CA for a ruff.|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: a little discussion about the number of tricks for NS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=15-20 BAL or game force |pg||

nt|wild card: north's hand looks like 6@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: note how both W's answered with only 1 point over 1@c|pg||
nt|panosk: and 5 imps to Isreal for not quitting desperate contract|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  making here n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: if you cancell out 2 slams one gained and one lost for each team the vast majority of imps were scored by part scores|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  must show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c is a transfer to 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a possibilty for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C the limit for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 3N on 9 was made in the OR -- 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Dubion had PASS out of the box more than once - and chooses to stay with it|pg||
nt|bardo: no il +1 non c'è stato|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is good to see that there are some hands where 2@H is opened on both sides of the Atlantic.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
nt|leao:  NS have 4@s|pg||
nt|leao:  and EW do not have 4@h|pg||
nt|bt: ew overcompeted here in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Play in @h. low to 8 first |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When entering dummy second time, run the 10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
nt|bt: this is the type of auctions where north has to base his action on south having some values, like 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at the Open Room bidding, by putting your cursor on the Open Room result (top left). East broke a fundamental rule of bidding by going to 4@H, He had made a limit bid and knew ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little of what partner held.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could hardly hope to shut out a spade fit if North/South held one.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can make this but is not easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
nt|bt: are the nz team allowed to do that "haka" before their matches? seems like they did against usa1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pawel90:  1BA pokazuje bilans przynajmniej|pg||
nt|lechcold: aczkolwiek mo¿na znaleæ uzasadnienie dla obu odzywek..|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 14-16 confirmed|pg||
nt|panosk: eventually will play diamonds and that is his problem, how to?|pg||
nt|leao:  if he goes for a xruff he may go -1 only|pg||
nt|leao:  rite... always -2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: he needed to float @S to make  but hard to picture Martel's shape|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart  then a@C and a club|pg||
nt|lml: this is a very sensible line|pg||
nt|yuval10: and naturally you play AK@s and go down|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong...|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ryskiel_: czy kto mo¿e zna termin V Kolumna...to co z wojny hiszpañskiej w 36 roku|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: yes I believe in smollen  3@H  after stayman and 2 diamond response would have been the same   but not game forcing?|pg||
nt|lml: it just doesnt work|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Very good, Lars.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: he has to duck to preserve the entry to the fourth club|pg||

nt|ehsana: better this way on this holding|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room bocchi-madala DID play 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: and DID get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: their system meant north was declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: now definately should get club right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still going down, isn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: but should not have cashed the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must lose 2@C and 1@S |pg||
nt|ady: a@C  and club before the K@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NS already have 1 trick|pg||
nt|rialc2: vedo che, praticamente, ci sono state solo manche (da ciò lo score "perfetto")|pg||
nt|skaftij:  on bd 29, Baldursson in 5@s, let rge @d lead run to 9 so 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: but now the defence get the @DK set up too fast|pg||

nt|lml: and 9 tricks in a normal 1NT contract|pg||
nt|ritong: would you downgrade west?|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|wild card: the heart stopper and the high card point count are not sufficient though|pg||

nt|oosmanb: 1NT by N most likely|pg||

nt|xenya: or S|pg||
nt|bt: well he better take it oout then|pg||
nt|brolucius: North showed spades, so East had a 1@S bid for take-out. Double would mean something else.|pg||

nt|brolucius: South's double will be a Support Double, showing 3-card support for partner's spades.|pg||
nt|bt: wow usa clearly wants to choose sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||

nt|ady: -300 in 4@S    dont thin n/s can be sure of 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: they have taken the push|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W have found their club fit.|pg||
nt|bt: that 1@S takeout was just horrendous and his poor partner has to play it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
nt|leao:  if i can, u surely can :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6nt looks cold|pg||
nt|skaftij:  kibs point out that AQxx cannot be handled |pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW play "HÃ¤xan"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has shown about 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson will be reluctant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they bid it in the open room|pg||
nt|skaftij:  otoh, they bid agressively|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 12-14 and @c, West would bid 2@c and revert to 2@h over 2@d I think|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|bt: thing is we all make horrendous mistakes but it is partnerpreserving to play them yourself|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not really hope to win the auction to good effect when his partner could not speak over 1@C. So, wiser to pass.|pg||
nt|bt: not only is woolridge upset over his partners bids, he also have to play a really awful contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is expecting better clubs opposite because he asked partner to choose between the red suits.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have doubled 1@H to get in the auction safely 1@S should have good shape including clubs on actual auction|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
nt|xenya: not likely to make -- but you never know|pg||
nt|bt: thing is only real suit shown by ns is spades so a take out is for all other suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kiwibridge: this is cruisy should be well in time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Some tell me West may have shown (17) 18-19|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Or they guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With no obvious fit, East lacks intermediates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west stil thinking|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6@c for iceland on board 12|pg||
nt|bt: anyway thanks hurd!!|pg||
nt|bt: you can come here anytime|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
nt|desinka:  yes|pg||

nt|brolucius: Let me take this opportunity to thanks our splendid VG operator, Pim. Excellent session and we very much appreciate your efforts! |pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphznv: i do :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would like to see auction after  P-1N[9-12]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when you have to open 1 heart you hold your breath |pg||

nt|skaftij:  But Easts "quacks" are after al in PD's suits|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30, Lauria in 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|ady: happy A@S with west    split aces  hopefully now|pg||
nt|panosk: just a diamond ruff in dummy needed here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Kibs tell 5NT pick a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well they picked one that makes lol|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will pull the match like 16-14 in Iceland favour|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a looot of explanation going on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now North is settled after so much talk and is ready to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nope..cards on the table..... and thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  sry missed that Israel raeched the slam too, I get so many comments, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his head is burried inside his palms|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better than 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: bath coup'esque |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my fellow commentators, Lars and Henry. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@C opening showed 2+, conceivably can have 5 diamonds also if balanced|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: it appears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not quite bath coup but he won 2 tricks when he deserved 1 in @S|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of te session    thx Victor   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|yuval10: heading to the last board|pg||
nt|lml: nice result for north south ... lets see how Pachtman-Ginossar handle it|pg||
nt|panosk: that is our last board for this session|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was two WELL DESERVED slam swings :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not "just lucky ones"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and so the last, and Jan we owe you much for your great skills on vugraph @H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and a fun hand to finish with|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx a lot for watching...fantastic match|pg||
nt|bt: involving a baseball bat|pg||
nt|ritong: ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably both teams will make the last 8 and they deserve it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: may hope is that Australia will make the last 8 as well :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: please rejoin us for more wonderful matches from veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym wicie nie ma problemu z wygraniem 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Drijver and Brink are a great pair and have had an excellent set here|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||
nt|skaftij:  possible swing to Italy |pg||
nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
nt|ady: specs suggesting diamond lead  and 4@C is down   but  can still make|pg||
nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
nt|bt: one thing about sloppy play though, its difficult to get back to good bridge|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwne decyzje obu naszych graczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie sympatyzujê ze Splinterem z rêk¹ S....kompletnie nie sympatyzujê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jassem chyba pomylil sie w systemie|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿ nie|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Martens zrozumial 3@s jako splinter @h|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale mecz przegramy:(|pg||
nt|kamyk: zamiast podsumowania: jak sie tak patrzy na BBO, to sporo widaæ...|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o kilka naprawdê bardzo ciekawych rozdañ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jutro przekazy z meczu Polaków o 13.30 i 16:45 - tak jak dzisiaj zapraszam z ca³ej si³y...mo¿e wreszcie zobaczymy prawdziwych polskich husarzy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: o 13.45 :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³uszenia jutro,dobrej nocy:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: o 13:45 dziêkujê Nataly...pewnie nei wiecie ¿e opeartorem jest nasza dziewczyna - Natalia Bana od pewnego czasu mieszkaj¹ca w Holandii|pg||
nt|kamyk: powiem za Wañkowiczem: Dziekujê Uprzejmie, Przybêdê Akuratnie:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes this and it finished 40:36 and 16:14 for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to guage|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ady: took the save non vul against vul|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might also |pg||
nt|boedhy:  dont think he would have led that against 3nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  and that was the 8th trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli to tak mia³o byæ, to jednak nie bêdê wkuwa³ systemu M-J:)|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have tried 6@D here|pg||
nt|panosk: our thanks to our very able operator Pim, great job indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: AFR Points: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might be a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saved by e|pg||
nt|skaftij:  N temted|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tempted|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, @d King was led|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably a double will come after|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make setting up spades    just 2 sspade losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board of this match - and tomorrow the Round Robin continues|pg||
nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphznv: thank you to Panos|pg||
nt|panosk: not as good as 4@S but it ll make|pg||
nt|panosk: thank you Pim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good victory the Netherlands|pg||
nt|skaftij:  420 + 140?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  11 imps|pg||

nt|xenya: i don't think most of us understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: A=3point, K=2points Q=1point|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 4@s bid showed 2K and 1Q |pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: he really has a pretty good playing strength hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: still 6 matches left for the teams to qualify for the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: top 8 will advance|pg||
nt|ady: I thin might have done better playing diamonds   forcing dummys trumps  to try and nulify the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to beat this now|pg||
nt|ady: diamond led would have been better for defence|pg||

pc|h7|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but there you see even another disadvantage for the double...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|lml: so a pickup for the usa|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
