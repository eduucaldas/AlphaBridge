nt|athene: italy have been very impressive so far|pg||
nt|athene: and lauria-versace aren't exactly anyone's idea of a third pair :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: witamy z powrotem|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi all and welcome to this match from Veldhoven. Iceland vs. China|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Play will start in a minute -- Einarsson and Jorgensen are discussing their defense|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: against the chinese system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|barnets:  morning all from florida|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy v USA in the Bermuda Bowl has a good ring to it. These events are enhanced by the decades of history behind them.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am watching the live video stream, but it is from the other table at the moment.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Utaly picked up three big wins on the first day, but they had some harder fights yesterday.|pg||
nt|hlortz: we are back again it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: witam ponownie|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphznt: There we go|pg||
nt|ady: still leading?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: welcome everybody|pg||
nt|gracelin: H all|pg||
nt|brolucius: China beat them by 1 IMP in a great match. (There was a very rare vice squeeze on the last board - worth looking up in the VG records).|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score in diamonds  looks best|pg||
nt|brolucius: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
nt|brolucius: .. for the live video pictures|pg||
nt|ady: could Bocchi get over ambitious in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Bocchi's 1@C is natural. All 3 Italian pairs play 2-over 1, which means that a two-level response to one of a suit is game-forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: welcome everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: good afternoon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: przekaz wideo z pokoju otwartego: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gracelin: Lian and Dhi is the natural pair in the Chinese team.  Bocchi also play natural with variable 1NT range|pg||
nt|gracelin: we sstart the match with a slam hand.  6S is cold and 7S on the D finesse which works.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy is now lying first comfortably with an average of 24 VP in the first 4 round.  China lies 13th at moment.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 c is 54 11-15, qualsiasi rever senza 3|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D via a negative double is weaker than a direct 2@D on the previous round.|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: pokoj otwarty rozpoczyna gre z kilkuminutowym opoznieniem|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there is a double dummy defense to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: west considering   will likely raise in spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2d must be a relay and 2H probably shows 5D/4H|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: witam na meczu Polska-Bu³garia|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wooldridge bid 1NT (transfer to 2@C) intending to support spades on the next round. That is why transfers are so effective in many situations. They give you two bites at the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: cherry.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: wooldridge explaining he is not 100% sure if 1nt shows clubs or could be a raise in @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sometimes they differ , depends on 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but hurd explained as @C ,  madala just wants to know the insides|pg||
nt|ady: would double of 3@S be penalty from North  ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ins & outs|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: madala asking for the director|pg||
nt|brolucius: When 1@C is basically natural but maybe two or three cards, it is usually best for the defenders to treat it as natural in their subsequent bidding.|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems norths double relates to wests 1n bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  1N=transfer to @C's, but since N opened 1@C, this showed a strong 3-card raise.  Hurd's immediate 2@S over the X showed a minimum|pg||
nt|ady: not sure  what south is meant to do?|pg||
nt|barnets: if wests bid showed clubs perhaps norths x also showed clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: That agreement prevents any misunderstandings, such as may have arisen here.|pg||
nt|barnets: hence x of 3@S would also be penalty|pg||
nt|barnets: by north|pg||
nt|ady: that would seem to be a reasonable choice|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not immediately obvious why N/S should call the director. They are probably happy to be defending 3@S.|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 rounds of spades would seem to defeat 3@SX even with 3 club tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|ady: lost of wast paper in  south hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Gerbrand will enter the names asap|pg||
nt|ady: tricky for south    good opening bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|ady: defence could of course go wrong in 6 hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|jaapfr: GA all|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Daniel   Jaap|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi david daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: Jaap, David:)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: operator is ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: Hedy:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hoi Jaap|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand Hop|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha great hoi Gerbrand:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: the important factor here for south, is that perhaps on some meanings of 1NT he is on forcing now, and on others he isnt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: 2NT was slightly ambitious.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had an obvious raise with that splendid heart suit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: to powa¿ny przeciwnik, który siê powa¿nie liczy w walce o awans do ósemki |pg||
nt|ady: not even necessary to do that       east unable to ruff any diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually they do not have a misunderstanding, wooldridge just giving all the info he can|pg||
nt|ady: this looks down 1 on the baad diamond split|pg||
nt|ady: will Bocchi try 4@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: even before madala asked anything about 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: A messy start to the match.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: good safe 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South commenting it was to difficult, north you probably did well|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: all in dutch|pg||
nt|ady: well done by south|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: the later round of bidding is not explained in their CC so we will have to take some guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S is more comfortable a contract than 6D.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lets see if they find the "killing defence" here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: apart from the club suit all looks well|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes and 5@D down on club leads so 3n the best spot|pg||
nt|psyck:  Results & Live Scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: at least a @C lead would have given Weinstein a mild scare|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: welcome Krishna|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lets try again :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: since they are in GF tempo, mabe south will rebid is spade suit and get a raise on the way to 6S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense is easier now east has bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they didnt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lechcold: antykontra Mihova mo¿e spowodowaæ wist  treflowy |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: is it a winner now?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: if S ducks one @h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and I guess thats not DD :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes that may work also|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|brolucius: East tries to slip through a 9th trick in diamonds. |pg||
nt|brolucius: By leading the jack, pretending to finesse against the Q, he aims to catch South asleep. Not today!|pg||
nt|desinka: hello all|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|fluffy: perhaps NS weren't prepared to defend against this 1NT convention|pg||
nt|fluffy: looks like Bocchi though that double of 1NT asked partner not to make any forward moves, but south didn't understand it that way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to understand that 5@D. His partner did not have enough to bid 2@D on the first round.|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: so the 4NT might be Turbo, showing odd numbers of key-card, in the meantime cue in H.|pg||
nt|lechcold: Grzegorz hamowa³ jak móg³, ale Krzysztof mia³ za du¿¹ kartê....|pg||
nt|ady: a lot of bidding on this hand|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|garden2005: witam po przerwie :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: czesc|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: 6D will go down if it's East hold that K10xx in trumps.  |pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: but if east has one heart and two clubs you have to win first heart|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznt: and now focus is on Einarsson|pg||
nt|ady: life made very difficult for n/s|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Our valiant operator is trying to recover from the crash (which of course was not his fault at all).|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mathat: Q @c lead 3 r  @h|pg||
nt|ady: I feel this should have been 300 the other way|pg||
pc|c9|nt|gracelin: declarer may have a guess at the end whether West has 3 or 4 cards heart.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson is now shaking his head -- he now knows he did the wrong thing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but a @h now -|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not necissarily|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: S knew his @SKQ was worthless, and he had no ace, so maybe his hand is not worth much|pg||
nt|ady: I am told 6@H in OR   A@S lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart ruffed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gracelin: I presume he will discard the losing club on 3-round of H.  But he smply takes the trump finesse.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: up to speed again|pg||
nt|ady: USA playing 3NT with n/s cards  OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: A pretty awful board for Italy, whatever was the cause of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to relog because open room was down|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|brolucius: No percentage in North entering the bidding.|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 4@h = @ss|pg||
nt|ady: 1@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: 1@S denies spades. With 4 or 5 spades he would double.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H and 5@C here equally most likely down|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: trying to see how he could make the slam :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: EW play standard short club, 5-card majors, strong notrump|pg||
nt|gracelin: West will bud to 4S|pg||
nt|gracelin: bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many use a cue-bid to show a sound 3-card raise, 2NT shows a 4-card raise.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: When the opponents find a fit and then stop at the two level, the other side know that the points are divided and that they will likely have a fit somewhere.|pg||
nt|ady: and then again at 3 level|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Ian :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubion cannot know east hand   of 7-4  or would surely correct|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West said 6-5 probably|pg||
nt|juror1: mo¿na obejrzeæ naszych w otwartym http://wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|gracelin: declarer needs to guess trump to make this, but I am afraid he will not.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably down one but can in fact pick up the spades|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mathat: @c is 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: So South survived a potential second disaster as a diamond lead would have produced 1100 should west have chanced a x of 3@H|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: kibs tell me 5@C can be made but I believe it can not be made (always also @S loser)|pg||
nt|ady: think it might be right for Sementa to run when doubled|pg||
nt|lechcold: król pik móg³by daæ niez³y efekt:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: from the 5H bid and the double, it's likely that north has a singleton trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: how can he believe north bids 5H at unfav Vul. with this 5422 hand.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer finesses in spades, seeking a discard for one of his diamond losers.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaapfr: yes DD 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|hedyg:  the OR is starting play now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pull 1@C and ruff 4th @S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 10 min later than we do, we have theathre here :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: The location of the king of spades means that South does well in 3@C, but the same location means that E-W won't make 3@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after all, north only bid 2H in first round.  So maybe declarer will figure it out.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will have to finish this and re start to link with other table so after this hand ill close this|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: I Don't know what they had for lunch..|pg||
nt|hedyg:  he can make  3 more tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: this looks a bright start for Netherlands   as far as this table is concerned  they would think they did well to stop out of a slam hand 1|pg||
nt|hedyg:  @c ruffed high and claim -3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: You can see what a good idea it was for North to keep the bidding alive over 2@H (which would have made). You should always be reluctant to let the opponents play at the two-level ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in a fit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he's on the wrong track|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mathat: think bocchi in vuln bid 5 with sngl @s|pg||
nt|gracelin: south cannot hace a singleton club, or he would lead one for the ruff, so the finesse is to play south for 3-5-3-2 very unlikely since north is raising 2H with 6|pg||

nt|nickf: close - then connect to the OPEN room|pg||
nt|gracelin: rehi everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: not without having looked at my screen :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however had south split the dummy shortening defense does not work|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to take ruffing diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ady: slam time|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|idc: The standard of commentary you can expect has just risen, as we welcome Joe Shair|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-USA 2 seniorzyù|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rhelle:  East will be tempted to pass this|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a save|pg||
nt|barnets: a low diamond lead V 6@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: both sides play fairly natural systems 5 card majors 15-17nt|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: North may respond 4@S  to his partner's one-bid. No, he has preferred 1@S.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: we are up to speed now|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: had to claim the first 2 |pg||
nt|athene: 4@S is two down, assuming the defence attack clubs early enough|pg||
nt|barnets: works quite well|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  And now West has a problem. 2@s is non forcing, but he has a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: but nanev, with singleton spade facing a takeout double, might bid on|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX in other room|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Oh, the pressure...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|idc: The Brazilian Federation has player profiles on-line, look at: http://www.bridge.esp.br/player/joaopaulocampos.php|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  He doesn't know about the wasted @h values in his partner's hand, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this sort of auction some play 2NT by the opener as weak-strong. That allows them to show a strong 3@C rebid (by bidding 3@C) or a shapely weaker one (via 2NT).|pg||
mb|p!|nt|athene: fearing his opponents have a huge fit and more shape than they do have|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this will limp home|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do anyone here have the link for running scores|pg||
nt|ady: yes   6@H can be beaten  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: at wbf.org|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@SX is also interesting|pg||
nt|barnets: def need to play a club|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   500 last hand   got the vulnerability wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 OR|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sorry - misclick here -- claim wasnt the right buttom :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: botton :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: @cQ took first trick|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: then a small @s to the K|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And E is now in |pg||
nt|barnets: to force dummy|pg||
nt|idc: and there is a link there to his partner's profile, thanks to Brazil for the info|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bit weak of Gosney - Edgtton to pass this out|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: This is interesting.  East will lead a high heart and shift to a minor.  But does he shift to the suit where he has the king, or where he doesn't?  That is what declarer will have ...|pg||
nt|kit: to judge.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, this is interesting|pg||
nt|antoniz: witaj Grzegorz:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: when he bids 4nt you might think it is offering two places to play, in which case he should pass 5@C|pg||
nt|hlortz: could be 6 imps if both 2@h and 2s make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: N/S are not playing a strong 1@C system. That is probably why North did not want to make a pre-emptive 4@S response - in case his partner was strong and they could make a slam.|pg||
nt|santyclz: W has no quick entry to allow a @s thru.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@S makes easily for me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rhelle:  the problem for East is communication. He can throw @cs on @h KQ, but how to get there?|pg||
nt|brolucius: When dummy has only one card in the suit led, the partner of the opening leader can give a suit preference card to suggest a switch.|pg||
nt|ady: spades never mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: this will be another swing to USA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@C-1 looks too many tricks made to me|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: Lian was in a tough situation to guess the trump layout under the bidding.  Italy really earned this swing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2s was 5+ spades veery weak|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sementa led a trump in the other room against 4S, which is tougher for declarer.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: thought max 10 tricks in @C b1|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2 clubs 15+ any reverse without 3spades or nat|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  8 easy tricks - 2 0 4 2 and a likely @h.|pg||
nt|idc: Since the defensive entries (@dT & @hA) are split N-S, defence won't be able to get at club winners|pg||
nt|ady: semi psyche by north    no action from south   believed vulnerable opps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Polska-Izrael jutro ponownie z przekazem wideo|pg||
nt|pawel90: czemu po treflu nie jest bez trzech?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: sometimes when you have a scrambling bid like this you can use it to show a weak bid in the highest-ranking suit|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, declarer doesn't know heart layout, so this could still be tricky|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Now club ruff, heart ruff, and eventual diamond finesse will make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rhelle:  North needs to take and shift to a @c - but not sure even that is enough|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a high spade, if 10 or J drops, he may ruff to hand to ruff the 3rd H.  If nothing drops, just pull the other trump|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: in other words 5@H over 4@S would be "good" and 4nt - whatever - 5@H is "bad"|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: I wonder what declarer would have done on a diamond shift|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rhelle:  the @h2 may help - Lavinthal for @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Of course, North also doesn't know that the 2@h opening was so weak in @h|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here we go again :)|pg||
nt|pawel90: o. teraz jest :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|rhelle:  good switch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi Rob and all|pg||
nt|rhelle:  hello|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes but too late I think|pg||
nt|rhelle:  no, just in time|pg||
nt|santyclz: N will think about what to ruff with on the 3rd @c, but it won't matter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That might ddepend on whether he believed the SP signal that West had chosen to give.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the 3NT board that we watched a moment ago, the bidding and result were the same at the other table. You can check such things by hitting the MOVIE button at the bottom.|pg||
nt|athene: but as he is a passed hand i am not sure there is any need to make that distinction|pg||
nt|ady: likely to go down   will have to play exactly right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: most wil be in 4@S here I suppose|pg||
nt|ady: finess the spade   and get J@C right|pg||
nt|ady: running scores link requested please|pg||
nt|fluffy: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi fluff:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: Hey hey|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rhelle:  East can only cross with a trump|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he does|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess he can just ruff and cash clubs then play another heart since li cant overruff or ruff anything|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: S asks W about their leads when switching sut|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W tells S that they play 2.4.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W needs the @ha in south for 2 reasons now.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle:  the HQ will get ruffed|pg||
nt|idc: He's committed himself to South holding @hA, which has two things going for it:|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|vugraphznt: and no attitude signals|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but now North can draw dummy's last trump and cash a @c|pg||
nt|idc: (i) the play is simple and (ii) it will work as cards lie|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|h2|nt|santyclz2:  Declarer, of course, doesn't know it works but surely s has something for his preempt.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|boedhy:  he has only 1 trump|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ah yes - silly me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think he should throw @c |pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs to discard, and wait until dummy is dead - South can hold up the @d 3 times|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Bauke takes second @d and plays @c|pg||
nt|boedhy:  west ruffs and now e WIjs ruffs third @d and they have @h to cash...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can also ruff this and play @c|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: anyway, lauria versace are content to push opps to the 5-level|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: well played|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so you were right after all Rob 1c was needed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s8|nt|boedhy:  @c|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|idc: Declarer choosing to play this as a squeeze on South|pg||
nt|jaapfr: http://www.wkbridge2011.com/nl/live a more important link mb|pg||
nt|fluffy: when north is known to hold @cA and to have a canape it looks easy to guess clubs once spades have been guessed|pg||

mb|3N|nt|rhelle:  1@c = 16+|pg||
nt|boedhy:  these board tend te get in teh way if you let it make early in the match|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is there but south is worried about his singleton spade.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 6@c 1@d  o 5-4 minore sing @S|pg||
nt|ady: anotgher lightish opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1@s = @h, unbalanced|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine not bidding 3@C on South hand|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt shows major-minor, shapely|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  1NT = relay|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H     not a great contract   but can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  Rob Helle is teh coinventor of teh system Muller de Wijs are playing|pg||
nt|athene: overcalls are 3 or 4 cards with a longer suit somewhere else|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H has a chance, 4@S is down on the heart ruff |pg||
nt|gulyas: in the meantime, OR made 5@Cx on bd2, for another 14 to Ned, leading by 25, nice start|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rhelle:  2@h = 4@h, 5+@d|pg||
nt|athene: so according to that scheme, lauria could have overcalled 1@H|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe, vulnerable, he thinks it's unduly risky|pg||
nt|athene: this looks like fairly old-fashioned precision club, so NS are just bidding naturally after the 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/USA%202/hurd-wooldridge.pdf|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: say LR or bad game raise, danger of getting to bad game|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S   shows spade control?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which doesn't say a lot for their system, NS need to cah their 4 winners|pg||
nt|hlortz: the latest system of game tries is bid game and try to make... should fail here :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle:  2@s = relay|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2NT = short in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@S transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S transfer to 2NT apparantly|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: quite possible that in the other room west opens a weak 2@S|pg||
nt|gracelin: good convention.|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a diamond guess to make 4@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: but lauria-versace seem to be very conservative with their weak twos, and weak jump bids in general|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's seems those Italians always have a right gadget to describe their hands perfectly.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if ducked to HQ, a club shift will beat it.  So declarer may decide to go up with HK and wor on spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Narkiewicz bardzo kaszle|pg||
nt|hlortz: is it totally clear to rise aC if decl leads it early?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boedhy:  So he knowes the system like nobody alse oh offcourse WEISMULLER themselver.|pg||

nt|rhelle:  3@c = relay|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, the club shift is only academic, nearly impossible in practical|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle:  3@s = 0-4-6-3|pg||
nt|boedhy:  WIESMULLER = Tarzan that is what they called their system|pg||
nt|rhelle:  Now North knows the @c losers will go on the @s AK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Takes away a round of bidding and may suggest a good opening lead.|pg||
nt|jkotor: zgadza siê, ale mo¿na te¿ zagraæ na impas i dzia³kê kierów (choæ przy renonsie trefl ma³o prawdopodobne)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now they can manage two heart ruffs if they diagnose the layout|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rhelle:  so he will get excited!|pg||
nt|kit: And in fact, N-S have profitable save in 5@C, and pushing opponents to 5@H (which likely would have happened) is a big bonus|pg||
nt|athene: slam might be harder to reach if west opened 2@S - what do you do with that north hand? just punt 3nt?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, no need to pre-empt opps if they don't bid slams even when given a free run|pg||
nt|athene: really you should not miss this slam|pg||
nt|athene: if you play a strong club and opps politely yield you the floor|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: So many plusses in bidding.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1NT was raptor showing 4@s and a 5 card minor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyway 5@C XC was a beauty play by Drijver in OR b2|pg||
nt|fluffy: Drijver- Brink playing only 3@s on board 3, this means at least 10 IMPs for Italy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|antoniz: brawo|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Gosney|pg||
nt|hlortz: well done|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle:  4@c = relay, asking for controls|pg||
nt|boedhy:  still needs the third round @H control|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@d = 2 controls; an ace or 2 kings|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he ask for it?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, and he will|pg||
nt|rhelle:  4@h = relay, asking for high cards|pg||
nt|ady: 7 easy    8th have to work for|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c = @dK, @hK, nothing in @c|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c4|nt|rhelle:  5@d = asking for more high cards|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@s = DQ, not @hQ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  On the last board at the other table Verhees van Prooyen were in the better 3nt contract, which on the layout is cold..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so a good start for teh home team.|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so really, NS are unlucky that South's red Q is in @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  otherwise they'd bid 7@d|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south would have been better to raise clubs right away|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Doesn't look likely.|pg||
nt|ady: careful defence will beat 3NT  2 hearts 1 club and 2 other aces|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: may cash club and try diamond to the 10|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: entries mean he is likely to make it on the lucky heart diivision|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boedhy:  still think a lot of pairs will end up in 7 @d tho and i dont see a way to make it|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@h I don't understand - that is a sign-off|pg||
nt|rhelle:  in my version - clearly they play this differently|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3 boards total 35 imps is a rocket start|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle:  I guess that they could sign off in 5@d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  taht should be possible...|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and 5@h is the relay, and 5NT shows the @dQ and denies the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: that will bring 8 tricks  unless 6 card spade suit out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: dont think so Barnet   favour diamond to the 10|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lechcold: profesjona³:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: in any case thats 3 spades 1 heart 1 club and A@D to lose|pg||

pc|h8|nt|boedhy:  then now he is counting his tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle:  that would be useful refinement|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and stops at 12|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed. It could be 7 if @h are 3-3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|boedhy:  no|pg||
nt|rhelle:  but you're not going to bid a grand on that|pg||

nt|brolucius: 1@C is 3+ clubs and 11-21 points.|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  well done then anyway :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NL is taking a bid lead|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|kit: I totally agree with this call.  South knows his side has at least 8 clubs and E-W have at least 8 hearts, so odds in favor of competing to 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: south should force this to slam i think|pg||
nt|athene: AJ10xx is a lot better than just 5 hcp|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ady: a quieter hand|pg||
nt|pawel90: NS maj¹ tu do wygrania nawet 5@H, ale obrona pikami jest dobra na kazdej wysokosci|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: not a successful lead     heart works out better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle:  North feels he is too weak to handle 1NT X|pg||
nt|kit: And here it pushed opponents to poor game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play 15+ - 18 for 1NT, so North was a shade light for that opening bid.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "good dummy" says Einarsson after W put down his cards - I agree :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and W layed down his @sK as it was just a small @s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in between|pg||
nt|jaapfr: some will bid as W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 split here|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: The defence had to stay away from both pointed suits here (@s & @d) which wasn't an easy task for them|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: Aust allowed to make that 4@S for an early 12 imp lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this may well fail|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle:  South is now advertising a rally big hand - and North will bid 3NT|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bidding 3NT yourself much safer|pg||
nt|rhelle:  9 tricks are of course easy once the @cQ drops|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so the NS aggressive auction looks like paying off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well it is sort of lucky offcourse on a @s lead you need that|pg||

nt|jkotor: znaczy jak w koñcu S otworzy kiera, co jest raczej oczywiste|pg||
pc|c4|nt|brolucius: Some players would not have bid 3@C, vulnerable, worried that partner might have only 3 clubs. But you can see that making that pre-emptive bid has pushed E/W around.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is likely to have 1 honor for the bidding, if it's a @h this is a good contract.  The @sk dooms it.|pg||
nt|kit: Still likely 1 loser in each suit|pg||

mb|d!|an|4+!s|nt|boedhy:  offcourse South Africa not among the favorites|pg||
nt|rhelle:  true - but a very solid team|pg||
nt|brolucius: Terence Reese once described Flannery as the worst bidding convention ever invented. "It copes with a distribution that causes no problen whatsoever with natural bidding,' was his ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: view.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: at this vul they open weak nt|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Not everybody's 2@h bid...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|boedhy:  although Apteker Gower are a good international pair|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 4 isreal bid to 4@S down 2 off the top|pg||
nt|ady: all game down I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  And teh Netherlands are among the topfavorites especially on home turf|pg||
nt|rhelle:  5@c will be lead directing|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is very high up on Roland Wald's list of the world's 10 worst conventions too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Roland agrees.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It has always staggered me that so many very good players use it.|pg||
nt|kit: big advantage of Flannery is that you don't have to respond 1@S to 1@H on a 4-bagger, so opener knows it shows 5.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, it will be 12-14|pg||
nt|gracelin: There is an excellent interview to Bocchi on the net.  I just don't know how to copy to long address to present to you.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@s asks for minor|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d shows more d@s than @cs|pg||
nt|ady: games|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  well ... I think Italy is very strong, especially in the absence of the alltime strong USA teams|pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland thinks the convention is so totally awful that he forbids commentators to use the F-word. (I will let your one aberration go unreported on this ocasion, Kit.)|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay for 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@c is minimum & without 4 card @d|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some won't with 4 cards in the other major, some won't with a void, some will with one of those flaws but not both.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: WE graj¹ Precison|pg||
nt|idc: a 3@d response to 2NT would have been 4 diamonds, min or max|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very costly for Australia|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some back here I expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a razorblade sharp 4@S needs @C lead to beat?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle:  South X of 5@c is interesting|pg||
nt|kit: Well, if I get fired it won't be the first time in my life :)|pg||

nt|rhelle:  showing the desire to compete|pg||
pc|sK|nt|boedhy:  and now he has done his part and passes|pg||
nt|ady: might make 12 tricks as they lay|pg||
nt|ady: might make only 9 if spade is ducked early by defence|pg||
nt|ady: when hearts split well will have 9 tricks and be relucant ti risk diamond finesse|pg||
nt|idc: as has been pointed out to me, a good thing E-W missed their @s fit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rhelle:  NS need to cash their 3 tricks in a hurry|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but looking at the hands....|pg||
nt|daman:  my oleasure     a great interview|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 3@d = more @ds than @cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the problem here was the wide range 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: needs to win in east hand to make 12|pg||
nt|barnets: we can see that but he is trying to guarantee just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on this lead|pg||
nt|barnets: there is no absolute guarantee I can see|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: take the A , play @D and then take safety play perhaps for 9|pg||
nt|barnets: when he loses the lead the def shift to a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: attitude lead|pg||
nt|idc: I wonder if any Multi 2@d users will play 6@h by West and suffer a ruff at trick one|pg||
nt|idc: or perhaps East passes in some matches and West becomes declarer that way|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ady: ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  otherway up|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S may make if they let him get the 4th @D to discard a @C|pg||

nt|kit: Good judgment by all to reach par here|pg||

nt|brolucius: West does not want to play a second top spade here.|pg||
nt|hlortz: might w dbl 3@S with the intent to pull @c to @D?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|boedhy:  @s|pg||
nt|rhelle:  the @s8 will be lavinthal for @d|pg||
nt|rhelle:  South can see he needs 2 @d tricks to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle:  so he needs the @dK in North|pg||
nt|rhelle:  might as well play the @dJ now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: in fact needed a club lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: They show standard count on king lead 5-level or higher contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will have given count.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and make 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: better than the arvitrary 4@H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gulyas: it maybe tricky if they play a @C back|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|barnets: now he has the guarantee for his contract|pg||
nt|pawel90: niestety treflowy tu obk³ada³|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: Now, when West shifts to a heart East will have to deduce that reason West didn't cash second spade is that it isn't cashing.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: bound to lose the @D for safety|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3C is also making here, so either 9 or 10 tricks will result in a tied board|pg||
nt|idc: Now declarer can claim, overtrick if @sK right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: try this if you want to see live play, not very exciting http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||

pc|d9|nt|malpaluche: @d j'aurais compris|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: East has advertised length in the majors, so declarer will probably play West for the @DQ.|pg||

nt|jkotor: 4@s na przeciwnej, ³adnie naszych wyblokowali|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|boedhy:  difficult to see who must bid again|pg||
nt|kit: will just have easy squeeze -- will not need to finesse|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Note Levin's heart plays -- trying to hide king of hearts so declarer places him with other high cards|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer just needs one of SA/HK to be on side.  In fact both are.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the t/o X was left in for 300 OR|pg||
pc|s5|nt|boedhy:  but think  South has a sort of lesser rick decision|pg||
nt|boedhy:  risk|pg||
nt|kit: I doubt if declarer will be fooled here, but still good defensive technique|pg||

nt|ady: as lone as they shift to a heart before trumps played  just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: long|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south knows his partner's shape then 6@H looks clear, with the good suit texture, even not knowing of the @H10 opposite|pg||
nt|kareno: Still it is hard to posit such a perfect fit.|pg||
nt|athene: a pity - my guess is south found out distribution but didn't know he was facing so many prime cards|pg||
nt|kareno: I would guess Italy will find the slam in the OR.|pg||
nt|athene: and he didn't have any way to make a mild slam try in hearts - if he had done so, north would surely have accepted|pg||
nt|barnets: a good pickup here for USA|pg||

nt|boedhy:  only one in 7@d on the board... Chili against Italy bog lead for them also|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: 15+ - 18 1NT.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Anyway, as Kit remarked, they have had to take a rather close view to reach game after their chosen start.|pg||

nt|yke:  for me it is a 1NT opening. But that's just a matter of style|pg||
nt|gracelin: good play on route to 9 tricks.  Declarer can later duck a round of D, draw top trumps and pitch dummy's D on good H, then ruff a D.|pg||
nt|pelu: even with @HK onside there are hard work to make 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: same play if Hearts are 3-3, declarer can pitch one D on H to lose only 1S, 1D and 1C|pg||
nt|pelu: and 12 opp 11 - and bad @C-value is not game potentional in green|pg||

nt|gracelin: The Italians can win imps either by overbidding or underbidding.  You have to admire their judgment.|pg||

nt|athene: but south won't (shouldn't) stick this, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: cue 2@H, check for 44 spades, bid 3nt otherwise|pg||
nt|athene: even though it's nice to go for penalties at this vulnerability, you know opps surely have an 8-card fit|pg||
nt|athene: so defending at the 1-level might well be wrong|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think not.  His pass of 1@d doubled was likely influenced by the vulnerability.  As it is north was on the thin side of the double and might have eschewed the double of 1@h ...|pg||
nt|kareno: with such thin hearts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is not making|pg||
nt|pelu: some work for 9 tricks here, |pg||

nt|boedhy:  then 6@s is is a little better then 50% because you can guess the @d and on a @d or non @d lead you get info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had he opened 1NT, which I assume shows 15-17, West would doubtless have stayed low. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Changing the 10,8 to the q,j on the hand above yields 17.5 points, still low but more reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that Weinstein didn't even search for a 5-3 spade fit.  He judged that with 3-3 in hearts and clubs it was very unlikely that spades would take 2 more tricks than notrump, ...|pg||

nt|yke:  3NT is questionable to me. with a 5-3 fit you should play in spades when the long spades is the weak hand and in NT when the long spades is the strong hand|pg||
nt|yke:  because you might not be able to enjoy the long spades because of the entries|pg||
nt|kit: with AQx of clubs, there is no entry problem to the long spades|pg||
nt|yke:  good point|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Einarsson had a lot of water and now he goes to the toilet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Amazing!  @ss are only 4-1 not 5-0.|pg||
nt|twcho: a trump lead will probably set the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: At matchpoints there would be more incentive to look for a 5-3 spade fit, since making 1 extra trick in spades is worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: after laying down his cards|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rhelle:  ah! a variation :)|pg||
nt|rhelle:  3@s is a strong 1-suiter, |pg||
nt|gracelin: even with this lead, if declarer is to ruff spade, he might lose a 2nd trump trick.|pg||
nt|pelu: some cross-ruffing af 9 tricks now - even play for 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: so likely there are still 9 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: def have no tricks|pg||
nt|ady: the lay out is friendlt|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 clubs one spade|pg||
nt|barnets: one heart or 1 diamond should make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  although why North wants to play a @s contract himself is a mystery to me|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well South africa has bid it and made it|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle:  4@c is a cue|pg||
nt|twcho: now declarer may succeed by ruffing three rounds of @s in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: With the preempt, declarer not likely to take 2 club finesses through South, and also likely to get trumps right|pg||

nt|lechcold: nietrafnie Grzegorz|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rhelle:  I still think North would have done better to keep relay'ing|pg||
nt|brolucius: West at the other table did try to cash two spades against 5@S doubled and allowed the game to be made. |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose one down against 4@S making in the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: That heart five in north could possibly have been promoted to a trick with persistence in diamonds after cashing clubs.  The play is complex|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: very quick @H9|pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking that if he doesn't overtake this and cash the @DK for a spade pitch, the defence can draw trumps and cash two spades|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case the nine was a poor choice because it opens him to the promotion.|pg||
nt|athene: but the trick comes back for the defence with a trump promotion in diamonds anyway|pg||
nt|athene: well, he is always losing out one way or another - even if he didn't waste the nine, the defence can prevail|pg||
nt|athene: for example on a diamond if he can ruff high north can pitch a club and get a club ruff with the @H5|pg||
nt|idc: West won't be expecting a doubleton heart on his left, which might be the surprise that dooms this contract|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly when s shows up with @h length.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|garden2005: Kuma kamufluje -1100 i nas zagaduje|pg||
mc|11|nt|rhelle:  but, let's be honest, it's a marginal slam. Around 50%, so staying out of it is no shame|pg||
nt|pelu: @C9 8 7 6 are strong ruffs|pg||
nt|gracelin: east has doubled 1C, so he doesn't have a singleton HK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now ruffing finesse in spade is the safe route|pg||
nt|gracelin: if instead, going to dummy with HQ and play another trump, West can win CK and play D to force declare losing control.|pg||
nt|barnets: with 4 tens and 3 nines though :)|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice intermediate spot cards|pg||

mb|2D!|an|pytanie|nt|fabsayc: declarer will need to guess the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT is just marked as strong raise on the cards, but must be GF or South would not have bid just 3@H. |pg||
nt|santyclz: One of the few hands where blackwood answers all your questions.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most players use it as game-forcing rather than 'limit or better'.|pg||
nt|kareno: If west leads that tempting diamond it is all over for south.|pg||
nt|athene: well 3nt hasn't got many tricks even if the @DQ isn't found|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually 3nt is doomed anyway but the diamond makes it quicker :)|pg||
mb|2H!|an|3 !h|nt|fabsayc: the main clue being north will already have shown two aces|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  6@ss fails on a @c lead.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system say 5 card major ask GF'|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  south difficult decision now|pg||
nt|rhelle:  he didn't seem to think it was that hard :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  first double?|pg||
nt|rhelle:  penalties, no doubt - 16+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West did not alert 2@C, thinks natural|pg||
nt|boedhy:  second double still take out|pg||
nt|rhelle:  2nd is take-out|pg||
nt|idc: N-S play a (mostly) game-forcing 2/1|pg||
nt|idc: and no doubt the sequence to 3@h will be forcing|pg||
nt|idc: South has bid this as a minimum opener with little slam interest, so North may give up now|pg||
mb|2S!|an|proba szlemikowa|nt|kiwibridge: and what if the answer showed @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: W has a tough lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: needs to avoid leading a @D to beat this|pg||
nt|hedyg:  might lead @s|pg||
nt|gulyas: that could work|pg||
mb|3C|an|wartosci !c|nt|gracelin: 2D is a safer contract than 1NT which can be set with 3S, 3C and a H.  Bocchi made a great lead to pave the way for a successful defense.|pg||
nt|idc: Had South tried a courtesy cue bid of 4@d (as he might) then I think they would have gone on|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  After 2 boards with good chances for USA, one with a chance for Brasil.|pg||
nt|gulyas: anything but a @D really:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2@c minors|pg||
nt|rhelle:  oh, that lead will make EW trump short|pg||
nt|rhelle:  and if then NS play 3 rounds of trumps, the roof will come down|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this will be disaster for EW|pg||
nt|rhelle:  especially as the West hand is dummy, so the defence is much easier that way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes|pg||
nt|boedhy:  the fact that he could lead the @s ten|pg||
nt|pelu: what a lead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @D lead very unlikely imo|pg||
mb|3D!|an|cue|nt|rensph:  quiet 1NT for EW here, diamonds break 4-4 so will end up with 6 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: admittedly, he has no good lead with his hand.  He'd rather attack dummy's suit than declarer's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south thinks to overtake and shift if north leads from doubleton K10, south has no entry to eastablish his spade anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|cue|nt|pelu: in OR @H-lead from N - and easy make|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W pokazal 4333 10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  now he will try to ruff a @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so close to 6 tricks...|pg||
nt|kit: If Weinstein chooses to lead from a king he will lead clubs, since no double of 5@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: What a waste of a hand, a good relay pair could use 11 rounds of bidding to get to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: But the passive lead reasonable, and now declarer takes them all|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he allows Bocchi to have led from K10x.  He must have seen it before.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can duck this as well and defenders still need to defend carefull to ge all their trics.|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes he had a winkle|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: 3@D better than double on that shape.|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.|pg||
nt|idc: We heard a comment at the table earlier that 'spades are always 5-0', so I guess this 4-1 counts as a favourable break|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i double versace passed 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: i doubt :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|santyclz: So much for 3nt by n...|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C a little scary -- Weinstein thinks opponents might have a slam.|pg||
nt|pelu: but a problem for NS that they never found their 5-3 fit in @c|pg||
nt|lechcold: transfer na kolor wroga to Stayman|pg||

mb|2N|nt|idc: if it asks for short suits, that 3@c will encourage him|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to idealny kontrakt w tym rozdaniu..4@H mo¿na przegraæ|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 5@D was a sensible option by North. Some would bid 5@C, claiming that they couldn't be any better for a passed hand. But South only made a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The VuGraph records are saved in various repositories (one is Nikos Sarantakos's VuGraph Project), so we can look up how other teams bid and made 7@H.|pg||
nt|ady: was worn out by then|pg||
nt|idc: But then if that is a return short suit try, South will be discouraged|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: E thinks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rensph:  Creative approach by W - had east shown a 5card major he'd be ok with that, too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this contract is touch and go, good guess in diamonds may see it home|pg||
nt|idc: ahha, am told 3@c is forced relay, then opener makes short suit try|pg||
nt|ady: may get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: They may end up in 2S with the Gazzilli.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: He could be a lot better as a passed hand.  Stiff in a major.  Queen of clubs someplace else.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: All othe bids by south will show the strong hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one disadvantage of the Gazzilli.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this time he has a very healthy 5-card suit.  North is worry south ma bid the same way with a much weak 5-card suit.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|jkotor: seniorzy taryfa w plecy na Duñczyków, tylko panie dobrze w tej rundzie|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fluffy: my limited understanding of gazilli says that 2@c is either nat or 16-18, 2@d is 8+ any, and 2@s shows spades and clubs minimum|pg||
nt|gracelin: sout may pass 1NT with 12-13 pts in order not to be involved in the Gazzilli.  But with 14 he fears losing game if north has 10-11, even a passed hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby declines the game-try but 4@c leaves North a different problem|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jaapfr: oeffff|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this strange looking play is quite good|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: for running scores|pg||
nt|fabsayc: saving spade king for a late discard|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As long as the x isn't takeout.|pg||
nt|idc: His dbl looks sensible|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: the reason why south bid 2@c instead of passing 1NT is that he might be facing an 11 point balanced hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: you are quite right.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think they can get out for less than 2hearts and eventually 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: West showed 6-8 with red suits|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaapfr: ty but then E 3@H not 4@H Gerbrand?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rensph:  N missed a chance to give partner 2 ruffs there, now it looks like 3@D is making|pg||
nt|hedyg:  surely a direct 3@d over 2@H would have been gf and this was a slight invite|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: but normally 2@s is with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play a very natural system and use standard sugnals|pg||
nt|gracelin: signals|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: I use two-way stayman and with game values, I do always check.  That my hand is balanced (4333) doesn't mean partner's is also the same, particularly with the modern tendency to ...|pg||
nt|kareno: open a lot of 5/4 hands 1nt.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kareno: So the auction, say, 1nt - 2@d (gfs) - 2@s - 3@s offers a choice of contract.|pg||
nt|rensph:  declarer will have to choose between finessing in clubs or spades|pg||
nt|idc: I think I like the logic behind SOuth's lead: partner has short hearts so where are E-W tricks coming from except ruffs, so lead a trump|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|boedhy:  this is close|pg||
nt|rhelle:  yes, one or two good decisions required|pg||
nt|boedhy:  needs to play @d|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and as Muller is playing it will take some time|pg||
nt|boedhy:  then he will play @d offcourse|pg||
nt|rhelle:  indeed- if only to get information how to play @ss|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has nervous moments -- feels a lot better with king of hearts onside|pg||
nt|gracelin: after the HK lead, the H10 is irrevelent|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gulyas: nice invention/convention:)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c8|nt|rensph:  ...unless defense solves this problem for him|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: the D shift deceived declarer, playing D strength with E|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, as Papi says:  "You need a reason *not* to lead trumps".|pg||
nt|idc: At the vulnerability East wanted to suggest a 5@c sac to his partner, hence the 4@c bid|pg||
nt|idc: If any blame is to be awarded, West's dbl perhaps deserves it (though -300 instead of -140 no disaster)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: thats a mistake by S - sh take @DA and play 3x@s|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1 imp if he makes 4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kit: Now will strip out hearts and clubs, and then try to duck a spade to West|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: By eliminating the side suits, he can survive when East holds @SQ-x.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Sementa decided his hand was worth game in @H, covered the black losers, nice @H fit and Kx in @d look pretty good|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: instead of taking 2 D tricks, Madala takes none by this defense.  He is not headed for -2|pg||
nt|idc: USA avoided the slam on failing finesse on Bd 8, so their lead up to 21 IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: Levin will go up ace of spades, hoping partner has KQ -- only chance|pg||
nt|twcho: good play of @s10 first|pg||
nt|twcho: south doesn't want west to cover with honor|pg||
nt|lechcold: niestety, 4@H na drugim stole bêdzie wygrane - wist pikowy|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: NS do play 1@S - 2@D as hears|pg||

nt|rhelle:  2@d = relay|pg||
nt|athene: hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: Two - no need to preempt with a solid opening bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China has another chance here, 6S is cold|pg||
nt|fluffy: not your everyday vulnerable preempt|pg||
nt|fluffy: 6@s is far from cold requiers a good guess i ntrumps or in the minors|pg||
nt|gracelin: in Italy they say Vulnerability is for children and Bocchi is no children.|pg||
nt|fluffy: normally you should gues trumps, but you are not entry rich to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but they won't use the bid with this hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  W bids 4@d before n can.|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle:  (no singleton or void)|pg||

mb|p|nt|boedhy:  2227 balanced tehese days :)|pg||
nt|athene: wow, only 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: i would want to bid a few more than that after partner doubles clubs for takeout|pg||
nt|idc: That's a good auction|pg||
nt|idc: Particularly by North, appreciating power of his shape after partner's negative dbl|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now what?  6 of a major looks likely  on the bidding (if not the hands).|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: this should be down, even down two is possible|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: missed a pass Karen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  well maybe south should go for 3nt then ?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sort of wrongsided it now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could it be slam looking form south...|pg||
nt|kareno: I also play that double as takeout.  And they have a light opening style with the forcing club system.|pg||
nt|rensph:  wouldn't want to get anywhere near 6@S usually|pg||
nt|fabsayc: best now is spade shift|pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz: USA 1 took a big lead when China went down in 4@S rather than the 3nt on bd 25.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You remember the deal where Levin upgraded a 17-count to 18, reaching 3NT opposite 7? China played that deal in 4@S, on a 5-3 fit and went one down. So, Kit's advice on the deal, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that West should not seek a 5-3 spade fit proved to be good advice.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they are there, I am quite sure Shi will take 12 tricks.  He is the best player in the team and reach semi final in BB in 2009.|pg||
nt|idc: Stansby's dbl started as minimum but I guess even his hand feels a little improved on auction|pg||
nt|idc: the 6@d bid should warn declarer of bad breaks ahead|pg||
nt|idc: I admit I might be tempted to do less as South - perhaps dbl is a little pesimistic but a forcing pass of 6@d maybe best|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: how to play now? not over yet|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  now is there some way to endplay w with the @h loser and force a @s lead?  I don't see one,  but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, I suspect this won't make - need a 12th trick from another @d ruff or a spade|pg||
nt|idc: and this attack on dummy's trumps probably too hard to handle|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Martel reading a book|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: "Starbound " that is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fluffy: if declarer missguesses trumps he will need to find @dQ|pg||
nt|fluffy: or squeeze south in the reds|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a difficult task|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S = 2Aces + @SQ - Lian exp @sAKQ :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: he even has time to establish a long Heart|pg||
nt|famus: natural for him to play !j--but if he opts to play a small @s--the play ends at trick 2|pg||
nt|famus: @sj|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the vugraph schedule so you can plan your days and weeks      http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|pelu: he know that N is short in @S, so he could play @S6|pg||
nt|famus: that wud end the thrill!!:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has so many entry to dummy, so I thk to take CA and play small spade to finesse S10 is the right play|pg||
nt|fluffy: Imaine for example playing a low spade and south ducking @sK9xx he might lock you in dummy with a heart and you have no way back to hand except destoying you chances of stablishing ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: @cQ|pg||
nt|pelu: this will be the 3. slam-swing in the match - the first 2 gave China 25 IMP and prob 12 more here|pg||
nt|gracelin: China should be proud of themself in outbidding the Italians in 3 slams in one set.  If Shi makes this.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: but one of the slam only maded on a defensiv error|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes sorry:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time he finds the 5 card major|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: various ways to come to nine tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: take a ruffing finesse in spades is one|pg||
pc|d9|nt|boedhy:  offcourse it was 50% but south has a very strong hand imo|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi must be thinking harder than we do except he is not looking at all 4 hands.  I am sure the line he chooses is the best one.|pg||
nt|daman:  here is the page for the result fromthe 3 events     http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|famus: so the Chinese wud b the first to put a dent in this Italian Juggernaut--They've rolled over evry other opponent mercilessly, and i dare say artfully till now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|rensph:  pointed out to me that it's not 12 tricks if E leads a club through, so S would have to play the hand in order to succeed. :)|pg||
nt|idc: I still admire the auction (by both sides) up till 6@d, then perhaps South did a little too much|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer will go up with the ace|pg||
nt|twcho: but he has to choose from finessing in @c or establishing the 4th @H|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|kareno: And all he needs are eight :)|pg||
nt|ady: now down 1|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|idc: but perhaps we should put it down to good E-W sac causing tough problem|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As was suspected, Brasil got to 6@h on  board 10.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South found out 3@C is making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and that 4@s is not making|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is to the bathroom|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: now overruff, diamond shift kills the dummy entry|pg||
nt|gracelin: now he need to guess DQ for his slam.  Declarer may try Heart 3-3 first,|pg||
nt|pelu: did he realy need to play @SJ?|pg||
nt|famus: so he has to play on the red suit squeeze but i think must surrender a @S NOW|pg||
nt|gracelin: I say no, since he as so many reentries to dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: so only 8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|twcho: nice smooth duck by south in the 1st trick|pg||
nt|twcho: now the contract is doomed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Nigel is a classy young player with a great future'|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|famus: to keep trump control and check out @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: take @S10 and play @DJ - he has a ruffing finess later in @c|pg||
nt|gracelin: he is to eatablish his club trick first|pg||
nt|pelu: my bet: he will make :)|pg||

nt|famus: wd China|pg||
nt|pelu: so S has to discard a @h, but then again @D to K, @H-ruff and S can be endplayed on @s9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey my half hearted prediction came true|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: actually this was the bidding :)|pg||
nt|idc: Auction entered is 4 passes and I doubt that really happened, just a typing glitch i expect|pg||
nt|jaapfr: re los kabeltje:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: south doubles 1@S and then north bids 1nt, i suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: I have predicted Shi will make this slam.  Glad he didn't let me down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: back to the double figure swings|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rhelle:  so far NS have 12 plus scores - they will be happy|pg||
nt|gracelin: at this Vul. 2D shows 4S and 5+ minor with 5-11 pts|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2c was 18-19 , madala passed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, 2@C shows 18-19 balanced for them. The other Italian pairs use 2@D for that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Sementa losts of clubs and spades again|pg||
nt|hedyg:  1@c= 2+|pg||
mb|4S|nt|idc: Yes, Bd 11 still being played in other room, in 3NT by East (USA)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: that was 4117 almost same|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Raptor is only played in direct seat|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: East is unbalanced now he dbled|pg||
nt|ady: this time they do have a spade fit   but still might play more safely in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: quel systeme !|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this upgrade may get them to the good slam, 2@S followed by 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|twcho: I still can't understand why declarer take the trump finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some might be tempted to double this with north but he does not have that great a hand|pg||
nt|athene: you either need a shortage so you can get some ruffs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boedhy:  yes they will be pretty confident about there list|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only board 9 is tricky|pg||
nt|boedhy:  It was bid and made at most tables|pg||
nt|athene: or you need such good trumps you just make them by force|pg||
nt|kareno: Nanev very close to a second double.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't know you were bi-lingual.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Because he was tricked by a 19 year old?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  after the accident on board 4 he is hesitant to bid 2@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@C no chance|pg||
nt|ady: now Sementa has said it all|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Thundering here, South; I made a wrong bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: ciê¿ki rebid z rêk¹ E...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boedhy:  solid 3nt again|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention that 2@C on a passed hand should show a sound raise in partner's major was banned for years by the English Bridge Union.  They thought it allowed players to psyche ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: in 3rd seat....|pg||
nt|kit: some might open the West hand 1NT and get to 3NT.  But they then might get a spade lead!|pg||
nt|athene: he really has not got that much defence|pg||
nt|kareno: In that case, north might sit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  for those who want to see the open room on livestream: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: This lead will not test declarer.  A heart lead might have.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C is known as the Drury convention.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And when 2@C shows 3 card support and 2@d is used for 4 card support it's 2-way Drury.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has the chance to ditch a diamond on the 4th club, so long as the defenders do not set up a diamond early.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Taking a trump finesse might allow a damaging diamond switch.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is no doubt what he is thinking about.|pg||
nt|idc: The 3@d showed 18-19 balanced & heart suport|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 9 tricks either spades or clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg:  in 4@s you would have to ruff high and play the J@S to create an entry to dummy with the 10@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rensph:  only worry of declarer here is to avoid losing 2 spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: with the knowledge of south's 4-cad spade, declarer can take deep finesse there to get 4S, 1H, 2C and 2D.|pg||
nt|ady: Duboin in with his jack   but partner had shown a good hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am afraid that even is not enough hedy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole pad³o 2@H i jest grane|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznt: 5@h= 2 aces no @sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i see it is 14-16, so not an upgrade, and to me worth 4@D over 4@C since diamonds good for many discards|pg||
nt|hedyg:  extremely disciplined pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: instead of dbl direct 2@S is 6-4/5 less strong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: Weinstein worried about a club ruff, so may play two top spades|pg||
nt|pelu: 37 IMP for China on 3 slams !|pg||
nt|gracelin: as there are only 2 entries to dummy, he could cash SA first to see what's north singleton, when the S7 shown, he know to double hook S10 and SQ|pg||
nt|fokal: he can evan afford to cash the @s As|pg||
nt|famus: this shud b a swing back to Italy if @s dont go to deep fin|pg||
nt|fokal: *even|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  E-w appear to have 4 losers and stopped just in time.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  on the other hand he also knows that with double fit Duboin is big enough to bid 4@s if it is there|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|fluffy: in 4@s, 4 players made, 10 players went down|pg||
nt|fluffy: making 3NT is for sure a supperb score|pg||
nt|gracelin: the Italian declarer must be among the 4 that make|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer lacks the entries for finesse south for Q107x, so he must hope north hold one of the Q, 10, or 7.  So cas SA and take the double hook|pg||
nt|fluffy: declarer can fleely cash @sA now right?|pg||
nt|famus: has to beware of entries to play @s twice- but also needs to check the hand---Declarer has his work cut out for him|pg||
nt|lechcold: po kierowym ataku konieczny by³by impas i damy i ósemki pik|pg||

nt|lechcold: tak|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: looks 1 down|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: If he plays trumps from the top and they break 3-2, he can set up the clubs, leeaving the master @SQ out. |pg||

pc|c3|nt|ady: 2 imps to Italy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see how hopeless it would have been for North to 'cover an honour with an honour'. |pg||
nt|santyclz: The bad news is the trump break.  The good news is that s didn't request a @d through.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, nicely done, now two entries to dummy for the double finesse.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|kit: Now diamond shift and he is down.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem was he couldn't go up ace of hearts due to no entry to the club.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South may hope that North started with @CKQJ.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: If North had that in clubs, North would have cashed another club at least|pg||
nt|antoniz: dlatego wist karo jest niedobry,moim zdaniem|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, that's a good inference - one that South has missed.|pg||

nt|gracelin: EW can make 3H, so 2S -1 or -2 is no big deal|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ady: 2NT   strong break of transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: sure, not your fault. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: the lead guesses diamonds for declarer, and now defeating 2@s will require a diamond ruff|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|kareno: This is a hand I would rather leave to partner to declare always - too many choices.  I agree that a club to the ten is tempting.  The diamonds have opened a path for the defense.|pg||

nt|gracelin: looks like a normal 4H hand on this last deal of the set.|pg||
nt|barnets: east overcalled one heart in open|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: We will be back at 13.45 local time|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking about whether to convert to 4@H|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Peter, a good win for your country|pg||
nt|petergill: If W does bid 4@H, then @SA lead works well, but might not be South's choice after this auction. The 3@S raise at the other table worked well, by guiding S to @SA lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: 1@D will be a transfer bid.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  as well as to the World Bridge Federation and to the World Bridge Federation with the Nederlandse Bridge Bond for sharing this important event  with us,especially to Jacob Hop who is instrumental in organising the broadcasts on behalf of BBO!|pg||
nt|jkotor: przed ME cykl powa¿nych przygotowañ by³ trochê d³u¿szy i porz¹dniejszy|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The next session starts in around 1 hours and 10 minutes. It will be the last session of the day.|pg||
nt|kit: This time it is right to play the 5-3 major-suit fit|pg||
nt|athene: maybe even promising spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Last board for the day, back tomorrow at 10.30 Paris time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: here at the playing site in Veldhoven|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our excellent operator Jan Nielsen|pg||
nt|idc: to my fellow commentator Joe and to our Operator Paul|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie p³aczmy na zapas,do strefy awansu niedaleko, jutro jest nowy dzieñ|pg||
nt|garden2005: nast¹pi przebudzenie|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy:  still liking his hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: despite this loss of Italy they still do lead the Round Robin pack after round 5|pg||
nt|idc: to the WBF for allowing us to broadcast this event|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Martel doesn't particularly mind a @s contract by e-w.|pg||
nt|idc: and as always to Roland and BBO, without whose work none of this amazing stuff would happen|pg||
nt|hedyg:  special thanks to our specs for joining and the kind and helpful messages. we hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|ady: may take some bidding   4th heart and the jack  the key|pg||
mb|p|nt|rensph:  in this layout it all mattered very little, had north held the @HK it would've been a very effective @SQ|pg||
nt|famus: i rate them favourite to win|pg||
nt|gracelin: some care is needed here.  But I am confident Shi will also bring this home.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: LIAN already left the table|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a well educated quess Famus±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: the next match will start in 40 minutes from now.  Tks all for watching and hope you have enjoyed some great hands.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will also like to thank Felipe, our most capable operator who explained many bidding sequences to us.|pg||
nt|pelu: a way to play is @cA - @H to Q, @hA and then 4x@D discard @s, then @C AND MAKING 11|pg||
nt|jaapfr: looks tough for E )DD very easy'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but he is afraid for @H loss @C@C and @SA for down 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer want to cash HA first as a safety play(he could afford t lose one trump), but here the threat for club overruff made that play not totally safe.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and very afraid for ducking this IF S 6 card @C|pg||
nt|famus: playing @hA is sure wau to -1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7 card|pg||
nt|famus: 6 cards he has so needs to duck|pg||
nt|gracelin: with a 7-card club suit at this Vul. south may have bid more.  so duck the first club then take trump finesse maybe a good way.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope he does not go for the line @CA @HA x@S|pg||
nt|lechcold: dojd¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba...|pg||
nt|jkotor: OBY!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: and to the spectators for some alert analysis|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and to the commentator for an excellent job |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do you think 3@d is forcing or not here?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W seems to be in doubt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|boedhy:  now pass finally|pg||
nt|rhelle:  good sequence - 5@c is again 50% at best|pg||
nt|boedhy:  slam again 50% or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well the 6 card trump support is hardly clear|pg||
nt|antoniz: mnie jest po prostu smutno,ale wierzê w przebudzenie naszych reprezentantów:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: * nie chc¹c|pg||
nt|lechcold: nie by³y to ³atwe rozdania|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play|pg||
nt|rhelle:  North: you guys have a bit of a @h fit|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, you'd better reserve your seats for the entire tournament - there is much wonderful bridge coming up!!|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: W decides that 3@d was non forcing and passed|pg||
nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, I'm a big fan of Fleischer's decision to treat KQx as four spades |pg||
nt|petergill: Fleisher I mean|pg||
nt|twcho: if non-@s lead, declarer will go down at most one|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA lead ---> 300 when declarer has to try for 3-3 trumps to try to make his contract, but I think a @D lead might be more likely|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lechcold: :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i wonder if he has A10x in spades if things would have been different|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Li just left the room -- and now Liu is on his own -- will he manage that?|pg||
nt|ehsana: .....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile 5@D in open room going down undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi now has a decision to make. Pass, 2NT, 3@D? He has chosen 2NT.|pg||
nt|ady: request for a link to running scores please|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@SX would not have been much fun|pg||
nt|psyck:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: If @D lead to ace, then on @CJ at Trick 2, S must rise ace OR underlead @SA when @D is ruffed|pg||
nt|lechcold: Brazylijczycy zagrali dobrze|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli nawet, to nic nie t³umaczy gry katastrofalnej, a tak¹ w nadmiarze tu ogl¹dam od 4 dni|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: jutro o 10.30 przekaz z meczu seniorow Polska-USA 2|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: a o 16.45 - mecz open Polska-Izrael, rowniez z przekazem wideo|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|twcho: now declarer is safe from being punched|pg||
nt|gulyas: S probably showing distribution here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz2:  Although the dummy's @c holding looks ominous.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think south showed some @S now|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Gerbrand when is restart please?|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê za wspólne kibicowanie - dobranoc :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rensph:  3N is made on a heart lead and continuation here, but if defenders set up a diamond trick early on declarer will still have to find the @SQ|pg||
nt|rensph:  I'm also informed that lauria made 4@S on this hand|pg||
nt|rensph:  3NT, sorry|pg||
nt|jacksond: if plays donde for spade queen he makes quite easily|pg||
nt|rensph:  sorry, 3N making with clubs 3-3|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|brolucius: North realised that his partner must have had some purpose in bidding 2@C checkback. When it turned out that he was not looking for four hearts, he knew that he must have been ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: looking for a 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@C Krzysztof potraktowa³ jako normalny cue-bid|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|boedhy:  and offcourse this one is down on @s lead|pg||
nt|rhelle:  thinking about it, 6@c is down on a @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: 10 easy tricks with spades splitting, but only 8 in notrump|pg||
nt|brolucius: if you want to listen to Voice Commentary, you should go directly to website: http://www.bridgebase.com/|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 16.45 1hr 20 from now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they go for 6@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: next set starting at 16:45|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably 3NT is 5422, and now north has to think|pg||
nt|hedyg:  shame only the 1st page of the NS CC is loaded :(|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DQ so vital here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I try to read what South wrote down|pg||
nt|fluffy: against many 8 HCP hands 6@d has no play|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|famus: yes--too tired--as pointed out by informed kibtz-- taking @H  A wud need to squeeze|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bye for now|pg||
nt|kareno: So that's it and Italy will get most or all of the VPs for this match.  Well done!!|pg||
nt|rensph:  lets see how declarer handles 4@S here though|pg||
nt|gracelin: He play Hear to break 2-2 or a singleton honor drops.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pity|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy recovered 19 mps in last 2 boards for a tied match.  Bye all|pg||
nt|famus: so a well deserved 1 imp:) thnks all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still China wins    wddddddddd±'|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  They tied with both Sweden and Italy today|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ±' ±'|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i try to smile but fail............±)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ty everybody|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: see you soon|pg||
nt|lechcold: przyda³oby siê 4N jako cue-ogólny|pg||
nt|petergill: If @CJ to king at Trick 2, then on @DK N will play @D9 as suit pref for @SA underlead|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 6@D plsssssss|pg||
nt|ady: may know shape   but needs KJ hearts as well as QD|pg||
nt|fluffy: he is also worried about clubs because he has @cQx and partner could have 2 low|pg||
pc|cA|nt|antoniz: po kontrze w 3tr,chyba lepsze 4tr|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: jutrzejsze przekazy zaczynaja sie o 10.30|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: do zobaczenia|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki i do us³yszenia:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: this likely to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: (My spelling is better than my typing.)|pg||
nt|barnets: should the two teams meet later on in the KO stages|pg||
nt|barnets: a good match and especially fine performance by the young USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: East doubled 1@C, so not certain that declarer will score four diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not hold a singleton diamond for his double, so declarer will start with the @DK.|pg||
nt|ady: maybe south will raise|pg||
nt|ady: no|pg||
nt|gulyas: no reason to, he told his story already|pg||
nt|fluffy: soth has told his story, he is not raising|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: South going through the auction, and asks who is declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And told he has a good hand for N|pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: I should also thank the players - been a lot of good bridge to watch|pg||
nt|ady: has he shown the vital Q@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes but his hcp are so beautiful|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North could do a slam try|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: especially getting diamonds right|pg||
nt|barnets: this will still be a small swing to USA team|pg||
nt|brolucius: With -500 on there partners' card, it was very much the right thing to do (as it happens) to bid game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..their..|pg||
nt|barnets: who will win this match and have a carry forward of some kind|pg||
nt|ady: may make even with 3 diamonds    as long as playing 1st club from north|pg||
pc|c2|nt|boedhy:  well good start for the Netherlands...and with all these difficult and lively boards fun to watch|pg||
nt|boedhy:  bye bye|pg||
nt|rhelle:  ok, thx all - see you in an hour|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|c3|pg||

nt|kamyk: no ale pamiêtajmy o chorobie Narkiewicza - to musia³o miec istotny wp³yw; ten sam sk³ad by³ w stanie osiagn¹æ du¿o wiêcej; no i jeszcze nie wszystko stracone|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|ady: I think will get diamond right   as does not want west on lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could easily be 4-4-4-1 for his initial take-out double.|pg||
nt|ady: well thx all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|fluffy: his hcp are maximum yes jaap, but partner could have anything|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|brolucius: When you Join a table that has voice commentary (there will always be two during the world championships), you can switch on each of the three commentators.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|barnets: I am not sure of the exact carryovers but it usually depends on which team finishes higher in the round robin|pg||
nt|brolucius: West false-carded the @DQ, to mislead declarer as to the position of the @DJ.|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia,dziêki|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaapfr: standings after this round : Neth 161 Italy 155 Israel 149 and usa2 137|pg||
nt|idc: including that last play - East realizes he can afford 2 trump losers but only if he starts on side suit immediately|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks Karen great operating, thanks Henry and Tommy and all spectators for great feedback|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: But no doubt he was helped by East's switch to the @D7. |pg||
