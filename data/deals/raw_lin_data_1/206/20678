nt|skaftij:  @c finesse might see him through|pg||
nt|andyv:  there is very little to the play of the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: as one may guess, 1@d was transfer and 3@d showing shortness with heart support|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer has his chances but has to deal carefully with the board, because we have 4 trumps with W|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 teams that are very close in the ranking|pg||
nt|penseur9: there's also http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-venice-cup with live updates during the match|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: wlc Rob|pg||
pc|d8|nt|farrukh: but even then e/w should pick up a few imps |pg||

nt|penseur9: difficult but this should make|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|nkgupt: there it is|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s7|nt|skaftij:  In OR, Jonsson overcalled with 1@s|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: thrumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: each country has his or her own shirts here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Iceland is in yellow, Japan in light orange|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|star6ija: both*|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E is playing with another partner today then yesterday|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: a lot of chances for S to make this contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: indeed, nicely played|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/livestream-wk-bridge-2011 for live feed of another table in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|andyv:  so declarer lost the 3 aces and made her game for a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the first big win for usa|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: open room: 4@h-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: some discussion in Swedish|pg||
nt|eweber: so after all André was right when he told the contract would make :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good morning :)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Victor-wlc:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 out of 2 finesses for slam - no good but unlikely to bid it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  N can make a couple of @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW about the same in @hs|pg||
mb|2N|an|!s support, limit raise or more|nt|rhelle: looks like EW can make 6@h, whereas NS have a good save (-1) in 6@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: that save has been found at the other table|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fearless 2H overcall -too rich for my taste - maybe thats why I am not playing|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: again not easy for NS to enter the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: no double - no trouble seems apt here|pg||
nt|cicus: as usual, the hand with shortness acts|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably 5-7 with @ds|pg||
nt|star6ija: declarer in the open room had played trumps, but without finesse, so 13 IMPs for USA, thanks to safety play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: missing 4@h by E/W?|pg||
nt|jaker: pretty routine 3n here|pg||
nt|fluffy: 1@h opening in third position is quite normal at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  and that is a weak hand with 5 spades and a minor by West|pg||
nt|dburn:  the New Zealand pair using Moscito, a system that does not allow very many passes in first or second or third position|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@d is no doubt a transfer to @h|pg||
nt|dburn:  some guesses for declarer - normal to pick up spades, will probably lose two hearts, so much will depend on clubs|pg||
nt|benjy: Hi all|pg||
nt|ahalim: this will be a partscore-battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio giving up very fast|pg||
nt|hobakan: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry wieczór wszystkim...panowie nie dostarczaj¹ nam chwil radoci,mo¿e chocia¿ panie siê nad nami zlituj¹|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: vulnerable 2@H overcall seems to be ' brave ' |pg||
pc|h3|nt|skaftij:  The convention card for EW does not explicitly say 16+|pg||
nt|star6ija: very high pressure by North|pg||
nt|fluffy: north rebids 1NT with 5422 wich is also very common nowdays|pg||
nt|penseur9: likely 3NT from E/W here|pg||
nt|penseur9: wrong :)|pg||
nt|pelu: oh 3NT was the last stop for EW|pg||
nt|eweber: open is playing 3nt|pg||
nt|pelu: and in OR von Arnim in 3NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: and rightly so since this will make on this layout|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, is that not a penalty bid?|pg||
nt|rhelle: lots of top players play transfers in these competitive situations|pg||
nt|star6ija: they may win some IMPs more, due to this 3@ss gadget|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: true, N had no means to invite|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm told that 2@d is just a GF |pg||
nt|jaker: we'll probably see a range of opening leads across the various matches. I'd try a heart myself|pg||
nt|dgame: @h lead sets the contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many different ways of raising spades these days - exactly what 2NT showed is a matter of p/ship agreement|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rhelle: I can see the logic of that - 6@c also looks a distinct possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it was expl. as strong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: great lead!!|pg||
nt|pelu: @H-lead even better - would kill dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: only 8 toptricks - and hard work to setup the 9.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: cant see time to setup anything on the given lead|pg||
nt|nkgupt: infact cant see any other game but ofr 5@d making on any decent def|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is looking at the convention card of E/W for leads|pg||
nt|penseur9: it seems there's no way to recoup here..|pg||
nt|pelu: in 3Nt the are only 7 toptrick with @hs 5-2 - extra trick in S but the 9. tyrick if difficult not playing DD|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4Nt for Aces or last stop?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I think W alerted it|pg||
nt|penseur9: I think last stop... something went wrong here in the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cant see what she has written|pg||
nt|eweber: theoretically W has the points for her jump to 3@d, but I assume most experts would find another bid|pg||
nt|pelu: easy for EW in OR after 1@C strong|pg||
pc|s6|nt|skaftij:  1NT would have been 15-17 in that pos. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Using standard openings and relays after 1@C opening - 1@D  promises 4 and unbal/semibal|pg||
nt|ahalim: @S contract is actually better for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: despite being way behind on HCP NS get to play this hand, teh lie out is not very friendly, lets see what they can do|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: still, with a passed partner you don't have to pursuit nonvul games|pg||
nt|rhelle: now, have they agreed what to do over intervention of 4NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2 popular schemes are DOPI-ROPI and DEPO-REPO|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Was intending to show 18-19 bal|pg||
nt|fluffy: the diamond suit is "frozen" wich means that any player who touches it will olose a trick|pg||
nt|fluffy: teh club suit is gonna be frozen soon also|pg||
nt|eweber: 3NT wouzld have been my choice with semibal hand and many points in the short suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W to S : I thought it would be to play|pg||
nt|pelu: one good news for W - no X :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry club suit is not frozen, @c9 protects east's @cJ|pg||
nt|pelu: so as I expected: 4Nt to play |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  @h switch|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: maybe he expected 5-5|pg||
nt|dgame: cold then|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: Double=0, Redouble=1 or Even / Odd|pg||
nt|rhelle: it seems they didn't quite understand each other|pg||
nt|dburn:  England rather fortunate on board 2, where they reached a somewhat ridiculous 3NT that had about eight or nine losers|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  although N may continue with @s and expect S to be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|pelu: @c10 now - or @H work for defense|pg||
nt|pelu: against 3Nt: @D lead from N - and easy 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h5|nt|fluffy: migry decides to go over diamonds, she loses 1 trick by touching the suit, but she stablishes 2 extra ticks for partner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rhelle: so although EW miss slam, they still pick up 11 IMPs|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: couhd have made 6 on heart lead but not now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: so first blood to USA1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|dburn:  this will be a swing one way or the other, since the contract at the other table was a part score|pg||
nt|dburn:  so, 10 to NZ or 7 to England depending on Wilkinson's view of the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  not really all that much to go on - the only suit whose distribution she knows for sure is spades|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  in W leads the Q@c and N ducks, W should lose 2 @d tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: !10 would have been easy for EW - now they need to be alert|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

nt|jaker: unlucky 3n...hearts 5-3 with the length on lead|pg||
nt|eweber: @h 43 and A1098 in @d with N would have helped though :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: played quick the last 5 tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|cicus: I told he didn't. well, he just took a shot at game.|pg||
nt|cicus: I am told :)|pg||
nt|cicus: big club|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a very very light take out double here...good shape but low in hcp|pg||
nt|dburn:  this will be a 1@d opening, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn:  four hearts, not four spades, minor suit canape possible|pg||
nt|dburn:  choice of actions for South now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@s was indeed a preemptive bid, making it imp. for E/W to find @h|pg||
nt|eweber: A1097 instead of Q1097|pg||
nt|penseur9: that was a very costly misunderstanding|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: needs to play in @H here|pg||
mb|d|an|4 card !s|nt|dburn:  she can bid 1@h as a distributional takeout, or double as a more balanced takeout, or overcall in her long suit|pg||
nt|benjy: how do you feel about her choice david?|pg||
nt|dburn:  would have doubled myself, with 1@h as second choice - not all that keen on 2@c|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree|pg||
nt|dgame: n-s miss a game 4@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what action over 1D- double or 1H|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak raise|nt|roswolf: hmm suggesting a heart lead (showing shortage)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and of course @C support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: even now 3@h is alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: late|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal    1@S=5-7 zz, a) 5+@D, some shortness  b) 4@D(441)|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't be sure but I think S showed @Hs and game forcing values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zz points are:  A=3 K=2 Q=1  [unless short]|pg||
nt|cicus: ah, thanks Al ,you are prepared|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: deas is not looking perfectly healthy; in a electrical chair, hand in bandage|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn:  but double nd 1@h lead to murkier later auctions than 2@c, which may have influenced matters|pg||
nt|benjy: super agressive 2NT bid by Fiona|pg||
nt|star6ija: looks like no troubles for declarer here|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 4@H - time to make coffee :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: modern tendency is to bid 5 card major - ok when strong enough for second bid - but facing a passed partner and minimum with both majors I prefer double|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east will probably double and in due course bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=2011Veldhoven&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CConventionCards|pg||
nt|pelu: give N @DK and not @SK - then plsy for slam|pg||
nt|fluffy: straightforward bidding for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby has to decide between rebidding her good hearts or bidding 3NT protecting @sK|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: DONT LIKE EAST'S PASS and 4@S is not the best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then pick event/country to get partnership convention card|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, 2@c is supposed to deliver more of a suit and / or more of a hand|pg||
nt|benjy: So you would bid over 2@C?|pg||
nt|dburn:  just about - could well have enough for 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: so I would like to pay more attention to the previous board|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  but this lead knocks out the entry to the clubs, so we may well not have enough for 2NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  although other things are reasonably favourable (e.g. the diamonds), so this will be close|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: well, after 4@d there wasn't a safe spot any more|pg||
nt|penseur9: this make easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good bid by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: did east want a double from w?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N have to cash out immediately|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS|pg||
nt|odysseus69: which heart to lead - having raised top of 3 is right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  and the contract allowed to make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpb: she is moving now to get a good seat, if possible|pg||
nt|star6ija: As Radoslav Radev pointed, 3 in Major weak is used by Eric Kokisch, who is a kind of advisor of strongest US players|pg||
nt|fluffy: sh picks the right one, 3NT is doomed on a spade lead|pg||
nt|pelu: but also 4NT would be a hard work to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is asking how many @h N has with the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can she have 4?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  a sizeable swing for EW|pg||
nt|fluffy: it takes a diamond lead to beat 4@h quickly|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjy: if she wins in dummy and leads a spade up east has to duck to give the defence a chance|pg||
nt|odysseus69: got to develop club trick - interesting to see what happens |pg||
nt|odysseus69: cashing the diamonds will cause pain to all 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @s to the J seems a way to go|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: small club to jack looks better|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fluffy: declarer can't avoid a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Upmark had option to Relay to get information about South hand, but elected to show @C with some shortness|pg||
nt|dburn:  East opened at the other table also, and South elected to double|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that looked right from here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with 8,9 of @c this seems ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade Q best but no good|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn:  West bid 1NT, which ended the auction, and eight tricks were taken|pg||
nt|dburn:  but they were taken by the defenders, so NZ have a useful plus 200|pg||
nt|benjy: this is cold now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not many will bid and make game here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: there was still a chance for the defence if simons had switched to spades|pg||
nt|penseur9: one looser in @H, @D and @C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaker: if north had chosen to overcall EW might stumble into spades, which I think makes 10 tricks, rather luckily|pg||
nt|fluffy: cos declarer needs to guess if she has to paly @sK or @sJ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: unfortunately I don't know any of the NS meanings  after the 1st 2 or 3 bids|pg||
nt|cicus: seems they do|pg||
nt|dburn:  sure - it may well have been cold anyway, but winning the first spade has certainly done no good for the defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: perfect contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with this defence, declarer has his life easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: her life, it's the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|fluffy: again there will be a chance if Stansby doesn't cash @cJ soon to discard her @sJ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests west should pass 3@H - THAT GOOD EASILY BE RIGHT - but east isnt guaranteed to have the hand he has - east failure to double 3@H should have cost him a packet|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in OR, defenders cut spade communication with the opening lead|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby is afraid of clubs breaking badly obviously|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: and actualyy has:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another good result for India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing the explanation|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems ideal to me - and n/s have only themselves to blame for the disaster|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by Brazil|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry i meant e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec asks why td called|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is asking sw for explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W / S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: about 3@h bid and explanation; it was only alerted for E, not for W|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is sour grapes and e/w are trying to win back the board in the appeals room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 4@s was 1 down|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo e/w were crazy in not doubling 3@H OR INDEED NOT PASSING 3@h out vul|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3@h could be hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: they played in the wrong suit and they should have just played bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: already some interesting first boards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done NZ|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fluffy: north is subject to a @d-@s squeeze|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@DS = 3+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Slam on a finesse - the hand I hate most|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N-S congratulate Palmer with her nice play of board 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how many spades/|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzpb: TD is collecting the written expl of 3@h :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west has a nice hand for the majors over a strong nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  North-South play a weak no trump, so this may be an upgrade|pg||
nt|star6ija: and Wests in both rooms chose diferent ways of acting, as well as Norths. US tactics was winning in both rooms, so deserved 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 4|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: ah hah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and leaves again|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: !:-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16 [1/2/3nv]  15-17 [3vul/4]|pg||
nt|ahalim: two easy slams to id|pg||
nt|fluffy: unable to hold 4@d and @sA she must drop a trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double-then 5D|pg||
mb|5S|nt|benjy: If i was playing a weak NT here then I would open one with the south hand|pg||
nt|benjy: Ok  you have 14 HCP and a couple of 10s but the 4333 is enough to keep me in range|pg||
nt|ahalim: bid|pg||
nt|tomi2: good morning to all|pg||
nt|jaker: the modern trend is more towards overcall and then double next with this hand type.|pg||
nt|pelu: D= dont bid partner - but sje is weong:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may have pushed then to slam|pg||
mb|p|an|forcing pass|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4@H NOT 4@S|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby is trully loaded, she might be thinking about slam now|pg||
nt|fluffy: the best way to handle the hand now is with 4@c splinter, migry will then know that her @cK is useless and sing off in 4@s quickly|pg||
nt|fluffy: splinter avoids the club duplication|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if the td rules in Brazil's favour it will almost certainly be appealed|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d will require guessing the @s suit or a @s lead|pg||
nt|benjy: and X in the pass out seems normal|pg||
nt|benjy: north will prob be glad to go back to clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|dgame: 1nt is quite in dangger|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: this variation of NT ranges is very fashionable|pg||
nt|cicus: among big clubbers|pg||
nt|andyv:  for up to the minute scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is interesting to see weak 2 openning with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|jaker: anyone else surprised by the 4 heart bid? |pg||
nt|fluffy: if for example stansby bids now 4@c over 3@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: not migry might think @cK is facing @cA|pg||
nt|fluffy: and overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: N says; we should not waste time with these hands; 11 tricks|pg||
nt|star6ija: but everything goes if the partner is warned|pg||
nt|pelu: and wrong again :)|pg||
nt|eweber: is she?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: I think D was just cards here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that was a forcing pass I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agressive bidding by E/W, previnting N/S from reaching slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trump lead recommended|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes, pass was forcing, leaving decision to N|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: @D lead will kill 5@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they may have heard you Victor :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 500 good result again for NZ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  4@h could have gone down 2 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@dX was made in OR|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzpb: thinking how to approach diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: first spade, then diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking what the double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 12-15 was said|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: she has 11pt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems hopeless on this layout|pg||
nt|andyv:  so NS will win imps no matter what happens here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Predictably they played previous in 3D in open room|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  the dbl by S should guide declarer on how to play the @s suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: anyway everything is lieing very well for EW, and they can't lose anything but 2 aces, so slipping a bit wouldn't matter here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|cicus: a good slam here - in fact laydown if S plays it at NT (not possible now)|pg||
nt|ahalim: EW have a sacrifice in the majors but will not bid it|pg||
nt|tomi2: non vuln / vuln with 55 in majors many will bid wests hand, even with that weak suits|pg||
nt|ahalim: right and then probably will find the save|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: bessis took out 6@c but put it back in the bidding box|pg||
pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: reverse attitude discard-3 down for sure|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|cicus: 12 sure tricks without needing the spade finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but since @SK onside it doesn't matter who plays it -- yes, that's resulting|pg||
nt|jaker: defense needs to be careful,trump switch makes things easier|pg||
nt|jaker: q of hearts best now|pg||
nt|jaker: but I think any non-club is ok|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpb: takes time to think, long|pg||
nt|andyv:  the other clue is that N has shown at least 9 cards in @hs and @cs |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|hobakan: wd|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cicus: this is maybe better than 6NT from N - but 2 IMPs less|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: the other room is still bidding  4 so can't say if 2 imps in play or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: nice switch to @h, but S has doubled giving values|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cicus: the risk of 6@C is a @D ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all in all    6@C looks like a good spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are some transportation issues after @D lead [we know, but Cullin isn't aware that @CQ is singleton]|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, defence took their tricks in time|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  one more board of tiny decisions|pg||
nt|rhelle: on the previous board, it seems that the @d finesse is declarer's best hope|pg||
nt|rhelle: so a bit sloppy going 1 off ...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  First pickup by Japan, Baldursson bid 4 @d on bd4|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  a wild hand...5@d about par for hand but may be hard to stop there|pg||
nt|don_kapu: sorry - 2 = 8 imp|pg||
nt|fluffy: many pairs in the open series would open east's hand -----------Board 6--------------|pg||
nt|fluffy: because they play precision limited openings, but playing natural methids its a different story|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|sfoxa:  EW have to stop low|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South passed 4Sx - definitely a mistake unless she thought double was penalty - 21st century double shows values|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  4-3-3-3 is actually a good shape for notrump - people have wrongly been downgrading it for years|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: the tables do not seem to be connected and therefore their are no imp scores on each bd|pg||
nt|cicus: nice suit to overcall on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H lead director?|pg||
nt|andyv:  if S bids 2@s. W may be able to bid 4@d (leaping michaels)|pg||
nt|jaker: declarer had 9 of clubs, so didnt matter|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4NT?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for running scores in all matches. Select Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup or d'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|don_kapu: maybe last contract will be 3nt|pg||
mb|2D|nt|alunand14: Sawiruddin-Hartono play prec|pg||
nt|rhelle: disciplined pass by South|pg||
nt|skaftij:  CC says weak 2 in @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: can't see what the players ar writing about 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like at partscore - better play in @s|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpb: bidding is now faster.....than playing, as stated by Deas|pg||
nt|rhelle: however, North may now not find the @s lead|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 1@H - 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - ???|pg||
nt|fluffy: simons has 3 ways of bidding the hand now, 2NT straightforward, 2@s explaining the hand, or 2@c followed by 2NT conceiling the spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: am I the only one who cant reach the official WBF page since yesterday evening?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but D'Ovidio will certainly have a minmimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: I guess W is bidding 4@S now - he expects more strength at the right place|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the limited 1@h opener, EW may be able to stop in 5@d|pg||
nt|dburn:  OK - North bid hearts, not West, but North showed spades|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2c will work fine if pasman doenst pass and bids 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: meaning of 3@s was asked; natural >3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S is thinking to bid 6@c|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  so far so good, though 7th trick is to be found|pg||
nt|benjy: i still don't believe you would have upgraded that hand though|pg||
nt|ahalim: I have it right now|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhh, donny direct bid to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a large number of pairs in the Bermuda Bowl are playing  1m-(1@H)-1@S = 0-3@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: for them  DBL = 4/5@S and they have other bids for 6+@S|pg||
nt|rhelle: that said, both red suits are so kind for declarer, that 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahalim: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think i can read 9-13 on one of the notes|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@c is a decent contract anyway declarer will get better use of trumps than the defence I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade lead for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cicus: e.g. 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  2@H for INV+ and 2@S weak  is frequent treatment|pg||
nt|alunand14: 13 tricks now...........|pg||
nt|star6ija: after ruffing will W underlead has @DAce for second ruff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this should go down; @c A, @c, @h, small @d, @c and trumph again|pg||
nt|dgame: 4@h a bit better|pg||
nt|don_kapu: dont see the posible oh 6@C|pg||
nt|eweber: for the excuse of East can be said that it is difficult for her to imagine that partner has only 5@d for her jump to 5@d|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dburn:  might well have done - lots of intermediates|pg||
nt|pelu: can i explain 2@D - I cant find information on CC|pg||
nt|hobakan: minor investigation|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and he did|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and he does cheap insurance!?|pg||
nt|cicus: I cannot assess the merits of such an agreement but it is too popular to be bad|pg||
nt|pelu: tx :)|pg||
nt|pelu: = both majors|pg||
nt|jaker: 6d is an interesting spot. you have various choices for how to handle the hearts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|skaftij:  Not so much fuss here, straight to the slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  better from South as it happens, this - West doesn't have an obvious club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  but she may be put off a diamond by North's bid in the suit - not sure what that meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: according to the auction E may ask for Spade continuation though|pg||
nt|jaker: can hope for someone to have Kx or Qx, but if it's east, she can unblock the honor, so you normally try to cash it early, preferably by leading to it, before they see the danger|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is counting and counting and counting while looking at her cards|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn:  she wasn't, but that has blown a tempo for the defence, and declarer can get the long diamond going before the defence can get a club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|skaftij:  This cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: agree, one K off, one not|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: in the mean time, N went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is a little bit dangerous for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: politely asking the Japan for admittance|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my immediate reaction is that it has same benefit of all transfer responses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there is a large group - especially in north america  that wants to apply law of total tricks   so  Neg DBL = exactly 4@S and 1@S=5+|pg||
nt|cicus: that was a popular treatment here even before the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|cicus: can't tell why|pg||
nt|ahollan1: momentum|pg||
nt|rhelle: mmmm leading the @dQ is a losign play when South has the singleton K|pg||
nt|rhelle: so in general, when you don't have the 10, low to the J is better|pg||
nt|dgame: u rite kapu 12 or 13 imps for germany|pg||
nt|don_kapu: yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  assuning declarer plays that way, of course, and does not rely on a heart to the king|pg||
nt|benjy: can't she try both by leading a @D now|pg||
nt|dburn:  she can certainly combine chances in some way, yes|pg||
nt|hobakan: what about 4NT.. it's 4 th step.|pg||
nt|hobakan: 4@d:0-3 , 4@h:1-4 , 4@s:no Q , 4 NT:with Q..|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|star6ija: we have to point out that 4@s is ice cold contract, so some swing (even double game) is possible|pg||
nt|jaker: can also play for east to have 10x, by leading low to the 8 or 9, and then leading the j (intrafinesse)|pg||
nt|hobakan: 5@c= 2 keys + @dQueen plus one king out side.. may be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: that is not written on paper as expl.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N has given the decision back to S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: has S 2 hearts??? Eastes problem now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or has he spades (2)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E has @h A and @s 9 for replay|pg||

nt|glen: np, sometimes hard to tell the cast|pg||

nt|alunand14: if Hartono play @DK, 3 round @H and @CQ : 13 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  @h start helped with this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S has one king outside; 4@h, 4@d, one king, 2@s and 3@c or 3@s and 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: explanation from N to E on South's hand|pg||

nt|don_kapu: my uncle Alnando shd be the senior team|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eweber: with void in dummy she probably didn't get a count signal, but of course she should still try @s A and another @d|pg||

mb|3C|an|gf|nt|odysseus69: 2C rebid is more usual|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: well, south didn't think long before bidding it|pg||

nt|don_kapu: very cheap bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: another simple balanced hadn rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: still only chance with the dummy she see|pg||
nt|pelu: could never cost|pg||
nt|eweber: ssure, this is what I said, but defense was not as silly as it looks with open cards|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it is certainly key part of Meckwell [RM Precision] and  RM Lite which is played by many top US pairs now|pg||
nt|cicus: makes competitive bidding easier but constructive bidding as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure the adjustment was to improve constructive bidding|pg||
nt|fluffy: depending on your agreements, 1@c-1NT might deny 4@d cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: it that's the case simons might have opted to play 3@c instead of 1NT, but she decided to stay at a low lever this time|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now they may not find club fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6NT no good|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  3@h was not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit sitting favorably for declarer, 3@s should make...losing 1@s, 2@h and 1@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W want to go to slam; 4@s is a cue|pg||
nt|fluffy: defence might cash first 9 tricks for down 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: the USA women play slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this will make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is a demonstration of why 2C is the right rebid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see how South can bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it seems very hard now to reach the best slam; 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [having played some form of big club since 1971]|pg||
nt|pelu: Gernamy in 6@d - no D so 11 IMP for Germany|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ohoh, S trying to create entry for a @D lead, no luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: im sorry missed a pass,|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 club ruffs are enough to win (as we see)|pg||
nt|tomi2: in that 6m hand we see many tables bidding and some making contracts like 6NT or 7 in a minor. 7 Clubs oftn fails because the @SA is on lead, 7@D makes on some tables. Did not spot ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: that the French auction here is so good, but nowadays Blackwood is out of fashion, so well done to them ;)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: assuming 4NT quantitative|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: bd 20 india gained 12 imps but it is subject to a td ruling here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: slowly|pg||

nt|skaftij:  bd 5, East lead @d ace so 4@h making, 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: club ruff|pg||
nt|benjy: I'm afraid I have to go, goodluck England, thanks David|pg||
nt|don_kapu: NS can competitive till 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no expl. on 4NT given|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy to reach after 2C rebid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  declarer will soon discover !A onside|pg||
nt|rhelle: The Moysian fit ... with the trumps so well placed, it's bound to succeed as well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  The @s position MAY yield 3 tricks for the defense if S had lead jack|pg||
nt|hobakan: not a good time for rasing to 5|pg||
nt|jaker: perhaps a misunderstanding. When you play both Jacoby and texas transfers, normally one of them is a slam try, and the other is sign-off. The auction suggests that they may have ...|pg||
nt|jaker: been on different wave lengths|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: misunderstanding about 4@h bid, W thinks it was for slam, E to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they just discussed this (in Italian.... ;))|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :0|pg||
nt|fluffy: they need not to block the hearts though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: he had a tough lead, trumps excluded and 4 small also unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: I sympathize with him if that matters much|pg||
nt|cicus: there is still hope for NS - a @H ruff and maybe declarer won't pick up spades|pg||
nt|cicus: very faint chance, to be sure|pg||
nt|farrukh: and there was no need for a @h finesse actually...it was just a practice finesse:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: looked clumsy -- but a plus score|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hi Andy|pg||
nt|tomi2: uken opened a heavy 2@C (playing a strong club)|pg||
nt|tomi2: *Auken|pg||
nt|fluffy: --------board 8----------|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but a strange line :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahalim: 6@H shd not be too difficult to bid|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very :)|pg||
nt|pelu: both teams are going for a win - but they both can except a draw - but in bridge u cant play for a draw (as in soccer :))|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP     2@C=game force relay|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hope, EW methods allow them to bid a game|pg||
nt|andyv:  and you are right...@c ruff was found..in OR, 3@h was a disaster, going down 3 and 9 more imps to Italy which has taken the lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: well, you are missing an Ace and @hQ|pg||
nt|don_kapu: weak nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like stansby devaluated his hand to a 2@c rebid for being void in aprtner's suit|pg||
nt|fluffy: this sohouldn't be a problem for Migry, she has huge support and invitational or more values, she should bid at least 3@c now, but most likelly 2@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: this cant be right!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=5-7zz, some splinter  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]|pg||
nt|star6ija: board 21 is another example of adantage of quick entering the auction...12 IMPs to USA1 because of openning 2@h with 2 Aces|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2 choice of lead, 10@C or @S 4 if i am right|pg||
nt|don_kapu: ohhhh there is a double|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so the notes are wrong  or Upmark misbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: players not alerting much. They discussed it before the match, so obvious alerts aren't made|pg||
nt|fluffy: wow, splinter|pg||
nt|fluffy: I guess that 1@s shows 5 cards|pg||
nt|fluffy: otherwise she wouldn't splinter giving up the spade fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpb: issue with bbo|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice bid of 3@ss showing willing to play 3N with @s stopper|pg||
nt|fluffy: @hK singleton is not a great card, but 5 trumps and a good hand is pehaps worth it|pg||
mb|2N|an|minors|nt|roswolf: north must have opened 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: nothing wrong with this contract|pg||
nt|alunand14: yes, I also wonder why sawiruddin also play as a beginner?|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am not sure what this pass means|pg||
nt|pelu: accept a draw :(:( - need a new keybord|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to BBO Voice Commentary [both tables in BB:Italy vs Bulgaria]|pg||
nt|ahalim: yes trump Q missing, but you have a 6-3 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but I will do them for the spectators|pg||
nt|pelu: how do u play that D? - most players: dont play my suit (they exp that partner often will lead the suit|pg||
nt|don_kapu: now NS in trouble|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North chose not to open so all quiet |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the top 8 will go on with the Quarter Finals tomorrow|pg||
mb|3C|nt|skaftij:  Will probably end up in 6|pg||
nt|skaftij:  -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: live scores under  http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will probably need to set up @d suit to pitch a @h or a @c (or both)|pg||
nt|tomi2: west may hope partner has 4 hearts|pg||
nt|jaker: propelled them too high. E and W both aggressive|pg||
nt|fluffy: Stansby is now on dream land it will be very hard to stop her before 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now they will end in 4-3 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: E thinks about his hand ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, N will actually not need any pitches from the @d suit as cards lie...but still, will set up the @ds for a @h pitch|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will another big swing for NS as 1N was bid and made in CR|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2@D = not agree of 2@C and South can bid anything ecxept @C|pg||
nt|fluffy: what is she expecting to lose in 6@c I can't understand|pg||
nt|fluffy: well, if partner doesn't have @dQ there is a problem having to ruff too many things|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: X plus 4@h seems quite aggressive |pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H could be down one here|pg||
nt|pelu: @C-lead to Q and @DK would defeat, but still problems|pg||
nt|eweber: OPen is playing 3@h only|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Cullin is just making forcing noises -- Upmark clarifying hand   we just don't know the specifics|pg||
nt|andyv:  N doesn't know yet how favorably everything lies for her|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Kibs - tell me - what do u normal play here?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - South did bid clubs this time- she learns fast|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzpb: does 2@h show 6-card? then with 4 trumps can show @hQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: I think they rebid 2@H with nothing extra to say|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: E promised a stronger hand than she has|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: however clarification of 2@c opening unclear|pg||
nt|eweber: oops|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rhelle: 1@c is a stretch, as far as I'm concerned. I'd be happy to pass that West hand. 12 points, but such a load of cr.p ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: In the end , I think East does well not to make a further slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W wins @d and returns @h, N will have to put up the K|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: interesting bidding here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: seems a strange decision at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: fortunately the @CA is right|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer needs to "unblock" the spade ace next|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 6 OR: Jonsson plays 5@c D for a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|star6ija: they reached good contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: still IMO she passed too quickly, the hand deserved a deeper consideration|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@H is the right target - trump losers may be a problem if spades are chosen|pg||
nt|farrukh: if i remember these relays correctly, N has shown 6+@s in a balanced hand and his controls, either in standard way or in zz terms|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its all about jack of diamonds|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|don_kapu: no double no trouble|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  W will have to shift to @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  moment of truth|pg||
nt|star6ija: even if they tried to find better spot bidding 3N, I doubt E would leave them there having 11 cards in major|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess about 2@D response came from Nystrom-Bertheau Supplementary Notes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assumed same relay structure even though they use different opening 2-bids|pg||
nt|cicus: upmark-cullin system notes (page 4) confirm your explanation, Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 7   Nystrom-Bertheau got shut out of @S, sold to 2@C South  and Pakistan on the board with 11 imps|pg||
nt|farrukh: if S is thinking so long there may have been some glitch in the relays|pg||
nt|pelu: most kibs: dont play my suit! - bit for sure here Fredin wont @C-lead :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahalim: this will be a fast claim|pg||
nt|hobakan: 15 and 5 cards @c.. pd passed hand.. are u agree with 2 NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: no|pg||
nt|hobakan: if 2@c-p-p.. pd can bid|pg||
nt|eweber: open is playing bd 22|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn:  1@h spades, 2NT spade raise|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cicus: as I said I think this is slightly inferior to 6@H but OK now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Masood currently in 6@H but Ahmed still has a bid|pg||
nt|cicus: as the cards lie|pg||
nt|alunand14: lah, menang @S mestinya cabut trump dulu ?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W explained his X as " I think it will go down" on the paper|pg||
nt|fluffy: partner's failure to bid 4@s is not bad news after all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: now declarer will have a sinking feeling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H in other room|pg||
nt|hobakan: but of course unlucky diamond distribution..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cicus: two playing options here - either draw trumps and hope @Hs come in or try to ruff a @D then draw trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since both majors split 32  i think this makes -- just make sure to win this trick in hand that ensures reentry to dummy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think it was possible for east to ask for aces and Queen, pls correct me if I am wrong|pg||
nt|penseur9: still looks like two @C and a @S looser|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @s9 in S wd be better|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: @sQ now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: then E must play @d|pg||
nt|pelu: or even more - she know now the W cant have @sKx |pg||
nt|penseur9: sorry be right back|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|alunand14: ya, tp tetap lbh berrisiko kalo ga cabut trum :(|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: which he's done|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing 3 rounds of trumps is wise|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a groan from part of the gallery and cheer from the other|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East marked with 5-5-2-1 and odds favour Jack with West|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: now relief|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer has 5 trump tricks, 3 @c, 1@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: and trying to ruff the 4th @c in dummy seems called for|pg||
nt|rhelle: so now declarer is struggling, and needs to do some good guessing to avoid going down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you cannot do cue's and asking for trump Q|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: after 7 the score is 18-10 to india|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: n ow question is A8 or Jack 8|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cicus: I think drawing trumps is right because of the possibility of a singleton honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i confess i didn't even see option to ruff @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rhelle: the @d 10 back seems obvious now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cicus: make the screen brighter|pg||
nt|rhelle: this works too, but is riskier - if East had AK98 of @c, it would hand the game back to her|pg||
nt|eweber: well played|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: and they are all back now.|pg||
nt|rhelle: but a deserved 10 IMPs to Germany, IMHO|pg||
nt|andyv:  N's thinking should have been:  If I have to play @hs, I will have to lead to my King...EW are not here to help me so I should stick to my original plan.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N/S are discussing that 3NT should have been the right contract, the 3@s bid was confusing (normally dbl would ask for a stopper)|pg||
nt|tomi2: lucky board for Germany here|pg||
nt|pelu: again East missed the defense - but it has been a long tournament|pg||
nt|penseur9: back|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i miscounted tricks - recurring error- sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: then he had to bid 4nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: always made after @sQ GIB told us|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: they play 3 sets per day with short breaks between matches  but then get to enjoy the evening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a wonderful concept|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cicus: many would have overcalled an offshape 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: so no error|pg||
mb|3C|an|asking for 4 or 5 card M|nt|vugraphzpb: standard bidding, 2 @s will be the end contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl looks like it's game forcing|pg||
nt|star6ija: interesting point...all this depends on agreements|pg||

nt|pelu: Fredin hate to pass :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: still in the tank|pg||
mb|3N|an|no 4/5 card M|nt|ahollan1: or 1@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, misread the opening bid...simply a negative dbl|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@C = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Bulgaria in 3@h in OR|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade lead would help|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north might regret re opening|pg||
nt|glen: hopefully they can use 2NT here to get to 5-3 @C fit|pg||
nt|glen: or pass|pg||
nt|glen: to get N to pick|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point glen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Anyone for balancing with East hand? Would end up in 4@s, unmakable|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: hmm, I expected 4@S from S but the vulnerability biased him|pg||
nt|odysseus69: £NT probably no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hate to confess i would lead a spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North does not want to lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: still 3@C is not good with no ruffing value in the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: some of my partnerships would play pass by S here to play 2@SXX|pg||
nt|fluffy: spade lead was good news in theory, but declarer is a bit stuack in her own hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: she makes if she plays for @h 3-3 and @s 4-3 obviously, but is tehre a better chance?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: found best - I confess I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for their feast|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: oeps, this can get nasty|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: 4@S??  at which point|pg||
nt|rhelle: A delicate 2NT contract|pg||
nt|tomi2: west worked out partner should be short in @D here|pg||
nt|penseur9: fatigue may be setting in for the Canadian pair since they're only 4 player team|pg||
nt|eweber: 2! was 2way checkback, asking N to bid 2@d|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may be a good save by NS as 4@h can make |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cross ruff seems an approach to take|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2: the small @D might be a mistake|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cicus: immediately over the double|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  proper contract (if only NS hands in consideration), and hardly found @cA lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite impossible to find without clues from the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: another chance now for the defense|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: balancing double  =  never jump to game   not to mention hasn't guaranteed 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not consider passing, but also did not look at the colours|pg||
nt|cicus: you are right, 4 spades were not guaranteed|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being corrected, apparently 5 member team|pg||
nt|penseur9: 6 members|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nystrom opened East hand  1N=14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ahmed playing 2@S North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand much easier to play seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|cicus: very true - drawing trumps results in only 8 tricks if @S do not break|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  apparently, N couldn't have singleton @c after 1NT opening|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however this should make- South in big trouble on run of diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|glen: EW have a zillion years of experience and they know there's blood in the water|pg||
nt|glen: hence everything by NS will get X'ed|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for bidding 3NT as South|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually I don't think cross ruff is necessary here, because E knows where all the points are|pg||
nt|jaker: nice lead. Too bad for her the 8 and 7 of spades aren't reversed. As it is, suit is blocked|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|roswolf: they could have let e/w play in 2@S quietly|pg||

nt|don_kapu: now must play @D to 10 or Q for - 1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  well done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle: if the @c run, you may well make 9. If they don't, you may not even make 8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: she must cash @dAQ before conceding a heart, else west will play a diamond to endplay her back|pg||
nt|pelu: there are CCs for 3 pairs|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  K@c and @c, @h return and 3rd @c to take the maximum no. of tricks|pg||
nt|fluffy: stansby foreseeing this is trhining about unblocking the hearts, kudos if she finds it|pg||
nt|fluffy: obvious danger is, declarer might have @h10!|pg||

nt|andyv:  this was not best for the defense|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: some credit to Nystrom for opening 1N=14-16  i think might be easier for North to bid more than 2@S than for South to take another call|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm    remember to refresh screen to get updates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy having a very big set against Bulgaria   that puts Italy almost half a match ahead of 2nd place Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: don't know why, but she did it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I stand corrected...the @h play doen't cost anything|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|nt|eweber: but I dare saying that both teams have their best pair sitting in the other room|pg||
pc|h5|nt|skaftij:  Needed an unprobable shift to a low @D to beat this certainly|pg||

nt|ahollan1: all 3 world championship events:  bermuda bowl (open), venice cup (women), d'orsi cup (seniors)  have 22 teams|pg||

nt|star6ija: another 2 IMPs for Japan|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|skaftij:  West needed to jettisom @cA |pg||

nt|fluffy: declarer forgot to cash @dAQ and now is in trouble|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|glen: one more @S by the defense now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: score is not correct of this match, sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: please watch the live scores|pg||
nt|andyv:  as has been pointed out to me, the return of a low @h by E was a master stroke and allowing the defense a chance to set this 4 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty for info rob|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 8 qualify to the Knockout Phase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how high does West go over strong 1@C??   vul opposite passed partner, but 74 ...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  then gets trump promotion|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 3 imps for italy|pg||
nt|tomi2: normally the small @D shows an entry in the small side suit, that is hearts here. Nehmert could have underlead the ace hoping to get another ruff this way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: my fault, 4@h would have been down after either a @s or a @d continuation|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North dd lead a spade in open room but 3NT should always make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Gordon-Reus is the strong pair on the cadian team: No 2 in the >Butler-ranking + 1,07|pg||
mb|1C|nt|pelu: 15-17 (14-16 nv)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: Running Scores: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl For VC and SB scroll to the bottom of the page, where you find the links to the scoreboards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: also livestream at that site|pg||
nt|don_kapu: 6@S if NS can reach the bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: just blame GIB - normal I lose to GIB :)|pg||
nt|eweber: right, and von Arnim - Auken may not be first in butler, but surely one of the strongest women pairs in the world|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: somebody told me GIB was saying that, but he erred|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Elke, but here they have played up to their best (yet)|pg||
nt|eweber: I like to have the option to double a strong NT for pen|pg||
nt|penseur9: west is one card from a Yarborough (all cards 9s or less :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: some people seem to be asleep in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :-)|pg||
nt|hobakan: 2@c or 3@c?|pg||
nt|eweber: most pairs play conv X vs strong NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what now for South?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: does 1S promise 5 - it does for many|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|cicus: yessss! that is my bid|pg||
nt|don_kapu: let's see, somebody chat me thats easy to make a 6@S contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is easy option|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl. was given that 1@s is a five card|pg||
mb|2S|an|gf|nt|sfoxa:  magician will bid and win 4@h here|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H = 5@H and 4+minor|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps RKCB now|pg||
nt|glen: 4@S red on 4-2-2-5 could get killed on other layouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H in other room   Bertheau overcalled 1@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW @S spots just good enough to allow this to make|pg||
nt|hobakan: normal with short in @h..|pg||
nt|don_kapu: if N bid 4@C whats thats meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: 2nt bid is not understood by Deas, acc. East|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: shaking her head (E)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again a long thinking pause ahead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: reply to 2nt was not expected|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and in the mean time, West is taking some chocolate!!|pg||
nt|rhelle: looks like 2@d was inverted|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: confused|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 paretscore-swing for Sweden = 19 IMP|pg||
nt|fluffy: an easy trasnfer hand sets the contract in a compfortable 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true glen|pg||
nt|glen: better to X 3@S to show support|pg||
nt|fluffy: when you hold 5 card major it is the percentage thing to play in your major opposite a balanced hand|pg||
nt|fluffy: no matter what kind of suit you have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S game forcing is most unusual |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S does show 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now N is writing down that to accept gf invitation, she must have extra values....?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: cannot ready completely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cicus: but I am ultra aggressive in such situations, those not so crazy would bid only 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4@d, 2@c a @s and a @h E will have to find 2 tricks...one could come from the @c suit if either finesse works|pg||
nt|andyv:  and that will be tested first|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  first step done. what about the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i think normal play is to get hearts wrong|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  there is no problem with @s guess - the A must be onside. the problem is in guessing @h correctly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: as playing heart to the jack also caters with AQx onside|pg||
nt|dgame: slam interest|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzpb: 3nt is expl. as balanced, 12,13pt|pg||
nt|jaker: feels like N could have made it more difficult my playing the K of spades at trick one, although S didn't promise such good spots|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11 tricks from top with club A gone, 12 with spade finesse|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4 losers in the red suits - defence need to take their @s trick before it goes on @cs|pg||
nt|rhelle: great lead!|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@h here depends on 3-2 trump break and successfu @c finesse|pg||
nt|pelu: in my opinion u normal dont need X for penalty - the weak hand can now take out in 5 card minor - I prefer that D = 5 card minor + 4 card major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you need it if somebody psyches a 1NT opener|pg||
nt|pelu: and u need to take 800 if u have game|pg||
nt|eweber: this is valid vs wk nt as well|pg||
nt|pelu: against weak NT D = penalty - for sure|pg||
nt|eweber: I play differnt methods with different partners and I can say that I miss the pen X more often then the 4M5m when I play the other sys|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i wouldn't object to 1@S, 2@S or 3@S in this situation|pg||
pc|d9|nt|glen: does E lead a @S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: from north's point of view couldnt south still have a small doubleton club?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@h was Game forcing|pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h will make on any lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: it also might be made if E decides to lead Q of Spades instead of @D Jack|pg||
nt|star6ija: or as Danny Sprung pointed via black squeeze, which on the actual layout doesn't work|pg||
pc|dK|nt|glen: even though S is hort|pg||
nt|pelu: I cant seew any play for 2Nt - only if NS help declarer :)|pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=882|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|glen: *short|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see if the ladies' secret weapon - intuition - will work|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpb: sorry error in the auction|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  not this time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  BD 7, Jonsson led a @s. Now a @h shift was required but not found. tough defense|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in 3Nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Moment of truth in OR, |pg||
nt|skaftij:  6@h is slightly better because a @c can be ditched on @s Queen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  OR is 2 boards behind designated time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Interesting deals in this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very long pause for the outcome, questions asked to N on bidding|pg||
nt|star6ija: some tricky move would be N to play small @c from dummy to put pressure over W if he had the King|pg||
nt|dgame: 6@s cold|pg||
nt|don_kapu: like ice cream|pg||
nt|pelu: lets see here - there are play for 3NT - but hard work - how is 2@hs?|pg||
nt|eweber: Germany place 4 at the moment, CDN 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: small @h now|pg||
nt|pelu: the missed defense in B21+B24 cost Canada 28 IMP!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: only reject  Pass and 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: now 11|pg||
nt|fluffy: as long as partner has at least 2 cards in your suit you are better in 2M than 1NT becaus eif he has 3, well you have a fit, if he doesn't, then you probably won't have the entrys ...|pg||
nt|fluffy: to stablish the suit anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: unless playing in a trump contract|pg||
nt|eweber: small @h would have been my lead in this aution|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  E may well need the 9@s as a throw in card to endplay N in the @h and/or @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  acutally, scratch the last statement|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|glen: no, makes the good lead and its a push|pg||
nt|star6ija: he can afford to lose this trick|pg||
nt|star6ija: so let's see what it will be|pg||
nt|pelu: now 7 tricks on a endplay of S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  celand and China  got penalty for slow play |pg||
nt|andyv:  E up to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hard to avoid in this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|jaker: then, if declarer ducks a trump comes through, and if he wins and plays a spade, S can win and cash spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzpb: south knows from the lead that west has another diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: so shouldn't go wrong here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but possibility to go wrong still exists for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: north knows west started with 7 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: otherwise south wouldn't overtake|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: unfortunate lead|pg||
nt|star6ija: depends on the point of view|pg||
pc|s9|nt|star6ija: N may find it fortunate :)|pg||
nt|dgame: claim all|pg||
nt|don_kapu: time to claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: mine too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eweber: sometimes it might cost a @h trick, but my experience tells me it is worth the risk|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N is deciding in what order to play the tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: But E in OR in 3@C - not better|pg||
pc|s7|nt|skaftij:  BD 8 OR, Kaku in East took the slow approach bidding 3@D iso 4@C. Ended in 3NT so Japan is levelling the match|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|penseur9: @Squeen, smal @S ruff and @D...|pg||

pc|h2|nt|star6ija: what about the slam...3-2 is 68 % and @c King onside is half of this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rhelle: now another @h takes the trump entry away before @cs are unblocked|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|glen: but south is happy with just one|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: claimed quickly when W had also @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky for West|pg||
nt|cicus: well, I lost 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, I can hardly imagine N's reasoning|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but well done by palmer to give them a chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: south will have shown her diamond count, so north's only chance was to cash @cA|pg||
nt|pelu: E only down 1 in 3@C ??|pg||
nt|jaker: a low club instead of the ace would have been an interesting play|pg||
nt|eweber: you never know :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Sabine Auken also 1NT, but pass from S and now 2@C from von Arnim!? - 2@H pas pas pas|pg||
nt|eweber: predictions are sometimes difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong|nt|ahollan1: 1@H max of 15 HCP|pg||

nt|penseur9: always difficult :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cicus: but you saw that Mohiudd bid it first :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=good raise of @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  most likely 3N will be final contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: half time now|pg||
nt|star6ija: even at this high level (World Championship) W may not duck, having doubleton King|pg||
mb|2S|nt|glen: never accept the trojan club|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is a red-blooded 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may invite slam|pg||
nt|odysseus69: grand here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: after bd 25 25-11 to India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with passive defense (@h lead) it will go down|pg||
nt|eweber: as far as I know 2@c asked for 4card @h in their sys|pg||
mb|5S|nt|alunand14: small slam from N|pg||
nt|rhelle: after this sequence, North can envisage @c shortage in her partner's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S had a re-double in her hand and then decided for 4@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: still, 4@h is a bit lazy, with this fine-looking hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@c is normally invitational or better - so it sets @h as trump suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: which means XX to show 1st round control looks perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: what would 3@S by S have meant??|pg||
nt|rhelle: we can see that 6@s is perhaps a superior contract|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@h alerted, probably weak, nice treatment when you ahppen to hold that hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good bid by South|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: but then cashing @cA also isn't wrong, the 3rd spade will go on the @dJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@s is natural, I'd think|pg||
nt|star6ija: also with C Jack or with @D JAck|pg||
nt|eweber: so pd will never bid 2@s and this is a chance to escape|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rhelle: but I don't think South is strong enough for that|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1Nt is  15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H was not invitational|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Japan heading for 4@s in OR on bd 9, East opened|pg||
nt|star6ija: Danny Sprung clearified this openning of 1 @d...always unbalanced with 5+@d or 4441|pg||
nt|fluffy: pasman scared of the 4 levl since she doesn't like the sapde void, will simons show upport at 4 level?|pg||
nt|pelu: very clever :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: nopes, and stansby steals their 11 card fit with the preempt, preempts work|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: a 9 count 2/1 in the open room got EW to 3NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: I am wondering if they can stop here|pg||
nt|dgame: should be playing carefully|pg||
nt|pelu: not after this lead :) - 13 tricks :)|pg||

nt|penseur9: six may make but not on @S lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|alunand14: X of hartono already make slam missing from S|pg||
nt|rhelle: great 5@d bid from North|pg||
nt|rhelle: save her partner's ass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl. of 4@d was not correct apparently|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11-25 (bra-ind) now|pg||
nt|star6ija: ah...4@d is may be Blackwood (Gene Saxe's statement)|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR Sweden has found the @S-fit as NS (:()|pg||
nt|pelu: playing 4@SD|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very tame bidding by Canada in open room|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: same contract other room, but EW never in the auction after  1@H-1@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: this more like a pairs auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W is not happy with delayed 3@h bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is called again!!|pg||
nt|glen: the thing is N had nothing to think about over 3@D|pg||
nt|fluffy: she might make the contract is she guesses @cJ and trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fluffy: simons playing @hK intuitively but its a small mistake, when aprtner leads trumps she might have @hKxx but she won't lead trumps from @hQxx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|glen: 2@H had some risk in a potential misfit auction, there was no way N was bidding again|pg||
nt|roswolf: with screens hesitations are less likely to cause adjustments|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: it is about thinking of N and thereafter bidding of S of 3@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD is present bud bidding is not ended....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @d play will probably be the issue here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: I can't see the purpose of 1@S response|pg||
nt|alunand14: 11 imp's for indonesia and draw now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: the brazilians here are rattled i think|pg||
nt|glen: but N had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W raises his hands on pass of S after 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a wild shot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: pass cards of W are not in sequential order on the tray, TD is now called by N|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled as south  - west has lost his cool|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: again fireworks?|pg||
nt|glen: sometimes you need to "calm the fuss down" to think clearly, but the fireworks can be distracting|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand is all about the @CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they are discussing pauses of W, N and E now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: during the bidding|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: at least 2 IMPs US thanking to the rifhtsided contract|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: there is also a lontg way to go in this tournament|pg||
nt|glen: S thinks "maybe I should have paused too, not be left out"|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wonder if east will consider cashing out for -1!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the pass after 2@s is the issue|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @c switch seems likely|pg||
nt|tomi2: France avoided the slam missing the ace and @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: so 10 imps were kind of randomly given to Germany depending on the position of the @HQ|pg||
nt|dgame: calculate the posibility 4-1 Break og @h|pg||

nt|dgame: no sugar :(|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpb: this does not seem to be well played|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson needs to play on @d now....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: asking about leads and signals now by E|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: many play  East 2@S would be natural, but maybe needs 6th @S or better hand|pg||
nt|eweber: and vs 6 South might double to avoid the @d lead|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: i don't see how she can make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and the scorer of the usa has fallen asleep again....|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skaftij:  Does he have a hunch about the @s position?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 1@S response wouldn't occur to me either -- unless playing Kaplan Inversion where 1@S=forcing NT equivalent|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
mc|13|nt|glen: at 50 for the extra down trick, he will take the @C finesse|pg||

nt|vugraphzpb: this was not the most exciting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: would you have played a @d to the 10?|pg||

nt|andyv:  heading|pg||

nt|dgame: 2@s?|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|sfoxa:  the lay of the cards isn't very pleased for EW (rather playing partscore in @s)|pg||

nt|fluffy: Migry biddig 2@s wich I suspect is a transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|eweber: well, some pairs might reach 6 by jumping in somehow|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H down 1 - card by card same play as here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: well 6@D OBJECTIVELY is good once east overcalls|pg||
nt|roswolf: i suspect n/s might bid this|pg||
nt|fluffy: asking partner if she is maximum or minimum|pg||
mb|d|an|!h|nt|glen: don't you need to play @S K83 opposite @S J72 for one loser?|pg||

nt|odysseus69: very aggressive double|pg||

nt|pelu: I see: alert SW on 2Nt - but prob no alert by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S whispered: "minors"|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed glen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction will NOT be duplicated since  Nystrom's 1/2/3 seat favorable 1N=10-12|pg||
nt|andyv:  the QJ@d made N put on the brakes|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this auction, the lead should be read as a singleton...W would otherwise lead a top @d|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is your everyday 1NT-2NT-3NT auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but defence isn't a pleasant walk, too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: palmer not enquiring about the 1NT range here|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt hard work, but on @H-lead S can make 4@S (DD: @HQ + 3x@S from top)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this is going too high for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpb: nice though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: W seems to be in trance now|pg||
nt|dgame: oh no|pg||
pc|dK|nt|skaftij:  this should make an overtrick or 2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S did not read it that way|pg||
nt|tomi2: this is an interesting spot, they have two 8 card fits. in clubs they even have all spotcards but one defender holds the "straight flush"|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont like that lead - my 3rd choice|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hobakan: 5 card Majör include 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: apparantly|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: expl was asked and given at the table|pg||
nt|pelu: almost fee fines - later she can discard her @C-loser|pg||
nt|pelu: tree finess|pg||
nt|pelu: free :)|pg||
nt|eweber: @hQ can't cost much, except for a poss @d ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: S know that East has !A or K, so finess with odds|pg||
nt|pelu: @DA (K)|pg||
nt|eweber: right 17 HCP missing only|pg||
nt|pelu: also lead 3. best so ) here promise K|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle: I'm not sure playing the @sK, when you know the ace is behind, is that great a play|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 9@D upside-down attitude|pg||
nt|star6ija: they avoided the risky contract of 4@h|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tomi2: @SK onside but spades 4-1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hey everyone hey peter:)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry partner -- don't like those either|pg||
nt|dgame: 6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should still be 2 down - |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: including the spade finesse and the dropping 8 they have 4@S 4@C and two aces, so they need two ruffs, but then trumps 4-1 might cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: if i can read the notes correctly, south is telling that 3@h showed fit and short @d|pg||
nt|tomi2: don't understand wests double here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: at least i can read ' 4315' |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahalim: I think W thought E was on lead :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: my (and for some other ones as well) first thought was, she forgot to be on lead hersef and wanted to get a club lead from partner|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: why that - ??|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rhelle: there are 2 discards in dummy ... but only 1 entry. How to draw trumps and get to dummy?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well take ace and exit with diamond|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|andreasw:  haha:))|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|pelu: against best defense 1NT could go down : @S from W in on @HA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzpb: kamer 21|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play heart to 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: difficult contract for E, she has to decide to stay in dummy or not |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ruilen....?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to stay and play heart from table|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably counted 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andreasw:  did not see the entire hand:) was looking at board 27 and 4@s seems only to be down 1?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sfoxa:  the best S's move seems to cash @hA and play a @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this line allows N to get her @c trick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: only 5 tricks played - I exp down 2|pg||

nt|hedyg:  catching up with the crash|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: sorry all, but i couldn't load the board|pg||

nt|pelu: Trick 6: @SQ from S, @SK from W and @SA from East :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: back to pasman who can bid pass or 4@s|pg||
nt|fluffy: and she goes quietly since she is balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: this is a good general rule when responding to take out doubles at high level, pass if you are balanced|pg||
nt|fluffy: here sadly, one or partner's aces isn't cashing, and @sQ is useless, and 4@c will make in comfort|pg||

nt|pelu: 3@c was Bergen - only invit to 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N not forcing    DBL obviously takeout  a great treatment, especially in context of Big Club|pg||

nt|andreasw:  after picking up 6-5 on last hand north now picked up a 6-4:)) lovely cards to hold|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I apologize|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surpring pass by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  n-s might end up in slam if S bids 4@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  the light overcall will steer NS away from the @h suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may well bid 2N here|pg||
nt|pelu: Back again - serius tecnical problems - every 15 min a have lost connection to Internet :(:(:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: wlc back|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: multi is a convention for strong minor and weak M hands|pg||
pc|hT|nt|skaftij:  East intended to show 1819 bal - W is using transfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: leaving N/S from @h or @c contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: What about a beer Elke?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: changed now - 3NT not much fun nor even 2NT -multi still creates discomfort|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this seems doomed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 5@CX is better but still 5 top losers vulnerable will be 800 against nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: did it end there?|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question is whether she feels she has enough to try for 3N.|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@c was negative freebid, nf|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they alerted 2@c because it was not-forcing|pg||
nt|eweber: np|pg||
nt|pelu: no coffee for her and wine for us :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpb: short breaks of sleeping|pg||

nt|hedyg:  yes ty|pg||
nt|eweber: you deserve a beer for your job :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: odd that N did not X this - can it be that would als have been T/O?|pg||
nt|rhelle: go, Pony, you never find KJ9x behind you|pg||
pc|hA|nt|star6ija: with no trump lead now the cross ruff is open|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: but even played by west is likely to go down|pg||
nt|fluffy: everybody making very reasonable decisions so far|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this seems doomed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky N found @dA by partner, not the @cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1N bid may actually have helped NS|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  good lead to knock out an entry into the N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: they have time trouble 3boards in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|jaker: in the other room, west passed the 2d opening, and NS got to a very reasonable 4h contract, which i guess failed on a club ruff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: now can develop @C suit for @D discard|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson could bid 3@D = 18-19 with 4 card support in @H, wonder why he shunned that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's a 10-imps gain for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 11 even|pg||
nt|rhelle: I daresay that there is a case for South competing with 2@s after the 2@c bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpb: he asked how much time was left; maybe he was in a hurry :-)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  good @d switch|pg||
nt|andreasw:  kib ask why W did not open 3@h insted of 2@h?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|alunand14: 6 imp's again for indonesia|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rhelle: but it all worked out in the end|pg||
nt|eweber: was I the one who needed a coffee? ;-) |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: but on that lead should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: very good switch to @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: this was not a good decision by E|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 2 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just needed 10x club with East|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: @S765 nothing to brag about -- no defense if EW run  ...  take the non-vul plus seems right|pg||
nt|eweber: I will take a wine as well|pg||
nt|pelu: why lead a singleton here - partner is favorit to no entries|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzpb: making again a new playing plan?|pg||

pc|d5|nt|glen: N can test declarer with @H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: should only lose etc:)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  however ..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west saves time by pitching club|pg||
nt|odysseus69: claim 1 down now|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzpb: she has to find the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or play @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1 @d + 2 @c + 2 @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: difficult to see|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks all for today, it has been a pleasure. Thanks to the kibitzers for the good comments especially Ãsak|pg||
nt|hedyg:  now a @H...who has the ace?|pg||
nt|fluffy: and best of all was pasman passing with 3@s in the end, stansby would had been glad had she opted to support at the 3 level|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Lauria made 5@H   seems everyone else treating west as 1-suiter|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: double game swing for France here|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3NT, or 6@d for NS - depending on @d finess that works|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and @s finess as well|pg||
nt|penseur9: is slam E/W biddable here?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: south resisting temptation|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S indeed thinking about 3nt......|pg||
nt|glen: S pausing for effect|pg||
nt|hedyg:  3 card bergen raise..i believe only in France|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahalim: frankly speaking : i don't like these bergen type raises with only 3-crd support|pg||
nt|pelu: 32 HCP but no fit but 6NT on - either @Ss 3-3 or @CK in S|pg||
nt|eweber: if West plays|pg||
nt|penseur9: how about 6@H?|pg||
nt|eweber: from E on a @c lead it is worse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: he resisted|pg||
nt|ritong: south had a tough problem to solve other table|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: sorry now i'm told both tables in Italy v Iceland played 5@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is something to be said for a 1NT overcall in North|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was not a bergen raise, it was simply an invitational raise with support|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N unintentionally moved the tray, before E had bid; they are making a joke about this also|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: and promptly E bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good time to play transfer leads|pg||
nt|cicus: bd 13 - lucky for Sweden that both pairs had their disaster on the same board - 16 IMP|pg||
nt|ritong: here, cronier did not create it  good decision|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im guessing one of the reasons would be his hand distrabution.. while 3@h would be weaker then 10-13 and can also hold 6@h aswell he wanted to show he "had something" |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: good lead|pg||
nt|pelu: the 2@H from W was contructiv: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: S should not take the first @c trick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: this lead sometimes causes problems for the defence|pg||
nt|penseur9: I'm being told that many tables in six |pg||
pc|c7|nt|andreasw:  the sweedish team only stood in 3@s on board 29 making 10 tricks so now bulgarya is in the lead with 3 boards to go|pg||
nt|pelu: East has prob now shown Gf+ values|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rhelle: after 1@h-2@h it gets tricky - East might have bid on 2 points|pg||
nt|penseur9: doesn't mean they all make :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have friend who would berate partner/teammates if they led from Jack -- even when it was right|pg||
nt|tomi2: their aim was not to preempt opps out of the auction, they would probably not do this with 7hcp only|pg||
nt|tomi2: they wanted to investigate the 4@S game|pg||
nt|ahalim: i said bergen type raises not bergen raises :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: if @sQ might show @sKQxx or @sQJx east doens't know if she should appeal or not|pg||
nt|fluffy: another spade obviously loses a trick for the defence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: or not  but they both did better than defend 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C strong in Open will prob lead to 6NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  in OR, W did not overcall 1@h but contract was still 3NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rhelle: or 9, maybe a bad 10|pg||
nt|rhelle: this could be another partscore swing - 2@h vs 2@s|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D GF and then only 2NT (stronger than 3NT) - why are West not slamgoing?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andreasw:  very close match!|pg||
nt|jaker: interesting result from USA senior 1 on board 6 where NS relayed but stopped in 5d. 6d was made on a heart lead when W pitched a spade and declarer guessed to discard a heart on ...|pg||
nt|jaker: the third spade from dummy, thus endplayed east to give a ruff sluff to get rid to the last  heart. that was nicely done|pg||
nt|fluffy: again stansby finds the best play, she has played extremlly well all this match|pg||
nt|penseur9: good question|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: I was overthinking bd 24. S should have ducked the first @d, then defence is chanceless|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: specs here missed a cool defense on  29|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: all that leads to ... should declarer duck at trick 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT are 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|pelu: very go0od lead - decl need @C-ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry|pg||
nt|hedyg:  they surely have other bids for 7 hcps support, 3@c and 3@d bergen raises are not preemptive either, only 3M is|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: simons wanted a quick club trick for some reason, the normal play in clubs is to finese QJ first|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andreasw:  with @d ace well placed i think he will make anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: now she is heading quickly for 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rhelle: the @sK didn't paralyse declarer|pg||

nt|alunand14: yes.... + 1|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D not 2@C???|pg||
nt|ritong: weird|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Dennis, thank you for the hard work done |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: you're welcome :) thank you for the commentary|pg||
nt|andyv:  whew|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Chance for England at the death, 6@D looks reasonable|pg||

nt|star6ija: thanks for all helpful comments|pg||
nt|hedyg:  and to Arifin and Thomas for guiding us through these boards|pg||

nt|andyv:  final board of this match.  thank you Pim for an excellent job as our vugraph coordinator.  And ty to all the specs for their participation.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: for live scores; http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks to my learned co-commentators Elke and Peter... |pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: or 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: weird = underbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 1@d is conventional|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: precision opening bids for EW    1@D should be 2+   2@C=6+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they've made 2@C DENY 4 card major  i'm checking cc now|pg||
nt|3for3: i dont think they play 1@D guarantees 2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, hope, kibs enjoyed comparing the matter of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: 3NT can't be beaten here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: chance now to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but east has a minimum, at least in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: maybe west should have bid it already|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: a vulnerable overcall at 2-level should show a good hand in my opinion|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ open team were in 5@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty to Andy|pg||
mb|1N|nt|farrukh: so it seems that there may be some ruling involved looking at the bidding and the table score for board 8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right Danny -- they play 2@D=mini-multi|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 31 proved to be a big swing for USA1|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like South needs to show her @H for NS to have a chance|pg||
nt|star6ija: also to Rob for his terrific job and to BBO for making possible to watch online this remarkable event|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thank you!|pg||
nt|fluffy: it might seem that this is not another balanced hand, but pasman might probe me wrong|pg||
nt|fluffy: look|pg||
nt|eweber: it is amazing that a single person can type everything in without mistakes, report comments and alerts from table, answer privat chat and analyse board 24 as well!|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: East lands on her feet ... :)|pg||
nt|eweber: thanks to you as well André :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kiwibridge: in their big win over USA2|pg||
nt|andyv:  S kept the auction open with a 1@s bid and game was easily reached|pg||
nt|penseur9: and we must yhank all our specs for their question and questions...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought other room played 6@H  but movie showing 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which way do you think score will be adjusted??|pg||
nt|rhelle: as the axe was getting perilously close to her neck |pg||
nt|pelu: ok last board here - tx to Rob our hard working operator, to Andreas for his help and to all kibs for their fine comments - see u i 1 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: N : "Sorry, could not resist"|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry Paul is our >Operator - :(:(|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: hehe|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Paul - Rob .. almost the same;)|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|farrukh: i am told that they played 6@h is right.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the chinese women even bought the contract now|pg||
nt|rmb1: We don't have the open room auction but they avoid two spade losers|pg||
nt|ahalim: Dennis must be good, just like his family name says : Stuurman|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@s seems to have a meaning if its been alerted|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes realy fantastic...|pg||
nt|penseur9: try questions and comments... :)|pg||
nt|eweber: @s threaten to be blocked|pg||
nt|pelu: can go down in 1Nt with a lot of play for 4@h|pg||
nt|penseur9: well... Canada over bid only one contract, their undoing was to underbid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C CHECKBACK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: see you tomorrow at 10 AM CET for the round 13...remember that places between 7th and 14th are in a 8 IMPs margin, so the interesting fights are stiil to come|pg||
nt|fluffy: probably the meaning is : I don't ahve fit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: likely end score Indonesia wins 49-39|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh  Note 26   2@C=6@C  no 4M but maybe 5M|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: just in time|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte could try the cue in pard's known shortness|pg||
nt|rhelle: on repeated trump leads, this may not be fun either|pg||
nt|rhelle: and what do we do against doubled partscores, boys and girls? We lead trumps|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 1|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N take the push?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  as cards lie this looks like +1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx to Rob for great work and and all kibitzers|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: but..|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: usa will be more secure after this match|pg||
nt|alunand14: wd INA :)|pg||
nt|pelu: here Auken-Arnim system with 2@C asking for 4 card @h would have worked perfect|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzpb: 2@s = 3 card spades|pg||
nt|farrukh: but now either it is operator error or Director's ruling, so we'll get the update shortly|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s taps could easily destroy this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  the vul may make E think twice about trying to make the hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: VPs*|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3NT facing 22-23 with no fit is normal|pg||
nt|fluffy: and the slam is buried|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: to pick up a few imps, instead of losing 11 if New Zealand would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: excellent!|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last board: thanks to operator (Karen?) and earlier commentators David Burn and Ben Green|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@d was gf checkback|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: D'Ovidio shaking her head when dummy came down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: ahhh   6@H moved back to 4@H was the adjustment|pg||
nt|farrukh: in fact most likely its a director's ruling because the score showed a pushed board and then it changed later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: here -1 (how to get @SQ SD:)?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Egypt-Israel  USA2-Italy  Brazil-USA1   all BB on voice tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: with @c cue they might...|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@H showed 4 @hs, did not deny 3 @ss|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fluffy: I had a very similar hand 2 months ago, and since then I ahve decided that 6 clubs on a 22 hand are worth 24 HCP|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  E will need to knock out the A of @cs first|pg||
nt|andyv:  then a 4th spade by S will set up a 2nd @h trick on the upper cut|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: indeed if no @D now still makes 4@S    IF IF IF:)|pg||
nt|alunand14: may be 13 imp's ...... ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @HA @DA @DK can as well|pg||
nt|alunand14: Romanski lead with @S 7:(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpb: S is in trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: TD came in to check if we where busy with last game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: only 4 min. left|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 8 tricks - bye all|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: some pairs don't have a way to show weak 4M+5m|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rhelle: that's more like it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pelu: and not so perfect defense cost 28 IMP|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rhelle: trumps, Pony ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: tries to work on double revoke I assume|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: Willard worried about @D losers after the  non-descript opening from Palmer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|penseur9: yes good point Peter|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now this is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|eweber: EW was not at all silent in the other room here|pg||
nt|pelu: and now 6 "hard" tricks for EW|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: the Q is a good card. If East ruffs @cs, the 2nd is with a trump winner|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  defense too friendly here...E will get off going down one|pg||
nt|hedyg:  yes she should have corrected to @s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 50 mins approx|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry 7 :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzpb: bye all, the next match starts in 1 hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but will go 1 down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: wonder if NS knew 4@D was length rather than shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: ty, see you!|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzpb: good defense play by Japan|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 49-39 congrats Indonesia|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks all...........|pg||
nt|alunand14: thanks Jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: selamat siang semua disana|pg||
nt|alunand14: selamat pagi di Veldhoven :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sudah malam:)?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok sore|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at my table  Muller forgoe opening strong 1@C and bought hand at 4@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...have fun the rest of this bermuda bowl.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Venice Cup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: venice cup this table :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|hedyg:  4@s is the correct contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: and so ends day 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks everyone  3 more matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1 down|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpb: probably expecting that bessis bid 2@s if she wanted to know 3-card support|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if she throws E in now there is an endplay to make the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg:  but no way she can see that|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i think 2@d followed by 3NT surely shows 5@ss|pg||
nt|hedyg:  else she could have bid 3NT directly|pg||
nt|tomi2: what else can she now play for? a revoke?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  how can she know that @cs are blocked?|pg||
nt|tomi2: she can hope for it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: but no defender will have bared the @sK|pg||
nt|ahalim: drop @SK singleton ??|pg||
nt|hedyg:  it is a miracle but only miracle can save her for sure|pg||
nt|pelu: Canada in 4H here|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|glen: thanks all, was fun :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @h insted of @s trick 2 would have made the overtrick "if u can guess that cards lie pretty good lol";)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: thx all, bye for now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Thx all see ya@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: restart at 16.45 local time|pg||
nt|cumino: dico contro|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|glen: running score shows final is 25-22 India|pg||
nt|vugraphzpb: by all|pg||
mc|8|nt|rhelle: but South makes this hard, by taking the @h Ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: if she takes the King, North will know to play another trump|pg||
pg||
