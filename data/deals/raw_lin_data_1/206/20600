nt|vugraphznz: and they landed in the best spot|pg||
nt|vugraphznz: East after @h3; ok..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW big club  and many bids value "zz" points  [A=3 K=2 Q=1]  lots of relays|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  fairly vanilla 2/1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|jbgood: looks as if the @d suit comes in in 4@h, so a normal contract turns into a good save|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: USA not X'd in the other room|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: if you are bidding confidently enough, you have a good chance to push non-vulnerable opponents a bit higher |pg||
nt|yuval10: it's likely that @c's are 2-2 because both defenders were in their hand once and didn't play @c|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps the only possible case in which it won't apply is when South has A@c singelton, and that's what makes W thinks|pg||
nt|yuval10: if South has the A@c, and he wins and play @d, then declarer has to guess, which of course is not optimal|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps declarer could have done better if he had assured an entry to dummy  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: but not in this match  -- identical auctions both tables|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: DBL gets the nod because 4@H and only doubleton @S   @SAxx and 4@H  would probably bid 3N since able to duck @S|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: here GeO remains silent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room also 3N east  after 1@S open with Fredin passing 1st round|pg||

nt|ady: this looks safer   though a club is a little worry|pg||
nt|ady: if North plays the ace and draws last trump   and plays a spade  and plays the 9  and east has the queden  then a 2nd club would defeat the contract|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: has seen the possible difficulty  and decided on the club finesse    that has resolved any problem|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|josj: and the @D return should clarify the position in that suit|pg||
nt|josj: E had better ducked the ace|pg||

pc|sK|nt|grebrof: but ok - it should be easy and it was|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N=good preemptive raise but i don't think this hand qualifies|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they don't seem to have a bid for "mixed"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: declarer will probably try to find @S10 doubleton somewhere|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real way to force defense to break @S or @D   [frozen suits]|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|josj: best defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|drorp: double dummy this contract makes, double finessing the JT of hearts, and chagas might actually make it if he can place Gino with the A@C from the quick double on 5@C|pg||
nt|grebrof: Israel is unbeaten so far - 16, 25 and 15, while Brasil have scored 18, 14 and 20 |pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 1 off double dummy|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|grebrof: the 4th match (the internetsite is finally up again), Israel scored 22 and Brasil 25, so both these teams have started off very well|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Cullin just convincing himself that nothing can go wrong with @D play|pg||

nt|ritong: his pard contributed @h Q on the lead, so no trump trick for his side|pg||
