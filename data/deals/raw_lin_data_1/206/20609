nt|lechcold: nasi w 3N s¹ tutaj|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rnmalik: 4@S would be off, losing 2@H+@S+@C=4 tricks for the defence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: especially because he has a nice way to get out in 2@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||

nt|lml: we have 10 spades ... we belong at the 4 level|pg||
nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||

nt|pawel90:  nie poprawiam Rysiu :) - chyba sie nie zrozumielismy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|lechcold: a wist @D2 to hazard straszliwy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lml: anybody see anyway to double 4@S?|pg||
nt|lechcold: na drugim stole 4@Sx|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: as long as defence does not play a 4th heart this may go down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: assuming that 3@cs establishes GF, 3@h maybe sounds more or less natural|pg||
nt|pawel90:  4@s chyba bez trzech, ale trzeba kiera trafiÄ|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: they know ... now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stefanov in 4@S North|pg||
nt|ady: North giving preference on 4 and 2 of diamonds instead of showing a likely 6 card suit seems where it went wrong|pg||
nt|star6ija: I like Martel's way of bidding|pg||
nt|stoffers: Loosing a couple of diamonds and maybe one spade here, more coffee :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: so far canada has been the aggressor and it has worked|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|nt|kit: yes, certainly Martel could have bid 3@S rather than 3@D, but they should have survived.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|lml: they stole the contract on board 2 in 2@D|pg||

nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||

nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
pc|d3|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
pc|d7|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||

nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||
nt|lechcold: jak mi siê zdaje, Kalita móg³ po³o¿yæ graj¹c kiera w lewie drugiej!! to dlatego, ¿e N mia³ za mocne kiery:)) ale to by³oby zagranie dla nadcz³owieka|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s9|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|famus: so they get the max|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: can bring down K@H in 3   but cant play a spade from north at the same time|pg||
nt|stoffers: and if declearer had the T@s Sementa would have been squeezed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|ady: that would solve the problem|pg||
pc|cA|nt|stoffers: check that score operator|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: discussion in bulgarian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i do not understand.... :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||

nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||

nt|star6ija: but they are going to be back shortly as far as I know Aronov - Stefanov simpathy to the higher levels|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but it was me who did not notice that on the king of diamonds \e played the ten |pg||
nt|ady: diamonds played for declarer by defence  so an overtrick last hand|pg||
nt|star6ija: maybe he played the Jack of Diamonds instead of 9|pg||

mb|p|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||

nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||

nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: can cash @SAK and play three rounds of trumps now to force east to give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't help|pg||
nt|athene: you can throw the club loser from dummy and ruff in hand but then dummy has only one trump to deal with two club losers|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|athene: to take some exit cards away from the defence and make them discard|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: guessed right    though perhaps a little luck;y|pg||

nt|ady: needed really to discard heartsnd keep 4 diamonds to succeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: slam time for EW?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly what he said when the first trick was over :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Let there be light|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and not dull borads|pg||
nt|skaftij:  boards|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 170 nie przysz³o nam do g³owy)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt is a possible call with that south hand|pg||
nt|famus: Hi Henri--congrtas for France reaching the Rugby Finals|pg||
nt|ehsana: $S on fro N/S|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: so far so good|pg||
nt|skaftij:  rathe heavy 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lechcold: 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wild card: probably he will have to|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: as if @C ever get any respect  now they're premature|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: the good news is that the long hand is overrufing the spades|pg||
nt|lml: so he will probably come to the diamond 9 eventually for 7 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lechcold: gramy z USA2 o 16:45 jakby co...|pg||
nt|ady: not going well|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|sA|pg||

pc|c5|nt|antoniz: oby tak skutecznie jak ze Szwecj¹ do tej pory:)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
pc|s9|nt|wild card: now his only hope is for west to have only 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: played for K@C with south when north played low   and king to come down in 3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: double squeeze now|pg||
nt|ady: north has to keep a top club  and south has to keep heart  so 3rd diamond is a trick|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wild card: well done, smelled his chance to make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a short break requested by one of the players|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d9|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: ech|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria need the points much more than Israel who were 3rd over night|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: not mentioning @h Kxx, always a small problem to hold Hxx in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  making here n/s|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
pc|d7|nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h3|nt|athene: he has to duck to preserve the entry to the fourth club|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but still going down, isn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: but should not have cashed the diamond|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and NS already have 1 trick|pg||
nt|rialc2: vedo che, praticamente, ci sono state solo manche (da ciò lo score "perfetto")|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set...|pg||
nt|athene: south has a pretty nice 12; he might just invite|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|athene: of course if west doubles a 2@H transfer that might alter things|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next session will be at 16.45 hours..|pg||
nt|athene: but they play 2-way stayman over the mini notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and no transfers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N back |pg||
nt|lml: no big deal when you have nine tricks anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last board now // Hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board now|pg||
nt|ady: final hand of the session    thx all    thx specs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Einarsson decided quickly not to finesses @h, queen being more likely with South and ruff pending|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of te session    thx Victor   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the set|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of match at our table    3rd/final session of the day scheduled to begin in about 1 hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
mb|1S|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||

nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|lml: if you play 3@S is not forcing maybe you could but that is hard|pg||

nt|lechcold: vugraf nienaganny:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
nt|lechcold: mecz skoñczy siê 16:14 dla nas|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: thanks all see you back in 1 1 /2 hour ca.|pg||
nt|ritong: now he can determine that north has singleton @s|pg||
mc|10|nt|udo: but with @c 3-3 , no need to find @S queen|pg||
nt|ritong: with 5@h presumably, 4@ds and 3 @cs if he tests the suit, what he certainly will do|pg||
nt|athene: yes, after he cashes the clubs, the spade guess won't present a problem|pg||
nt|lechcold: B-N zagrali poprawnie na drugim stole|pg||
nt|lechcold: tutaj posz³o ze 30 impów:(|pg||
