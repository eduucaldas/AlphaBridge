mb|1H|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth jokingly admonished not to make such a mess of the played boards|pg||
mb|2D!|an|better 2!h raise|nt|kit: 2@D shows good heart raise|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D probably a transfer, gd 2@H bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: beaten by operator and Kit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: enclosure a little crowded, four players, five kibitzers and me|pg||
nt|copeyj: game from Meckstroth now?|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will have to choose between 3NT and 5@D it looks like -- if he even has the chance to play 3NT.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: lall fans and folds and fans his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: studies the tray, taps the table, rocks slightly in his seat|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p!|nt|kit: 3NT can be beaten on accurate defense|pg||
nt|copeyj: Lall has probably worked out by now that Grue doesn't have much to spare for his double, but the problem is he doesn't need very much to make a game|pg||
nt|kit: 5@D also, but need early club shift.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth writes an explanation of his alerted pass, tears off the sheet and buries it face down|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kit: I don't understand the reason for 4@H -- seems like this would say he isn't sure of proper strain|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell: Q shows K, possible AKQ|pg||
nt|kit: now, South needs to lead ace of diamonds to take a look.|pg||
nt|kit: Too late.|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will go right after spades for his discard -- no second chance for the defense.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director writes down the lineups while lall studies the dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Yes, Lall can just win this and play K@S as Kit says|pg||
nt|kit: He does have to worry about spades being 5-2 though|pg||
nt|kit: But king of clubs in North hand looks more dangerous -- North did show good heart raise.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|kit: And opponents will probably give him honest count on the spades.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: jeff and joe tell each other who's playing at the other table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: will be able to draw trumps now unless Rodwell plays @C and Lall misguesses|pg||
nt|copeyj: and there it is|pg||
nt|kit: nice shift by Rodwell, who has an idea what the problem is.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: q detached|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: He thinks his partner has king of spades, not ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|copeyj: If Meckstroth had @SA instead of @DA (not so unlikely) the only way to beat it was to give Lall a @C guess now|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Good evening Victor and all friends:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hey guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We're starting now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: this might have some action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cognoscenti and junkies:)|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT - 3NT?   stayman?|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: EW can make 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate the opening but it is welland's style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, 15 boards to go in this marathon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ty operator:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the Nickell team had a big 2nd session- now they introduce a new pair - Zia-Hamman who always generate some excitement|pg||
mb|2H|an|Wk raise|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome!|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what their 2NT range is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They play transfer advances over a dbl here. So 2@h = > LR|pg||
mb|3H|an|Not invitational|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from the alert it appears that NS have at least 2 ways to raise over a double, most likely a transfer back to H shows a better hand with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is one tough event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi guys, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: against 5 diamonds South has to lead a club or diamond ace and club switch|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
nt|daman: welcome to the first session of the Round of 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 lead     most pairs lead 2nd highest from a bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: this auction makes no sense unless a 2NT opener is 21-22|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell says 2N here is 18-19. He must have down graded|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3NT should fail but Zia not stopping|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: perhaps their system didnÂ´t find the @d fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the clue was that Haman did not bid 3NT at first opportunity|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right the twostep showed multiple places to play and/or slam interest|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|daman: one is not permitted to downgrade with 20|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: you have to maintain a level playing field as a courtesy to your teammates|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This is going to be an intense match. Bathurst needs a good set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator has put up S first name to save space...he is Joel Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club switch gives a chance since Hamman blocked spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a partner of mine when he was about 14:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: needed midnight game victory to get Life master card:)|pg||

nt|kit: difficult hand here -- declarer has 2 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond, and 2 hearts for sure|pg||
nt|kit: does he try to draw trumps and set up diamonds, or score his small trumpwith ruffs?|pg||
nt|kit: I think he does best going for the ruffs, but not sure.|pg||
nt|copeyj: scoring small trumps with ruffs works better here i thk doesnt it|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe not|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but if hearts 3-3, other approach is better|pg||
nt|copeyj: perhaps even with this layout going after trumps works best|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: takes a drink of water, fans his cards, folds his cards, takes another drink, studies dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: grue: happy to play that way|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: what happened?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: players too fast for the operator!?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no drama - session start always a difficult time for operators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a fair case for the trump ace lead, though it is a hard problem. to beat this partner will need an entry, so maybe look at dummy before you decide what to do|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe may fall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E showed a lot of restriant here|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this plays better from south|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surely not 2S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: That's all he could be thinking about at this point|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: no way- 1nt?|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hopefully this set they play a little faster|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dream on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell in the tank atm. He has coffee this set!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: young and fearless|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surprised by the lack of a -ve type X from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 honour cards and may as well have none|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very friendly lie|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||

nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||

nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
nt|tez: sry.private|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S is probably OK at match points BUT against good opposition at teams it is not a good idea|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|copeyj: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265 for E/W|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/robinson-boydrrevision.pdf is the card for N/S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: not an encouraging start for the trailing team when your opponents bring home a 22 point 3NT|pg||
pc|c4|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|kit: Rodwell has his defense against 4@S planned -- club to ace, underlead AK of hearts, club ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C lead director i guess - rodwell imagining beating 5@S if he ends up defending that with @C to A, @H underlead and @C ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: I guess @H @H might make 4@S tricky?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth: "I should have figured that out, sorry partner"|pg||
nt|copeyj: very surprising hand with the 4 players we see here|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|kit: Grue expects his partner has a singleton heart.  Doesn't he learn from experience?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S inventive|pg||

nt|kit: 2 of hearts upside-down suit-preference for diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: and 63 was wierd - i would love to know the auction|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening from Bramley next door got the job done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me S has an opening hand. If I dont act early, I can be outbiddenÂ´like now|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D a multi - weak 2M or 20+ HCP any 4441|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bd 63|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||
nt|roswolf: another disto hand -the dealong computer is working overtime|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point ed|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: par here is 4@SD, down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: outlawed in many events isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy pass by south|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: west will redbl?|pg||

nt|lml: so do you balance as south?|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|lml: me neither but I am old|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall: "No double? Seamon: "Can we double now?" after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: the heart bid from west not robust|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt asks suit, i ignore and bid 3@S with self sufficient 6|pg||
nt|daman: you don't look old :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It wouldn't be particularly harmful here though. You just have to know when to make the junior bid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is 3@H enough after the X?|pg||
nt|daman: Roland is old|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bobh1: cannot believe bramley's bidding|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: I dontÂ´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: it could have been staymanic too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very odd auction|pg||

nt|iceking: 3 canadians here |pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk5: Who is the 3rd?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this match reminds me of a 60's match, roth-stoners versus standard bidders|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: best chance for defense is a low spade back to the nine|pg||
pc|d7|nt|iceking: just a little:)|pg||
nt|daman: you are Canadian?|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt put up the jack he might hve a guess later|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: if he thinks E has ace, i mean|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: north must think the world is crazy and lets e/w get on withir|pg||
nt|roswolf: with it|pg||
nt|lml: you are going to want to let the opponents play hearts for the max tricks here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jack is right card of course but sometimes reflexes take over|pg||
nt|odysseus69: gain for Nickell when they played last in 4S rather than 5 clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|copeyj: will locate the @CQ I think|pg||
nt|iceking: my grandfather moved to iceland from canada when he was 17 so iam like 1/8th canadian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you came to canada and paid the 25$ exit fee we count you as Canadian|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: When you open by agreement on hands that once would have been considered semi-psyches, your later bidding has to allow for it.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and 2@h dbl is 500|pg||

nt|copeyj: who was going to penalise that?|pg||

nt|ady: hoping  doubleton honor diamond with west|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: there is always an option|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: most americans play sound weak 2s and therefore  i think declarer will play for the outside strength to be with east who did rdbl|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: better to cash|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: But with all the spots it doesn't matter who plays them|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: I think Joe's X says enough for Mike to hit 4@S, in my style anyway |pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: pass is ofcourse mistake he probably opened 1@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: it wasn;t strength showing with three queens :)|pg||
nt|lml: as the cards lie 4@S east-west can go down|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: looked like down 2 to me also|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Operator, could u check this auction please?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: it was. I fixed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: battle of part scores here|pg||
nt|copeyj: South will (I guess) bid 2@S showing a fit now?|pg||
nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprised no opening by roy as west -he must respect the colors some of the time|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx, sorry|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT = 2 places to play the hand|pg||
nt|daman: might hard to pass the North hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Might even be 3, it's a general t/o|pg||
nt|lml: here north will convert clubs to diamonds to clarify|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah, the system is lagging. So it's hard getting the right bids in|pg||
nt|iceking: oh didnt see this would happen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pushey for Roland but the mandatory opening bid may encourage North to sniff|pg||
mb|4S|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passel shows a strong sense of rubber bridge pragmatism|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: an extension of support doubles -interesting idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: did north bid 4@H I DONT THINK SO|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now he sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|bobh1: barts hand is suddenly very prime|pg||
nt|roswolf: east no doubt is required to hold a good hand when he bids like this|pg||
nt|othered1: and he's right to get in -- they make a bunch of @H as cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am surprised passell did not use texas transfer, should play better from east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: youth, style, and vulnerability conspire to make an opening bid out of the S hand, and no denying it can work. still, S has a low offense-to-defense ratio, and insufficient Losing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Trick Count to open by normal standards|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|bobh1: roy may not be done|pg||

nt|bobh1: unless he was barred by the huddle|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: what does east need to raise a 20 count?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: must have done|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@h retransfer is not so unlikely|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess almost unfettered aggression cuts both ways|pg||
nt|daman: looks like the same 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be 800|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more IMPs for Nickell on Board 19    double partscore swing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||
nt|copeyj: although game not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: 4 tricks for north isnt that down 4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy welland does like to mix it up but this time it backfired|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thi will be more fun forNS than playing 4@H, anway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 5|pg||
nt|iceking: he asked for @H now so will get 2 ruffs east will get one more @D ruff the ace of @S and one @C trick in end 1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Katz is thinking about a @s from the looks of it|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure Nickells @D 4 meant something|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Maybe he's thinking about if Nickell signaled a stiff @h or @hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't think he imagined a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a full 1.5 losers short of the canonical criterion|pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: has to win this in the dummy and draw trumps|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this free-wheeling style needs some judgment to work well |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|copeyj: still has to negotiate the @D suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: but|pg||
nt|copeyj: E likely to have good @h and has @SK so a decent chance of W having both @D honours|pg||
nt|iceking: so good start for Nickell here |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|copeyj: AJ@H K@S J@C and Q@D might be an opening bid with some shape (singleton @C)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||

nt|ralfwil: what is W thinking about?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|pc|c9|pg||

nt|kit: diamonds suit good quality, spade suit bad quality.  That's the difference, and the reason Grue's choice succeeds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell takes a deep breath and a drink.  grue offers jeff a break "after like two boards? is that OK?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell has this repertoire of idle habits but I can't read anything from it|pg||

nt|ady: 6@C   should be reached|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: pass by Katz denies as little as 3 card @H support|pg||
nt|lml: Nickell doesnt need 3 card support though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know but it happens a lot when you have too many good options|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: favourable lie of cards here - no @S guess to get wrong, @H 3-3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is a 3@H stopper probe reasonable from East here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey really wants to bid 3nt..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT sems unilateral - I presume 3@D from West denied a good fit, so you can't run @D tricks|pg||
nt|daman: commonly referred to as a support double    which was invented by Eric Rodwell...who is playing in this match at the other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: note that if you change club jack to queen  -- only 1 HCP and still an unsupported minor honor --  the prospects for making slam are considerably enhanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a double would have shown 3 card support and a raise to 2@H would guarantee 4|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if 3@H is forcing since it is alerted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D or 2S with West? |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: probably not keen on either;)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, as unilateral bids go, this one looksto have good chances|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E may be doomed to make this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if eventually N breaks the frozen club suit as needs must, likely to go right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: South failed to bid 2@C   made a MP bid of 1NT instead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: presumably 1st round @D control|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think opening 2nt makes slam bidding easier, but of course grue's double does|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's forcing, the table confirms|pg||
nt|lml: it seems a reasonable way to play it and keeps some room open to look for better things|pg||
nt|lml: North has an ugly lead.  What would you pick?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: trump|pg||

pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: 3@D says LIke? Thn East claerly has to go on|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 5nt pick a slam|pg||

nt|daman: the @C 7 was suit preference|pg||
nt|iceking: pd seldom has stiff @D as N didnt suggest @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the @c7 def doesn't led the low @d return theory|pg||
nt|daman: but a low @D would be cool|pg||

nt|lml: not seeing 7 though|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d7|pg||

pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfd: grue: like a negative freebid.  lall: bid a slow 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: So E-W get blown out of a diamond partial in their 10-card fit.  It is necessary to find ways to bid such hands as the East hand vs. Precision.|pg||
nt|copeyj: having said all of that, N/S should make this and E/W can make 4@D|pg||

nt|daman: they're not on the same page    same as first session|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think so and in a long event mental fatigue should be avoided|pg||

nt|iceking: no real harm though both fine results|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: slam likely to be bid here!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s showed a minor|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 options for Nickell here 2@S-3@S-pass|pg||
nt|daman: the defense of 3NT on Board 20 was less than spectacular|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|copeyj: 2@S is about 10-13 for N/S|pg||

nt|iceking: what should Katz bid here 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: depends on there agreemeants|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: might bid 4@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lead directing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can deny that zia has a weak raise|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: pass was a big reach|pg||
nt|daman: it creates a playing field full of moguls|pg||
nt|iceking: oops are in strong seq so usually bids here from east should be naturalish shape showing, incase pd wants to compete |pg||
nt|iceking: east ofcourse has a incredible strong hand compare to NS bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really tell who is strong to make fine differences in meaning|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: intermediate  opening - far too strong for a weak 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: nice fit - stiff @D opposite AXXX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 4@D to me showed diamonds, has to more we don't know|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think he can because he needs the entry to finesse hearts.  They got a trump lead in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: now he should bid 2@D|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and non vul too:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is S thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Knowing how aggressively NS overcall, I'm surprisd Lall can consider a move over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should be celebrating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just be happy you find spades|pg||
nt|iceking: so now the question is does 4@H set up forcing situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for that reason i would have doubled 3@S to confirm strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and avoid partner bidding 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nick bid with the yarb again. so maybe 4@h does do so|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding should end here i cant see N dbl this|pg||

nt|daman: Hey John|pg||

mb|4D|nt|gowdy: hi |pg||
nt|iceking: with so many@D and no spade spots i doubt he will dbl but he might|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia alerts the dbl as a game try of some kind, not penalty.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fortunately it was not possible to catch them|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4@D was alerted as showing @C|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead normally would beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d showed @cs. Was the alert|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok i missed that obviously, but 6nt is always a possibility|pg||
nt|daman: they were saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it isnt clear to lead a diamond.  It sounds like West has them wired|pg||
nt|daman: we should expect to see a semblance of normal bridge|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes when you make a strange bid the defence does help out|pg||
nt|lml: because they believe you|pg||
nt|daman: they save you from yourself|pg||
nt|daman: he will x 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C as a lead director on that poorish hand at unfavorable facing a passe dpartner is understandable, but the real flaw isn;t any of those things  -- it is that youy dont have an ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: entry|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: it sounded like Nickell had a diamond trap pass|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2@D presumable artoficial gf|pg||
nt|bobh1: i suspect roy will bid the slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the spade lead will be almost automatic|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have wrongsided it|pg||
nt|roswolf: since east will declare 6@H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: all these transfers sometimes backfire|pg||
nt|daman: my partner overcalled and I have 4 trumps to an honor plus an Ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: I guess 5NT might leave the grand open as an option as well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: far too quick:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps doub will not know why he is getting the @S lead he requested|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the spade lead highlighted now|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 90 secs:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: John Matheson points out that West dodged a bullet by not doubling with his dbleton @S and a 13 count|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: If not many @d, at least the KQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: or even just the K@d|pg||

nt|iceking: so this is not over by no means|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: THE @D9 is a very good card|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and well earned.I dont like 1nt on E|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes and it seems that getting to @Cs would be worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think grue will have a singleton club around 95% of time for his double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on what N does on the first round of diamonds in 3N:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: a command   not a suggestion|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: and not 4 diamonds, so in effect both explanations the same|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|copeyj: not much choice in 2/1 Ralf|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: unless you play 3@D as natural invitational|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking NOrth covered the @SJ|pg||

mc|5|nt|Vugraphzfg: They claimed 5 after drawing trumps|pg||

nt|tejjyid: such a healthy game :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smokers do it faster|pg||
nt|ady: going for a coffee|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess no-one lights the filters of their cigarettes (under stress) any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they're back, 2 of them anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I have to say that the flavour of a burning Kent filter was particularly nasty|pg||

nt|copeyj: if it goes 4 down undoubled next door thats 12 imops|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|kit: Even Meckstroth-Rodwell sometimes stop in 2NT.  A rare occasion.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Game time|pg||
nt|iceking: we see alll hands looks easy from here, but Katz had some guessing to do it was not all clear |pg||
nt|daman: they are in 4@S on 23 in the OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is east hand a 2@C opener|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: another hand of untold promise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: or any 3-card minor (not 2@s reverse)|pg||
mb|1N|an|Semi forcing|nt|copeyj: not a very exciting hand here - unless they can get 3N played by W and avoid @C lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing score, four infinities|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have opened the north hand|pg||
nt|ady: partial |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah you're right|pg||
nt|daman: only my mother would open 2@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: not likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reminds me of the old lancia matches:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whoops|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: now how will north catch up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: transfers over 1@C opener might get you there with E opening 1@C but thats it|pg||
nt|lml: 2@h might have got through|pg||
nt|odysseus69: enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that left nothing to spare|pg||
nt|daman: it won't now|pg||
nt|lml: he had to start with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: in the game now|pg||
nt|ady: could the diamond be short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ifyou compare this to 93,West has just made a very heavy simple raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2+ limited|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They're going to settle for 2@d. Katz doesn't want to start a double war.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can i have her phone number :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2N probably some kind of relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a quick-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: As 4@d come down in dummy, Nick says: "That's the good news"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: Tie game again. Lets see if Grue and lall keep looking for blood. Not sure how many people dbl 3@h last hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: THIS WILL BE PASSED|pg||
nt|lml: well at least he has 1 dummy entry|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: so|pg||
nt|lml: which will give him a second one later|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I was looking at 3 spade ...senior moment|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do now with the south hand assuming you were not looking at four hands|pg||
nt|lml: I might switch to clubs|pg||
nt|lml: @SK and then clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's probably thinking about if he can score his @hQ or not. So I think he's temped to play a trump. Not so much a @c when he sees no dummy entry to play towards hand yet|pg||
nt|lml: hard to play a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: spotlight to robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D probably 3@S maximum hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D openings require lots of special understandings in strong club auctions|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: likely to be a game swing to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|copeyj: who are opening up a bit of a lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure I would have led @H too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad start for robinson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!  not for me! leads from 1087x and from J862 is forbidden if there isnÂ´t a very good reason|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: i think they were the primary reason Garozzo abandoned Precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s just says he can't double 1N. They don't seem to have a lot to do this auction|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: good play|pg||
nt|lml: wow if Katz put up the @SQ which really doesnt cost much he can do very well|pg||
nt|iceking: agressive spot|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 12 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: even if S leads a @H|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the problem with opening 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: judging not to unblock |pg||
nt|odysseus69: c7 may be Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if playing Smith some play that high from leader means poor holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We have another director call|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: yes, I like to remove all the balanced hands into 1NT - of course that creates other issues|pg||
nt|ady: initial trump lead best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|copeyj: still I believe the Robinson team can bring in the recent Cavendish pairs winners Kit Woolsey and Fred Stewart in the next stanza|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N was inconsistent in the auction at best|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and @C is his strongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought about it, and after the 5 min tank, he probably should have too.|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell    retakes the lead|pg||
nt|iceking: so with trump return now this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|iceking: there have been alot of unclear carding here so far |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Actually. This is the first time they are in the lead this match|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: I think he should have the cost is very little|pg||
nt|lml: and the award vrey big|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: yes   it was a tie earlier|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh zagorin just gave it Katz didnt read it didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) the @C Q may have been a better choice|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave you now    it's been fun      see you tonight|pg||
nt|iceking: have fun at the hockey match|pg||
nt|iceking: isnt that always the case if Canadian needs to leave in hurry there is some ice hockey going on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead from king was normal so cashing spade ace first i can see why Katz misguessed|pg||
nt|gowdy: could  be curling as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only Vancouver team still in stanley cup of hockey|pg||
nt|iceking: Curling is forbidden in iceland actually we have law against that sport|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: it is often right to fall back on ancient principles|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: then its easy for us to say :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: covering heart not good|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Apparently joel really needed a tissue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently victor was right about S catching a cold in 3H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hurd tells Zia not to think too hard|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|ralfwil: and 9 easy tricks now. N is squeezed|pg||
nt|copeyj: has 9 top tricks now and will make 2 overtricks I think when @SQ drops doubleton and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead will then be up to 40|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This was much to lose with either the Q or T play. If he guesses right then he has an entry that opps will eventually give him.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|lml: he needs the entry then so he can play hearts .. not sure a late entry is that good|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He needed 33@hs i think. the late entry for @cs was just as a good|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they use brooms so is witches sport|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lml: if he plays hearts from his hand he has to lose 2 hearts, a club, 2 spades and 2 trump no matter what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: After this board they need to pick up the pace|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sJ|pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|kit: If Rodwell shifts to a stiff diamond, declarer actually does best to let them have the ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|kit: this has to be wrong -- must be better to ruff heart and lead up to king of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell folds his cards, leans back, folds his hands across his chest|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell's kibitzer has not returned, perhaps respecting the rule not to|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: (reenter the enclosure after leaving it, with all matches on vugraph)|pg||
nt|kit: If rodwell ruffs and returns a trump, can declarer handle it all?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: not many kibitzers here in the ballroom.  willenken kibitzed welland one quarter he was sitting out, the only one I'd seen in the Round of 16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: this is the marquee table tonight|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: eric says sorry, takes a sip, still hasn't looked at his hand since the diamond was played|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: four in the enclosure here: shane B, jenny W, sally M, and some fellow I don't but perhaps should recognize|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps ruff, then king of clubs is most effective defense |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no webcam for this event.  you'll have to visualize from my descriptions|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will not be able to afford to ruff another club in dummy, so how can he dodge the club loser?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director peeks in at our progress.  we were well ahead before the break and this pause|pg||
nt|dinos1: if ruff and return @s then dcl pull trumps and play @hQ pitching @dJ|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: right -- so ruff, then king of clubs better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: then finally played some card upsidedown|pg||

nt|copeyj: 11 to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: very diplomatic bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he's going to pass he should be content with 3@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EW are doing n well in the BAM scoring - not very useful for them, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey is taking his time while Grue calls dummy cards|pg||
nt|daman: they are finished in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: n/s might attempt 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H for me|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: highest minor with any 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have opened also but perhaps these two are the opposite side of the coin to their opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 12-14?|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|gowdy: the key here is if W should have bid 4@D  perhaps game  with 3NT or perhaps even 3 @H  would be better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: an imp for Nickell although the defence was not electric here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then might have made 4 of diamonds on last trick via endplay....you dont see that every day|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3N or 4@S for N/S|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better control of the bidding had ew used gazzilli maybe|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: they play k-s|pg||
nt|lml: anybody bid now with the south hand?|pg||
nt|lml: say DBL again?|pg||
nt|iceking: or cole or some convention over 2@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|lml: I guess its a bit too rich|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: a routine bd|pg||
nt|roswolf: then 3nt never in the picture|pg||
nt|othered1: And rather orthodoxly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we have some yes's and some no's.  the fear of the yes's is partner will bid and create a minus|pg||
mb|3H|nt|copeyj: Les Bart predicts Robinson will bid 4@S courtesy of having no sure entry to the @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i much prefer a direct 3@C unless that has a special meaning|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Mixed Raise  = why should they go down when we can?|pg||
nt|daman: "stay fixed"|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid again but I would think I might be had|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: if p cant dbl 4@s to show something, you shouldn't bid anything with that hand. N has a very good pass|pg||
nt|iceking: over 1@S i meant|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@D had slam intentions|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 5@D would have been better picture bid of W hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that scenario, if N has seven of diamonds instead of 8 the correct defence for E is to exit with the six, not the two. that way N does not score the beer card|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: or just 3nt give it up|pg||
nt|iceking: problem ofcourse with 5@D as they play, 3@D might have been some fragmeant bid |pg||
nt|iceking: or what do they bid with some monster @H hands i assume 3@D or 3@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead interesting by Katz, figuring if partner cant bid he has to have openers suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: A lot of people would double with W's hand for the blacks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not show blacks|pg||
nt|iceking: well thought out lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: oh, 1@c was opened. sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: overboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i can live with mixed raise, likely would not have bought hand for 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes I like the 4@S bid.  You dont have defense and you do have offense|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Many players can rebid nt with a singleton in partners major. I donÂ´t like it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clearly seamon expects more points than partner is producing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very optimistic if 2@C was weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I want to trust at least a doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: never seems to cost however|pg||
nt|marlowepi: important psychological point when playing juniors, gotta be tough as nails|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Here 3@h is clearly a form of checkback to play @ss|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|lml: anything else is whimpy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very interesting hand to play|pg||
nt|odysseus69: road home not obvious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia is asking about their openings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very hard hand. maybe spade knave now, and heart queen later|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: so says Popeye|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gowdy: nice play however his 5@C was enough |pg||
nt|fabsayc: come on ralph this is cold|pg||
nt|iceking: nothing Katz can do here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Can't blame the man for trying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kevin and Katz discuss the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know this won't be popular, but i think their should be penalties for a single long pause either in bidding or play|pg||
nt|gowdy: he needs P to have the @d q and @H A and @C a or k 6   thats alot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If the table players dont mind, we shouldnt either.|pg||
nt|iceking: he also knows pd had kj @C and AK @H he really cant have much more, so should probably see the hand is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There has been a director call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you are stealing opponents time when they need to think|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree iam not big fan of these huge pauses in middle of hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: no  i believe some hands take more time than others  take time on the tough ones no proble here|pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell nailed them in 2@C|pg||
nt|iceking: so we are even again|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: where is my spinach|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: still difficult to see a way home|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|iceking: unblock?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If they play smith of some kind, they'll defend correctly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: auction does not really work either as lall could be 3442|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Theycan go to 4NT with 16 + 14 quite comfortably, so there isplenty of room to explore|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually south can still have 4 clubs as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Why don't they work well? if he's 3442 then it doesnt matter. If Grue had 4@h he'd bid 3@h here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now south knows he can play diamonds after the dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needed a minor suit lead  for this to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this deal, Meckstroth (South) led his singleton but later decided not to ruff when declarer led a second spade towards dummy (letting the game through). |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT best here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is W close to 4C over 3S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'd say so since p didnt bid 1@s-2@d//2@s-2n//3@h which is the lesser version of this auction as Zia explains to Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats part of the mystery (to me) of 2/1 - |pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceking: this will go few down|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|iceking: will not cost much though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: just Michaels that force to 3 level vul, and most of the time second suit gets lost anyway, so your only showing 5 cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Bad blood at the table for this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue complained about flipped cards too quick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: the 4@S bid was the main problem, not anticipating opponents sacrificing|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kit: And we have yet another close game contract here.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lall: in partner's suit we don't play rusinow.  we define 1@D as a suit, we talked about that for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: eric then asks about meaning of @d4 with singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lall just waves off the question|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will probably start on hearts and see what kind of end position he can develop|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth returns.  grue: jack low low queen.  rodwell: they treat 1@D as a suit for the purpose of rusinow leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: jeff stands up again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: since this board might be a while|pg||
nt|kit: he has 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 clu is 5.  a couple of diamond ruffs get him to 7.  On the fourth heart, he can pitch his last club when West follows, and then club ruff gets him to ...|pg||
nt|kit: 8|pg||
nt|kit: and then a trump end-play.  I think that is the general approach.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: he is taking his diamond ruffs early -- makes sense|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lall pushes his chair back, leans forward, selects @C8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: With the long diamond set up, it can't help East to play a trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: eric checks his watch|pg||
nt|kit: Part of problem here is that West got to pitch a club, so no more low club ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: lots of wristwatches in national events where cellphones and similar devices are forbidden|pg||
nt|kit: so jack of hearts, pitch club, last heart, ruff with 8 of spades.  Nope, not good enough.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director announces 10 minutes for the last board and 5/13|pg||
nt|kit: I think he had to do the hearts first to have a chance as the cards lay, since East had 4 clubs.  Not sure that would have worked either.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell says sorry again, finishes his water.  justin still bouncing his chair|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: jeff writes something - then blots it out|pg||

mb|1C|nt|tejjyid: maybe more defensible if you play specific 2 suiters, that's true|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: again we see an 11 point special|pg||
nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this first session|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: north in the spotlight again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's not just popular in the US. It's a popular tool when playing precision. Where 2@h is less than INV with exactly 5@s 4@h and 2@s is the same with a INV|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|iceking: slam time but will they get there|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: and roy will have to restrain himself|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C by south?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 4@S wont work, would agree hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He does one better with 4@c.. They might get there now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: its 4+@h in some cases|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2N over either bid is hand asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: depends a little what dbl means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Doesn't promise extras|pg||
nt|iceking: if its just normal support dbl N could have 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: EW will be regretting 109 & 110 right now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes mere mortals may sniff a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d might be RKCB|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt they can miss slam now|pg||
nt|iceking: no matter what 4@D means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup, table confirmed. It's rkcb|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is still in the tank tho. He doesn't know to show the @s void or not|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: iam not big fan of rkcb everytime here, imo it takes away alot of natural quebidding seq that could be importand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 110%|pg||
nt|iceking: instead you shoud use turbo when @C are trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: should|pg||
nt|iceking: in my opinion|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: this looks like a not so exciting 4@S unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D was a decent sac|pg||
nt|copeyj: sure it was 500 against 620|pg||
nt|copeyj: worth finding but not a big deal in scheme of things|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps is manna when you trail by 50|pg||
nt|copeyj: true!|pg||
nt|ady: can get home    but if a spade is led and dducked  defence can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This tank can only help N/S here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can you explain how that works magnus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even at favorable, opening an 8 loser hand without 2 honors in any suit and 4333 in a suit you dont want led seems..........arguable|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|iceking: Italians use Turbo instead of RKCB imyself only use it when @C are trumps, it means in quebidding seq you show even or odd number of aces instead of asking, it starts in 4@S from ...|pg||
nt|iceking: either side |pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: investigating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although I think they were booked to lose on those at this table becasue of the other table results, but not as much as 25|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we are not stuck on this play|pg||
nt|lml: I have to leave you all now.  Dont get unto too much trouble|pg||
nt|daman: later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thank you|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|bobh1: just guessing but it seems all of roy's bids are transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wish we knew what this auction meant|pg||
nt|ady: needs to take first trick if either diamond or spade led  to be sure of making   not easy|pg||
nt|daman: this is not as good as 4@S  especially if the defnese finds time to play @Hs|pg||
nt|iceking: this was the danger |pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile bathurst has bid 7 essentially on his own|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural nf competive i think N just gambled 2 much here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont have precise rules for void showing, you get into these problems with low level blackwoods|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural forcing its maybe calculated risk from north to bid 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There's been another TD call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why i proposed 5@C to start with, huge fit limited hand|pg||
nt|iceking: this table needs more love to manyTD calls here:)|pg||
nt|gowdy:  If5 @D showed 2 with void   he was hoping for more in  @H I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: N and E aren't getting along|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 5@d was 2 w/ Q. It didn't show a void|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont see any squeeze potential here|pg||
nt|iceking: even W has @S ace and 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is most likely bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@D by E might have had a shot until doug's double|pg||
nt|gowdy: then 7 is far fetched|pg||
nt|imp_jan: strange lead|pg||
nt|iceking: its 4card ending 4 @H in dummy w just keeps 3@H and @S ace i cant see it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good evening all|pg||
nt|iceking: so this looks like no play |pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not leading low?|pg||
nt|gowdy: N called  the D on Ralph for taking too much time  gloves are off in my book !|pg||
nt|iceking: agree rather standard lead low trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening light -- and i am a big practitioner--should be about something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the suit, or the multivalent playability, or something|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: 3NT can be held to 9 tricks on a @H lead I think     having said that.....EW would lose an IMP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It can still be held to 9|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: specs   the world knows 3NT can be held to 9 on a low @C back|pg||
nt|daman: North might play the @C King and cross his fingers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: 1C-1S=art. GF - a spec informs me|pg||
nt|ady: just been pointed out 9 tricks   assuming of course get clubs right|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: transfer then second suit should be looking for best game not a slam try, apparently cohler thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: playing 2/1 not much can go wrong even if you open that hand. its not bad|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: maybe North is thinking about the @D suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since we are opening a minor i am not sure how 2/1 enters into it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: the dbls have warned e/w off|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: not in 3NT  the dizzy heights of 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a low spade is safest lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it would be nice tobe abale to try forslam and stop in eiterh 4NT or 5@C though - you can see whay Cohler likes his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My feeling is that the jump to6@C has bit twice though|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so, maybe 4@D was the bid that goaded West onwards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: you're following ups are different|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: smooth duck|pg||
nt|kit: Grue trying to set up declarer cashing ace of spades --|pg||
nt|kit: or really concerned about declarer having 5 spades|pg||
nt|henryb:  Grue is making sure he beats this if decarer has five spades|pg||
nt|kit: From the weak 2, declarer knows king of spades is off|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: justin still bouncing to a rhythm only he can hear.  rodwell asks for his system card, checks it just briefly|pg||
nt|kit: so declarer may deduce the 4-2 spade split and go into damage control mode|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: final bells go off|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and the other room has just finished.  resumption supposed to be at 10 after the hour|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: kibitzer slow to pull CQ off dummy and rodwell tries to lead it|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer plays a diamond, Grue will do well to not ruff it, so his partner can ruff the third round.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: jeff could have won or lost a lot of money down the hall by the time this hand finishes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell says sorry for the Nth time|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|roswolf: agreed but east has a "law2 decision|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: getting too high? you're p wont hang you for bidding 1@c imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm not sure what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Though 4NT = 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|daman: a better auction with 3334      would be 1@C - 2NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator anam|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D would be natural nf here so 3@H probably 2wayish natural or invitational strenght|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: seems they have got diamonds |pg||
nt|fabsayc: an extension of the only game try principle|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: trump lead? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mahaffey might have bid slam here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought well and good about it but then came to the green card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace lead for me|pg||
pc|h7|nt|iceking: so now he just needs to make this |pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: seems more realistic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or maybe a @S, try & build a 3rd trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: my point was its a very standard 12 pt opening. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|othered1: goiong for 200 against a making 4@H could be a meaningful pick-up|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iceking: Gib says +1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade to ace is actually normal to avoid diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but GIB would drop the king of spades|pg||
nt|iceking: i would also looking at all hands|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|tejjyid: excellent idea -maybe it will catch on :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, well it depends on your criteria for opening bids. unsupported honors are much better defensively  than offensively, and 7 LTC is the norm for an opener, and W had a tidy 8. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but chscun a son gout|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: e/w are known to open 11's too. I think its sound to say he'd always open that hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|dburn: and a spade to the ace is not the best way to avoid losing a diamond ruff - suppose South had three spades to the king|pg||
nt|iceking: we are all genius here looking at all 4 hands:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: Ive got to play with this gib guy  never goes down when he sees all the hands|pg||
nt|dburn: or two spades to the king, and three diamonds|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|ady: a poor result of a part score hand|pg||

nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggesting an alternative bid to 2@D is hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah that's it for play |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
