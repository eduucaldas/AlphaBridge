mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
nt|glen: and that increases to 11|pg||

mb|3H|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT will be Lebenshol, forcing a 3@C bid|pg||

nt|santyclz: 3 loser |pg||
nt|mr murray: they got it right|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S will promise 4 (playing support doubles), therefore E knows he has a 5-4 major fit, but 3 points keep saying pass pass pass|pg||

nt|othered1: system summaries for this event:  NS http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mr murray: big dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|glen: Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are|pg||
nt|glen: that's actually a bogus study, but fun to quote|pg||

mb|d|nt|santyclz: This may get out of hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2c  GF  could be balanced|pg||
nt|mr murray: so true and I am glad that came out :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|weakish|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S shows a power hand in two ways: by bidding again above 2@D and by looking for a fit in a suit that W has|pg||
nt|glen: however N could care less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John just wrote a long note for George|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S by north is down on a double-dummy @D lead and continuation, but it figures just to be a push|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3h natural no extras prob no stopper|pg||
nt|glen: dear george, how are the white soxs doing this year?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, it won't take long to play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzff: I couldn't ssee f thats what he said, but it ws in red ink|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: not sure a @D lead is easy |pg||

pc|hQ|nt|psyck: at this vul, I would have expected S to be happy to defend|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|glen: must be about the bulls|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Barry shaking his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He agrees with you|pg||
nt|pef: those who are good at picking off stiff kings offside should be in 6 spades on this hand :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room they played a prosaic 4@s on bd 1 to lose 4 imps.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is good decision|pg||
nt|pelu: for I dont like that X with 3-3 i major - why not 1Nt (as Welland in OR??|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he chose n/t he would not like it|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is going to work out better|pg||
nt|santyclz: A genuine "Bramley" x.  4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs makes by leaning to the East side|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 2 was the opposite of prosaic though|pg||
nt|mr murray: well played|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pelu: what is the problem with 1NT? if N can penalty D then 2@C by EW is a nice contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 4 @H cant he?|pg||
nt|othered1: game in a rounded suit is likely here. Slam won't make on best lead|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, north chose the unfortunate lead of the @da.  Still, that wasn't enough by itself.|pg||
nt|glen: by Namyats, he means 4@C=long @Hs, good hand|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H=it better be a GOOD hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Neil shows his hand to Steve who says "wow"|pg||
nt|glen: and when dummy comes down EW will give up quickly|pg||
nt|glen: or W will WoW|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|mr murray: wow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John sees the dummy and says, pretty good support|pg||
nt|glen: this will be ruffed, trump out, @D to 9, making 5|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|mr murray: those guys get mostly good results from their off-shape dble. Finally coming to all the bridge world . Look what the Italians did to the bridge community in the 50-60's|pg||
nt|othered1: south is laying out hands where slam will make and you can come up with quite a few.  This is a very experienced partnership, so they know each other's proclivities.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: wouldn't think you would lead C Q against 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the first lead that pops to mind just looking at W hand|pg||
mb|4S|an|Black?|nt|mr murray: Yhey had everyone talking to themselves|pg||
nt|pelu: at that time they were better bidders and better card-players|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: strong club opening, 2c response showing a positive response in diamonds, and now the south hands becomes huge (on the 6d slam hand)|pg||
nt|mr murray: they made many off shape dbles|pg||
nt|mr murray: they were also great card players|pg||
nt|mr murray: so are most of the experts now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|othered1: right.  Earlier I only said neither rounded slam makes against the best lead.  Likely to be found in @C, but not @H|pg||
nt|othered1: and the slam killing @D lead was found against 5@C in OR.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|othered1: Was 4@S kickback (RKC-like with @H as key)?|pg||
nt|othered1: If it were a cue-bid, north could be thinking laying out possible hands for a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I only saw hand signals, not sure what it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I wonder if 5NT would have been choice of slams?|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing it or thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: high-level partnerships need to discuss all sorts of subtletries applicable at the slam level.  And most do, but it seems that there are always situations that haven't been ...|pg||
nt|othered1: explicitly discussed and maybe are subject to general, meta-agreements.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Eventually, I'll bet north does not punt the grand and is really just considering which slam is likely better.|pg||
nt|othered1: FWIW, in my preferred style, n orth tends to deny 3-card @H support when he bids 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|nt|odysseus69: time for someone to quote the rabbi's law but not me- I dont know it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my |pg||
nt|sybarra: this might draw the X |pg||
nt|othered1: Now he'll get the @C lead, as east will double|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: their slam-bidding was spec were excelent - they were the first to cue bid 2. round controls - at that time US could only cue bid Aces |pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: even @hA instead of @c now & he will get a signal...|pg||
nt|psyck: oh well...|pg||
nt|santyclz: The standard of bridge has improved greatly in the past 50 years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: very simple--if the king is singleton, drop it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Cue-bidding was my early speculation.  Just shows how tough these auctions actually are to pull off consistently.  But even small slam in @C was going to cost a bunch of imps ...|pg||
nt|othered1: against the normal @D lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew pulls out the redouble card and shows it to Neil|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 7 actually is going to cost only two more imps than stopping in 6 with @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question was what would lead be agst 6 @H |pg||
nt|othered1: west, having heard the auction is thinking, "can he really be asking for a @C lead?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt E can X 6 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John and Neil talking, Drew said he is thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think he could have doubled 6 and I don't think west would have found the lead unassisted|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@H, that is.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John asked to see Jims hand and Jim showed him the C A|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: for sure - but the off shape X are not comon to day|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: thus this opening lead is working for declarer|pg||
mb|4N|an|More|nt|othered1: Count tricks by assuring north that all keys are held.  If that's what 4N does, I think north can bid the grand right here.|pg||

nt|othered1: But it didn't get in the way in the OR and I'd guess it would work out similarly here.  But that's a guess.|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: You have a bunch of stuff to handle, but on EW cards alone it doesn't look horrible.  5@D also has risks|pg||

nt|santyclz: Some pairs seldom let a freely bid 2M stand unless they know it's breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mpny:  5D can be beaten several ways|pg||
mb|d|nt|mpny:  4H is better, but has problems due to 52 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: Drew can XX this |pg||
nt|sybarra: for first round control |pg||
nt|othered1: and 4-1 @H also may present a problem on @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume east is still unlimited at this point.  But ugly trumps may make west want to back off a bit.|pg||
nt|mpny:  west does not really even have an opening bid, he will cooperate in no slam tries|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: when both sides try for the same contract normal at least one side are wrong :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: so aker up by 40 imps with 6 boards, including this one, to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: comparisons are now active, but we are missing two boards, one was a push, the other was an imp to aker|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and here comes the club lead |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mpny:  i think 4-1 trump + 5-2 spades is too much|pg||
pc|c5|nt|santyclz: I sent a suggestion to the ACBL that all 1nt contracts be scored as 1nt x'd to add interest.  They didn't respond.|pg||
nt|glen: now the @H Q|pg||
nt|glen: or jack depending on style|pg||
nt|glen: some play second highest thru declarer|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of ways to approach this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and would be fairly easy if suits broke|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure he's down all the time,  South's having tha 3rd @D may be a key.  But he's gonna have to take a right view or two at least.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may take a moments (as it should)|pg||
nt|othered1: the only real hint from the auction, the double of 4@C, doesn't tell  him all that much.  Can he infer that south wanted to get a tap started with that lead (likely normal anyway)?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glen: no, back to @S ville|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mr murray: cant imagine y|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: I think that's a winning line|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pef: this will make 4, 4 hearts, 2 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamonds|pg||
nt|mr murray: then chambers pass of 1n/t when they had game would have worked out well. 1n/t dbled with 2 overtricks would be good :)|pg||

pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|pelu: dont work in pairs 380/580 a cold zero against 400/600|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: now on @C return I think he has to pitch then play @D|pg||
nt|mpny:  see how different it would be if west no longer had a D|pg||
nt|othered1: right. I'llhave to go back to see if @D duck by north would have beaten this.  Still not sure it would have, if west takes a winning line.|pg||
nt|mpny:  i think it can still be made, but harder|pg||
nt|mpny:  very hard for north, west could be 5512|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: So here's another way, not exactly obvious, how the 6-5 can make evaluation tough.   But partner's on lead and he might not even have a @H to lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cherilou: There are 60 boards to play so all teams playing have a chance to make semi finals. Thanks Bob for great vugraghing!|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|cherilou: no not @H's --whew!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: Thanks to BBO for making this all possible and to you the specs for wastching. It's a great show!|pg||
nt|cherilou: w3ill N find the killing @C lead?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: schermer asking drew what he would have led if he has splintered in clubs!|pg||
nt|othered1: more than half, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: and now the prepostpenultimate board, the kokish abbreivated as penultimate|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: they need to stay even here, and bid the slam |pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|othered1: Best not play the 8-card @H fit, which is down on the lead of either black suit.  But good 7-card suits shouldn't go quietly|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||
nt|glen: E's bid here depends on system, and whether 2@C is natural or artificial|pg||
nt|glen: experts have worked hard to convert every @C bid into an artificial meaning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George seems to be in pain, head in his hands|pg||
nt|glen: he is thinking about page 431 of the notes|pg||
nt|glen: do we play xyz over this sequence or abc?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I hate it when I can't remember who I have what agreements with |pg||
nt|othered1: NS in OR stayed out.  Let's see how tough they can make it in this room.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: now stan dard practice is to bid immediate 2H with weak hand|pg||
nt|glen: he hopes that 2NT is a puppet to 3@C, often a @C signoff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve thought for a while, then alerted|pg||
nt|glen: but on page 531 it is revealed as super-blackwood grand slam try|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing just 4S now|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless S gets involved maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: now I dont exp that they can stop in 3@c|pg||
nt|glen: but with a forced waiting bid of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George fakes applauding when steve bid shows up|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do you think that west has another bid?  I do, given the light hands they open.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Wrong again, I guess|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: wonder what 2 @D would have been for them, given 1 nt was "other suits" minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @H for that matter, or 2 nt |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew said he wasn't sure what the double of 1NT would be, if I heard him correctly.  With my hearing it could have been something else thoughh|pg||
nt|othered1: south was a passed hand, so 1N looks normal, if they choose to enter at all.  2N looks to dangerous to me at equal nonvul.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|glen: good trump lead|pg||
nt|glen: declarer's best line was to ruff a bunch of @Hs in the short @C hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: only if 2Nt is transfer to 3@c|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it was but steve bid 3 nt anyways|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Bob|pg||
nt|mr murray: many play 2n/t asks partner to bid 3 clubs. apparently not here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wolff (still like the word snapdragon better.)|pg||
nt|pelu: a @S-lead will help E a lot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: but after the bidding a @D would be normal|pg||
nt|pelu: so another game/partscore flat board?? :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his hand as a 17-19pt nt.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is not the worlds worst contract if clubs were nicer|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|glen: N should continue with the program|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|santyclz: Now a @d.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu: but Jacobs was on the right track - His 2Nt ask for 3@C - the winning partscore|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: just trying to find a bid Ed, that moves it forward |pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|pelu: overrules by partner|pg||
mc|12|nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps this will come down to the final board|pg||
nt|mr murray: uknow what happens when u overrule your partner:)  the gods take over and slap u in the face|pg||
nt|othered1: they've found their major lengths already and there's no reason to think you have to boost them out of slam|pg||

nt|mr murray: unlucky that heart 5 was almost unreadable|pg||
nt|santyclz: What's this?  An actual game???|pg||
nt|othered1: Match is only half way over and 21 imps can come back in a couple of heartbeats.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|pelu: better to play low card = come on - from bad suits u can affort to play high|pg||
nt|mpny:  welland seems to have opened 1N in the other room. here it was hard. east might have done more, but his values did not really look slammish|pg||
mb|3H|nt|santyclz: I'm going to nap through the 3rd segment and hope to be awake for the 4th.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have a longish break now or is this last hand for the day? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: nice hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: this time upside down would be best of course|pg||
nt|glen: and the last board of the set, still another 15 boards for this evening|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: this is it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: c uall later. enjoyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for the day  |pg||
mb|5D|nt|mr murray: cant make but cant blame Jim for bidding on.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The bidding isn't over...|pg||
nt|mr murray: can he not bid 5 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Joe - Its bedtime for me 23.50 here - but tx for at nice evening Joe and Murray  and good job wd by u Bob|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3rd segment is due to start in a little less than an hour.|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye for now.  Nice specs|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a lot to say as there was not a lot to do |pg||
nt|mpny:  again potentially dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will pick up the matches tomorrow |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Michael and Ed,  great fun|pg||
mb|5H|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree. the ugly NT opening with a good 5-card major and a worthless doubleton in the other paid huge dividends in the OR|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Vugraphzff: The redouble showed hearts I think|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @s|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye Joe and Peter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Murray.|pg||
nt|glen: now W can bid 3@D|pg||
nt|glen: some specs liked 2@D by W on the round b4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all - no problem in the play here|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mpny:  you can make 5, even without a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: yikes, 4@H is falling in love with the wrong person|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Bob, our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: George said something I couldn't catch as he put down the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for the helpful (and often funny) comments  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|mpny:  a very bad end for Casen Krekorian|pg||
nt|othered1: this is easily makable.  Just strip the black suits and play 3@D and north will  be endplayed in @H.  But there are alternatives|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|glen: with George it was something very funny|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Jan Martel who works hard to organize the operators and the USBF for bringing this great tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: no, 5 was makable.  I didn't notice west toppling over|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a few  hopeless slams in this set across both tables.  Unusual for play at this level, I'd th ink.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: See you all tomorrow for 2nd half of round of 8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: its a mystery to me why anyone would want to bid hearts on East after 1Dx|pg||
nt|glen: he has a great sense of humor|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
nt|pef: now is a good time to thank my fellow commentator, victor silverstone|pg||
nt|pef: and both bbo and the usbf for making this possible |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.  The next segment is sched to start in about 25 min.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pef: also our noble vugraph operator, Bob, and of course Roland Wald for the huge work that goes into arranging for all the commenators|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and I thank you Peter our Vugraph operator and al who have stayed here till the end|pg||
nt|pef: there will be all four of the quarterfinal matches on bbo starting tomorrow at 10:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time|pg||
nt|pef: the score is incorrect, somehow 118 was marked as a passout, they were actually in 4 clubs, I believe, making 4|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mpny:  they were unlucky to be mirrored|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|pef: ah, they just fixed it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: what I have told my students: only lead a doubleton if its partners suit! - even if u get a ruff u lose tempo|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: next segment in 48 minutes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: we are waiting for the TD to arrive to say "hey, finish up"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he just was here, didn't say anything|pg||
nt|glen: ok, he gave them the TD stare?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yep|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: so after this board, we can all go to the closed room and see what happens|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again Bob |pg||
pc|dK|nt|glen: S likely to play @Cs with nothing better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he's back!!!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
mc|11|nt|othered1: Nice work, Bob.  thanks everyone and bye|pg||
nt|sybarra: now have 32 points  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: TY and good night from Las Vegas|pg||
nt|sybarra: enjoy the rest of the evening and WIN at the .....table etc|pg||
