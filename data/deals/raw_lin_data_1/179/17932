nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Bill Frisby, Jordan Chodorow and yours truly will be commentating in this room|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|jcwla: Useful agreement is when we have committed to a certain level (e.g., here 2@D forces to at least 2@S), bidding there straight away is the weakest possible action.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Precision (Meckwell Lite) for N-S, 2/1 for E-W|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D might be as short as 2, so sometimes the opponents might want to bid them naturally, but here east was a passed hand so there was no problem |pg||
nt|athene: if he picks the hearts right he can make ten tricks here|pg||
nt|athene: with this sort of holding you basically have to decide which opponent has the doubleton honour|pg||
nt|athene: if you thought north did you would lead to the ten|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: the double of 2@D probably showed "real" diamonds - i.e. 5 of them - so if declarer can get a count on the clubs and spades, he'll know that south has the shorter hearts|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jcwla: Also, doubleton @S already slightly atypical for 1NT and with 2-2 in M's would be more so.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s5|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcwla: Big result for Deutsch here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: A result one should never see at IMPs|pg||
nt|athene: hard to see how Platnik thought he had a penalty pass, with 743 of trumps|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|nt|athene: yes you should really avoid passing doubles of 2M unless you KNOW it's just a matter of 5 or 800 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Confident of beating it 2 to double into game - not loving the alternatives does not make the pass any more acceptable.|pg||
nt|kit: and with good defense it doesn't seem like we should have seen the result|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfe: Hampson writing notes|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes people make these tight doubles, slip in defence and concede -670, and then say "well the double was ok, it was just we misdefended"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: terence reese said in one of his books a long time ago: if that happens, the double was the mistake, not the defence|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rosenkranz looking XX here.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: you shouldn't double partscores if it takes a tight defence to beat them |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Totally agree.|pg||
nt|kit: defending 2@H looks a lot better than playing 2@S on E-W cards|pg||
nt|kit: And surely Cohen isn't going to sell out to 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: well, i'm with smith|pg||
nt|kit: when his partner opened the bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Greco playing with his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: opening and reclosing|pg||
nt|athene: ok to pass these doubles at mp, when 200 is such a big wonderful glow in the sky, but at imps it just seems dodgy|pg||
nt|kit: I don't agree -- plus score is better than minus score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||

mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfe: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen says I psyche|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Pd will often have a doubleton @H and the fit just happens not to be lovely this time, but as a matter of philosophy putting yourself in position for -670 on this type hand doesn't ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: appeal.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen says okay shaking hi shead and now Greco lowers the screen and is writing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Difference between +200 and -200 is 9 IMPs -- almost the same as cost of -670 vs. -110|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't see why platnik had any reason to imagine his partner had three hearts rather than two|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now more writing to Greco from Smith and upside down is whispered|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen is shaking his head wondering what is taking so long|pg||
nt|jcwla: Right - and while 200 seemingly going out here that doesn't seem the expected value for the 2@S call.|pg||
nt|athene: when partner turns up with one more trump than he should have and passing still works out badly...|pg||
nt|kit: passing only turned out badly because of foolish cover of jack of diamonds |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hampson shakes his arms to the side and says this has taken 5 minutes|pg||

nt|kit: Greco knows his partner has a stiff spade left -- didn't know if it is king or ace|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: well, no need to push opponents to 3-level if they do it themselves|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for smith to evaluate his hand on this sequence because so much depends on his partner's side-suit distribution|pg||

nt|athene: as south did in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: Very difficult for N-S to judge the extent of the fit here.|pg||
nt|athene: lack of support double or spade raise limits south to two hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he doesn't have to have diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: could still, for example, be 2-4-2-5|pg||
nt|athene: this is the problem with strong club and 5-card majors|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D ends up being pretty much any hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: Replace "the" with "a."|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and we don't complain|pg||
nt|athene: sorry i meant south's pass over 2@H limited him to at most two *spades*, of course|pg||
nt|kit: wouldn't make much difference in Standard -- North would know about diamnd suit, but still couldn't know about the great mesh|pg||
nt|athene: it makes a bit of difference to know your partner has 4+ diamonds rather than 2+, i think, with that north hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|kit: why?  It is the stiff spade which is the key.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes but if partner has more diamonds, it will be easier to ruff spades|pg||

nt|athene: for example suppose east was relatively cautious and bid only 2@D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a make because you set up a club trick for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|athene: now still if north bids 2nt that isn't a jump so might not promise so much|pg||
nt|athene: when opps haven't bid more than 1@S it's easy for north to show his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Losing 2 hearts and 1 club|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H quite easy -- 4 heart tricks, 2 spades, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|kit: Probably right to just blast out king of hearts -- even if opponents find diamond shift, still time to set up club trick.|pg||
nt|athene: deutsch in the other room might have been worried his partner had just a monster with a diamond suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should double again, then bid 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cohen says ugh and then okay|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: now leaning back in his chair with his hands crossed over his head|pg||
nt|kit: however, now a diamond shift will actually defeat the contract, as declarer will be forced to play clubs before drawing second trump -- and West gets a ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now Cohen is counting on the table and says sorry|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe king of hearts play wasn't right -- perhaps queen of spades, spade ruff, and heart (or club) from dummy was better.|pg||

nt|athene: responder could have asked for a 5-card major if he was game forcing but not if inviting|pg||

nt|athene: so north shows the 5th heart on the way to 3nt just in case his partner has three|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it were, some might still open 1NT.  But common reason is difficult rebid over 1@S response, but here raise would seem reasonable (close to min-range hand, worthless side ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: doubleton), particularly if 1@S response is agreed to have integrity (which most don't).|pg||

nt|athene: does something good in spades give you any other chance?|pg||
nt|athene: very unlikely i guess - KQ doubleton might help|pg||
