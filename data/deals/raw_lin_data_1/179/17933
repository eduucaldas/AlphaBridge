nt|psyck: EW play standard American 2/1. NS play natural opening bids with some artificial followups|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: discussing houw many diamonds redouble shows|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
mb|5D|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||

nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room they played a prosaic 4@s on bd 1 to lose 4 imps.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||

nt|psyck: deal 2 was the opposite of prosaic though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
