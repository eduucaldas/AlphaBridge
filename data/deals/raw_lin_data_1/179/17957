mb|p|nt|paulg:  Interesting to see that both these pairs are playing a short 1@c with transfer responses ... more common in Europe than the USA in my experience|pg||

mb|1D|nt|glen: nope|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: Aker team has to right the ship|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: In a match this close, 1 imp lost (had @D split 2-2) could be critical.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is natural but promises an unbalanced hand ... seems appropriate|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer responses to 1@D also it looks like|pg||
nt|paulg:  I expect 1NT is a game-forcing relay .. and then we'll be guessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|cherilou: Howard's wondering........|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play similar methods myself, but there are many different ways of doing the relay responses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1@D is unbalanced hand, usually 5 diamonds unless 4 X 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|swanson: 4@S is a good save here except N-S can't make 4@H.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|bobh1: i have a different definition of a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: Give south credit for putting it to them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wolfson thought pass was forcing |pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobh1: good thing he did or he would lose 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment, 2@H there showing spade support|pg||
nt|cherilou: seems all is natural now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: what would he do with x  KJ109xx QJx xxx I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish he played differently I'd guess :)|pg||
nt|cherilou: oops--not now|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe they play weak jump shifts. That can impact many other sequences|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 tricks are easy, 9 needs to find the @hq.|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer cannot relinquiosh the lead at all, so making depends on finding H Q|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c showed shortage, will Richter try to show the void now|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a break |pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of |pg||
nt|peachy: Aker needed some luck, but I dont quite understand playing a second club|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherilou: responses to this type of KC vary by partnership when a X occurs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: still has a lot to do |pg||
nt|peachy: Still, not enough to let it make, Goren was counting on too many covers in partner's hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks like Richter is concerned about a heart lead and is hoping to hear a confirmatory redouble showing first-round control?|pg||
nt|cherilou: often pass shows 0--but not by their methods|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|glen: personally, on these hands where the high card points are split, say 18-22, long term forcing passes will not be a net plus|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: pesky J10, to give him option to do it either way :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least ended up in right spot |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I could not see what the late round auction shows|pg||
nt|cherilou: play will be fast again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker thought no Key Cards, but it was "no heart control" by agreement -- that's what they said after the auction but why 5@H if not KC?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|swanson: On this particular hand, South would double 4@S even if his partner's pass was not forcing.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If S plays @sJ, I´m convinced that N will have a @s trick on the @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@h is the bid of a man who does not trust his memory|pg||

mb|2N|an|limit raise|nt|cherilou: yes, if no KC then missing @S A and @D K--only 5@D should be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is a hand where transfer responses are very useful|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure how they play it  given their system,  should be weak|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||
nt|swanson: The bidding in the other room was a bit exuberant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||
nt|swanson: 4-5-2-2 hands are not pleasant to bid without Mr. Flannery's convention.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this one is kinda good for Mr F|pg||
nt|santyclz: Richter is playing with Aker, I beleive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  as Richter can continue with a constructive 2@s having shown his values|pg||
pc|s4|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  and heart length|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes and also a hand where not opening 1NT with S hand gives EW bidding room|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfc: 14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|paulg:  the flipside being that you prevent the opponents getting into trouble, as happened at the other table|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: Usually played as 11-15.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||
nt|swanson: But a 2@S rebid after partner's forcing 1NT is unattractive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes you need some kind of gazzilli to really show the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice escape.  Not going to make, but not doubled.  Still a minus on top of the -200 in CR will give Wofson a handy lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. I think W should play @dQ on @dA. N cannot have a 5-card @d, so It cannot be dangerous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can make now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: work OK to play the queen when partner has the jack, but might cause underlead otherwise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult to know what to play from Qx|pg||

mb|2S|nt|paulg:  in his defence, this is potentially a very long event and you would wish to preserve as many brain cells as possible ... but it was worth a little more thought|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: according to larry's website, he is on a cruise October 22-29 http://pwr.com/CRUZBRUCE/bridgecruise/bridgecruise_2011cohen.html|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: good fit here |pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: it is not really practical to play that double by North guarantees four hearts, so South has a tough call over 2@s  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: curious, in a way, that no-one doubled. Perhaps the pairs are still feeling each other out - like the first few rounds of a boxing contest|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so easy, but a winning line is  a @d to @dA and a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W could have taken the imps by doubling 4@h, trusting on partners 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a diamond back would make things very awkward|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: threatening diamond ruff would be good -- NS play standard C & A (except upside down discards)so N can't be sure of the diamond distribution|pg||

nt|sybarra: so in the end,  it didnt matter |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: so on the last hand Goren tried a diamond from dummy, knowing Cohen would have to play the 3, and hoping Cohen had AKQ - no luck|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 5@c is a neat contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director announces the halfway mark for thei 15 bd segment|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|peachy: 1C = clubs or balanced. If balanced any shape in minors 12-14 or 18-bad 20.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobh1: misfit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|glen: 32-0 this set, and NS will just try to keep it on the fairway|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is probably takeout of spades, showing a hand he'd wished that he'd opened|pg||
nt|peachy: 1H is transfer to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: in fact 6@c is quite good - solid if trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 6 clubs isn't so bad (but not today)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|swanson: If Cohen had passed, Levin would have doubled 1@S, showing a trap pass of 1@D.|pg||
nt|othered1: double pretty much says east had a penalty double of 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: With minimum and 3card spades, opener would accept transfer|pg||
nt|peachy: I think thats how the script goes, anyway :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson: She will pass or bid 2NT here; not much percentage in doubling 2@S.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all up to North really - depends what view he takes of his trumps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c should really set clubs, so 4@s should be a cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: why is N thinking? Can S still have the big type hand?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that anyone is thinking here|pg||
nt|paulg:  normally 1@s would deny a big balanced hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: weinstein is thinking -- he knows this is a 4-3 fit, but still....  (he's a thinker by nature)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: not at imps...at mps W might double 2@S|pg||
nt|glen: W would like better @S spots at imps|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry, I'm confused|pg||
nt|paulg:  well weinstein does have control of every suit eventually, but I would not have thought it was sufficient to merit a long think |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein thought it was Garner's lead  -- like me, he missed the 3@H bid and was thinking over 2@S by Garner|pg||
mb|4N|nt|peachy: In general, EW card has many transfers and relays with strong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: a @h lead is needed|pg||

mb|6N|nt|mdgraham: well, now it can make|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he can just get the hts right |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bet he does (for an overtrick)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 12th trick is a problem.|pg||
nt|peachy: This could indeed prove unmakeable|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: diamong K or spd thru |pg||
nt|sybarra: cohen sorting ojut whether they can beat it|pg||
nt|peachy: no lead possible even that could hand declarer a trick|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Even then the entries are wrong.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|swanson: Appears to me that Cohen was inviting trouble by bidding over 1@S (although some partnerships play all new suit responses to overcalls as a one-round force).|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfc: note the auction in the other room (same except 2@S was doubled)|pg||
nt|glen: also some play 1@S, while not forcing, doesn't need to be a good suit|pg||

nt|bobh1: win the @H K and play a low @C but maybe she's thought too long for that to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that is what she did|pg||
nt|swanson: The only hope for declarer is 3 heart tricks.  The defense could err because East did not make a negative double and will expect only a three card heart holding.|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't that work (low @C from dummy trick 2) if you guess the @C position next round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't the @H8 give the count?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think @h play is att with the T|pg||

nt|swanson: Levin has to win the @HK and lead a low club to give herself any chance I believe.  But South is going to shift to a diamond, which is a killer.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: other table has been on 115 a very long time (since our break) maybe something is wrong|pg||
nt|swanson: North might well have considered passing 3NT, but East would removed in any event.  (3NT showed a long minor - not to play.)|pg||
nt|paulg:  he was going down there if the @cQ had not been played|pg||
nt|peachy: He really shoyld not have taken the club finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand of this segment |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one more after this one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cherilou: don't like the @C Q play|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: sorry, |pg||
mb|2N|an|GF raise|nt|peachy: These guys won't get much of a dinner break, continue at 6:10PM, right?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I think that is right -- the break was before this match|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is 40 min from now |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the early diamond play meant that he had shortened his trumps beyond repair|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfc: I like this hand more than Wolfson does|pg||
nt|paulg:  an opportunity missed by NS, although in their defence they did not know that declarer has misplayed the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the tables aren't linked apparently; wolfson is in good shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its dinner yet|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 4@H probably shows specifically a 6-bagger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: apparently the tables got disconnected -- maybe someone can find the scores for us from the other table|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe with a singleton...not sure...can tell you it is not a sign-off|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: k, I think you are right, late dinners in this schedule, but break srill a nice things|pg||
nt|santyclz: But then, I keep thinking this is the last segment, but it's only the 1/2-way mark.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: not sure how many diamond can (should make here)  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there is a break between segments 2 and 3 each day.  We finish by 8:30 or so local time each day|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I can´t set up any suit on my hand, I´ll try to find my partners, so a @h lead for me|pg||
nt|paulg:  hands like the last one are the real bonus of having BBO vugraph ... we see all the good and bad plays|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: so a great late cocktails and dinner |pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|paulg:  3@d a lot better contract than 3@c, but will not make any more tricks today|pg||

pc|h4|nt|peachy: Y'all agree with 4S by East?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|santyclz: 4 more segments tomorrow.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit frisky |pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: He changed horses in the middle of the stram, if it was a 2S bid, stick with that evaluation|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: *stream|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cherilou: next hand is the last for this set--will have a 1 hour 20 minute break then back for 2 more sets today.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but where were n/s going to play?|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe landed in 5D, oe 4D at least|pg||
nt|sybarra: with void in @D maybe he was afraid of 5 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: (making)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks to Jan, Glen, the players and our dedicated but limited audience|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|glen: generally you want to bid a in-tempo 2@H here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: simson thinking:  geez i didn't want to bid the 1st time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The hesitation before 2@h was because the director arrived to check that we'd caught up and then the other director announced 10 minutes so the players engaged in a little hilarity|pg||

nt|peachy: We'll soon see what other table thinks of those cards|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: last hand. well done Joe |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the commentators and to the specs -- we'll start the next segment soon |pg||
nt|peachy: before dark, if we are lucky :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW have missed a couple of chances this set, but the deficit is manageable still|pg||
mb|2H|an|spades|nt|paulg:  good luck with the rest of the day, my bed will be calling before you restart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: board is backward on the table -- so east is west and south is north, etc, and my job is very had for this one :)|pg||
mb|d|an|to|nt|swanson: In the Cohen version of Jacoby 2NT, 4@H shows a minimum, but no singleton.  I suppose South though his lack of high cards was compensation for the singleton.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: We give special applause to BBO for putting on this great show--Roland for all his organization and of course to all the spectators!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfc: this is a different Stayman sequence than it appears but I don't know what it is -- some kind of Puppet I suspect|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, thanks to Jan Martel of USBF for organizing the vugraph of this great event, and to Roland Wald, our tireless BBO vugraph coordinator.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: 10 min left the director annouces|pg||
nt|peachy: They dont have Stayman at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  you have my permission to give North a good slap for misplacing the board on the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@H was mixed raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  4@s is a big bid from Aker opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: from Richter, actually|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like it--don't want to defend 4@H when we have 9 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C forces 2D, then describe|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't understand the bidding here.  Maybe I'm just too tired.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: Also thanks to Joe Stokes for excellent operator job!|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  this is going to be another swing for aker, to make the match quite close|pg||
nt|cherilou: EW will gain 9 on this board and close the margin to 10 with 90 boards to go.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not last |pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was forced|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: last board! Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Ralf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the first of 8 15-bd segments for this match:  60 boards today and 60 tomorrow|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: thx Joe,  great job as always, (I miss being there) |pg||
pc|d2|nt|swanson: Board 117 where E-W went for 300 was a loss.  N-S were evidently minus 100 at the other table.|pg||
nt|cherilou: N can get 2 @C ruffs.....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Garner, who actually holds the North hand, must feel a little uncomfortable to let two passed hands play in 4@s undoubled |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Raija,  always fun to comment with you |pg||
nt|peachy: Fabulous job, Jow|pg||
nt|peachy: Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs, for your comments and inputs,  we appreciate them |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|swanson: Congratualtions to the Wolfson team.  The heavy underdog Silverstein team put up a great battle for the first 7 sessions.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|paulg:  playing for the club ruffs is very dangerous, as partner may have the @cK and you let the contract make|pg||
nt|cherilou: but his partner pre-empted and he has 2 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i'm sure he is uncomfortable defendingk, but not clear he think he can beat 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|santyclz: This might make some sense if 2@h shows the majors rather than just @ss.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mdgraham: ouch - don't think he can make it now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: special thanks to Jan Martel,  who organizes the vugraph at his great even |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cherilou: for sure---S has VERY heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was described as a mixed raise, so 4 trumps plus a card outside|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry I missed that|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  thanks all, have fun later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I missed some of the play -- it is surprisingly disorienting (at least for me) for the play to go counterclockwise relative to what I have on the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks again all -  back in a little over an hour|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks again--come on back and join us in 80 minutes. Bye.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: result on that last board was -2|pg||
