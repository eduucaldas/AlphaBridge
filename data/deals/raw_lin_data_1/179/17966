nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good evening all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Good evening Victor and all friends:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hey guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We're starting now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: this might have some action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cognoscenti and junkies:)|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT - 3NT?   stayman?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: gooe afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobh1: EW can make 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate the opening but it is welland's style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, 15 boards to go in this marathon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ty operator:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the Nickell team had a big 2nd session- now they introduce a new pair - Zia-Hamman who always generate some excitement|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what their 2NT range is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They play transfer advances over a dbl here. So 2@h = > LR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Joe|pg||
mb|4S|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from the alert it appears that NS have at least 2 ways to raise over a double, most likely a transfer back to H shows a better hand with fit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ralf.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is one tough event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi guys, welcome|pg||
nt|santyclz: Starting with everybody's 3nt, ease into things.|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: against 5 diamonds South has to lead a club or diamond ace and club switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
nt|daman: welcome to the first session of the Round of 8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The good news for this set is I managed to steal a bagel to eat :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 lead     most pairs lead 2nd highest from a bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: this auction makes no sense unless a 2NT opener is 21-22|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell says 2N here is 18-19. He must have down graded|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only for warming up:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi everyone, play started. Give me a sec|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: 3NT should fail but Zia not stopping|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Anam.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps their system didn´t find the @d fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the clue was that Haman did not bid 3NT at first opportunity|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right the twostep showed multiple places to play and/or slam interest|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|daman: one is not permitted to downgrade with 20|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: you have to maintain a level playing field as a courtesy to your teammates|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This is going to be an intense match. Bathurst needs a good set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator has put up S first name to save space...he is Joel Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club switch gives a chance since Hamman blocked spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a partner of mine when he was about 14:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c lead from S a little bit mor interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: needed midnight game victory to get Life master card:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: ignore me- too late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hamman inquires leads|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Anam|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: now a @H thru   the @S 9 was a telling card|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s5|nt|santyclz: There is a school of thought that when leading vs 3nt if you don't have a 5 card suit, try to hit your pd's.  They would do well here.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: Good afternoon Geroge|pg||
nt|lml: George|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: NS is playing precision|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, Bob!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1d promised 2+ ;  presumably 2d was strong D hand|pg||
nt|othered1: So it's a minimum, ambiguous 1@D and an inverted raise.|pg||

nt|roswolf: another freakish distribution|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Should be better now. Sorry all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: how about the grueful pun?|pg||
nt|lml: good idea playing the @CK first |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Claimed d1 after drawing trumps.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: can he make if S leads a @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Bad news: I didn't grab enough jam.|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|ralfwil: what happened?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hello ANam & Spectators |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: players too fast for the operator!?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no drama - session start always a difficult time for operators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E plays low switch to a @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi James. Let me know if my side chat starts to annoy people.|pg||
mb|2N|an|Wk !cs or GF|nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a fair case for the trump ace lead, though it is a hard problem. to beat this partner will need an entry, so maybe look at dummy before you decide what to do|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think so if he finesses the 1st trick then attacks @hs, if s wins he has no @c to lead if n wins no reentry.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If anyone knows W name, let me know.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no at all , keep going :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|Forced|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ah, good, that beats it.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s switch after @cQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems  3NT shot to start in board 77|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe may fall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E showed a lot of restriant here|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this plays better from south|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surely not 2S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: That's all he could be thinking about at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no way- 1nt?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S lead coming from W |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hopefully this set they play a little faster|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dream on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell in the tank atm. He has coffee this set!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: young and fearless|pg||
nt|santyclz: Katz perhaps?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I voted for Swanson:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or A@C to see dummy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surprised by the lack of a -ve type X from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 honour cards and may as well have none|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh the pairing i'm looking at is obsolete|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer has 7 quick tricks |pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: very friendly lie|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (if it stops here)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is an excellent case for a low club lead on this auction|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I am not awake yet... it does play better from north|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer points out 2 down with c ruff|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: has to move for 2 more A@C helps a lot |pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS cashing in their optimism|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: And there it is|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: deep finesse experts:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: home gives another @C and 9 tricks |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
nt|tez: sry.private|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S is probably OK at match points BUT against good opposition at teams it is not a good idea|pg||
nt|ralfwil: difficult to find, but after @hA a @d switch had broken 4@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: played a small @H beacuse makes no dammagge but if opps play @S he will go for a @C next |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Jim is asking about whether or not Roy can have majors|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: I play like that, that after a A lead a switch indicates a doubleton, so W could play low and later give the ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|copeyj: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265 for E/W|pg||
nt|santyclz: After a king lead a switch indicates a singleton?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/robinson-boydrrevision.pdf is the card for N/S|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c2|nt|tejjyid: not an encouraging start for the trailing team when your opponents bring home a 22 point 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: the upside is too low and the downside is too large|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: Specs agree with you MArtin|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c8|nt|kit: This won't turn out to be the most effective lead, but still will defeat thecontract|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|daman: one more trick    made 4|pg||

nt|daman: he should by default|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: the pay of ace and another works too|pg||
nt|lml: East will be endplayed|pg||
nt|daman: that's what I meant    he sorta has a one way guess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: if North was givng up on 3-3 @C, I don'tknow why he wouldn't cash the Ace 1st|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's gonna go for a @h exit I think|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hi David|pg||
nt|tejjyid: he might play East for 5 @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|nt|daman: onless he plays for Kx with East|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jameslee 2: 10 |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: In CR, south responded to 1@C with 2N and west tried high @C lead and continued the suit, so it scored.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfh: ew play intermediate 2 bids so 2H shows better than 10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: that might have been a try at a swingy result being so far down, but not their farther away|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: I like EW's 2-bid methods, but can't find anyone to play them.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: what are you refering to Ed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oh sorry missed your earlier comment|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: Intermediate 2 of major openings, as our operator mentioned, like 10-13.  That lets auctions like this one run smoothly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if west can make a battlefield decision and bail over 3@S?  Guess not and auction did seem forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so the style may have worked against them here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: looks like "no double, no trouble" on an otherwise ugly  hand|pg||
nt|othered1: would you have passed 2@H playing standard?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a tossup but maybe since no good inviting bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||

nt|roswolf: a healthy swing to robinson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Seamon shakes head after the A@C comes down|pg||
nt|daman: played by South in the OR   no chance to make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|tejjyid: doing enough to maintain doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dougy!|pg||
nt|santyclz: X or 1@D?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! a direct lead when you suspect that partner can win a trick, it´s a singleton. after a winning trick, it´s a doubleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Roy reminds the table, what he writes on paper are NS agreements, not necessarily what he has.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: in the other room, the trap pass of 3@D worked|pg||
nt|daman: 12 IMPs to Bathurst|pg||
nt|daman: East opened this hand in the OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Standard prealert in case i forget later: Both pairs play short 1@d limited opening|pg||
nt|kit: rodwell can pass, bid1NT, or even try a 3-card major here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big swing in this 3Nt other table @S lead other side declarer |pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Why 1@C?  was he treating it as balanced?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a comfprtable 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Standard for Lall and Grue|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi doug dey|pg||
nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobh1: not sure why Roy doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: perhaps x is transfer to 1@S|pg||
nt|othered1: to show @S in a transfer style?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: after losing 500 Hamman expected a sub strength 3 club bid rather than a full value|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: +140 will be a great result for N/S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This set finishes at bd 90|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad fit & bad distribution dangerous hand to crool up |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: so here the operator is just putting in the final contract to help us catch up|pg||
nt|copeyj: and the Welland team has a good result next door|pg||
nt|lml: it was set up by a weak opening bid by east in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: 1N only has a 5cM if they're 5 little or if S prefers to show it as 4 cards|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jameslee 2: good stop by W and not easy also wd |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jameslee 2: 25 honour caount points and made it to play only 2@H |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this is interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i fancy declarer|pg||
nt|bobh1: does he have to guess @Hs?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but west's double may point the way for declarer to get it right|pg||
nt|daman: Hurd opened|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Oh, Justin and Joe are sitting out? Didn't know. |pg||
pc|c7|nt|tejjyid: West not stopping out of 4@S |pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: Grue has the right idea -- pretend like you are declaring 1@D instead of defending, and draw trumps|pg||
nt|santyclz: W doesn't believe that the opps opening 1@c isn't forcing in this vul.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|ady: e/w have wide range of 1 level overcalls|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||

nt|bobh1: trump coup?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nick is asking about distribution|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: if east had 2 low spades and an extra diamond  would he have kept 1spade open?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Seamon is back and ready it seems.|pg||

nt|daman: 10 in each hand|pg||
nt|daman: EW are in 5@D in the OR on 18|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Geoffrey.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Geoffrey|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Roy is by far the nicest person to VG|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He shows me all the alerts!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: for +650 and -100|pg||
nt|daman: played by East on a low @H lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it is very symmetrical |pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart lead will need a GPS queen locator|pg||
nt|roswolf: punt to game in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and 63 was wierd - i would love to know the auction|pg||
nt|copeyj: aggressive opening from Bramley next door got the job done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me S has an opening hand. If I dont act early, I can be outbidden´like now|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D a multi - weak 2M or 20+ HCP any 4441|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bd 63|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||
nt|roswolf: another disto hand -the dealong computer is working overtime|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point ed|pg||
nt|ady: differencce in overcalling at the 1 level at this table|pg||
nt|santyclz: For those new to BBO:  Hover your mouse over the other room score to show a pop-up of the bidding there.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: par here is 4@SD, down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: outlawed in many events isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy pass by south|pg||
nt|roswolf: artificial enq?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: west will redbl?|pg||

nt|lml: very very good|pg||
nt|lml: so do you balance as south?|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|lml: me neither but I am old|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 18|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 contracts 4@H/4@S for E|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could try a splinter 4@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or a 2@S bid |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or just end up in 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall: "No double? Seamon: "Can we double now?" after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: the heart bid from west not robust|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt asks suit, i ignore and bid 3@S with self sufficient 6|pg||
nt|daman: you don't look old :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It wouldn't be particularly harmful here though. You just have to know when to make the junior bid :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Or trasnfer to 2@h.|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is 3@H enough after the X?|pg||
nt|daman: Roland is old|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt creative not my choice |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If they play 2way game tries, 2@s would be SSGT so he had to bid 2n|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: supppose they play it artificial |pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobh1: cannot believe bramley's bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the minor Q's lok like complete trash|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nah, 106|pg||
nt|roswolf: might well end in 3nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer not to open on a hand like Ns. no texture|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3 losers if you guess @C here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty Anam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Drew explains 3@s is natural and accepting game ofc|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ralfwil: I dont´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Seems Kim liked 3@s a little too much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Jim*|pg||
nt|mr murray: I feel a bit of desperation in that bid.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: slam needs  2 out of 3 K missing placed |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I suppose that's because Drew didn't bid 3@d|pg||
nt|mr murray: at this point it is certainly warrented.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Assuming they bid game tries up the line, with @d values, he should have bid 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: it could have been staymanic too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very odd auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would X that with West just to discourage partner|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Magnus Magnusson|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Magnus|pg||
nt|iceking: hello|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 canadians here |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes true|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Walddk5: Who is the 3rd?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this match reminds me of a 60's match, roth-stoners versus standard bidders|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anyone with me?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: best chance for defense is a low spade back to the nine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: So, not sure we can blame Jim for getting excited|pg||
nt|mr murray: understandable when Drew didnt bid 3 diamonds that he might have the right cards for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: just a little:)|pg||
nt|daman: you are Canadian?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt put up the jack he might hve a guess later|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd open it 2@H.|pg||
nt|roswolf: not i a clear opening|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5/4 7-10|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s = ART, forcing. |pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if I pass on N, - if there is a game we will find it|pg||
nt|mr murray: club or heart beats it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Bramley's tanking on lead. He doesn't know anything about Jim's hand except he has 5+@h and 4+@s|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfg: NS joke about knowing this sequence. It came up yesterday|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: slam will go down then A@D not a ussufull card  pity|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: if he thinks E has ace, i mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Casen's desperate for an entry to hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: north must think the world is crazy and lets e/w get on withir|pg||
nt|roswolf: with it|pg||
nt|lml: you are going to want to let the opponents play hearts for the max tricks here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jack is right card of course but sometimes reflexes take over|pg||
nt|odysseus69: gain for Nickell when they played last in 4S rather than 5 clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|copeyj: will locate the @CQ I think|pg||
nt|iceking: my grandfather moved to iceland from canada when he was 17 so iam like 1/8th canadian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you came to canada and paid the 25$ exit fee we count you as Canadian|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: When you open by agreement on hands that once would have been considered semi-psyches, your later bidding has to allow for it.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: and 2@h dbl is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: they were never going to x 2@h though Ralf|pg||
nt|copeyj: who was going to penalise that?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 78 3nt made in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: hoping  doubleton honor diamond with west|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this wont make but -1 0nly might be possible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: there is always an option|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: most americans play sound weak 2s and therefore  i think declarer will play for the outside strength to be with east who did rdbl|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: better to cash|pg||
nt|iceking: this tourney is such a grind |pg||
nt|daman: on 18   EW went 1 down in 5@D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: NS are going to have to break @hs here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: But with all the spots it doesn't matter who plays them|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|daman: might be a double partscore swing |pg||
nt|daman: for 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lml: so far opening light has got too good results|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mr murray: got to try heart 8 now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ask him self which finesse take no more entrys for 2 jobs :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I think Joe's X says enough for Mike to hit 4@S, in my style anyway |pg||
nt|tejjyid: sorry, East's X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: for West...etc.|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D +3 at this table    6IMPs to Nickell|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can have a full count now and discard a @c|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|mr murray: of course nothing matters. when things go bad they seem to stay that way|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|roswolf: another cocktail of life and death|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a roland slam, with unlucky outcome:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not a friendly hand for ew here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They're discussing what 3@h by N instead of 3@d would be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: S says it was the weakest possible hand and that N should bid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: But Jacobs comes in with, "Why would you want out? Opener vs opener?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: pass is ofcourse mistake he probably opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you prefer to show a red  2-suiter as E or bid 2@d?|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2 suited overcall or 2@d for the lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: So Roy responded: "Because we went -2."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Beatty has alerted to S yet, He may have forgotten. He's asked for a second to remember|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He comes to the right conclusion tho|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 80  a 4@S +2 contract @S 2/2 & K@D on side |pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: it wasn;t strength showing with three queens :)|pg||
nt|lml: as the cards lie 4@S east-west can go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: 90 imp lead for Welland. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: looked like down 2 to me also|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Operator, could u check this auction please?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: it was. I fixed it|pg||
mb|3C|nt|copeyj: battle of part scores here|pg||
nt|copeyj: South will (I guess) bid 2@S showing a fit now?|pg||
nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprised no opening by roy as west -he must respect the colors some of the time|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx, sorry|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT = 2 places to play the hand|pg||
nt|daman: might hard to pass the North hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Might even be 3, it's a general t/o|pg||
nt|lml: here north will convert clubs to diamonds to clarify|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah, the system is lagging. So it's hard getting the right bids in|pg||
nt|iceking: oh didnt see this would happen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pushey for Roland but the mandatory opening bid may encourage North to sniff|pg||
mb|3H|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passel shows a strong sense of rubber bridge pragmatism|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: an extension of support doubles -interesting idea|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: did north bid 4@H I DONT THINK SO|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now he sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|bobh1: barts hand is suddenly very prime|pg||
nt|roswolf: east no doubt is required to hold a good hand when he bids like this|pg||
nt|othered1: and he's right to get in -- they make a bunch of @H as cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am surprised passell did not use texas transfer, should play better from east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: youth, style, and vulnerability conspire to make an opening bid out of the S hand, and no denying it can work. still, S has a low offense-to-defense ratio, and insufficient Losing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Trick Count to open by normal standards|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome all the spectators and the operator|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D will make E try a slam for sure |pg||
nt|mr murray: they might get back 13|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Casen shakes his head as he thinks about the last hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Severe case of dummy-locked. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: roy may not be done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is self restraint|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless he was barred by the huddle|pg||
nt|iceking: are we in 1100 range here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: what does east need to raise a 20 count?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: must have done|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@h retransfer is not so unlikely|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess almost unfettered aggression cuts both ways|pg||
nt|daman: looks like the same 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be 800|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more IMPs for Nickell on Board 19    double partscore swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||
nt|copeyj: although game not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: 4 tricks for north isnt that down 4|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: roy welland does like to mix it up but this time it backfired|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thi will be more fun forNS than playing 4@H, anway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 5|pg||
nt|iceking: he asked for @H now so will get 2 ruffs east will get one more @D ruff the ace of @S and one @C trick in end 1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Katz is thinking about a @s from the looks of it|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure Nickells @D 4 meant something|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Maybe he's thinking about if Nickell signaled a stiff @h or @hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't think he imagined a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a full 1.5 losers short of the canonical criterion|pg||
pc|c2|nt|copeyj: has to win this in the dummy and draw trumps|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i cant see another plausible line|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|copeyj: still has to negotiate the @D suit|pg||

nt|copeyj: E likely to have good @h and has @SK so a decent chance of W having both @D honours|pg||
nt|iceking: so good start for Nickell here |pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: AJ@H K@S J@C and Q@D might be an opening bid with some shape (singleton @C)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree, so a small @d towards dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is W thinking about?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: has to play low @D now|pg||

nt|ady: but may be a poor result|pg||
nt|lml: so a phantom going for 800 in both rooms|pg||
nt|daman: a breathless push|pg||
nt|puncher99: not taking the finnesse is right if the opps are in game|pg||
mb|2H|nt|puncher99: u dont want the q to b onsides|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a more sedate hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pay up magnus :)|pg||

nt|iceking: this was really very easy hand to defend |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a peaceful 1nt!?|pg||

nt|lml: 6 is a Roland slam|pg||

mb|2N|nt|lml: 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: looks that way :)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   should be reached|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3nt will finishe contract|pg||
mb|3N|nt|daman: pass by Katz denies as little as 3 card @H support|pg||
nt|lml: Nickell doesnt need 3 card support though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know but it happens a lot when you have too many good options|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: favourable lie of cards here - no @S guess to get wrong, @H 3-3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is a 3@H stopper probe reasonable from East here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey really wants to bid 3nt..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT sems unilateral - I presume 3@D from West denied a good fit, so you can't run @D tricks|pg||
nt|daman: commonly referred to as a support double    which was invented by Eric Rodwell...who is playing in this match at the other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: note that if you change club jack to queen  -- only 1 HCP and still an unsupported minor honor --  the prospects for making slam are considerably enhanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a double would have shown 3 card support and a raise to 2@H would guarantee 4|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if 3@H is forcing since it is alerted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D or 2S with West? |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably not keen on either;)|pg||
nt|puncher99: since they play a club system  he knows their max is 25 and pard didnt opn nt so prob less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: NS are playing transfer advances. so 2@s is a wk raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9/10 tricks home with KQ@D in good place |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|puncher99: its usually a balanced hand  no 5 card majors to bid the nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meck is asking about 2@h by N|pg||
nt|puncher99: look likes easy 110 or a hard 140|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall replies its fairly constructive|pg||
nt|santyclz: I think we can all agree on that...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: @cQJ are in a good place too|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: will he duck 1 @H ?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  for all scores after 75 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: E says 3@d = I like it.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, as unilateral bids go, this one looksto have good chances|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: E may be doomed to make this|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if eventually N breaks the frozen club suit as needs must, likely to go right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: South failed to bid 2@C   made a MP bid of 1NT instead|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2 more rounds of @cs?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tejjyid: presumably 1st round @D control|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think opening 2nt makes slam bidding easier, but of course grue's double does|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's forcing, the table confirms|pg||
nt|lml: it seems a reasonable way to play it and keeps some room open to look for better things|pg||
nt|lml: North has an ugly lead.  What would you pick?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: trump|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: 3@D says LIke? Thn East claerly has to go on|pg||
nt|lml: cute|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s is some kind of wide ranging hand also|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: with normal misguess in @C now this will few down|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: 5NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's now probably going to consider playing @c |pg||
pc|d2|nt|tejjyid: I withdraw the "unilateral"|pg||

nt|puncher99: 140 now with lo club off |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfg: Alert: Dont want to play it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5nt pick a slam|pg||
nt|iceking: low @D return now maybe|pg||
nt|daman: the @C 7 was suit preference|pg||
nt|iceking: pd seldom has stiff @D as N didnt suggest @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the @c7 def doesn't led the low @d return theory|pg||
nt|daman: but a low @D would be cool|pg||
nt|puncher99: but thts double dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|iceking: yes but even so east should think himself what shape pd has|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h return looks best - as we can see all cards|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ady: pick a slam    they only have one fit|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: w can now make 9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: tilt on spade ace|pg||

pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: only 2 @s tricks to the defence|pg||
nt|lml: not seeing 7 though|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: going back to the 2D/2S question my view for hat its worth is that 2D is best when the hand is poor and the spade support is poor|pg||

nt|copeyj: for an imp|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: so the club underlead gave nothing away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my take on that -- generally agreeing -- is that 2S may be in order on 3/6 when there  is more hope of game when partner is short in diamonds |pg||

mb|4C|nt|roswolf: slam likely to be bid here!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s showed a minor|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 options for Nickell here 2@S-3@S-pass|pg||
nt|daman: the defense of 3NT on Board 20 was less than spectacular|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt from Jacobs?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now *that's* a weak 2...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|copeyj: 2@S is about 10-13 for N/S|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s lead beats it|pg||
nt|iceking: what should Katz bid here 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: depends on there agreemeants|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: might bid 4@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lead directing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can deny that zia has a weak raise|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: pass was a big reach|pg||
nt|daman: it creates a playing field full of moguls|pg||
nt|iceking: oops are in strong seq so usually bids here from east should be naturalish shape showing, incase pd wants to compete |pg||
nt|iceking: east ofcourse has a incredible strong hand compare to NS bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really tell who is strong to make fine differences in meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: intermediate  opening - far too strong for a weak 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: nice fit - stiff @D opposite AXXX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 4@D to me showed diamonds, has to more we don't know|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think he can because he needs the entry to finesse hearts.  They got a trump lead in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: now he should bid 2@D|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and non vul too:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is S thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Knowing how aggressively NS overcall, I'm surprisd Lall can consider a move over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should be celebrating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just be happy you find spades|pg||
nt|iceking: so now the question is does 4@H set up forcing situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for that reason i would have doubled 3@S to confirm strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and avoid partner bidding 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nick bid with the yarb again. so maybe 4@h does do so|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding should end here i cant see N dbl this|pg||

nt|daman: Hey John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi|pg||

mb|d|nt|gowdy: hi |pg||
nt|iceking: with so many@D and no spade spots i doubt he will dbl but he might|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia alerts the dbl as a game try of some kind, not penalty.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fortunately it was not possible to catch them|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4@D was alerted as showing @C|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead normally would beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d showed @cs. Was the alert|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He was probably tihnking about if N was 6-4 or something|pg||
nt|daman: what is going on?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: George.. You might be jinxing E/W :)|pg||
nt|daman: no jinx|pg||
nt|daman: lol   look at this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer to something? but why not transfer to @H |pg||
nt|bobh1: bramley adpting roy's opening style now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok i missed that obviously, but 6nt is always a possibility|pg||
nt|daman: they were saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it isnt clear to lead a diamond.  It sounds like West has them wired|pg||
nt|daman: we should expect to see a semblance of normal bridge|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes when you make a strange bid the defence does help out|pg||
nt|lml: because they believe you|pg||
nt|daman: they save you from yourself|pg||
nt|daman: he will x 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C as a lead director on that poorish hand at unfavorable facing a passe dpartner is understandable, but the real flaw isn;t any of those things  -- it is that youy dont have an ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: entry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I must confess - I had bid 3nt as E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: am I alone?|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd bid 2nt (leb) then 3 to show fear and trepidation.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They play leb responses from what i can tell. 3@d directly shows 8-11ish so there was no need for 3n|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: it sounded like Nickell had a diamond trap pass|pg||
nt|iceking: he still cant really dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I whack|pg||
nt|iceking: why you dont trust them:)|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if 5@C is a good save|pg||

pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: true if N *is 4261, that's nice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: this coiuld be played in one minute|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D presumable artoficial gf|pg||
nt|bobh1: i suspect roy will bid the slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the spade lead will be almost automatic|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have wrongsided it|pg||
nt|roswolf: since east will declare 6@H|pg||
nt|puncher99: best defence gets 800|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobh1: all these transfers sometimes backfire|pg||
nt|daman: my partner overcalled and I have 4 trumps to an honor plus an Ace|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: I guess 5NT might leave the grand open as an option as well|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: far too quick:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps doub will not know why he is getting the @S lead he requested|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the spade lead highlighted now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N overcalled at favorable and was forced to bid over 4HX. way too pushy to move|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 90 secs:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: John Matheson points out that West dodged a bullet by not doubling with his dbleton @S and a 13 count|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 7 of the 8-11 ins in @s AK10x|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iceking: the good news 5@S was never makeing |pg||
nt|iceking: even 4@S probably dont make|pg||
nt|kit: and that best defense is coming|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: south thinks west has diamonds too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If not many @d, at least the KQ|pg||
nt|lml: even KQ10x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: point is, from S he only cares about the KQ, @hs are good with an entry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: or even just the K@d|pg||
nt|lml: might switch to a club I guess.  he needs tricks|pg||

pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: right; there's nice, and there's realistic|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|nt|copeyj: and perfect for flannery (dare I say it)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on last another 5 for Bathurst when West rebid 2D rather than 2S|pg||
nt|santyclz: 0 1 3 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|4+!s|nt|copeyj: but E/W don't play it so has to settle for 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: do e/w play 2/1?|pg||
nt|roswolf: trappy hand for n/s|pg||
nt|kit: I've never thought that that sort of jump to 4@S is a winner.  You can outbid them if need be.  So why not make limit raise and give partner a chance to look at his hand.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: are we sure the score was making 5?|pg||
nt|lml: if the play went as we saw it should be 4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yes it made 5|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he did finesse the heart?|pg||
nt|iceking: normal end up in 4@H here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bart says "Nice spots, pd."|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: S tossed the @cK|pg||
nt|lml: okay thanks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this could catch a cold|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nonvul colds heal fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: doubt it Geoff looking at that 2@D call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this double is effectively a short suit game try, but quite optomistic|pg||
nt|daman: yes   I agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless they develop into double pneumonia:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3nt is quite a bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Double is not a SSGT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Alerted as willing to play 3@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Its either @ds or GF w/ @c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|iceking: is it down on @D lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: run to 10 then|pg||
nt|iceking: makes then|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: am sure this will be passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler: I have too much" as dummy comes down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always grisly when it is the PARTNER of the NT bidder who starts with AK and gives RHO a rufff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: well that confirms no 2/1|pg||
nt|iceking: and might do it|pg||
nt|puncher99: 6hearts only beaten by a trump lead  on lst hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We're about to find out|pg||
nt|iceking: even N doesnt guess this,,, its going to be not that easy defend this|pg||
nt|mr murray: it is|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: 3@C or 2nt scramble would have been my choices instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: well West couldnt help with a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is asking about leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell explains if E has a choice, he should unblock the suit if possible|pg||
nt|lml: this is just an unfriendly hand for north south as the double suggests|pg||
nt|daman: it must be South who is hesitating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Theyre all thinking|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: not easy to beat 3N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but how to bid it? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has to play a D honor on first round i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing 14-16 NT might wander into it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 16-18 better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe so:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: looks like e/w are playing 15-17 and n/s are playing 14-17 NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, tournament players have to narrow it from the standard 13-18 of rubber bridge:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: suicide bomber fared less well in open room|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|copeyj: unlikely to make with @DQ offside, @CA offside|pg||
nt|lml: so do you play the double asks for a heart lead in this auction?|pg||
nt|kit: good reopening by Grue -- he found a nice catch|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|iceking: on board 22 not same tempo in open room,,, bidding ended in 5@D dbled down 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is 800 pneumonia? or just a heavy cold|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: THIS MAY WELL PLAY QUITE WELL|pg||
nt|ady: again a trump lead best    but does not beat this one|pg||
nt|kit: Now Rodwell has to find diamond shift immediately|pg||
nt|kit: And that J109x of clubs is so, so, tempting|pg||
nt|kit: But with partner having 6 diamonds, it is hard to see how diamond shift can be wrong.|pg||
nt|puncher99: ur real lucky when u lead  a stiff trump and ur pards ajx doesnt get wasted|pg||
nt|mr murray: they havent been right on their shotting stars yet. They are due. Not this time :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|copeyj: thats one hurdle dealt with|pg||
nt|iceking: Katz should figure this out, i assume Nickell will return @S 8 so he should have @D void|pg||
nt|iceking: he still though needs to guess what other H pd has like if he has Qx in @H not @C king he will need to play for upper-cut|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: between 2@c and 2@s, one of the bids showed Roy's hand, or at least that he had 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@h by Bart = 4@h, suit setting |pg||
pc|s5|nt|copeyj: has chances now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well defence may help of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: just needs to avoid 3 @C losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4 @C losers I mean|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely to be a swing to Welland|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 imps or 7 imps depending on whether he makes or goes down 1|pg||
nt|daman: I do|pg||
nt|iceking: so this is not over by no means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s was willing to play 3nt|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: THE @D9 is a very good card|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: and well earned.I dont like 1nt on E|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes and it seems that getting to @Cs would be worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think grue will have a singleton club around 95% of time for his double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on what N does on the first round of diamonds in 3N:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: a command   not a suggestion|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and not 4 diamonds, so in effect both explanations the same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They are going over agreements again. 3@s in this auction is apparently undiscussed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mr murray: another big pickup for welland|pg||
nt|santyclz: 25 unanswered imps this session before this bd.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|copeyj: not much choice in 2/1 Ralf|pg||
nt|kit: But there is still a catch -- West would have to not play a third round of diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: unless you play 3@D as natural invitational|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: they are going to have to cash out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking NOrth covered the @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: well not as long as nickell doesnt take the third club|pg||
nt|daman: he can't make more than 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: not yet anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: ok well defended |pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: really well done give them credit|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: kind of halfway signals but they worked|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: yes  very nice|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cQ|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfg: They claimed 5 after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: And now all left for a smoke|pg||
nt|tejjyid: such a healthy game :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smokers do it faster|pg||
nt|ady: going for a coffee|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess no-one lights the filters of their cigarettes (under stress) any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they're back, 2 of them anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I have to say that the flavour of a burning Kent filter was particularly nasty|pg||

mc|9|nt|fabsayc: radical concept to play 3NT with 54 fit, but actually the better the spades the more likely 3NT is right|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe a big club system with control-showing responses (gotta get an ad for Blue Team in) would let west count losers on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is equivalent to playing 3NT with a long minor, if minor runs 3NT ok, may have first 9|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Game time|pg||
nt|iceking: we see alll hands looks easy from here, but Katz had some guessing to do it was not all clear |pg||
nt|daman: they are in 4@S on 23 in the OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is east hand a 2@C opener|pg||
nt|mr murray: to make 6 I meant in other room|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @d10 was a winner, so max|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ok|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: another hand of untold promise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: or any 3-card minor (not 2@s reverse)|pg||
nt|mr murray: this of course was always safe|pg||
nt|santyclz: So the slam needed a @c lead.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|copeyj: not a very exciting hand here - unless they can get 3N played by W and avoid @C lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: amazing score, four infinities|pg||
nt|mr murray: essentiallly yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have opened the north hand|pg||
nt|ady: partial |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah you're right|pg||
nt|daman: only my mother would open 2@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Rather better suit than his last 2@s bid...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: rather different colors too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: not likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reminds me of the old lancia matches:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whoops|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: now how will north catch up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: transfers over 1@C opener might get you there with E opening 1@C but thats it|pg||
nt|lml: 2@h might have got through|pg||
nt|odysseus69: enough|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: well that left nothing to spare|pg||
nt|daman: it won't now|pg||
nt|lml: he had to start with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: in the game now|pg||
nt|ady: could the diamond be short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ifyou compare this to 93,West has just made a very heavy simple raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2+ limited|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They're going to settle for 2@d. Katz doesn't want to start a double war.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can i have her phone number :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm about to lose the alerts. They're handing writing is like font 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: their*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: hand writing*.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The only thing i can read off 2@h alert is that its 19+|pg||
nt|kit: would be nice to follow their bids here, probably will be a long sequence with a lot of artificiality|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2N probably some kind of relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a quick-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: As 4@d come down in dummy, Nick says: "That's the good news"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meck made a mistake here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, 6@H is a fine contract, and I would expect they will be able to find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He changed his "@s" to @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Tie game again. Lets see if Grue and lall keep looking for blood. Not sure how many people dbl 3@h last hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The only thing they are missing is aces|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: THIS WILL BE PASSED|pg||
nt|lml: well at least he has 1 dummy entry|pg||
pc|d5|nt|copeyj: so|pg||
nt|lml: which will give him a second one later|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I was looking at 3 spade ...senior moment|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do now with the south hand assuming you were not looking at four hands|pg||
nt|lml: I might switch to clubs|pg||
nt|lml: @SK and then clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's probably thinking about if he can score his @hQ or not. So I think he's temped to play a trump. Not so much a @c when he sees no dummy entry to play towards hand yet|pg||
nt|lml: hard to play a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe|pg||
pc|d3|nt|copeyj: spotlight to robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D probably 3@S maximum hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D openings require lots of special understandings in strong club auctions|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely to be a game swing to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|copeyj: who are opening up a bit of a lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure I would have led @H too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad start for robinson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!  not for me! leads from 1087x and from J862 is forbidden if there isn´t a very good reason|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: i think they were the primary reason Garozzo abandoned Precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s just says he can't double 1N. They don't seem to have a lot to do this auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: good play|pg||
nt|lml: wow if Katz put up the @SQ which really doesnt cost much he can do very well|pg||
nt|iceking: agressive spot|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 12 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: even if S leads a @H|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the problem with opening 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: judging not to unblock |pg||
nt|odysseus69: c7 may be Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if playing Smith some play that high from leader means poor holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We have another director call|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: yes, I like to remove all the balanced hands into 1NT - of course that creates other issues|pg||
nt|ady: initial trump lead best|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S probably RKC for hearts|pg||
nt|kit: 5@D asking for queen of trumps|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: still I believe the Robinson team can bring in the recent Cavendish pairs winners Kit Woolsey and Fred Stewart in the next stanza|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N was inconsistent in the auction at best|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: yes and @C is his strongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought about it, and after the 5 min tank, he probably should have too.|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell    retakes the lead|pg||
nt|iceking: so with trump return now this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|iceking: there have been alot of unclear carding here so far |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Actually. This is the first time they are in the lead this match|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: I think he should have the cost is very little|pg||
nt|lml: and the award vrey big|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on a hand loke wests I use 2nt as forcing with 4+@h and @s control and 3@s as forcing without @s control|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: By no Q there I meant no @d control|pg||
nt|puncher99: wonder what pass meant over the x for the q  ask?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be No @hQ, no?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|daman: yes   it was a tie earlier|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh zagorin just gave it Katz didnt read it didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) the @C Q may have been a better choice|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave you now    it's been fun      see you tonight|pg||
nt|iceking: have fun at the hockey match|pg||
nt|iceking: isnt that always the case if Canadian needs to leave in hurry there is some ice hockey going on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead from king was normal so cashing spade ace first i can see why Katz misguessed|pg||
nt|gowdy: could  be curling as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only Vancouver team still in stanley cup of hockey|pg||
nt|iceking: Curling is forbidden in iceland actually we have law against that sport|pg||
nt|kit: anyway, they got to the good slam, which makes even on a trump lead with diamonds 3-3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: it is often right to fall back on ancient principles|pg||
nt|ralfwil: like... my keyboard can´t spell:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: then its easy for us to say :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: covering heart not good|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfg: Apparently joel really needed a tissue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently victor was right about S catching a cold in 3H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hurd tells Zia not to think too hard|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: and 9 easy tricks now. N is squeezed|pg||
nt|copeyj: has 9 top tricks now and will make 2 overtricks I think when @SQ drops doubleton and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead will then be up to 40|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfg: This was much to lose with either the Q or T play. If he guesses right then he has an entry that opps will eventually give him.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lml: he needs the entry then so he can play hearts .. not sure a late entry is that good|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfg: He needed 33@hs i think. the late entry for @cs was just as a good|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they use brooms so is witches sport|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|lml: if he plays hearts from his hand he has to lose 2 hearts, a club, 2 spades and 2 trump no matter what|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 2nt is for me asking for side suit and inviting|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we have some yes's and some no's.  the fear of the yes's is partner will bid and create a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Les Bart predicts Robinson will bid 4@S courtesy of having no sure entry to the @S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: i much prefer a direct 3@C unless that has a special meaning|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Mixed Raise  = why should they go down when we can?|pg||
nt|daman: "stay fixed"|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid again but I would think I might be had|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: if p cant dbl 4@s to show something, you shouldn't bid anything with that hand. N has a very good pass|pg||
nt|iceking: over 1@S i meant|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@D had slam intentions|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 5@D would have been better picture bid of W hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that scenario, if N has seven of diamonds instead of 8 the correct defence for E is to exit with the six, not the two. that way N does not score the beer card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yes, by convention they also bid the side suit over 2n|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: or just 3nt give it up|pg||
nt|iceking: problem ofcourse with 5@D as they play, 3@D might have been some fragmeant bid |pg||
nt|iceking: or what do they bid with some monster @H hands i assume 3@D or 3@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead interesting by Katz, figuring if partner cant bid he has to have openers suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: A lot of people would double with W's hand for the blacks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not show blacks|pg||
nt|iceking: well thought out lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: oh, 1@c was opened. sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Now this should be doubled, but Rodwell hasn't shown his trump support yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: dont they play transfers over 1M-X?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@h is for me an overbid as well as 4@h|pg||
nt|mr murray: the only one who didnt overbid was bramley and he has the best hand :):)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nowadays penalty doubles doesn´t exist.|pg||
nt|mr murray: what dat!!!|pg||
nt|mr murray: spade lead would give them a chance to beat it. now doesnt look good for def|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: overboard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i can live with mixed raise, likely would not have bought hand for 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes I like the 4@S bid.  You dont have defense and you do have offense|pg||
nt|kit: they do play transfers, but only up to 2@H I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Theyre taking a smoke break after this hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: Many players can rebid nt with a singleton in partners major. I don´t like it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clearly seamon expects more points than partner is producing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very optimistic if 2@C was weak|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: I want to trust at least a doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: never seems to cost however|pg||
nt|marlowepi: important psychological point when playing juniors, gotta be tough as nails|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Here 3@h is clearly a form of checkback to play @ss|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: Ugly -- even if declarer leads spade to queen, he has problem of of getting back to his hand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: anything else is whimpy|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dinos1: so 2@h 2@d 1@s and 1@c to lose|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense has to be careful -- they need to set up their diamond winners before giving club ruffs.|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 800 always there -- it is the 1100 the defense is after|pg||
nt|kit: no, sorry -- it is the 800|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: very interesting hand to play|pg||
nt|odysseus69: road home not obvious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia is asking about their openings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very hard hand. maybe spade knave now, and heart queen later|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|daman: so says Popeye|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gowdy: nice play however his 5@C was enough |pg||
nt|fabsayc: come on ralph this is cold|pg||
nt|iceking: nothing Katz can do here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Can't blame the man for trying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kevin and Katz discuss the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know this won't be popular, but i think their should be penalties for a single long pause either in bidding or play|pg||
nt|gowdy: he needs P to have the @d q and @H A and @C a or k 6   thats alot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If the table players dont mind, we shouldnt either.|pg||
nt|iceking: he also knows pd had kj @C and AK @H he really cant have much more, so should probably see the hand is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There has been a director call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you are stealing opponents time when they need to think|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree iam not big fan of these huge pauses in middle of hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: no  i believe some hands take more time than others  take time on the tough ones no proble here|pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell nailed them in 2@C|pg||
nt|iceking: so we are even again|pg||
nt|mr murray: I pick def now. must not have heard michaels bid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: where is my spinach|pg||
nt|kit: jack of diamonds shift makes a lot of sense now -- he has to know his partner has every missing high card for the redouble|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: he played for 3-2 @hs with a stiff @d lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thought s was 5 2 1 5?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: still difficult to see a way home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hands like this are what top-level bridge are all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hurd may have gotten a few more strands of gray hair since the last trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: got the chance back ! @sQ!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: he was engaged n hurd mentality|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|mr murray: not unreasonable except bvramleys play of diamond queen fooled him I guess|pg||
pc|h5|nt|dinos1: now -2, coz W will be endplayed in @s's|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, the real cost of the Mixed Raise comes elsewhere. it dedicates a bid for small gains that could be used to cater to big ones|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|sT|pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: made this next door - will have to find out how later|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|mc|9|nt|marlowepi: naturally it has its successes too of course|pg||
nt|kit: now if declarer wins a diamond and exits with a diamond, queen of clubs, pitch, and defense wins out|pg||
pg||
