mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|bobh1: ed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: goo9d evening everyone|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|sybarra: 3 nt looks better than anything else |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bobh1: wolfson stayed out of the auction...a very good move|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty decent spot, but not necessarily as these cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on a finess on NS|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome to round 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3N is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents quiet, they're unlikely to be able to find it.  |pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder what E is thinking about?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: don't know but she is thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: not slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but bid it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Cheri -- welcome specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the 2nd of 8 15-bd segments for this quarter final match|pg||
nt|cherilou: Wolfson has started strong but there are still 90 boards to play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 105 to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: a rather intimate group at this table :)  |pg||
mb|5N|nt|bobh1: apparently yes she is thinking of slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two philosophies about transfers over 1@c - show a 4-card major first in a weakish hand, or show the long minor first|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry -- lost my connection but we didn't miss anything.  Garner thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play basic 2/1 std carding, EW Precision with additional gadgets|pg||
mb|6C|nt|othered1: Is that kickback (RKC in @H?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: doesnt seem like her partner can have 3 kcs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: why not -- isn't she unlimited?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west, I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i guess you're right forgot that E reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: obviously she expected more from 3@H (not 4@H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not the first choice of contracts maybe, but might make |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but that lead and down it goes|pg||
nt|peachy: System declaration for EW here http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=800&pid=458|pg||
nt|peachy: rather aggressice this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very vanilla -- straight down the middle for NS;  EW play Precision (Meckwell lite as they say)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfc: did well to find 3N in other room|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: figured S would pitch the K  try to discourage continuation |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not a good hand for upside down carding -- w/ old fashioned carding, the 3 would be clearly a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he has the entries to make this hand now that I look at it  |pg||
nt|peachy: Donn in the hot seat now|pg||
nt|sybarra: think about the 5 nt bid,  is that with stiff K of @D? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he can ruff a heart, play clubs twice, overtaking cash the 3rd club, cash the @DT and get back to dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|paulg:  A quiet start to this segment|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: 4@H by west over 2@H, "fast arrival," I guess would require east to always have either 4@H or 3@S.  Is that absolute in their style?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: garner:  "don't think too hard"|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|cherilou: Hi Joe! We have a great vugraph operator with us|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: Would S bid NT with stiff K|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherilou: welcome Paul|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: and yet, in a way, it's good for your team to have an opponent spend mental energy needlessly - so why tell him the hand is a pianola? |pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: big swing as first hand |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sure, it was in partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but N bid NT|pg||

nt|ahollan1: system summary forms [that also describe carding]  and NS ACBL convention card  under  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=20&task=list|pg||
nt|athene: not a bad 6@H or 6@C, or 6NT played by east|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: big 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: just needs the clubs to come in, basically|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|an|NAT, FG|nt|athene: 3@C from west might be this hand now|pg||
nt|pef: all four of the matches are pretty close at the 1/4 mark|pg||
mb|2S|nt|pef: simson deciding how many spades to bid at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: I think he decided he didn't want to push them anywhere, he knows things are splitting well for e/w|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|pef: 4s is probably keycard for hearts|pg||
mb|5C|an|0 or 3|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@H might make sometimes even when the clubs don't behave, as you can ruff them good and reach them with a trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wolfson-Cohen bid & made 6@C on 31|pg||
nt|athene: or on a spade lead maybe you rise @SQ and then play a diamond, going for diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   6@C|pg||
nt|athene: not sure if that is better than just drawing trumps and relying on the clubs|pg||
nt|pef: wolfson just gained a big swing on the first board.  their pair in the close room got to 6c on the 4-3 fit, diamond ace was led, but not continued.  so 25 imps on that choice|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps are 2-2 you are pretty much sorted; if they are worse you need the clubs to run|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|athene: maybe west could have worked out to deliver the diamond ruff by remembering the 5nt bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: i assume that was "pick a slam" which suggests south was happy to hear 6@D from his partner|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: so @DK10 more likely than singleton kink|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: singleton king|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn  EW in other room also playing a Big Club|pg||
mc|13|nt|ahollan1: but they end up defending 4@SX|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the cards ain;t worth a dime, if you don;t lay 'em down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT (and sometimes with real clubs, of course)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi Cheri|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong art|nt|paulg:  Interesting to see that both these pairs are playing a short 1@c with transfer responses ... more common in Europe than the USA in my experience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs here open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT and play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|sybarra: 3 @S now?|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|marlowepi: some would overcall 1S with N hand too|pg||
nt|paulg:  What a position for East .. having to bid his better minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nightmare for E to respond to that double|pg||
nt|cherilou: N's pass alerted to show less than 3@S. Common treatment in the US.|pg||
nt|sybarra: weak |pg||
mb|3N|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that I can just type faster than Joe *when* he is also entering the bidding|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least it's @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushing them right to slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: risk/reward of 1@S overcall is not good opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  When he is given the chance Richter should put about 5 Pass cards on the tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: can W find the killing @d lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the NS responses to 1@c (at the 1-level, anyway) seem remarkably like what I play with one of my partners  |pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@C will make but E is never going to cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and the torture continues|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: doesnt 6 @H make? |pg||
nt|peachy: this maybe is a little inferior, if we go resulting only|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: looks like 3N isn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are frozen so 4C is a making sve on a squeeze i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same bid in both rooms -- better than 4@H -- shows what they open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 1@s from N alerted as S didn´t support with a 4-card suit?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|cherilou: 3NT also because can't get to dummy to finesse @C|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|cherilou: gasping pass here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: 3NT could be "non-serious" slam interest, in case responder now wants to cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c very popular in England now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but should be alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one spade denied a 4-cd major (I was catching up and didn't get the alert in and it's too late once the auction ends)|pg||
nt|paulg:  and now he gets to play it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: auction inother room also interesting|pg||
nt|cherilou: this will go quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: a heartfelt "thank you partner"|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: Goren never bid hearts, AFAIK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ralfwil: ok|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: john swanson remarks that 3N as a minimum slam try is VERY minimum|pg||
nt|swanson: It's about as non-serious as one can get.|pg||
nt|bobh1: personally i like to be able to play 3N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably alerted - 4+@D, if the last deal is anything to go by|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: transfer response to 1@C for both pairs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and NS open pretty much any 11 count (not sure about EW)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must finess in @d now and I can only see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, N bid 1@s with 4@s 6@d on board 1|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Richter:  "which cue bid I am going to pass"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @H suit looks familiar|pg||
nt|athene: i mean you have a good hand as far as playing strength goes, but you don't have the hcp or controls which many strong club pairs are quite strict about|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|5+ !hs and 4+ !ds, 10-15|nt|pef: on the last board they are playing 4 spades doubled in the closed room, so another large pickup for wolfson (it would appear to go down 3 on the singleton diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but west hand doesn't really look like just 5-7 hcp either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=11-15 HCP, 5+@H & 4+@D|pg||
nt|athene: ekeblad-rubin play some odd canapé and use some 2-level openers to fill in the gaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should just copy/paste :(|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good bid from Ekeblad  not only descriptive, but catches partner with good hand for offense OR defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We are all very grateful to have Al here to explain the bidding - Russ Ekeblad asked me whether Al was here at the beginning of the last set, because he knows that Al knows their ...|pg||

nt|athene: not much more, but a little|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@SX went for 800   that's another 12 for Wolfson|pg||
nt|pef: I'm sure he thought about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this hand Goren in 4@H East|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h2|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Ekeblad return @C  if 1@S 2@C  or is his shape clear to declarer?|pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: nope|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: Aker team has to right the ship|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: In a match this close, 1 imp lost (had @D split 2-2) could be critical.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is natural but promises an unbalanced hand ... seems appropriate|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer responses to 1@D also it looks like|pg||
nt|paulg:  I expect 1NT is a game-forcing relay .. and then we'll be guessing|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|cherilou: Howard's wondering........|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play similar methods myself, but there are many different ways of doing the relay responses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1@D is unbalanced hand, usually 5 diamonds unless 4 X 1|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|swanson: 4@S is a good save here except N-S can't make 4@H.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now Goren bids the hts and it doesnt make |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|peachy: Some consistency :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bobh1: i have a different definition of a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: Give south credit for putting it to them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wolfson thought pass was forcing |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: good thing he did or he would lose 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment, 2@H there showing spade support|pg||
nt|cherilou: seems all is natural now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what would he do with x  KJ109xx QJx xxx I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish he played differently I'd guess :)|pg||
nt|cherilou: oops--not now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: maybe they play weak jump shifts. That can impact many other sequences|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c showed shortage, will Richter try to show the void now|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a break |pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of |pg||
nt|peachy: Aker needed some luck, but I dont quite understand playing a second club|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|cherilou: responses to this type of KC vary by partnership when a X occurs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: still has a lot to do |pg||
nt|peachy: Still, not enough to let it make, Goren was counting on too many covers in partner's hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulg:  it looks like Richter is concerned about a heart lead and is hoping to hear a confirmatory redouble showing first-round control?|pg||
nt|cherilou: often pass shows 0--but not by their methods|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|glen: personally, on these hands where the high card points are split, say 18-22, long term forcing passes will not be a net plus|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least ended up in right spot |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I could not see what the late round auction shows|pg||
nt|cherilou: play will be fast again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker thought no Key Cards, but it was "no heart control" by agreement -- that's what they said after the auction but why 5@H if not KC?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|swanson: On this particular hand, South would double 4@S even if his partner's pass was not forcing.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: SImson puts the screen down to ask what shapes are possible for 1@d|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Doug Simson can pickup 3 imp if he holds this to -2|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like double dummy he can hold this to down 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|an|2+ diamonds|nt|peachy: EW do not have weak two in diamonds available, even if E might otherwise consider it|pg||
mb|d|nt|cherilou: yes, if no KC then missing @S A and @D K--only 5@D should be bid|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: not sure how they play it  given their system,  should be weak|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||
nt|swanson: The bidding in the other room was a bit exuberant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||
nt|swanson: 4-5-2-2 hands are not pleasant to bid without Mr. Flannery's convention.|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  as Richter can continue with a constructive 2@s having shown his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  and heart length|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes and also a hand where not opening 1NT with S hand gives EW bidding room|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|paulg:  the flipside being that you prevent the opponents getting into trouble, as happened at the other table|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||
nt|swanson: But a 2@S rebid after partner's forcing 1NT is unattractive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes you need some kind of gazzilli to really show the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice escape.  Not going to make, but not doubled.  Still a minus on top of the -200 in CR will give Wofson a handy lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. I think W should play @dQ on @dA. N cannot have a 5-card @d, so It cannot be dangerous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can make now|pg||

nt|paulg:  here 1@c could be a weak notrump, so the West 1@s overcall is wide-ranging and East has to bid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|swanson: Strange to me that North didn't double 1NT after his partner and West decided 1@S was not going to work for E-W.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: Maybe, but Es double tells a lot. W has @cQ and E not the other top honours, so how defeat?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i thought 3@H  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: guess they reverse which major shortnes|pg||
nt|athene: usually these bids show 5431, so playing in the major is a possibility, but obviously not here|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's normal for responder to actually bid the shortness|pg||
nt|athene: so if you end up playing in the major opps aren't defending double-dummy|pg||
nt|pef: 3n by south made at the other table because east had a chance to overcall in spades so got a spade lead instead of a heart lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   i should have know better about how they show short major   it fits in with other auctions where the flip-flop|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pef: tough problem for south here, I think he made a good decision not to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|pef: for 3n to be right dummy needs both a heart card and minors so good that both will likely run|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|athene: well there goes their game|pg||

nt|bobh1: 3N is a good spot on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe thinking 3N might be better than 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: S should get to 7 tricks here even with @D blockage|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|glen: exactly, 2NT might be a try to get to 3NT on some hands|pg||

nt|athene: on that auction though i would say the heart lead was the normal lead anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Johnson thinks maybe he should have just jumped to 5@c and forgotten slam, before they got a chance to DBL @hs|pg||
nt|athene: if you want tricks you lead dummy's fragment rather than its shortage|pg||

nt|athene: west has a 4@S opener but opens it 1@S, as people do, for some reason|pg||

mb|4H|nt|paulg:  in his defence, this is potentially a very long event and you would wish to preserve as many brain cells as possible ... but it was worth a little more thought|pg||

nt|bobh1: 1N will make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good fit here |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it is not really practical to play that double by North guarantees four hearts, so South has a tough call over 2@s  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: if he knows the lead was not from KQ -- not sure how they lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cherilou: I think 3 was sufficient--E would take it to game. Often 2@H is bid with 5+ @H's and a stretch.........|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: curious, in a way, that no-one doubled. Perhaps the pairs are still feeling each other out - like the first few rounds of a boxing contest|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: this is probably the best defence. a small trumph will W win on his hand and play a @c|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so easy, but a winning line is  a @d to @dA and a @c|pg||

nt|mdgraham: a diamond back would make things very awkward|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: threatening diamond ruff would be good -- NS play standard C & A (except upside down discards)so N can't be sure of the diamond distribution|pg||

nt|glen: E wished W could show good hand via X of 2@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|swanson: E-W use 'good-bad' 2NT, so with a weaker hand West would bid 2NT as a relay to 3@C.|pg||
nt|othered1: right, but even if they play it west without @H might shy away from it.|pg||
nt|bobh1: kind of surprising if W likes her hand that she bid her suits out of order|pg||
nt|paulg:  it all came down to whether he thought East was 4414 or 4315 ... i don't really see why he should get it right|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Reverses are the black hole of standard bidding|pg||
nt|bobh1: alls well that ends well|pg||
nt|bobh1: not clear how to play this|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes develop @Cs but entries are an issue|pg||
nt|bobh1: awkward to win the @H in hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe just have to take a position in @Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: defense can prevail if they can get it right|pg||
nt|bobh1: win the @H K and play a low @C but maybe she's thought too long for that to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that is what she did|pg||
nt|swanson: The only hope for declarer is 3 heart tricks.  The defense could err because East did not make a negative double and will expect only a three card heart holding.|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't that work (low @C from dummy trick 2) if you guess the @C position next round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't the @H8 give the count?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think @h play is att with the T|pg||
nt|glen: another plan is wait for larry to fall asleep|pg||
nt|swanson: Levin has to win the @HK and lead a low club to give herself any chance I believe.  But South is going to shift to a diamond, which is a killer.|pg||
nt|glen: so everybody likes the @C Q at trick 2?|pg||
nt|glen: after winning @H K|pg||
nt|bobh1: if she won the @H smoothly and played a low @C Larry might be tempted to play the K|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobh1: but not after the tank|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down and Garner asking Aker questions|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW will be disappointed not to be playing in 4@h, but not clear who could have done more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must play on @d very early and no rounds of trumps|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|peachy: These are not the kind of hands that Aker needs, they want something that has an opportunity for a swing, ir two, or three|pg||
nt|sybarra: true |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i guess if @CJ or @C10  can't untangle the suit before !AH gone  but then @SK hasn't scored either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too bad   Johnson will open 1@D in 3rd seat so we don't get to see a specialty 4th seat 2@S opener from Rubin|pg||
nt|athene: rubin will bid 1@S, then when it goes X pass 1N, will he (can he) bid 2@D natural?|pg||

nt|athene: not really worth leaping michaels even if they play that here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it asks for @H stop|pg||
nt|athene: you want about 5 losers at worst for that i think|pg||
nt|pef: I was wondering that, but wouldn't you first double 2nt with that type of hand?|pg||
nt|athene: especially at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rubin asks about 2NT and I think Johnson says it asks for more information|pg||
nt|athene: of course he will be worried 2NT might be a bit of a bluff with a weakish heart raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: spec wondering what happens if Johnson bid immediate 4@H      me too|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: well my guesss is west bids 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: it's not exactly safe but then neither is passing|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pef: it might be one of those close your eyes and bid 4s hands by rubin if that had occurred, passing is just too dangerous|pg||
nt|pef: people tend to forget that not bidding can be as risky as bidding in many of these situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cohen didn't realize he had an opening bid   buys the hand for 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: rubin might think this is unusual in which case he will bid 5@D|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: @HT showing the Jack|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: standard operating procedure for defending a 2-suiter: force|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: he just has to let south make two trump tricks, i think, and accept one down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 3@H fetch?  my limited funds on defense|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff can surely beat 3@H if nothing else does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ohhhh  3@H played by south  so defense can't find @S ruff|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|d4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still down   so Aker plus in both rooms|pg||
nt|athene: just looking at the diamond suit in isolation, declarer would like to cash the ace then lead small to the nine, setting up a finesse to pick up south's holding for only one loser|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bobh1: so how did she play it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe my crashing caused problems.  she won @HK and played a small club to Cohen's K; he returned a heart, Levin ducked, and wolfson played another club, locking her in dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|swanson: In the Cohen version of Jacoby 2NT, 4@H shows a minimum, but no singleton.  I suppose South though his lack of high cards was compensation for the singleton.|pg||
