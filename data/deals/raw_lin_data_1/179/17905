nt|Vugraphzfc: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: Silverstein has a useful 21 IMP lead with 4 quarters to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|daman: actually NS play Ultimate Canape    much different from the Ultimate Club|pg||
nt|henryb:  notice the canape start|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  as you can see NS often open the 2nd laongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Canape in action -- starting with the shorter suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I believe canape was popularized by the Italian Blue Team|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  1N response, if he makes it, shows 0-1 spade|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: right   canape originated by Frenchman   Pierre Albarran   but popularized in different systems used by Blue Team|pg||
mb|2D|nt|henryb:  Predates them by a long time: some French pairs started playing it in the thirties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|daman: "popularized"|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  1@S shows longer @S as with 5@H 4@S they open... 1@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|Gerben42:  very friendly hand but communication problems to get the 8th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  looks like this will make exactly two|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  yes @HJ falls|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  in a way|pg||
nt|henryb:  Levin assumed that the trump lead suggested strong hearts|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42:  also it helps Meyers to know the @H position |pg||
nt|henryb:  Johan Bennet points out that an opening heart lead would defeat the contract|pg||
mc|8|nt|Gerben42:  in theory nice but not very realistic I guess|pg||
nt|daman: nobody would lead a @H on that auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  certainly tough|pg||
nt|henryb:  and I think a diamond at trick 2 would cut the communication anyway|pg||
nt|daman: a victory for canape |pg||
nt|daman: 2@H -1 in the CR   5 IMPs to Wolfson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other rooms visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/    but each match playing different set of boards|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but still you get 3@H 4@S and @CA |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: discussion here about how well alerted the defense was to the idea that north was likely short in spades with longer hearts;  had leader know N was short in spades, would have led ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: differently and possibly set the hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rubin "knew" Ekeblad had 3 hearts and the defense did not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: the issue I guess is that the pass of 1@H usually shows 3 because of the likelihood of canape|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but with a weak hand, would they really bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, without 3 hearts he would almost always bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: director was here and decision will come later|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  what convention cards are being used? ACBL or WBF?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: acbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfc: although many pairs have only the system summary form (no card)|pg||
nt|henryb:  ACBL + system descriptions on the USBC website that have been available for about a month|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@H was natural -- go figure|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: @S 2 lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: if Meyers had passed, 3@H would be invitational -- no agreement on this auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: right if declarer had k10 or q10|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you are worried about setting up dummy's spade spots but that was not so much an issue there with no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nubmaster: Får se om dom hittar 5@c, enda utgången som står|pg||
nt|hesse: aggressiv innmelding fra nord|pg||

nt|nubmaster: nej...|pg||
nt|hesse: alt han ser er en drømmetilpasning|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Skall man starta med 3@d här? Om då partnern hoppar till 4@s så kan man bjuda 5@c... att bara chansa in 4@h känns inte rätt|pg||
nt|hesse: kortfargebud i @d nå?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: varför inte först bjuda @h och sedan stödja @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: för mig är 2@h krav för en rond|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@h är väl inte krav här?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: 1@C is carrot, 9-12 or 17+ i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes they play that system|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||

pc|h6|nt|nubmaster: ja|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: they have to shift to a diamond at some point|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nubmaster: åhh|pg||
nt|athene: before the diamond goes on a club|pg||
nt|benjy: this could make if west continues with a 3rd @S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjy: looks like this should make|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: how to get opps into the right contract|pg||
nt|athene: it's not clear for either defender to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|benjy: how does he know his pd does not hold A10 of @S when it would be critical to continue the suit|pg||

nt|hesse: her var det flere mindre gode vurderinger|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll if WEst wins this hed better know what to do next|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: Basically NS play a simple 2/1 udca, & EW play a more complicated version|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer can't get back to hand but if she leads the @CQ, then the @CJ10x come down|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer can't get off the dummy though, so this will still fail|pg||
nt|athene: i mean lead @CQ after winning the king and unblocking in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even then a diamond shift takes the entry out before west's trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: so you still can't use the @C9 as a discard|pg||
nt|xenya: even that won'y help him|pg||
nt|benjy: her|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is similar to a 4@S in the semi-final|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @C9 here is playing for east to have misdefended|pg||
nt|athene: because with @CJ10x, objectively, he had to split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Aj10 of clubs with East is best faint hope|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E hesitated before playing @c3|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjy: pitch a @C on the established @S winner and lead trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|odysseus69: of course East would have played the 10 but sometimes people make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: now she might continue @CQ but really east can't do anything then but play a diamond, can he?|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hesse: og tilslutt endte det meget heldig for nordmennene som lå inne for slakt|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: vad kostar 5@dX 500 eller 800|pg||
nt|athene: he might be worried she has @DQx(x) in hand but if she has, there's no stopping the contract|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: sabine could have walked into it here she could be going for a number instead of -80|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no upside|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think all the same that N action very dangerous on vul|pg||
nt|friggi: strange line of play|pg||
nt|benjy: very odd, did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: ok, good play to give the defence a chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: now there is no point playing for 4-1 trumps (so you can cash the @C9) because then east would have a trump winner anyway|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hesse: det ville gitt svenskene mye imp uavhengig av motspill :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Förmodligen 800 om inte man maskar @h för ett @s sak|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Fast med @h ut, stöld, @c, och ny @h stöld = 800|pg||

nt|ahollan1: system summary forms for all participants under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=20&task=list|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|daman: 2@D would be drury with 3 card support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i don't think they distinguish 3 and 4 card support|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H shortness - that excites Meyers :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@h = splinter slam try -- not a good fit for W|pg||
nt|daman: most pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  George, a few pairs do -- I would guess between a fifth and a third unless it has changed a lot in the last five years|pg||
nt|daman: it has changes a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  some probably use 2NT for that too|pg||
mb|4D|nt|daman: most of those I play with and against play 2 way drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  as an alternate Jacoby|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb:  In my area, there is one pair out of about 30 serious players who play two-way Drury|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|Gerben42:  holding @HKQ hasn't stopped Meyers - 3@S sort of accepted the try|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: although 5@S suggests she knows they have 10 trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Levin showing @sQ because of sixth spade|pg||

nt|Walddk6: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  i.e. with ten trumps you pretend to hold @SQ even if you dont|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  with @HA and @SK missing, 5@S is the spot|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c=is an artificial raise with anywhere from mixed to a 3+ card minimum forcing raise.|pg||
nt|psyck: The match is fairly tightly poised at the midway stage|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, they have more gadgets in their arsenel than just 3@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: cant see explanations|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|hesse: godt resultat for Norge i lukket|pg||
nt|athene: if Penfold doesn't use them at all, can she save them up for next year? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the main argument against the balancing double is that Zia couldn't overcall over 1@C, so the chances of finding him with a 5-card red suit are not so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS  making their aggressive intentions clear from the very first boards  -  the opening skirmishes of the longer battle|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, she is obviously pursuing an aggressive policy (early on at least)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed I would expect blood to be spilled in this match 4 very aggressive players|pg||
nt|mamos: Now the Irish find themselves in a rather uncomfortable spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: values + supp surely|pg||

pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: indeed Ben but tommy doesnt know how to spell PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you double there as often as possible|pg||
nt|athene: because your main upside is the penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|benjy: but you know partner isn't passing with the north hand|pg||
nt|benjy: looking at the north cards|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: well, it's unlikely if east is sane, but if partner DOES have a pass, it's big money territory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 10 tricks-as long as she doesnt cover this(she wont)|pg||
nt|athene: and we saw here east doesn't really have a 2@C overcall|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: according to the textbooks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|friggi: it is agressive at least|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy: but if partner bids 2@S which they often will, won't you wish you had passed out 2@C?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is risky, i agree, because it's a misfit auction - hearts can easily be north's best suit here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hesse: Nå er gjerne spillefører glad hun ikke fikk @d ut|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not 10 tricks |pg||
nt|athene: partner will usually have five spades to bid 2@S there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 now|pg||
nt|mamos: it depends on which textbooks you have|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: yes, i agree, it can go wrong|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjy: I agree with one of the specs that if you are going to bid then at least overcall directly then you have the upside of getting to a game|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Om partnern har 2 stick som krävs så lirar nog 4@s minst lika bra|pg||
nt|athene: zia loves all his cards now - @DQJ doubleton were a bit rubbish when he picked the hand up but they improved when partner opened 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks Hearts agreed|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence from west - most Acol players would bid 2@S second time|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: maybe they play that as constructive with five spdes|pg||

nt|athene: or a relay perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jcomyn: shows what i know|pg||
nt|benjy: 4nt looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|mamos: EAst has asked for Spade lead but Diamond looks best |pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer can throw a diamond on a spade and take a ruffing diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to go down yet though|pg||

nt|athene: @S9, @D109|pg||
nt|athene: ah no, the ruffing finesse not enough|pg||
nt|benjy: you have to pitch a @D on the established @S and then take a ruffing @D finesse to make|pg||
nt|athene: since he has only one trump left|pg||
nt|athene: he has to actually drop the doubleton @DK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c6|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nubmaster: oj|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. cash the @DA and lead the @D2, not the @D10|pg||
nt|benjy: this won't make, surely he will just take a @D finesse|pg||
nt|athene: too hard (in my opinion)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well zia will give it his best shot|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate all these dull boards!! :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well this one DID look dull|pg||
nt|athene: sabine's missing fifth diamond is costly :) you are right, 4-3-5-1 would have had much more offensive potential|pg||
nt|benjy: yes but the downside of no eight card fit|pg||
nt|benjy: the specs have suggested that Sabine would bid 2nt to show 4@S over the 2@S enquiry and hence 4@C showed 4441|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there's plenty of room to show the shape exactly over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but you would need to be a more longstanding partnership than NS i think for that|pg||
nt|athene: now zia knows if he draws trumps he is short of tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine he will take straightforward finesse|pg||
nt|benjy: opposite a 4441 i think Zia had a slam try not a slam drive personally, if he had just bid 4@D that would involve partner, but perhaps he thought 4@C showed extras?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|hQ|nt|hesse: @h ess var nok ikke beste forsvar|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|nt|athene: depends if 2@S was GF, perhaps|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjy: Zia encouraged on the A@D as he wanted a ruff, /sabine thought he held the Q@D|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: i think the way people play these days, if you only raise partner to 2 and you have a singleton, you are always minimum|pg||
nt|athene: in other words 1@D - 1@H; 3@H is any non-min with a singleton|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|jcomyn: thats why he is Zia|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamonds or nt?|pg||
nt|athene: zia might bid 3@H now asking for a stop, or maybe just 2@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: yes, true, the diamond pitch was revealing|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: 2@S looks automatic to me, but he is /zia|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hesse: der tok jeg feil :)|pg||
nt|hesse: så får vi se om syd finner trumfvarianten|pg||
nt|athene: that is always something to watch out for - if a defender pitches a painless early card from a suit where dummy has four, it's almost aways from 5+|pg||
nt|athene: you just need partner to have @SA or @CK and one heart stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: og så skal @ceren løses|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Totalställningen just nu: Nor 77, Dan 75, Sve 73, Fin 55|pg||

nt|hesse: eller er kontrakten alltid beit?|pg||
nt|hesse: Kurt Ove Thommasen kommenterer at det mangler overgang til intrafinessen|pg||

nt|hesse: *Thomassen|pg||
nt|benjy: if 3nt is the right spot then 2@S will get you there, i don't understand the reasoning behind 3@C|pg||

nt|odysseus69: having decided not to bid 1NT over 1H then over 3H it looked a good idea|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: i thought at first south was bidding 3@C with the idea that if it went 3@H P P he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe even taking @c fin on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: yep A@D , @C finesse , then ruff @D and @C|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: sort of trying to coax a 3nt bid from partner|pg||

nt|benjy: 4 imps to Sinclair when 1NT was passed un the OR and made 90|pg||
nt|athene: one other point worth a mention|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's really important to get into the bidding over 1nt if you have only a 4-4 fit |pg||
nt|athene: because that 44 fit just isn't taking so many tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: after only minor fit found, 3@h should be asking for check & not a cue|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: W is definitely in the tank|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: bd 74 was fouled (I don't know more than that), so we will play another 74 but I won't have the deal.  I can put in the score, however.l|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I'm told they will play it now, so I'll not close out and will keep you all posted|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|benjy: 2@D multi, X showing 12-15 bal or a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: old dilemma - 2@d or 2@H?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: solid 3NT contracts seem the flavour of the day|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal now, the next session will start shortly after this ends. Thanks to my co-commentators Mike & Roberto.  Good job by our Operator Bob.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & ...|pg||
nt|psyck: for their inputs.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: On bpard 11, Auken went off in 3@S when Price made 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly surprisin|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: he didn't make he was allowed|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H is competitive in spades|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ppiglett: No surprise there - it needed the King and Queen come down under the Ace to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: looks like 2S was some kind of ask.|pg||
nt|psyck: Many (including me) raise with 3 cards, generally unbalanced hands or with extras.  It is normal to follow the raise with a relay to find shape & values|pg||
pc|s4|nt|benjy: 2@H and 2NT transfers?|pg||
nt|dburn: this appears to be a strong club auction with an artificial positive and perhaps some relays|pg||
nt|psyck: so 3@d may have been 3 cards, min hand, @d length|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|xenya: 1@H transfer|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: W has shown 18-19 bal, explains E|pg||
