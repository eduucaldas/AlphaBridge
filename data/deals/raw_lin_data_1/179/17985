nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||

nt|mr murray: like the word snapdragon. try to use the bid as much as I can :)|pg||
nt|pelu: S could also X here - = good hand 3 card @S (or he would bid 2@s)|pg||

nt|joest: this is the 8th and final set of this quarterfinal match|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mr murray: 2 diamonds a game force|pg||
nt|glen: good evening all (such as all is), with some high profile matches going on, we will have a close knit group here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: shows 3 spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now some discussion of the auction|pg||
nt|joest: I think West opened 1NT here and not north|pg||
mb|2N|nt|caitlin: For someone who has retired from this level of bridge, we see Larry Cohen fill in a lot:)|pg||
nt|ady: no entries to north|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: wont matter what game they get 2. easy rider this hand|pg||

nt|joest: hi shirley|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: is all this true ?|pg||
nt|stc: a very brave 4@h !!|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H seems very aggressive with 11 HCP 3-4-3-3 shape|pg||
nt|stc: I still don't trust the bidding ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: operator is this full bidding?|pg||
nt|caitlin: This will be a forcing defense with 4-1 trump break and with @S losers...can play 2@S trump down declarer.....|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h probably -2...|pg||
nt|stc: the result in OR looks OK|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|stc: we may have a major swing here|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello Jack |pg||
nt|joest: operator can we switch this over to2NT by west?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|mr murray: cant seem to find 6 tricks for def.|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s, 1@h, 4@d, 2@c will suffice here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Both play natural with a strong NT. EW in the 2/1 style. Both with some nifty stuff in the mid-auction|pg||
nt|glen: N would not pick the 5-2 fit if he knew the @D shortness was the @D ace|pg||
nt|mr murray: quite a possition taking out to 4 hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S is a phantom, in that it can be beaten by a @S lead and unlikely @D shift.  But 5@S is a normal spot and requires good defense to beat it.  6@H looks like south is simply ...|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding one more for "safety."  But he knows they have huge red fits|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should still be able to bring this home without too much problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play xfers 1@D and 1@h over their 1@c opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  Mark Epstein is our operator|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mark|pg||
nt|joest: with diamonds 33 this will roll right in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry about that... fat fingers on the pass key|pg||
nt|joest: np :)|pg||
nt|joest: theres no rush to work diamonds so I suspect we may see a spade to the ten early on in case Garner has Hx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjent: Yeah, South knew he had @d shortage as well ... and still volunteered for 3NT, rather than trying, say, 3@d|pg||
nt|glen: this has no play with the the layout of the major suits|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing wonderful but this is truly poor|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3n/t has certain chances|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing any good on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: With @dQ-5th over the J, 3NT is doomed on reasonable defence|pg||
nt|mr murray: Pass seemed logical choice over 2 hearts|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: @S in trick 2 to K and A gave W the overtrick|pg||
nt|mr murray: it is not like they are behind in match|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Perhaps west might have considered a double to try to get the @D back.  |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: clrar trumps better|pg||
nt|ady: clear|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|santyclz: Has to be very careful though.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'd be giving up a trump that way but needed to probably play the Q@c... hard for E to read the situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  now in dummy gives Steve a bunch of choices and probably headaches too|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|joest: this was reasonable, playing possibly north for Spade shortness b/c of the heart length lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: nice shift, 12 imps back to Aker|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|santyclz: E needs to get his @h trick in before he can coup n.|pg||
nt|mr murray: he could slip but not likely|pg||
nt|mr murray: long as he hooks club there can be no problem|pg||
nt|psyck: one @c entry to play @h, another to play @s for ruff & then exit to get couple of trumps more|pg||

nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|joest: kinda slow start|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: dont worry non e of us can spell|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't NS start behind by 3 imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N better than 4@H|pg||
nt|stc: better not to overbid here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
nt|glen: and that increases to 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it may have come too early in the segment|pg||
nt|pelu: tx for that :)|pg||
nt|joest: intersting problem for Garner.  Do you just transfer and be done with it or Stayman?|pg||
nt|joest: b/c if you Stayman and partner bids 2@d you risk hearing a 2@s correction to 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT tends to be 15-17 opposite a passed hand|pg||
mb|4D|an|transfer|nt|Vugraphzff: clubs|pg||
nt|mr murray: rather chase 3 imps than 11|pg||
nt|stc: slam needs @h 3-2 and @d finesse, so not good|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb sorry|pg||
nt|joest: or you could just go big and hope! :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT will be Lebenshol, forcing a 3@C bid|pg||
nt|glen: N only has 5@Cs, but wants to push EW out of 2@S|pg||
nt|mr murray: must be lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George shows John the 3C card and John nods|pg||
nt|caitlin: not yet:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: auction messed up by me|pg||
nt|ady: has 10 tricks in diamonds  assuming no peek of stiff K@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cant say I understand the bidding|pg||
nt|pef: that wasn't the auction, victor|pg||
nt|santyclz: With a 4 loser hand w makes a practical bid.  Unfortunately e has no cover cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3 loser hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 loser |pg||
nt|mr murray: they got it right|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S will promise 4 (playing support doubles), therefore E knows he has a 5-4 major fit, but 3 points keep saying pass pass pass|pg||
nt|joest: if Goren leads a club, this will work well for north south|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mr murray: cept it becomes 4 by attrition :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS i OP never found the @C-fit (3@d direct from Welland in East|pg||
nt|santyclz: E's x showing 3 card supt for w's presumed @hs?|pg||
nt|mr murray: all true|pg||
nt|glen: this should make, losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|glen: unless declarer takes a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve asks Neil something, gets an answer and puts his hand down and assumes the Thinker pose|pg||
nt|mr murray: might make a n overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  better go up with ace|pg||
nt|sybarra: makes it a bit dicier |pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Ed |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Linda Lee|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe a lot more|pg||
nt|joest: even if he takes a shake here, he has to lose a heart, two diamonds and a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this looks kind of unlucky|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: hello |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|nt|othered1: Hi, Linda!|pg||
nt|lml: Interesting that the heart void decided to penalty double|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like EW went through a Bart-type auction, where 2@D showed @H length.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: not the dummy he was hoping for, he may even have to duck @d's twice to go -1, could well go -2 |pg||
nt|lml: what do you think of Garner's double?|pg||
nt|othered1: Since 2@D normally shows 5 @H exactly, and east didn't rebid in @H, south "knows" north should have 5 of them.|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: I think the spade length in his hand helps too.  |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|lml: welcome|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Thomas!|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry for my delay|pg||
nt|tomi2: have missed one huge swing already it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: Two wild hands to start.|pg||
nt|andyv:  should lose 2@c, and 1@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Howie thinking...|pg||
nt|joest: he tends to do that..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Just to let you know we haven't crashed|pg||
pc|c8|nt|joest: unless east led a doubleton heart, weinsteinpretty sure he has a trump loser|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mr murray: declarer tryint to put e on a sti9ff club|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: maybe he can ruff out the Kx of clubs for another diamond pitch...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I did suspect as much- I only come on to BBO to study bidding on slam and near-sla hands- and this is what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: this hand show why I 100% prefer that 1@D = 4+ card|pg||
nt|ady: would havgone down on spade lead if finessing  if defence takes 2 spade ruffs and the 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  might not take @s finesse as he can afford to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mr murray: but shioukdnt have it as he would bid 3 spades with a stiff and 5 tumps|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|othered1: both pairs take a standard but with lots of specialized sequences approach|pg||
nt|lml: they didnt double at the other table so this is going to be a swing|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: in the bidding here !NT sh be alerted = @C-suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it was |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|lml: same contract no double|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|s4|nt|tomi2: the double with no trumps migh mislead the declarer, he will not expect this maybe|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Garner gets some imagination points here.  Was the auction similar or did west respond 2@H?  That might have dissuaded north from drawing them a road map with a double and would ...|pg||
nt|othered1: have kept south from drawing the same inference as Garner|pg||
nt|lml: it did pinpoint the @DA|pg||
nt|lml: so that the diamond play wasnt much of a guess|pg||
nt|othered1: might be only 5 imps|pg||
nt|ady: then would male 11|pg||
nt|ady: make|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mr murray: my spelling a bit imperfect. |pg||

mc|9|nt|joest: not sure I fully understand this.  With a diamond tap there WEinstein would need Hx onside to get out for down one which exists)|pg||

nt|othered1: system summaries for this event:  NS http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW play several gadgets when they open 1@c but 1@c is not precision style|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room Walter Johnson was undeterred from opening 2@h by either his side four card spade suit orhis void|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mr murray: big dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|glen: Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are|pg||
nt|glen: that's actually a bogus study, but fun to quote|pg||
nt|othered1: and EW: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=745&pid=100|pg||
nt|joest: oh ok|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s here  is mixed|pg||
nt|joest: of course red vs. white might give one pause|pg||
nt|sybarra: did the Jacobs match have a concession? |pg||
nt|joest: i think they picked up in the last set|pg||
nt|joest: but to answer your question: "I don't know"|pg||
mb|3S|an|mixed|nt|santyclz: This may get out of hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2c  GF  could be balanced|pg||
nt|mr murray: so true and I am glad that came out :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south is treating his hand as 17-19, balanced, I think.  thus 1@C opening.   See system summary: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop...|pg||
nt|othered1: =1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|ady: around 8 or 9 tricks in hearts for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl should be @s...if S had passed, 1@h would be xfer to @s|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure here either, but getting lots of questions |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  auction may die here|pg||
nt|ady: not much joy for e/w in spades   just make 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1n was alerted on both side, but couldn't read it|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Again:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|andyv:  although W certainly has 2@d bid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S shows a power hand in two ways: by bidding again above 2@D and by looking for a fit in a suit that W has|pg||
nt|glen: however N could care less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John just wrote a long note for George|pg||
nt|joest: this looks slated for another down one for Howie|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S by north is down on a double-dummy @D lead and continuation, but it figures just to be a push|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3h natural no extras prob no stopper|pg||
nt|glen: dear george, how are the white soxs doing this year?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, it won't take long to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: if E had bid 3NT - he would have a nice surprise ;)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT must promise heart support|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I couldn't ssee f thats what he said, but it ws in red ink|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: not sure a @D lead is easy |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: I wonder if EW are on same wavelength|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: at this vul, I would have expected S to be happy to defend|pg||
nt|ady: not clear for this to be doubled   but likely 2 down|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a beautiful contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think so, also this is Bob Lafleur operating|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: I think Aker decided the 4-3 in spades was best|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: must be about the bulls|pg||
nt|stc: just made ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2: how could they bid if not so? west had no @D stopper so he raised his partners suit with some fit|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense has to be careful  here or declarer can scoot by with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bob:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S easy down 2, so both room "unlucky"|pg||
nt|mr murray: So many hands I can think of that it makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but here -800 :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wasright it looks like|pg||
nt|mr murray: very true|pg||
nt|mr murray: 500  which is too much|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|joest: nothing seems attractive at this point besides swinging the ace of spades|pg||
nt|joest: Note that Ron Rubin at the other table opened the west hand 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: he and Walter Johnson look at weak 2@h bids differently|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: I think it would be found < 1 percent of the time|pg||
nt|joest: some play that 2@h and 2@s are constructive weak twos and play that a Multi 2@d is a weak one|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: its not obvious to me looking at the south hand what is the right play|pg||
nt|othered1: @HA and more @D should do it but the ruff sluff defense, while some specs think it's obvious (since east figures to be in a 4-3) it will be a nice effort.|pg||
nt|lml: it is true that south can deduce that north has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: I think a ruff sluff without the @HA will work quite well|pg||
nt|othered1: either, I think|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: maybe not so trivial|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: this isnt over though|pg||
nt|othered1: still room for misguessing, but it is there if east can work it out.  @C position may not be clear at all in context of the auction|pg||
nt|lml: East really feels he has to find the trump queen|pg||
nt|othered1: and t hen he still needs to find a way to run the @C, which he may believe are 3-1|pg||
nt|lml: well if he decides Garner has the @SQ a spade to the 10 seems a start|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure it is makeable if clubs are 3-1.  Can you think of a way?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|lml: he decided that too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzff: creative typing our theme today|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: possible to go down 3 if another spade finesse is taken   then defence switches to diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|pef: goren seems to be helping declarer here|pg||
nt|caitlin: a @H|pg||
nt|andyv:  if a 2nd @s hook, then @d back will produce -3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|andyv:  however on @c back by S, E should get suspicious|pg||
nt|ady: problem  though  no entry to east hand to take 2nd spade finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 3 in OR in 2@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve is a very deliberate player|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: although it looks like declarer always has 5 trumps, 3 clubs, and the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|glen: giving up beer card early |pg||
nt|glen: to be sneaky|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve steals a look at Neil|pg||
nt|mr murray: gotta ruff lolw|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|h8|nt|caitlin: website is www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|joest: once west shows with AKJ of hearts + spade Q. howie might play for the 'intrafinesse'|pg||
nt|joest: leading the 9 from dummy and passing it, playing west for Jx or 10x|pg||
nt|joest: actual lie makes everything irrelevant|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: but then he had other chances, I think, beginning with @SK, then hoping to read the position|pg||
nt|lml: this was very tough to play|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: and to defend|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||

nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|pc|d8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||

nt|andyv:  wonder what the delay is|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry folks, network issues, on 94 Steve played 4C -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Barry shaking his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He agrees with you|pg||
nt|pef: those who are good at picking off stiff kings offside should be in 6 spades on this hand :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room they played a prosaic 4@s on bd 1 to lose 4 imps.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is good decision|pg||
nt|pelu: for I dont like that X with 3-3 i major - why not 1Nt (as Welland in OR??|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he chose n/t he would not like it|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is going to work out better|pg||
nt|santyclz: A genuine "Bramley" x.  4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
nt|tomi2: je now played on clubs breaking, trump queen with south AND spades 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs makes by leaning to the East side|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 2 was the opposite of prosaic though|pg||
nt|mr murray: well played|pg||
nt|othered1: He might have been playing south for a flat 13 count, w hich still w ouldn't have given north much of a negative double.|pg||
mb|2C|an|6+ /|nt|sybarra: the precision type 2 @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: had he started with spade to the 10, then spade honor pulling trumps and then overtake clubs, he needs clubs 2-2, spade queen with south and either 3-3 OR 4-2|pg||
nt|stc: we may have some action here with games in both directions|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: what is the problem with 1NT? if N can penalty D then 2@C by EW is a nice contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 4 @H cant he?|pg||
nt|othered1: game in a rounded suit is likely here. Slam won't make on best lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, and @SK first would have made with south holding Qx or Qxx in @S, if he could read the position|pg||
nt|caitlin: good @C fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, north chose the unfortunate lead of the @da.  Still, that wasn't enough by itself.|pg||
nt|glen: by Namyats, he means 4@C=long @Hs, good hand|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H=it better be a GOOD hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Neil shows his hand to Steve who says "wow"|pg||
nt|glen: and when dummy comes down EW will give up quickly|pg||
nt|glen: or W will WoW|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table, click "Movie", then "(other) Room", |pg||
nt|mr murray: wow|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John sees the dummy and says, pretty good support|pg||
nt|glen: this will be ruffed, trump out, @D to 9, making 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|mr murray: those guys get mostly good results from their off-shape dble. Finally coming to all the bridge world . Look what the Italians did to the bridge community in the 50-60's|pg||
nt|othered1: south is laying out hands where slam will make and you can come up with quite a few.  This is a very experienced partnership, so they know each other's proclivities.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: wouldn't think you would lead C Q against 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the first lead that pops to mind just looking at W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: Yhey had everyone talking to themselves|pg||
nt|pelu: at that time they were better bidders and better card-players|pg||
nt|stc: X not best move here|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see what 2@h means.  It perhaps means four spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pef: strong club opening, 2c response showing a positive response in diamonds, and now the south hands becomes huge (on the 6d slam hand)|pg||
nt|mr murray: they made many off shape dbles|pg||
nt|mr murray: they were also great card players|pg||
nt|mr murray: so are most of the experts now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: writing notes on both sides with each bid, sorry i can't read them|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: right.  Earlier I only said neither rounded slam makes against the best lead.  Likely to be found in @C, but not @H|pg||
nt|othered1: and the slam killing @D lead was found against 5@C in OR.|pg||
nt|tomi2: in the OR everybody hat spade he had to mention|pg||
nt|joest: i'm told it means four cards in 'a major'|pg||
mb|4H|nt|othered1: the modern double likely  just shows extras|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h was four spades and a max and 4@h is a Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Was 4@S kickback (RKC-like with @H as key)?|pg||
nt|othered1: If it were a cue-bid, north could be thinking laying out possible hands for a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I only saw hand signals, not sure what it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I wonder if 5NT would have been choice of slams?|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing it or thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: high-level partnerships need to discuss all sorts of subtletries applicable at the slam level.  And most do, but it seems that there are always situations that haven't been ...|pg||
nt|othered1: explicitly discussed and maybe are subject to general, meta-agreements.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Eventually, I'll bet north does not punt the grand and is really just considering which slam is likely better.|pg||
nt|othered1: FWIW, in my preferred style, n orth tends to deny 3-card @H support when he bids 3@C.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: a fast claim|pg||
nt|sybarra: something seeems  a miss here or are we gong to 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: time for someone to quote the rabbi's law but not me- I dont know it|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my |pg||
nt|sybarra: this might draw the X |pg||
nt|othered1: Now he'll get the @C lead, as east will double|pg||
nt|sybarra: guess not |pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmm|pg||
nt|joest: well if this is really how it went something went wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Barry shakes his head and is telling howie something|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone forgot something |pg||
nt|joest: this is a really terrible way to lose a game swing in a tight match|pg||
nt|joest: i guess the issue: is this makeable?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: their slam-bidding was spec were excelent - they were the first to cue bid 2. round controls - at that time US could only cue bid Aces |pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: Cue-bidding was my early speculation.  Just shows how tough these auctions actually are to pull off consistently.  But even small slam in @C was going to cost a bunch of imps ...|pg||
nt|othered1: against the normal @D lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew pulls out the redouble card and shows it to Neil|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 7 actually is going to cost only two more imps than stopping in 6 with @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question was what would lead be agst 6 @H |pg||
nt|othered1: west, having heard the auction is thinking, "can he really be asking for a @C lead?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt E can X 6 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John and Neil talking, Drew said he is thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think he could have doubled 6 and I don't think west would have found the lead unassisted|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@H, that is.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John asked to see Jims hand and Jim showed him the C A|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: played one trick with director here, now Howie has gone off with director|pg||
nt|sybarra: what can he be worried about?  or is it gaming them to shake them up further?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what it's all about Shirley|pg||
nt|joest: i guess the key is whether garner knows the actual partnership agreement so that he defends correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Don't think so, obviously somebody had a misunderstanding of what their agreements were so there was mis-information|pg||
nt|joest: if he defends like he's defending a 4-4 heart game and that permits this to make... big problem|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|ady: now no hope    but a reasonable short   hoping defence has slipped and then bring in the diamond suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|glen: W sets up @Ds even though @C jack is not much on an entry|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 111  6@H  so just 1 imp at stake|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 rounds of @cs may be the best defense|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  S should have no problems from here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  E|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H making 7 was a push|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asks about @CT, yes preference for @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 115   Bathurst over Nickell by 55|pg||
nt|andyv:  4 rounds of @hs and either AK of @s and ruff or take finesse works|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 111  Diamond leads Deutsch by 44|pg||
nt|andyv:  right now this is the only close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad leans over the table, then sits back and sips his coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin examining the chandeliers|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Welland Jacobs did continue their match -- just not enough vugraph operators for the extra 2 tables|pg||
nt|andyv:  and this looks like it's going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson with his legs crossed, hands folded together holding his cards - typical posture when studying them - then folds his card and takes the thinker pose - typical when studying ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't get any read whether simson is confident or doubtful in his defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has to duck this |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: covers his face with his hand.  first time I've noticed that|pg||
nt|andyv:  so not sure why he's thinking so long about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thinks long about everything, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: in defense and in the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren in weird position,  but looks like he's going to make 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: especially in defense.  he has not gotten his share of hands as declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK still in dummy, trump pulled  to both ways to play @S work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs again.  rubin takes a swig of water|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson leaning back with his eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin stifles a yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Goren will play @D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson rubs his eyes.  ekeblad grabs his hair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  this hand is much tougher single dummy    whodda thunk|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is why they introduced chess clocks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson shakes his head and finally picks up his cards again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last round Wildavsky took a long time until Doub finally told him to do something.  But that contract was never beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally players just sit and stew until the meditator breaks his trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: earlier, rubin wrote a note|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "if opponents stew on a hand, remind me to wake up. this does not apply if I'm dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops      Hideous Hog:  if you're going to do the wrong thing -- do it quickly|pg||

mc|10|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: draw trump, 4.  I'll be right back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren got it wrong    go figure|pg||
nt|andyv:  much tougher for Doug that it was for us seeing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson shakes his head.  simson: no he couldn't do it! I'm so sorry.  kept trying to figure out a trump coup|pg||
nt|andyv:  than|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and for Russ & Barry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: is there anything I could have done to help you?|pg||
nt|andyv:  great partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  yell  DON'T RUFF|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you lead the deuce [4]. I should have trusted you had the J.  you did the best you could. I tried my best|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: if he had @SA, why didn't he just play @SA @SK ruff a spade?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play   Bathurst over Nickell by 46|pg||

nt|glen: no sure what happened there, EW had 6 tricks for down 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Michael,  we know you know these players well |pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Hi, Michael!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pef: this seems like a  pretty dull 4h game|pg||
nt|andyv:  on lead, he did have hope if he guessed @cs (and @cs were 2-2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: taking 2@Hs, 2@Ds, 1@C, 1@S|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h looks like a make here|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s by W is any GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  and starts a relay|pg||
nt|ady: North opened 2@S in OR  and south raised to 3   they got away with iy|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pef: ah, I was about to say I was surprised chris didn't bid over the strong club|pg||
nt|pef: chris is thinking if michael can bid 2c on kqjx, I can certain bid 2d on kqjx|pg||
nt|pef: not michael trying to decide how many diamonds (or something even more creative) to bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there is a N/S sacrifiice here and it looks likely here.-both playing lead directing overcalls- partnership harmony|pg||
nt|pef: if he bids 5d, east might easily bid 5h which is too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D would be great bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry everyone, lost connection|pg||
nt|pef: hello again, one and all|pg||
nt|mr murray: cant be right to pass . Irf partner shows 4 hearts u almost have a game bid. In fact vul u probably should.|pg||
nt|mpny:  yes, most have been teammates, not happily for them free of me   :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Aggressive, but sane, opening and a normalish overcall despite xxx in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  advantage of preempts...they sometimes work|pg||
nt|joest: there must be something about the east-west system I don't know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Barry alerted 2N|pg||
nt|joest: I mean I know there is, it's just that this may be one of them! :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like south has turned it into a game force.|pg||
nt|othered1: and they can make 4@H or 5, double-dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: As cards lie, even @S lead would not beat this, assuming declarer reads the hand correctly|pg||
nt|lml: seems like a push now after the club lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|pef: michael was thinking so hard he blew out the connection|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: both E & W writing notes for screen mates|pg||
nt|kit: good idea to find heart fit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: It was never going to be easy but must move and try for game|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: looks safe to play @h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mr murray: bet he wished he passed now :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mr murray: nice start for def.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: no evil shortness by the opponents here, thus will lose one of each suit except for trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S may be trickier|pg||
nt|mpny:  4H and 5C can both make, but now likely a push|pg||
nt|ady: at love all the 3@S in OR will gain 6 imps|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have around 430|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: take the @D off dummy and its tough to make 4 @S |pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north thought the cue-bid was strongly suggestive of @S and what else could he have bid.  But I hope my students don't see an expert rebidding a 5-card suit twice . . . |pg||
nt|othered1: (I only have intermediate students, they wouldn't notice the context)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew closed the screen to ask Neil a question|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|mr murray: club and spade ace seems clear|pg||
nt|mpny:  I prefer the 4C that wold tried in the other room over 3D|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pef: 4d made it easy for goren.  I wonder what he would have done over 5d|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|pelu: no I am wrong - Give West H9x in D + @SK then a wey to go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now Jim is thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: I would also,  unless the cue-bid strongly implied real @S support.  A methods thing when 2@H isn't a game force.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry folks, could not catch up|pg||
nt|andyv:  in auction here, W showed a GF hand with @ds and said nothing about @ss.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|lml: in some games you would now know where the @HA is but not in this one|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: he needed to play low smoothly|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|ady: we stuck again?|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe this is the curse room:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: bed time - after @H to Q there are 9 toptricks - sorry :(:(|pg||
nt|mr murray: lol|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: really he should have decided while he was thinking about what to throw on the diamond what card to play on  the heart|pg||
nt|joest: that will slow play down considerably|pg||
nt|joest: he can't really ruff out the spades convienently any more b/c trumps are blocked|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|othered1: Now he still needs a black-suit miracle and won't get it.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|c7|pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzff: drew says i did not have to bid|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|kit: now he may get this wrong|pg||
nt|kit: and go after diamonds instead of spades|pg||
nt|joest: by playing diamonds?|pg||
nt|sybarra: it was so easy from this vantage point |pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing he will hook the spade|pg||
nt|kit: I'm guessing he won't from his spade discard|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough :)|pg||
nt|joest: i am getting a fair   of suggestions from kibitzers but no one is convinced s/he knows theright play :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: 8 to go here, not over yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thru 112  Diamond leads Deutsch by 45|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks simson his shape, "so I could have drawn trumps!".  johnson: "there were easier ways to play that"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no updates about Welland-Jacobs :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad shakes his head, "coulda made 5"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  too many possible shapes to list|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no no no no|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfd: believe it or not, this is the real auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh    should have looked at hands  not just the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: when I enter multiple passes sometimes they don't all go through|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D from Johnson in 3rd seat is standard operating procedure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I need to be more careful to doublecheck|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=@C & @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: less than invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D was 2+|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  3@d now|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: had you covered, put it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "probably should be responsive"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: I have another partner in mind, once I get rid of him... [rubin and johnson break up laughing]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson sighs.  less inclined to banter than the other three at this table|pg||
nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin rocks side to side. turns his head suddenly toward the bidbox|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: did not see which picture card he played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very good chance he'll score both either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: "well... let's start with the ... " [reaches for @HJ]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson counts something out with his fingers, talking to himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: problem will be if Simson shows @CA   |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns and peeks at the card|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so now I have it right|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: actually I think @HQ is better if he can pick that johnson has psyched|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: might be able to "mark" @HK in S hand|pg||

nt|pef: on slightly different auctions (but both started with a strong 1c) both norths preempted only to 4d leading to the push|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 more bds, Peter, hang in there.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry, should have told everyone Steve was thinking about overtaking|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: nice grand lets see if they can bid it|pg||
nt|glen: a tricky D would be to force declarer to win @D in dummy at trick 2, threaten ruffs but deny quick communications to draw trumps and ruff @H|pg||
nt|lml: you make a lot of clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pef: yes, I agree with you Victor.  I know Kit Woolsey would have bid 5d|pg||
nt|pelu: ok tx :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: nice bid by jabobs. his partner will know they have at least a small slam and keep quiet|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: on the last board, the other NS were not on the same page, and retreated out of a @S contract|pg||
nt|glen: costing 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|mr murray: 4 di is good bid. takes away the cue|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John takes off his glasses and rubs his face, George gets up and stretches, John's glasses back on|pg||
nt|glen: does he really want to see George stretch?|pg||
nt|glen: or did the glasses go back on afterwards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: afterwards|pg||
nt|mr murray: they got all the way to 4 in the open room|pg||
nt|mr murray: he bids at least 6|pg||
nt|glen: absolutely, is now dreaming on auctions for a grand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John takes out 6H, but just holds it, |pg||
nt|sybarra: hope that doesnt sound like resulting the hand|pg||
mb|2N|an|GF 4 hearts|nt|caitlin: wow Nickell catching up..on a roll.....didn't look like they had a chance|pg||

nt|andyv:  wow... was waiting to see a 1@s 3@c auction but not this time|pg||
nt|joest: play for @ds 33 or @s 33|pg||
nt|joest: added vig of Qx of spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|odysseus69: If not bidding 5D immediately I prefer to crawl and listen.|pg||
nt|santyclz: S's hand just took a nosedive.|pg||
nt|mr murray: we need some excitement|pg||
nt|othered1: NS's jump overcalls are intermediate when vul, so south wouldn't have considered 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  what does everyone thing, 2N vs 3D? I'd have thought 3D normal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: speaking of kit woolsey, double by donn was "woolsey" showing a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|glen: he figures the bidding room is gone to know for sure that S has @D first round control and the black aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John says too much and claims|pg||
nt|sybarra: I will get the nt in first|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: now, after seeing dummy, he is re-planning the auction|pg||
nt|glen: and sending it to the Master Solvers Club (the bridge world)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: noone stepping out of line or difficult contrascts|pg||
nt|lml: anyone know what 2@D is?|pg||
nt|stc: probably making|pg||
nt|caitlin: Larry's|pg||
nt|stc: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I have been commentating 4 hours now, so the old man need ½hours sleep :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Another slam misadventure in the OR, and one I don't understand.|pg||
nt|stc: not enough time for a @s trick, -1|pg||
nt|caitlin: option was 1NT but I much prefer 1@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pef: this is going to make 3 or 4 depending on a guess (likely to be gotten correct) in diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Bob, pls tell the players we need a slam, xx'd contract or both.|pg||
nt|mpny:  in the other room west just bid way too much|pg||
nt|stc: -1 on good defense|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting card combination here.  If South plays 9 of hearts on first round of hearts, gives declarer a chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mr murray: That is a long time. |pg||
nt|caitlin: closed room very slow|pg||

pc|hT|nt|pelu: we started this "morning" with 2@d RD +1|pg||
nt|lml: I have been told that 1@S was a transfer to 2@D|pg||
nt|lml: then 2@S was presumably natural|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mr murray: nice spade distro|pg||
nt|mr murray: th9 off the top|pg||
nt|mr murray: no time for spades|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 9 toptricks with @Cs 3-3, but look at the nice @S-position - nice for decl - only 2 @S-tricks for EW|pg||
nt|othered1: a tad matchpointy.  but 3@D with a flat hand and @SKJx coming down in dummy isn't very tasty either|pg||
nt|lml: so the 10 top tricks are all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: as long as the defence continues majors|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest: this hand now all comes down to the @S k  +420|pg||

nt|mr murray: anything past 1 level is probably minus|pg||
nt|sybarra: tightened this match up |pg||
nt|lml: another overtrick worth an imp :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: A nice grand in OR, and 7@H, the matchpoints spot perhaps, won't make.|pg||
nt|stc: upgrade ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  this grand looks flat, but grands are never fully routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, W opened 1@c and then the auction took off|pg||
mb|1C|an|Stong|nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, last hand was +3 for 150|pg||
nt|joest: so how much does Howie want to bid at these colors?|pg||
nt|joest: My guess = 2@d (Multi)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Not quite a "Bramley" x.  For that the 4 card suit must be the one x'd.|pg||
nt|mr murray: must be a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: Not the shape he would like to have to double, but he has the values & @s's are well placed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes was alerted |pg||
nt|glen: 4@S in the open room doomed by the losing @C finesse|pg||
nt|glen: now do NS have two suit runouts, or will S just transfer to (or bid) @Hs?|pg||
nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|kit: 6NT is easy here. 6@H might not be.|pg||
mb|1H|an|8-11 ...|nt|pef: donn, choosing to play in either a 4-3 major fit or 2d|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfettered, this may maybe not be as easy to bid |pg||
nt|stc: W in trouble :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: e-w can make 90 in diamonds|pg||
nt|mpny:  i guess 2S|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting, Blackwoodless auction to 7 in OR, helped I think by EW getting their @D into the auction|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: quite common nowadays to play xfrs on 1M-(x)|pg||
nt|psyck: allows you to show more hand types including good & bad raises|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @cT lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: An interesting lead problem.  The @h seems obvious, but s "bid" @cs and is most likely short in @ss.  So...|pg||
nt|glen: E was planning on bidding @S next, but could sit for this X with Axx|pg||
nt|othered1: would be anice hand to be playing 3@C rebid by south as forcing (as in Kaplan-Sheinwold)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for the S hand with a void to blackwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, trying for @s ruff could be considered|pg||
nt|kit: they did well getting hearts played from East side if they land there, so no opening lead ruff.|pg||
mb|2C|an|tran to d|nt|pef: hmm, maybe the play puppet stayman|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 2C may be 5cd stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: Now 4@D if not some specialized bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggests exclusion blwd|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play it, nor usually kickback, so my 4@D bid would be a simple splinter, slam try in @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry, don't know|pg||
nt|pef: I have a feeling it went pass 3d, here, but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table Wold opened the n hand 1@h and was briefly in 2@hxx'd.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed, |pg||
mb|2D|nt|glen: if declarer could quickly draw trumps, there would be 2@Hs, 1@S, 5@Ds, and perhaps a @C|pg||
nt|stc: very pushy, bad, but making !!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did we miss a step or is 3N a max. with 3 @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: OK, exclusion blackwood it is and south will find the ace.  Will he now be able to let north count tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1430 over excl. |pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, ty:)|pg||
mb|2H|an|spades|nt|glen: thus this opening lead is working for declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: my bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Count tricks by assuring north that all keys are held.  If that's what 4N does, I think north can bid the grand right here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  always willing to learn new systems:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: this seems very polite now,your suit no partner your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I guess chris really did make a game try on his hand.  well, I suppose it's a good save over 3d by e/w|pg||
nt|pef: We are no longer getting scoring comparisons after that breakdown.  Board 112 was a push.  I'll try to keep you updated on the actual scores|pg||
nt|pef: On board 113, e/w played 3d making 4, so 1 imp to aker.  the actual score is now 239 to 201|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for a hand that couhldnt muster a bid over 2C the North hand is about maximum although I tend to dislike 6-3-2-2. The South hand by contast does not have ennogh to suggest that ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: game is on - however the state of the match may be affecting players' judgement|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N (isn't 3@S a violation of Hamman's Law?) would depend on having the @DK on lead, absent a miracle @H lead to get the shift|pg||
mb|3S|an|4 spades|nt|odysseus69: still frozen board|pg||
nt|othered1: Actually with the lucky @C holding, you don't even need that|pg||
nt|ady: looks like an easy 11 tricks |pg||
nt|joest: i wonder how many spades this sequence shows|pg||
nt|joest: thanks :)|pg||
nt|joest: so now what?  Donn with tons of values and they have not (perhaps fortunately) investigated @hs yet|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- this looks like one of those we have no idea what to do slam auctions which end in 6NT|pg||
nt|joest: you might think that with a hand this strong Donn could break the trasnfer (or something) and take over.  I'm sure he could have.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes I probably would bid 3NT with the east hand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|othered1: and he does.|pg||
nt|mpny:  well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nice auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, very well reasoned auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4 baby @D's got tucked in pocket |pg||
nt|sybarra: (in N)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Hard to find a grand slam try in south 's hand that would have @HA alone and not @SAK|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H will play OK, as cards lie|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is they get a diamond lead from the king because they both suggested weakness in that suit|pg||
nt|othered1: and may provide 2 more overtrick imps|pg||
nt|joest: "pick a slam".   Well I doubt he picks hearts Kit|pg||
nt|kit: spades won't be so hot|pg||
nt|joest: he will offer up 6@c probably?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Barry starts to bid, stops to reconsider|pg||
nt|kit: 6@C no bargain, but it will make|pg||
nt|kit: or go down about 4, depending on lead|pg||
mb|6S|nt|andyv:  this should be flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I think you had it right a second ago.   WE just blast into 6NT|pg||
nt|kit: Donn won't sit for a 4-2 fit|pg||
mb|6N|nt|joest: now if Donn knows Barry only has four spades, leaving him there can't be right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: okay okay ... I will now try harder to play for overs at imps... you have convinced me|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: and here we are -- will probably take all the tricks on a squeeze, and will probably take 15 minutes to play the hand.|pg||
nt|joest: time to visit the refrigerator!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzff: Josh sees the dummy and smiles|pg||
nt|joest: north-south lead rusinow although against slams who knows?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sheepishly|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: They're just there|pg||
nt|kit: first 2 tricks will go quickly -- 2 red aces|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|kit: then there will be a big huddle|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|stc: this board could be a swing in this very low scoring segment|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: unexpected pickup for Aker on  113, keeping them in the game|pg||
nt|joest: three times 4@h has been played: each one a swing|pg||
nt|joest: of course one might expect that when it's a 4-2 fit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kit: looks like he will unblock the spades and play a club to jack.  When that holds, things will speed up.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: everybody laughing about 6 spades now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Howie and Barry just go off for a break while Josh thinks|pg||
nt|kit: he may be thinking of a squeeze-endplay on South|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve and Josh talking, now Josh thinking again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: they are  back, but Josh still thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Steve nodding his head, this may take a while|pg||
nt|andyv:  they open 1@d with semi balanced or unbalanced hands w @ds or 4-5 in minors|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Thank you,|pg||
nt|andyv:  wlc:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Steve closes his hand, thinks opens his hand thinks some more|pg||
mb|2H|nt|santyclz: Not everybody sells.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H doesnt look that bad|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: this is only about overtricks|pg||
nt|othered1: Steve insists on opening any hand worth an opening bid with a 5-card major, even if (much) longer minor is held|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing's changed over the years|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: this reminds me of the swiss I played once where it ended 0-0. 7 pianola boards|pg||
nt|joest: would you reopen here Kit?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: You have a bunch of stuff to handle, but on EW cards alone it doesn't look horrible.  5@D also has risks|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D non ace of hts and a ht |pg||
nt|sybarra: is -1|pg||
nt|lml: whenever I get a hand like that I think more of Bergen and people like that ... 6-5 come alive|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: they didn't have much option here anyway, esp vul...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some pairs seldom let a freely bid 2M stand unless they know it's breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mpny:  5D can be beaten several ways|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may take one more stab|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  4H is better, but has problems due to 52 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: Drew can XX this |pg||
nt|sybarra: for first round control |pg||
nt|othered1: and 4-1 @H also may present a problem on @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume east is still unlimited at this point.  But ugly trumps may make west want to back off a bit.|pg||
nt|mpny:  west does not really even have an opening bid, he will cooperate in no slam tries|pg||
nt|andyv:  he does have 1st round control in @s and 2nd in @cs and K@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: if I was planning on doing so, I would have bid 2@D (if you are talking bout North hand)|pg||
nt|joest: with a suit that good you don't need to worry about reopening with double I guess|pg||
nt|joest: yeah I am|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: when both sides try for the same contract normal at least one side are wrong :)|pg||
nt|lml: I bid clubs then spades... I think of it as a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: This will take some careful play.|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with this vulnerability.  If it were safer to pass then come in, I'd consider it.|pg||
nt|lml: you know that is exactly the mistake I made a couple of days ago.  I had a 6-5 but definitely much worse than this one and I passed|pg||
nt|lml: and when the auction was back to me it was at 4@S and I was vul|pg||
nt|lml: bidding was right ... sigh|pg||
nt|othered1: I do have @S here.  May be different without boss suit|pg||
nt|joest: I thought Howie would bid 2@d while the getting was good to be honest|pg||
nt|kit: he could be in 5-1 spade fit with 5-4 diamond fit for all he knows|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|pef: so aker up by 40 imps with 6 boards, including this one, to go|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pef: comparisons are now active, but we are missing two boards, one was a push, the other was an imp to aker|pg||
nt|joest: good point|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and here comes the club lead |pg||
nt|lml: I liked your point about the vul too|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve heard enough|pg||
nt|ady: a decent effort|pg||
nt|ady: now have to hope no bad splits which there is not|pg||
nt|ady: J@D  lead does not give anything away|pg||
nt|andyv:  + side for declarer...not too many ways to play the @h suit wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now Aker is thinking, he wrote a question for Steve in the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mpny:  i think 4-1 trump + 5-2 spades is too much|pg||
pc|c6|nt|santyclz: I sent a suggestion to the ACBL that all 1nt contracts be scored as 1nt x'd to add interest.  They didn't respond.|pg||
nt|glen: now the @H Q|pg||
nt|glen: or jack depending on style|pg||
nt|glen: some play second highest thru declarer|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|joest: intuitively it doesn't seem right to defend 2@h but there are other ways to get yourself back in|pg||
nt|kit: So I assumed he was planning on selling out.  The 2@S call surprised me.|pg||
nt|joest: it is sort of unilateral i agree|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: lots of ways to approach this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and would be fairly easy if suits broke|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure he's down all the time,  South's having tha 3rd @D may be a key.  But he's gonna have to take a right view or two at least.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may take a moments (as it should)|pg||
nt|othered1: the only real hint from the auction, the double of 4@C, doesn't tell  him all that much.  Can he infer that south wanted to get a tap started with that lead (likely normal anyway)?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now doesn't matter how @hs split and Steve can claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  might play @h to 10|pg||
nt|ady: as long as not 4-0|pg||
nt|ady: not sure can afford a safety play|pg||
nt|andyv:  still several twists to this hand...Steve can't see what we can|pg||
nt|ady: from here needs 3 rufffs in north hand  to be sure of 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay 13 tricks are available|pg||
pc|h8|nt|glen: no, back to @S ville|pg||
nt|kit: And yes, I think he should have bid 2@D over the double.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mr murray: cant imagine y|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: Garner knows clubs are breaking and he expects the 6-5.  Can work out a heart is cashing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|othered1: I think that's a winning line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: this will make 4, 4 hearts, 2 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamonds|pg||
nt|mr murray: then chambers pass of 1n/t when they had game would have worked out well. 1n/t dbled with 2 overtricks would be good :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mr murray: ACBL silly not to respond to u :)|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room 2@h was the final contract so at least Howie acted|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mpny:  a good play, north likely did not know declarer's minor shape|pg||
nt|mpny:  D entry and SA still intact|pg||
nt|othered1: GIB will make an overtrick from here, I assume (GIB peeks).  Don't think a human will, however|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Sorry, I misdescribed.  A 2M where the bidding implies an 8+ card fit.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: At th is point, @H 4-1 are the major concern|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|pelu: dont work in pairs 380/580 a cold zero against 400/600|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: now on @C return I think he has to pitch then play @D|pg||
nt|mpny:  see how different it would be if west no longer had a D|pg||
nt|othered1: right. I'llhave to go back to see if @D duck by north would have beaten this.  Still not sure it would have, if west takes a winning line.|pg||
nt|mpny:  i think it can still be made, but harder|pg||
nt|mpny:  very hard for north, west could be 5512|pg||
nt|othered1: woudn't we be in the same position essentially again with west pitch ing on @C return?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|othered1: Where's the handy-dandy double-dummy analyzer when we need it.  I know there's one marked GIB at the bottom of my screen, but that's tantamount to cheating. for commentators and I ...|pg||

nt|pef: imp|pg||
nt|mr murray: these partscores are certainly not raising my blood pressure|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go - fight on 5-level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Another IMP to Jacobs, they are (very) slowly tightening this up.|pg||
nt|lml: well if I were peeking I would have taken the diamond finesse at trick one|pg||
nt|stc: Do not agree with the @h play, why not start with small to the K and try small to the J later ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Not testing diamonds meant Wolfson didn't get count on @Hs ty bjde:)|pg||
nt|stc: Boards 84,85 may bring some IMP to Aker|pg||
nt|joest: so perhaps a tiny pickup for Wolfson|pg||
nt|kit: which doesn't figure to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: NS has 26 HCP - but EW can make 4@S :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: my problem is I am much too short to peak|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|forcing|nt|pelu: this time - with 19 HCP I would X also with 3 card @h|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = semi-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: i like the 2@S bid in the open room, at vul vs. not its good to show about that playing strength|pg||
nt|glen: i don't know if I would call AKQ5 pieces|pg||
nt|othered1: After a very exciting start, with a bunch of imps up in the air, this match (and the hands) have settled down.|pg||
nt|othered1: west  has an awkward hand to bid.  Maximumish, if queeny pass, but nothing exactly descriptive over the @S bid.|pg||
nt|lml: West has a bidding challenge here.  I dont like negative double but may be the best choice|pg||
nt|stc: NS will play in @s with not much success|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: I could try 2@C, but they open short @C, so that may not be attractive|pg||
nt|lml: well it is a good 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on this hand leading from the three card suit won't work very well|pg||
nt|pef: chris has a horrible hand to lead from.  you really hate to lead from axxx against 1nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong kind of boards for trailing side- great boards if leading|pg||
nt|pef: yes, this set started with several potential swing boards, but the last five or six have been very dull|pg||
nt|mr murray: bidding looks strange|pg||
nt|othered1: There is a price to pay for opening 1@D only on unbalanced hands.|pg||
nt|lml: 2@C could even be 2 I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mr murray: what was 3 clubs?|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are those 4 small diamonds again |pg||
nt|andyv:  re re|pg||
nt|ady: re   re|pg||
nt|andyv:  did 6@h make?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: on bd 100 Steve played 2 rounds of hearts end iin dummy, roughed a diamond and claimed 7|pg||
nt|ady: does not show up in movie as yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  this is not a good slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: no |pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl ny W shows @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  by|pg||
nt|andyv:  cross roads for E|pg||
nt|andyv:  should bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Too good to open 3@s non-vul?|pg||
nt|psyck: or too bad|pg||
nt|psyck: many do not like to distort the major suit lengths...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here N could also X (= @h-suit) - but too weak|pg||
nt|mr murray: nice pass|pg||
nt|pelu: in my normal system I can bid 3@S in West (weak support)|pg||
nt|pelu: @h-lead can defeat 4@c|pg||
nt|stc: too high, could even go -2|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he has his bid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pef: if the play in the closed room is correct, it looks like 3nt is going to go down on board 115 which should take the majrgin to about 30 imps with 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, network problems, Barry is making this but i cant tell how many up tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the hands are so dull that my lights keep going out|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@H in OR only down 1 after 2x@s and then @DA and @D - better a @s |pg||
nt|sybarra: excep "good"  defined as it makes |pg||
nt|sybarra: just needs good guessing|pg||
nt|stc: sure he has, both K's off side|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT might be better or worse, not clear|pg||
nt|kit: This will depend on not losing 2 diamond tricks.  Declarer could get it wrong, leading a low diamond to the 10.|pg||
nt|joest: when you're down in a match, people just raise to 3NT with the north hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|glen: this will be painless|pg||
nt|ady: not sure how could claim 13 tricks at that point ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it's not clear|pg||
nt|kit: That is, if West is up to ducking.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|stc: OK, one trick coming|pg||
nt|joest: he will need to be|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|othered1: As with most ambiguous openings that don't show extra strength, it's usually right to compete aggressively.|pg||
nt|lml: one way from here is for declarer to draw two trumps and then play diamonds ... that exquals 1 down  5S a trump, a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be down 1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|pelu: wd Jacobs|pg||
nt|mr murray: jacobs might go if he know partner has 4+ trumps. especially with both bidding clubs|pg||
nt|lml: for the defense|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mr murray: they lost their heart trick|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mr murray: partner cued to show a hand worthy of some 4 level contract. normal lead seems a heart. should be no panic to cash|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i think he clamed a line and when CQ came down...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: ah but that helped|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: howie might just double hook of course|pg||

nt|mpny:  he forgot that his trumps are all high|pg||

mb|2D|an|natural forcing|nt|andyv:  Welland, with no vugraph operators to slow them down, finished ahead of everyone...well done.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gosia: 2 @d ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: will see if he needs them again as the auction progresses|pg||
mb|3S|an|could be natural or values for 3NT|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: very similar start in other room  except Garner in South bid 2@C |pg||
nt|gosia: this is the time to bid 7 on a finesse for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: indeed, johnson again fans his hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Garner 2@C was @D LR+   so same as Johnson's 2@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder if 4@c is keycard now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H [by either] would be RKC|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so 4@C just a cue|pg||
nt|andyv:  then 4@c just cue|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ahollan1: NOW  RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...now 4@h is rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson points at cards in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: see if he shows the Q/extra length|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course he will|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  i think so but I thought 5N would ask for specific kings but I don't have any notes to support that|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  i think Simson should have shown the Q    extra length could have been important to Johnson|pg||
nt|gosia: still 13 to Aker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson agrees that he asked for keycards, simson showed 2 without the Q, johnson asked for kings, and simson showed 0|pg||

nt|othered1: nice salvage job by EW|pg||
nt|stc: On 84 EW in 2NT in OR,will give 11 to Aker|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s back by N may either have been:  don't want @c back (denying a void) or upside down suit preference|pg||
nt|kit: So against me I would have gone down -- if (and big if) West is up to ducking.  But next time I'll have queen doubleton, and ducking will cost.|pg||
nt|joest: game theory|pg||
mb|1D|an|may be short|nt|pef: so what do you bid at favorable on the east hand now, victor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, he was down 1|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks in @h|pg||
nt|glen: EW will find 4-4 @S fit and reach 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seemed a tired play |pg||
nt|lml: so now they thing that opening 1C without clubs is peachy|pg||
nt|joest: !1@d = 4+|pg||
nt|kit: so I think immediate low diamond to 10 is better than 75%|pg||
nt|joest: typically unbalanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry couldn't read notes|pg||
nt|kit: slam hand -- and N-S certain to get there after 1@D opening I think.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: chris probably meant 4n as natural there.  great call.|pg||
nt|glen: will trumps 3-2, its just 3 losers and a push|pg||
nt|glen: this form of double, made popular by the italians, acts as a @S transfer|pg||
nt|glen: it designed to increase the chances of overcaller being on lead into the opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: and raising with 3|pg||
nt|joest: 2@C = LR+ in diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: weinstein writing expalanation for Barry|pg||
mb|3H|an|weaak|mb|3S|nt|glen: here 2@S promises 4, while a double would be support with 3|pg||
nt|mpny:  both tables opened 4S, i'd have opened 1|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S on board 70 was a full game swing to Aker, when east in the OR didn't find a winning play against the @H lead.|pg||
nt|joest: if west bids 4@h it will make it easy for Garner to picture shortness in the north hand|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d usually has shortness in it anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@S inOR was a phantom by a couple of tricks. See if it's duplicated here.|pg||
nt|ady: can only see 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: unless club trick |pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't open 1@d, thus the opener of 1@c with only 2|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein may have 'only nine points' but he has lots of playing tricks|pg||
nt|kit: enemy heart bidding tells Garner that partner is short in hearts, so he knows small slam is certain.  He is thinkin grand.|pg||
nt|joest: if he locates all the aces I think he will bid it.    If he can't scientifically locate the spade king he will shoot it in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: director just checking, we are supposed to finish in less than 10 minutes, not happening I don't think|pg||
nt|joest: either Howie has it for all this bidding|pg||
nt|joest: or Barry has it for his overcall|pg||
nt|joest: [or we go down 1] :)|pg||
nt|kit: how can he bid RKC -- they don't have a suit yet|pg||
nt|joest: they have agreed diamodns|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c was LR+ in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: oh, okay|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: North needs to av oid touch clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  4th best leads|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: I know 6-5 hands can be treated as having a 7-card suit, but it plays havoc with Lawful follow-ups|pg||
nt|mpny:  it will be hard for schermer not to bid 5,|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, especially since he thinks east's twosuits are minors|pg||
nt|othered1: If he knew one was @H,  he'd stay out|pg||
nt|stc: wow, 6@s but not 6@h !!|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure yet!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 9 would have promised 0 or 2|pg||
nt|joest: he may be mulling over whether 4@h = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: then he will surely bid RKC now, king ask, and stop in 6@D|pg||
nt|joest: now I definitely don't think so|pg||
nt|joest: lHO is weak and has flashed the king of clubs|pg||
nt|joest: Garner will kick this in|pg||
nt|kit: What is purpose of 4@C other than to torture partner?  South should be taking control.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pelu: in OR EW could not stop after Welland oen 1@H in W - they are in 3NT|pg||
nt|mr murray: that is super light|pg||
nt|mr murray: only 5332|pg||
nt|mr murray: not choice of most|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass over the double denied 3@H|pg||
nt|joest: he wants to torture partner first Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4 10s!|pg||
nt|glen: W tries for slam, George is not driving anywhere|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing he will bid 5S, duplicating the other room result|pg||
nt|stc: excl BW|pg||
nt|caitlin: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|caitlin: tell me key cards but NOT in clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Does 4@D show club control?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve and Howie both writing|pg||
nt|joest: problem is Garner doesn't know partner has a club stiff|pg||
nt|joest: even if he has the spade king. if he only has four spades he can't shell enough clubs out of the dummy|pg||
nt|kit: that's why I asked about immediate 4@D bid over double, as opposed to pass|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d shows a control, sorry|pg||
nt|joest: in club s|pg||
nt|joest: good point|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: So here's another way, not exactly obvious, how the 6-5 can make evaluation tough.   But partner's on lead and he might not even have a @H to lead|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h = Q@s ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|joest: I hope Howie doesn't think this is passable|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mpny:  he may still be afraid that no spade will cash|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: and the limo brakes soon enough|pg||
nt|glen: if W bids again, he will switch to taxi driving|pg||
nt|kit: what is 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: more torture|pg||
nt|kit: no kidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve pushes back from the table, rocks back and forth|pg||
nt|joest: Steve may be worried they have no heart control (despite the bidding()|pg||
nt|kit: impossible -- West has king of clubs, and North opened bidding|pg||
nt|joest: Howie on the other hand has decided that maybe now is a good time to hit the brakes after opening with nine highs, taking a 3@s call and then taking a cue bid|pg||
nt|kit: So even if partner has a doubleton heart, he must have a control.|pg||
nt|joest: it is just not in Garner's nature to pass here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: steve rocking again, |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Barry and Howie are looking at Josh's hand from 114|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: wow, what a judgment|pg||
nt|mpny:  very well judged, at least sucessfully|pg||
nt|othered1: possible 13 imps to welland, assuming the wheels don't fall off on defense|pg||
nt|stc: vwd|pg||
nt|joest: maybe Howie would have been better off bidding 4@h instead of 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: wrong again|pg||
nt|joest: i'm told they rested in 5@d in the other room|pg||
nt|joest: that was a big chance for Aker that got away if that's true|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Howie reviews the auction for Barry |pg||
pc|hK|nt|stc: best lead is a @H !!!|pg||

nt|joest: i doubt Weinstein would double at any other colors|pg||
nt|kit: he projects spade shortness in his partner's hand, but too weak to act, so doesn't want to let opponents play at 2-level when they have 8-card fit|pg||
nt|joest: they reached 6@d in the open room on Board 117 so this match is going to get very close|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pef: I believe gordon is also going to gain about 5 imps on board 116, and board 117 looked pretty good for them so maybe there is hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cards very friendly for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: , @D to K @H to small and A, @C back, and @h10 and duck in S!|pg||
nt|othered1: or even make it by rising with @DJ and going right in @C|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S is normal here.  Slam is on a finess plus and isn't up to snuff.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: yes, they can actually make 5s if they guess to pin the j of hearts|pg||
nt|stc: On 87 N played the A@s and @s for K single or @s 2-2 - but with no chances on the actual layout|pg||
nt|joest: just an 8 imp difference now|pg||
nt|kit: Double was difference between going plus and going minus.  Even vulnerable, the double gains 5 or 6 IMPs.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: director comes in and frowns|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: CAT SELL OUT NOW|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  but even on low @d to the 8, S cashes @h and exits low @d...E can't overtake or he will lose @d, but if he wins on board, has to give up a @c|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mr murray: I am sure schermer wanted to make a slam try but hesitated|pg||
nt|glen: this hand shows why some like to open 11s in a 11-13 style, it kept the open room low in 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|glen: here the 11 count passed, but then had to take the 3rd seat opening up to 2NT|pg||
nt|stc: not sure about Goren's X ? delayed support ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: Bramley open 1NT in East??? and passed out|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: on previous hand west really should have kept a spade entry in hand and played clubs twice from east hand to try for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
nt|ady: not sure of the meanings of these bids   but 6@C looks a good contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like relays with W providing info...I don't have info on their system for this part|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may simply be patterning out his hand at this point|pg||
nt|joest: this might come down to whether west can duck the clubs smoothly|pg||
pc|dA|nt|glen: lets see how declarer tackles @Cs|pg||
nt|othered1: or finding a sleepy south|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|othered1: This h as the potential to tighten the match up quite a bit.|pg||
nt|kit: However, 3@D hasn't made yet.  And it probably won't, as likely club to 9 will be club play.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: ok- cant expect them t bid 5S|pg||
nt|pef: play here won't take long, I don't think, draw trumps, take the diamond finesse, peacefully go down 1 unless n/s have a major accident and never get their heart ace|pg||
nt|pelu: for me easy 1@C and no problem in next round: 1@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|stc: lot of work for -1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  certainly reached a mundane contract for such an exciting auction|pg||
nt|ady: same contract in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  if I had to guess, it would seem that W showed a 4-3-3-3 pattern, no 4 card major, and min. NT hand...he might have shown 3-3-3-4 exactly|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|glen: will get 3@Cs, thus has 2@S, 3@Cs, 2@Ds but where's trick 8?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: i have a lot of players who only open 1@C on 2-3 small and dont open og 4-5 :):)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|glen: this partscore hand may take some time to play in the battle for the 8th trick|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stc: easier for the defense now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: The auction tells east he can just sit back and see if his @H cashes'|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: Imp scale's limiting disaster scores is evident here.  on a normal partial, EW get back half of the imps from last hand's debacle.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|kit: Goren trying to hide his spade strength, but he is unable to do so|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: has to be right to go up -- declarer known to have 5 cards in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|kit: so discard can't be of value|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|stc: chances to make now, play a @h and try some cross ruff|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: schermer asking drew what he would have led if he has splintered in clubs!|pg||
nt|othered1: more than half, rather|pg||
nt|joest: solid result there|pg||
mb|1N|nt|glen: and now the prepostpenultimate board, the kokish abbreivated as penultimate|pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR, North made limited opening, so south had no real interest in slam.|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|xfer|nt|sybarra: they need to stay even here, and bid the slam |pg||
nt|andyv:  this should end the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats the limit|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: Best not play the 8-card @H fit, which is down on the lead of either black suit.  But good 7-card suits shouldn't go quietly|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking to see why they got to slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead but attains little|pg||
nt|ady: nice doubleton fillers with east|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||
nt|glen: E's bid here depends on system, and whether 2@C is natural or artificial|pg||
nt|glen: experts have worked hard to convert every @C bid into an artificial meaning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George seems to be in pain, head in his hands|pg||
nt|glen: he is thinking about page 431 of the notes|pg||
nt|glen: do we play xyz over this sequence or abc?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I hate it when I can't remember who I have what agreements with |pg||
nt|othered1: NS in OR stayed out.  Let's see how tough they can make it in this room.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: now stan dard practice is to bid immediate 2H with weak hand|pg||
nt|glen: he hopes that 2NT is a puppet to 3@C, often a @C signoff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve thought for a while, then alerted|pg||
nt|glen: but on page 531 it is revealed as super-blackwood grand slam try|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing just 4S now|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless S gets involved maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  now A@d and @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it's too late|pg||
nt|ady: does not really matter   can take at best 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|pelu: now I dont exp that they can stop in 3@c|pg||
nt|glen: but with a forced waiting bid of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George fakes applauding when steve bid shows up|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to be another 110 for ns losing two trumps, two clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|kit: Aker not getting the opportunity on these boards, but there is one to go.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: Do you think that west has another bid?  I do, given the light hands they open.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Wrong again, I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 2@C was a transfer to @D.|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT seems like a big bid by north after alreday bidding 3S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 2 @D would have been for them, given 1 nt was "other suits" minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @H for that matter, or 2 nt |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew said he wasn't sure what the double of 1NT would be, if I heard him correctly.  With my hearing it could have been something else thoughh|pg||
nt|othered1: south was a passed hand, so 1N looks normal, if they choose to enter at all.  2N looks to dangerous to me at equal nonvul.|pg||
nt|othered1: Here?  I agree.|pg||
nt|joest: sorry east can get a diamond ruff unles declarer breaks communications right now with a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|glen: good trump lead|pg||
nt|glen: declarer's best line was to ruff a bunch of @Hs in the short @C hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: only if 2Nt is transfer to 3@c|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzff: it was but steve bid 3 nt anyways|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Bob|pg||
nt|mr murray: many play 2n/t asks partner to bid 3 clubs. apparently not here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wolff (still like the word snapdragon better.)|pg||
nt|pelu: a @S-lead will help E a lot|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: but after the bidding a @D would be normal|pg||
nt|pelu: so another game/partscore flat board?? :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his hand as a 17-19pt nt.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is not the worlds worst contract if clubs were nicer|pg||
nt|stc: 3Nt was an easy make, 4@s is not|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: I would much rather have heard 4@C cue from partner, and even then 4N seems very pushy.  Maybe in their methods, however, a 4@H return cue would not have shown extras|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|glen: N should continue with the program|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  as we come to the last board of this set, I want to thank Bob, our operator, for doing a great job and surviving all the "power failures":)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty to David and thanks to all the specs who joined us|pg||
pc|dK|nt|santyclz: Now a @d.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    thx Bob   and Andy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: but Jacobs was on the right track - His 2Nt ask for 3@C - the winning partscore|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: just trying to find a bid Ed, that moves it forward |pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: and there it is, so possible swing here.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: overrules by partner|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt have extras after 3@S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps this will come down to the final board|pg||
nt|mr murray: uknow what happens when u overrule your partner:)  the gods take over and slap u in the face|pg||
nt|othered1: they've found their major lengths already and there's no reason to think you have to boost them out of slam|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: surprised he didn't eant the @C pitch here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  final set of this round of matches will start in about an hour|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: overtake + ruff|pg||
nt|kit: should have led low spade -- build fence around partner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: @HJ also work fine here - when pd has 10 8! - why not just @D???|pg||
nt|mr murray: he has time for diamond|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wants all he is entitled 2|pg||
nt|mr murray: chazur in pure yiddish . all bridge players want more :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: turns out a good shift. heart return better than diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|glen: when you play a suit and declarer continues it, well, the program was better|pg||
nt|joest: you beat me to it kit|pg||
nt|joest: goodbye diamond ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: why - also down 1 on @HJ|pg||
nt|mr murray: down2?|pg||
nt|pelu: or 2 - ok|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|pef: berkowitz and sontag somewhat miraculously stopped in 4c on board 118 and n/w didn't bid 4s, so that's going to be another 6 imps to gordon|pg||
nt|pef: with 2 go go we are down to 14 imps|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mr murray: get your nap in yet?  :)|pg||
nt|lml: so trump losers  = 1 down|pg||
nt|kit: or even better, lead jack of spades so partner will think declarer has queen|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: 3 trump losers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mr murray: he is going to make it. well-done|pg||
nt|lml: push|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|othered1: west looked like he was in good position, then the roof fell in|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: yes, and cash king of clubs so partner knows what is going on|pg||
nt|joest: doesn't tht make partner less likely to overtake?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|santyclz: S needed to win and shift back to a @h for -2.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: if you lead jack of spades denying queen, partner will automatically play king|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mr murray: the old 98 of heart trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|mr murray: yes that is y the heart ace was good|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  but this hand doesn't bode well for the Aker team|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = good @H raise   2@H would be weaker|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to be much weaker although the @h honors are nice|pg||

nt|gosia: :)|pg||

nt|mr murray: unlucky that heart 5 was almost unreadable|pg||
nt|santyclz: What's this?  An actual game???|pg||
nt|othered1: Match is only half way over and 21 imps can come back in a couple of heartbeats.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Start time will be 10 minutes after the hour...|pg||
nt|joest: ok last board coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: better to play low card = come on - from bad suits u can affort to play high|pg||
nt|mpny:  welland seems to have opened 1N in the other room. here it was hard. east might have done more, but his values did not really look slammish|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you.  If he is playing hearts he should take the pitch|pg||
nt|joest: north-south can make a heart game on a good trump guess|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|santyclz: I'm going to nap through the 3rd segment and hope to be awake for the 4th.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have a longish break now or is this last hand for the day? |pg||
nt|joest: which will not be easy to reach :)|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h = @hs + a minor|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mr murray: nice hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: this time upside down would be best of course|pg||
nt|glen: and the last board of the set, still another 15 boards for this evening|pg||
nt|andyv:  Wolfson able to extend their lead by 11 this set...only 29 imps exchanged over 14 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|andyv:  so in about 33 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 5@D  both ok for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is what you call a solid overcall|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: this is it|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D likely transfer to @H, leaving east wihtout a good call unless double shows @H.|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard not to be in 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: after the 14-16 1NT opening, will have to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|joest: 3@d is probably something like INV in spades|pg||
nt|joest: INV or better|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mr murray: c uall later. enjoyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for the day  |pg||
nt|lml: well Richter had those covered :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes     maybe double followed by diamonds  unless finding a spade fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3d was alerted|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mr murray: cant make but cant blame Jim for bidding on.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The bidding isn't over...|pg||
nt|mr murray: can he not bid 5 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Joe - Its bedtime for me 23.50 here - but tx for at nice evening Joe and Murray  and good job wd by u Bob|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3rd segment is due to start in a little less than an hour.|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye for now.  Nice specs|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a lot to say as there was not a lot to do |pg||
nt|mpny:  again potentially dangerous|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will pick up the matches tomorrow |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Michael and Ed,  great fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N may still be found|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d does well too|pg||
nt|joest: this looks to arrive in 4@s one down|pg||
nt|joest: sorry down 2 on a ruff|pg||
nt|joest: i wonder who is thinking right now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree. the ugly NT opening with a good 5-card major and a worthless doubleton in the other paid huge dividends in the OR|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like Aker played east for that good a h and.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what is 4@C I wonder?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: The redouble showed hearts I think|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @s|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye Joe and Peter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Murray.|pg||
nt|glen: now W can bid 3@D|pg||
nt|glen: some specs liked 2@D by W on the round b4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't know but they got to 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all - no problem in the play here|pg||
nt|joest: ....and about what|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mpny:  you can make 5, even without a heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: and he'll earn an overtrick, too|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  Steve better not think too long here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|glen: yikes, 4@H is falling in love with the wrong person|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Bob, our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: George said something I couldn't catch as he put down the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for the helpful (and often funny) comments  |pg||
nt|stc: even the lucky position in @c is not enough here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mpny:  a very bad end for Casen Krekorian|pg||
nt|othered1: this is easily makable.  Just strip the black suits and play 3@D and north will  be endplayed in @H.  But there are alternatives|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andyv:  I guess so|pg||
nt|andyv:  mix up somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he didn't think long at all...|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C  I dont understand|pg||
nt|ady: may not lead a club    a slight chance|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't comment since I don't know what meaning this pair would attach to it|pg||
nt|ady: but even then  will have to play 3 rounds of trumps to get to the heart discard|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: with George it was something very funny|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Jan Martel who works hard to organize the operators and the USBF for bringing this great tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: no, 5 was makable.  I didn't notice west toppling over|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a few  hopeless slams in this set across both tables.  Unusual for play at this level, I'd th ink.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: See you all tomorrow for 2nd half of round of 8|pg||
nt|joest: hard to see how Aker can win 13 on this last board here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|odysseus69: its a mystery to me why anyone would want to bid hearts on East after 1Dx|pg||
nt|glen: he has a great sense of humor|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe Steve was playing Howard for the A@c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|ady: of couurse a spade lead still ok  as club can be cashed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
