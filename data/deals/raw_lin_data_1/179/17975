nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|1S|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
mb|d|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
mb|3C|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|viren169: this is destined to go 1 down|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
nt|roswolf: must lose the 2 black aces|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably reach 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Two hearts and a diamond to lose in 4 @S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
nt|puncher99: mite b goin to 4hrts|pg||
nt|puncher99: if they find 44|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a good raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
nt|viren169: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
nt|ybob: re :)|pg||
nt|viren169: a t/out dble would have been more interesting!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W can win 3NT |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||

nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||

pc|cA|nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: Now declarer needs all three spades and a club to live|pg||
pc|d8|pg||

nt|benjent: Goodness me. The dealing machine is still set on "goulash" :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|sommer: a-live:)|pg||
nt|sommer: live!|pg||
nt|roswolf: good always good to see some real bridge|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
nt|ybob: 140 here|pg||
nt|viren169: best to pass with a mis-fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 now|pg||
nt|viren169: defense need to be quick to hold it to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on that lead!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gulyas: will try a @S now|pg||
nt|ybob: now 10|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|benjent: 2 off? Kranyak's just going to pump @c's and accept a certain fate I would think|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|gulyas: still down by 15|pg||
nt|frankaus: another interesting lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: break|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for diamond in the other room|pg||
nt|bagman: A partscore hand which probably belongs to NS. EW can take 6 tricks in NT in defense|pg||
nt|bagman: The nice lie of the red suits gives declarer 3 hearts and 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: I am not a big fan of south's pass here|pg||
nt|bagman: The club J is also onside so declarer can make 2 club tricks and come to 7 with 3 hearts, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: really 1@D by east!?|pg||
nt|bagman: The latter line probably needs some entry help from the defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ybob: probably 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chessmaste: Good play by declarer, avoiding 3 down|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c8|nt|bagman: N is now in position to cash 5 first and see what happens then|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: Best to continue clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now he may well go 3 down|pg||
nt|benjent: Might need the @d finesse too|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|ybob: A@S and @H to 120|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: Once declarer sees the dummy he wishes he's in 6NT but no problem here as hearts behave|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss to Cohen "you couldn't ask for the queen"|pg||

nt|puncher99: must of|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|viren169: could be trouble here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I play notrump bids here showing @s raises with all suit bids natural after a strong club opening|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to make some good guesses in 3NT|pg||
nt|ybob: another 140 to E-W, now 2@C  p p 2@H ?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
nt|ybob: or X from E|pg||
nt|viren169: or P P dble|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
nt|viren169: East taking the low road!|pg||
nt|viren169: North will hopeful respect the bidding...|pg||
nt|ybob: if S has 6@C and pd 4333 2@H was the good bid|pg||
nt|viren169: if South had an opening they would pass...|pg||
nt|ybob: not opening but 6@C decent|pg||
mb|2N|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|viren169: this wont be pretty...|pg||
nt|ybob: don¬¥t like 2NT|pg||
nt|ybob: with xxx @S|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like a pass to me...|pg||
nt|ybob: pd denies 4@S|pg||
nt|viren169: good lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
nt|ybob: -100 instead  win 140|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 light if North ducks 2 rounds of hearts...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bagman: A good try and a good bet S holding one spade and partner 5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer was taking the club finesse to the safe hand protecting the @HK|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
nt|viren169: @d now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|bagman: and if the @HK is with south with original 5 spades, the contract is going down anyway|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gulyas: making him less likely to hold @H length, hence getting the finesse right|pg||
nt|psyck: as Mike pointed out, starting on @h would have given him more chances, if he could knock out the entry to the long @s hand|pg||
nt|passell: 10 of clubs a misprint|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably played a low @C|pg||
nt|sommer: wow..they missed the "easy" slam in OR|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: ?|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Looks like -500|pg||

pc|c7|nt|psyck: anyway, home once he gets the @h right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s8|nt|gulyas: got it wrong|pg||
mc|6|nt|gulyas: you have to make such games if you want to beat the top seed|pg||
nt|gulyas: strange enough, they gained 2 on the board, as it drifted 2 off|pg||
nt|psyck: @hQ as trick 2 would have removed W's only possible entry & he could afford to lose 1@s, 2@h, 1@c then into safe hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HA premature play, the @S would have squeezed declarer, then endplayed with a @D|pg||

nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..the minorsqueeze against N|pg||
nt|roswolf: west fell in love with his 2 aces|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the obvious call |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: connection problem :(|pg||
nt|bagman: Did West really pass?|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were wet here imo a reopening double would have got them into the auction|pg||
nt|viren169: the vul and the 2@d bid kept N/S at bay!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: ..3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it appears so pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: I admit that W holds a bad hand and they are vulnerable but still he's holding a reasonable spade suit and doubleton heart|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||
nt|sommer: + Q:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||
nt|roswolf: well so i cant count or perhaps type:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: @CK creates a parking place for the diamond loser|pg||
nt|sommer: always makeable I guess|pg||
nt|sommer: now @D7 disappears|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but may work out ok|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|1D|nt|swanson: Hi to all.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be feisty|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: bits and pieces hand now|pg||
nt|sommer: 2 @H NS looks best|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfj: 0-7|pg||
nt|viren169: lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: I play 2@s there pretty sound aswell but this east hand is too powerful for a 2@s bid there imo|pg||
nt|psyck: I may have tried a higher number of @h|pg||
nt|passell: the preemptive 1heart|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed, don't make things worse. The wind will shift in their direction sometime. Need to make sure you haven't blown the match already when that happens.|pg||
nt|roswolf: will west bid here|pg||
nt|ybob: wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Facing a passed partner and holding a bad hand with no source of tricks S goes for the offshape X instead of the dangerous 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|ybob: now better :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|viren169: a light opener in 1st seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north sticks his neck out|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The real score is probably 4-3 to Deutsch|pg||
nt|swanson: There is no really good opening bid with the South hand.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: very true   I prefer 1heart overcall to dbl with west  anyone have an opinion?|pg||
nt|benjent: 1@h for me too. Tell partner where you live|pg||
nt|bagman: S happy having avoided being dummy in 3@C|pg||
pc|c7|nt|passell: makes it very difficult for the opponents to get to 3nt  on many hands when it is cold|pg||
nt|sommer: calm down now...|pg||
nt|ybob: and light X too :)|pg||
nt|viren169: probably systematically t/out of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i keep missing a spot of bidding :)|pg||
nt|ybob: over 1NT opening from W :)|pg||
nt|viren169: no worries... keeps us amused!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
nt|bagman: N could have bid 2NT for the minors but 3@C is lead directing and normally also a good trump suit (facing a normal X=T/O)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||
nt|passell: 7imps|pg||
nt|passell: hampson did have 1 suit stopped  just neither of theirs|pg||
nt|passell: Gavin did well to bid 1spade also|pg||
nt|benjent: I expect Kranyak will cash a big @d now|pg||
nt|sommer: sure sure..N has to raise to 3|pg||
nt|sommer: Cohen doesn't like it right now..I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed not clear how 3@S fares|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bagman: Everything else is friendly so S is unlikely to go down here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: Get some attitude (just in case) and also make sure partner returns the right thing|pg||
nt|passell: hampson hoping he has only 2|pg||
nt|ybob: S has 2 moves, @H or low @S ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ybob: now K @D and 8 @H  ...|pg||
nt|ybob: if duck N play @S ...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bessi2: 4@s make but may be difficult to reach|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to guess the spades, avoid losing control and manage the diamonds (with ruff or luck)|pg||
nt|viren169: declarer will duck this expecting diamonds to be 5-3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ybob: with 5@D on N he bids 2@D over 2@C|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|viren169: easy for us to see... looking at all 4 hands|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: Deutch probably going plus in both rooms again|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is am exciting lot |pg||
nt|bagman: A solid slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Hampson will be wondering if slam is on. The @d overcall is good news, really|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@D looks a cinch to bid|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bagman: Both holding good looking two suiters|pg||
nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||
nt|bagman: EW have 12 tricks in both diamonds and NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Might have some communication problems in NT with heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w never got to grips with the hand|pg||
nt|bagman: @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: a relay sequence should do the trick here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I would not pass the South hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting pass from Deutsch here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 4 corrected|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is possiblr here|pg||
nt|bagman: But nothing unsolvable; take @H diamonds and then @SQ|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||
nt|frankaus: no entry to  8 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D, 6NT..or maybe even 7@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon they will know about the misfit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing diamonds i suppose and if so 4@D MUST BE A SLAM TRY|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok so is 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW SLAM IS EASY PEASEY|pg||
nt|bagman: Not even trying to guess what's going on here biddingwise|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@C precision, 1@S  i think positive unbal but not sure|pg||
nt|ybob: 8/11|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
nt|viren169: all routes lead to 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||
nt|ybob: another NT ?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bessi2: It must have been delightful for Deutsc to see that 3@d bid :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think a grand is possible|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H could be kickback but could also be something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: NICELY BID|pg||
nt|bagman: The play is no problem|pg||
nt|puncher99: cashout time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||

nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|puncher99: cranes law|pg||
nt|bagman: Good lead; it scared Diamond|pg||
nt|puncher99: lead aces vrs all slams|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|swanson: Now, by the time spades are led the situation will be clear to the defenders.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: If the @SK does not come down, he has some chances left in hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sommer: only makeable, even..I think|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: But my line is easy to take when seeing all the cards|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|benjent: Bit of mostly harmless stewing|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|swanson: East can be endplay now.  This was an unusual 3-suit squeeze.  Declarer still has the guess the situation, of course if West rises and leads a club.  It wouldn't be fun to lose the ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: In unfriendly game a proper comment by NS might put EW to tilt |pg||
mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: 2@C - must be a Transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Not everyone responds with Kranyak's hand, but on average it's the right action|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman took the @h A out, but now has folded his hand up again|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@H looks like no 5M, no 6m with positive values|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: as before|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bessi2: hmm.. had to cancel my speech regarding the play in 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: can't read the notes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: Double seems a bit optimistic with no @c pips|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: Well, South pushed the boat out with 2@H and has now left his ship in the harbour. 4@H would have had chances - this has none |pg||
nt|gulyas: this will not test declarer|pg||
nt|psyck: a trump lead would have prolonged the play|pg||
nt|sommer: @H for @C's?|pg||
nt|viren169: West didnt raise because East is limited|pg||
nt|viren169: 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|benjent: The 2nd @c trick gets Greco up to 6, and the @s finesse will make it 7|pg||
nt|benjent: No problem getting the @d suit right when North has bid both blacks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: looks like he will make this|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond play is not that risky as if there was a diamond ruff hangin, the defense might have gone for that|pg||
nt|sommer: @H2..|pg||
nt|roswolf: creaking to the obvious contract|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bagman: This is the best lead and declarer might have some difficulties as he's probably giving up a club |pg||
nt|bagman: then a diamond back and defense set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: win and lead a heart following with the club finesse looks very natural|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bessi2: imo,  both are to blame for this contract|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|bagman: A low diamond now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|passell: 5 with any lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|passell: the nine of clubs was a good card to see|pg||
nt|benjent: Cashing the @d's to squeeze some unhappy discards out of Wolpert|pg||
nt|sommer: @SQ and claim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is more or less forced to play clubs from hand|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss was thinking about overtaking the club, so Smith showed his hand and asked "how do I do?"|pg||

nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||

nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||

nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: not sure I understand this play by Larsen.. if loses to the @c Q then e-w have another oppertunity to play @d |pg||

nt|puncher99: doesnt look like ns pair is on same page|pg||

nt|bagman: With 3163 he would have bid it already :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ybob: 2@S 4@S surely|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: North has a weak two in diamonds - great thinks South - but it could have been worse - he might have opened 3@D |pg||

nt|roswolf: ok thx|pg||
nt|roswolf: now may play 4@H|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi folks|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chessmaste: South's bidding is wildly optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: At least that's what was claimed and I double checked - declarer pitched a spade on the diamond A as S ruffed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffed a spade to get to dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hope we're okay now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: N failed to cover the @DJ so there was a diamond winner to take care of the spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: WELL DONE OR PLAYING IN LUCK!?|pg||
nt|bagman: S willing to try 3NT with diamond filler and solid club stopper|pg||
nt|roswolf: well not many overtricks|pg||
nt|ybob: trump lead ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: close one........here and at other tables|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chessmaste: I will say it one more time - a void in partner's suit is not an asset |pg||
nt|bessi2: e-w let him off the hook which is surprising... west has an easy penalty dbl there imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 1 heart =8-11 artificial -5 sp|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|chessmaste: Agreed - the bridge has been moderate so far|pg||
nt|roswolf: chicken|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|benjent: Can nearly make this now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: once more a fatuous overcall attracts a poor lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: south i think showed a clear lack of bottle|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: Without the @c lead, declarer has to fall back on the @d finesse when @c's don't break. With this lead, he can actually pick up the @c's|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|benjent: If he's got the moxy for it. Bit risky, so here comes the @d finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|benjent: Wolpert's going to have to find the @s shift|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h6 pitch should help|pg||
nt|bagman: N had a natural diamond lead without the overcall|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|benjent: NS play upside down signals, with suit preference tendencies "if we think partner will be able to work it out"|pg||
nt|benjent: So Kranyak has been busy suit preferencing for @s's, hoping that partner will be able to work it out|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert will be thinking - if declarer has @hA, he'l have 9 tricks, so I'll have to hope the @s's cash|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfj: very good run here for the Deutsch team|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|benjent: If partner has @hA, then Greco may not have 9 tricks yet|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|caitlin: @DA seemed odd|pg||
nt|ybob: 3 rounds @S and finesse J @C to only 10|pg||
nt|caitlin: that was the lead right?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

nt|roswolf: quality|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asked who had the @d K|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|benjent: Flat board, but there was more on the line here than at the other table. I like Diamond's minus better than Deutsch's.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|benjent: EW play precision, but their 1NT is a little stronger than usual - 14-16|pg||
nt|ybob: problems to N-S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: softly softly e/w|pg||
nt|bagman: Even the overcall loses a trick from time to time it's still probably winning bridge to overcall aggressively with dubious suits|pg||

nt|roswolf: is|pg||
nt|bagman: E, on the other hand, might think that 5 @D might be good|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fine contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Excuse me, 1NT is 15-17 in 3rd/4th|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bessi2: not sure I would have protected there but I like it nonetheless|pg||

nt|bagman: Making a probe|pg||
nt|ybob: XX shows 2 places out ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: N bids 2@H now it will be doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks a simple make|pg||
nt|ybob: clear 4144 by S|pg||
nt|caitlin: as long as Hampson doesn't bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ???|pg||
nt|ybob: not a bad spot 2@H win 6/7 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: pretty good 6@c contract here but seems doomed to fail as the cards lie|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, that's a keen 3NT not vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass the buck bid|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is rightsided|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and gains the 8th trick|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..and will probably make!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9th|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen asks for a review of the auction|pg||
nt|sommer: with @DJ falling thats 9|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not X 3@S because he expected a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|caitlin: no Lebensohl so DONT but Gavin must think 2@H better than 2@D???|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D was better|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Is it playable? Sure, but he'll need to pull off some magic in the @c suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 7 tricks :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: and often it's a bad idea to X probes giving away bidding space|pg||
nt|roswolf: but of course the defence can cash out but i have my doubts|pg||
nt|bagman: or 8|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H X is the second best contract|pg||
pc|hT|nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
nt|caitlin: so at other table 2@H E-W and here N-S!!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||
nt|roswolf: serves him right - always make things easy for your ox opposite!|pg||
nt|ybob: better 2@D i think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d7|nt|bagman: There's not much left for Moss to try: he needs now diamonds running |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinking, we didn't lose connection again :)|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Cplay was an extra chance to the @D's ..hoping @C are 3-3, if @D dont work|pg||
nt|roswolf: no time pressure is there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen: "sorry" - he's been moving the spade 2, spade 7 and club 10 into playing position |pg||
nt|bagman: This is KO and they are two boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Of course they don't know about the other table, but I'm pretty sure there isn't any time problem (each table is screened off so we can't see the clocks in the middle of the room ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but could move the curtains aside and look if wanted to|pg||
nt|roswolf: best chance for south is to switch to@S isnt it?|pg||
nt|bagman: DD, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Director just announced 20 minutes, so definitely no time problems|pg||
nt|bagman: But S might think that W holds the Q and N better hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably shoots back a low club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Wonder if S can tell that the @h Q at trick 1 was a falsecard (in the sense that he must have had either ten or nine) so know that W didn't want a shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen has now moved a diamond to the end of his hand - considering going passive?|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point but i cnat see how a club or a diamond could lead to 4 more reicks for defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: almost played the @s 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He might hope for 8 or less for declarer instead of getting 5 or more for the defense :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is likely that diamonds are favorable for declarer so he must generate tricks elsewhere|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: perhaps i dont now|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: Good @h return - I reckon that was tough after the @s lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
nt|caitlin: still @H ruff in 2@D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||
nt|roswolf: but i can see the cards south cant - which is why it would be fascinating to hear his thoughts|pg||
nt|ybob: the best was 1@H but this made W :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: We'll be starting again reasonably soon I suspect - one of the benefits of playing different boards in each match is we don't have to wait for the slow matches to finish before we ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: resume|pg||
nt|roswolf: another feisty hand to finish with|pg||
nt|caitlin: Yea, cash @HQ then @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: We are now on the last board of the set. Thanks to our very efficient operator Susan - Great Job! Our appreciation the USBF for ensuring that this fine event is brought to BBO ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: vugraph. Thanks too to my very learned fellow commentators, Pekka and Glenn for their company and perceptive comments and to our specs whose contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphzfj: last board here -- thanks to the specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: thanks to u also|pg||
nt|ybob: 6@S good here|pg||
nt|caitlin: still worth 4 IMPs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|benjent: tempting to try for game, too tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: these quarter-final matches resume tomorrow, about 14 hours from now (10 local time)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should quickly go down|pg||
nt|bagman: This surely goes down but is it going down one or two|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: thanks to all my commentators as well|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss: "sorry partner"|pg||
nt|roswolf: although if south opens up the @S suit....|pg||
nt|bagman: Now win the ace and a low club and see if the defense takes the tricks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: A lot of total IMPs this set!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman asks to look at NS convention card|pg||
nt|bagman: After the defense grabs the first 4 heart tricks, declarer has 7 tricks ready and can build one more in diamonds for an overtick|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 3@D asks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bessi2: wow.. that 3@s is one serious underbid in my opinion.. but at first glance it looks successful|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Kranyak's accept is marginal, Wolpert's invite is marginal, the @s break is poor, and this is going to sail off|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|caitlin: this kills slam|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|bagman: Cohen should go up the Q|pg||
nt|bagman: and cash spades and diamond A|pg||
nt|bagman: If the defense does not cooperate in hearts, declarer is likely to make only 7|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry agreed re: @S:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: lots of hands:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: serious 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@C  void |pg||
nt|caitlin: asking to cue|pg||
nt|caitlin: or 3N mild slam try...one or other depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|caitlin: W can cue @HK|pg||
nt|ybob: serious 3NT|pg||
nt|swanson: I think 3@C = min, 3@D inquiry; 3@S void somewhere; 3NT = where?, 4@C = clubs.|pg||
nt|petergill: Greco in the tank, thinking about how to find @d control, and at same time check for enough controls = cannot do both? - has to guess what to do?|pg||
nt|petergill: I was commentating at other table in this match... where same problem arose |pg||
mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: he can stand to go to 5@S though, unless partner has really filthy trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: why X??|pg||
mb|r|nt|ybob: now XX = A@H and @D cue|pg||
nt|swanson: Works well to respond g.f. 2@C and proceed naturally (2@H, 2@S, 3@D ...)|pg||
nt|caitlin: paych|pg||
nt|caitlin: psych|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@H, bypassing 4@D, identifies the @d problem to his partner|pg||
nt|petergill: Rdbl = first round @H control |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ybob: and @D cue too|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: This is the last board of the set. Restart is in ... about 10 minutes I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: nv he does not care wherefrom the @SQ comes down|pg||
nt|ybob: if W denies it|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|caitlin: hard slam to bid without knowing partner's exact shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing 1st and 2nd round cue bids, East must have @d control for the Rdbl, else Easthe signs off in 4@s, knowing two @d lsoers exist |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|swanson: The Larry Cohen version of Jacoby as published in Bulletin last year is 3@C all minimums.  Probably in use by E-W.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjent: Thanks to my fellow commentators Mike Passell and Frank Budai, and our operator Susan|pg||
nt|bagman: Win this and take winners for double squeeze|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: Agressive bridge leads often to huge IMP turnover|pg||
nt|bagman: thx all and bye for now|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye|pg||
nt|sommer: bye|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|benjent: Results at http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 4@HXX on a @D lead would be interesting. Academic point, perhaps. |pg||
mc|12|nt|bagman: the rest plays itself automatically for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye all|pg||
nt|bagman: thx all, bye for now|pg||
nt|caitlin: push|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty all:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: more to come any minute|pg||
nt|ybob: E could be push another, good cards |pg||
nt|petergill: Playing Precision with light openings, West was worried that partner had Q109xx, Axxxx, KQx void, and the Dbl meant a heart ruff awaited 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: to me W bid well|pg||
nt|ybob: but not sure if E did|pg||
nt|ybob: 2NT = 4 cards supp , 3NT = serious, 4@H = cue over 4@C shows void ... |pg||
nt|ybob: he needs make a waiting bid 4@S|pg||
pg||
