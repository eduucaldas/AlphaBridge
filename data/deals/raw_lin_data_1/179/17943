nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||

nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||

nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||

nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|sT|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|s5|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||

nt|fabsayc: they dont stop anybody|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: They don't play transfers over 2N overcall, I guess.   thought that was almost universal, but maybe 3@D would transfer to @S|pg||
nt|iceking: can make 12 tricks here |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: both side of the table asking what the 3 heart bid was and explained as stayman|pg||
nt|iceking: interesting methods|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 3minor is natural nf|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure how they play here|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play transfers over 1N overcalls, but do over 2N|pg||
nt|iceking: oh same here:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D not forcing is too limited a use at imps vulnerable|pg||
nt|iceking: probably means something else |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Opps' suit is Stayman without a heart stop if my memory serves me correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks right with this hand|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 3@H is stayman and 3nt shows 2@S 3@S would show 3@S and 4th level promise 4@S its playable methods|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
mb|3H|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||

mb|p|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||

nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
mb|6C|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||

nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: will try a @S now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||

pc|s8|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
