nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: this might have some action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cognoscenti and junkies:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: EW can make 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate the opening but it is welland's style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, 15 boards to go in this marathon|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
mb|1N|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is one tough event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi guys, welcome|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
nt|daman: welcome to the first session of the Round of 8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 lead     most pairs lead 2nd highest from a bad suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: agree that jumps should show specific handtypes. otherwise they can just be plastic bags over partner';s head....sorry for the gruesome metaphor:)|pg||

nt|tejjyid: how about the grueful pun?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: what happened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: players too fast for the operator!?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no drama - session start always a difficult time for operators|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: the axe may fall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E showed a lot of restriant here|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this plays better from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no way- 1nt?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surprised by the lack of a -ve type X from East|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very friendly lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (if it stops here)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is an excellent case for a low club lead on this auction|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS cashing in their optimism|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfg: And there it is|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|copeyj: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265 for E/W|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/robinson-boydrrevision.pdf is the card for N/S|pg||

pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: if North was givng up on 3-3 @C, I don'tknow why he wouldn't cash the Ace 1st|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: doing enough to maintain doubt in declarer's mind|pg||

nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||

nt|roswolf: fair point ed|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: par here is 4@SD, down 1 or 2|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall: "No double? Seamon: "Can we double now?" after seeing dummy|pg||

nt|daman: you don't look old :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It wouldn't be particularly harmful here though. You just have to know when to make the junior bid :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||

nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||

mb|d|nt|ralfwil: or any 3-card minor (not 2@s reverse)|pg||
mb|r|nt|copeyj: not a very exciting hand here - unless they can get 3N played by W and avoid @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have opened the north hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah you're right|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not likely|pg||

nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: now how will north catch up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: transfers over 1@C opener might get you there with E opening 1@C but thats it|pg||
nt|lml: 2@h might have got through|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that left nothing to spare|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: in the game now|pg||
nt|ady: could the diamond be short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: 2+ limited|pg||

nt|copeyj: 2N probably some kind of relay|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: THIS WILL BE PASSED|pg||

nt|lml: which will give him a second one later|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I was looking at 3 spade ...senior moment|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do now with the south hand assuming you were not looking at four hands|pg||
nt|lml: I might switch to clubs|pg||
nt|lml: @SK and then clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's probably thinking about if he can score his @hQ or not. So I think he's temped to play a trump. Not so much a @c when he sees no dummy entry to play towards hand yet|pg||
nt|lml: hard to play a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe|pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: spotlight to robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D probably 3@S maximum hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D openings require lots of special understandings in strong club auctions|pg||
pc|sT|nt|copeyj: likely to be a game swing to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|copeyj: who are opening up a bit of a lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure I would have led @H too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad start for robinson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!  not for me! leads from 1087x and from J862 is forbidden if there isnÂ´t a very good reason|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: i think they were the primary reason Garozzo abandoned Precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s just says he can't double 1N. They don't seem to have a lot to do this auction|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: good play|pg||
nt|lml: wow if Katz put up the @SQ which really doesnt cost much he can do very well|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tejjyid: yes, I like to remove all the balanced hands into 1NT - of course that creates other issues|pg||
nt|ady: initial trump lead best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: still I believe the Robinson team can bring in the recent Cavendish pairs winners Kit Woolsey and Fred Stewart in the next stanza|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N was inconsistent in the auction at best|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and @C is his strongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought about it, and after the 5 min tank, he probably should have too.|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: and 9 easy tricks now. N is squeezed|pg||
nt|copeyj: has 9 top tricks now and will make 2 overtricks I think when @SQ drops doubleton and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead will then be up to 40|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This was much to lose with either the Q or T play. If he guesses right then he has an entry that opps will eventually give him.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|lml: he needs the entry then so he can play hearts .. not sure a late entry is that good|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He needed 33@hs i think. the late entry for @cs was just as a good|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lml: if he plays hearts from his hand he has to lose 2 hearts, a club, 2 spades and 2 trump no matter what|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: many of these conventional bid can help defence - either with a dbl or a pass |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm great lead - maybe|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean 11?|pg||
nt|lml: the negative double kept the heart suit out|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: waiting for play atm. he's thinking|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: at one time that would have been a 2@H overcall, too much defense and too thin suits for Michaels|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if he pitches a @S from hand, can't he get 12?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes he can but main considerations is not losing a diamond|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|copeyj: more pain for Robinson's team|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: ouch for robinson -welland on form|pg||
nt|copeyj: nothing they could do here - just an outstanding lead|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: defence need to play clubs early|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|lml: this looks like a push|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I prefer this way; you show 10 cards, not 5 & texture is only a problem sometimes |pg||
nt|tejjyid: this looks like a trump squeeze materialising|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: Michaels is for optimists...|pg||

nt|daman: just a routine push|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S doubled would have been interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: maybe more defensible if you play specific 2 suiters, that's true|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: again we see an 11 point special|pg||
nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this first session|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: north in the spotlight again|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bobh1: and roy will have to restrain himself|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|tejjyid: EW will be regretting 109 & 110 right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes mere mortals may sniff a slam|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|copeyj: this looks like a not so exciting 4@S unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D was a decent sac|pg||
nt|copeyj: sure it was 500 against 620|pg||
nt|copeyj: worth finding but not a big deal in scheme of things|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps is manna when you trail by 50|pg||
nt|copeyj: true!|pg||
nt|ady: can get home    but if a spade is led and dducked  defence can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This tank can only help N/S here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: investigating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although I think they were booked to lose on those at this table becasue of the other table results, but not as much as 25|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we are not stuck on this play|pg||
nt|lml: I have to leave you all now.  Dont get unto too much trouble|pg||
nt|daman: later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thank you|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|bobh1: just guessing but it seems all of roy's bids are transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wish we knew what this auction meant|pg||
nt|ady: needs to take first trick if either diamond or spade led  to be sure of making   not easy|pg||
nt|daman: this is not as good as 4@S  especially if the defnese finds time to play @Hs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: yes that is most likely bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@D by E might have had a shot until doug's double|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT can be held to 9 tricks on a @H lead I think     having said that.....EW would lose an IMP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It can still be held to 9|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: specs   the world knows 3NT can be held to 9 on a low @C back|pg||
nt|daman: North might play the @C King and cross his fingers|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: 1C-1S=art. GF - a spec informs me|pg||
nt|ady: just been pointed out 9 tricks   assuming of course get clubs right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: transfer then second suit should be looking for best game not a slam try, apparently cohler thinks otherwise|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: maybe North is thinking about the @D suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: the dbls have warned e/w off|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: not in 3NT  the dizzy heights of 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a low spade is safest lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it would be nice tobe abale to try forslam and stop in eiterh 4NT or 5@C though - you can see whay Cohler likes his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My feeling is that the jump to6@C has bit twice though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: so, maybe 4@D was the bid that goaded West onwards|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|daman: no way|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h2|nt|daman: did he do that Dan?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: 4@D ok, 4@S way too much|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: oposite a limited hand (NT opening) perhapsEast has the responsibility to slow things down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|copeyj: So we are coming to our last board|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfg: He did it|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: right, it's not the worst slam youve been in when you are 40 behind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think they mostly bid this slam because trailing|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm not sure what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Though 4NT = 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|daman: a better auction with 3334      would be 1@C - 2NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: diamond ace lead for me|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: seems more realistic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or maybe a @S, try & build a 3rd trick|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

nt|daman: see you soon|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: or, maybe it won't - how many down is this?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Everyone left again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||

nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if whales can swim anywhere anytime, why not bridge players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imagin if every 8 board match you played was decided by 3 imps - you'd have no nervous system left|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I actually gave up opening balanced 11's after 20 years, butthen I gave up altogether soon afterwrds, 'cos I never gotany openign hands..|pg||
