nt|iceking: hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Even playing 14-16 NT I would open 1@D in N|pg||
nt|iceking: not my style either open hands like these 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: no @S-stop, no @H-stop and bad @C-stop :)|pg||
nt|iceking: its like Helgemo Hellness they open 1nt everytime they can it seems|pg||
nt|iceking: Hurd will probably duck this for control he can always play for drop later in the play|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT : only a red lead bring it home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I'm trying to get the computer in another room on the internet - so I didn't see the play here. Will enter score as soon as I can|pg||
mc|7|nt|iceking: so we didnt get to see the play Hurd did fine end 2 down was a ugly spot|pg||

nt|ralfwil: goo9d evening everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 nt looks better than anything else |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|bobh1: wolfson stayed out of the auction...a very good move|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty decent spot, but not necessarily as these cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on a finess on NS|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome to round 2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents quiet, they're unlikely to be able to find it.  |pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder what E is thinking about?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: don't know but she is thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: not slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but bid it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Cheri -- welcome specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the 2nd of 8 15-bd segments for this quarter final match|pg||
nt|cherilou: Wolfson has started strong but there are still 90 boards to play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 105 to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: a rather intimate group at this table :)  |pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: apparently yes she is thinking of slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two philosophies about transfers over 1@c - show a 4-card major first in a weakish hand, or show the long minor first|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry -- lost my connection but we didn't miss anything.  Garner thinking|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play basic 2/1 std carding, EW Precision with additional gadgets|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: Is that kickback (RKC in @H?)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobh1: doesnt seem like her partner can have 3 kcs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: why not -- isn't she unlimited?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west, I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i guess you're right forgot that E reversed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfc: obviously she expected more from 3@H (not 4@H)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: not the first choice of contracts maybe, but might make |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: but that lead and down it goes|pg||
nt|peachy: System declaration for EW here http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=800&pid=458|pg||
nt|peachy: rather aggressice this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very vanilla -- straight down the middle for NS;  EW play Precision (Meckwell lite as they say)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: did well to find 3N in other room|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: figured S would pitch the K  try to discourage continuation |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not a good hand for upside down carding -- w/ old fashioned carding, the 3 would be clearly a singleton|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he has the entries to make this hand now that I look at it  |pg||
nt|peachy: Donn in the hot seat now|pg||
nt|sybarra: think about the 5 nt bid,  is that with stiff K of @D? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he can ruff a heart, play clubs twice, overtaking cash the 3rd club, cash the @DT and get back to dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  A quiet start to this segment|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: 4@H by west over 2@H, "fast arrival," I guess would require east to always have either 4@H or 3@S.  Is that absolute in their style?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfc: garner:  "don't think too hard"|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cherilou: Hi Joe! We have a great vugraph operator with us|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|peachy: Would S bid NT with stiff K|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome Paul|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|mdgraham: and yet, in a way, it's good for your team to have an opponent spend mental energy needlessly - so why tell him the hand is a pianola? |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: big swing as first hand |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sure, it was in partner's suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but N bid NT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|mc|8|nt|othered1: finding 3N wasn't all that tough after south overcalled 1@H in CR.|pg||

nt|iceking: 10 tricks in 1nt in closed room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asking about spot card leads - if 4+ clubs, Ten is Rusinow; if 3 or fewer, it's standard (I think)|pg||
nt|iceking: thats a lot looking at this layout|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|peachy: welcome back to segment 4 of this quarterfinal march|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the cards ain;t worth a dime, if you don;t lay 'em down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT (and sometimes with real clubs, of course)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi Cheri|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Interesting to see that both these pairs are playing a short 1@c with transfer responses ... more common in Europe than the USA in my experience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs here open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT and play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfc: we are having a little trouble getting started -- will be live soon|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Joe, and Joe our operator :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2 Joes, how lucky can you get?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 3 @S now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm, strange contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: some would overcall 1S with N hand too|pg||
nt|paulg:  What a position for East .. having to bid his better minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nightmare for E to respond to that double|pg||
nt|cherilou: N's pass alerted to show less than 3@S. Common treatment in the US.|pg||
nt|sybarra: weak |pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|santyclz: I suspect Joe is just catching us up and the auction was 1@s p 1nt p 2@h p 2@s ppp.|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play down-the-middle 2/1, std carding.  EW card a little more complex, here http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=755&pid=71|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all|pg||
nt|ritong: hi|pg||
nt|ybob: on last hand @C lead was -1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Welcome to the 2nd half of the 120-board quarter match|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that I can just type faster than Joe *when* he is also entering the bidding|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least it's @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushing them right to slam?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|glen: risk/reward of 1@S overcall is not good opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  When he is given the chance Richter should put about 5 Pass cards on the tray|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: can W find the killing @d lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the NS responses to 1@c (at the 1-level, anyway) seem remarkably like what I play with one of my partners  |pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@C will make but E is never going to cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and the torture continues|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: doesnt 6 @H make? |pg||
nt|peachy: this maybe is a little inferior, if we go resulting only|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 3N isn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are frozen so 4C is a making sve on a squeeze i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same bid in both rooms -- better than 4@H -- shows what they open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 1@s from N alerted as S didn´t support with a 4-card suit?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cherilou: 3NT also because can't get to dummy to finesse @C|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|cherilou: gasping pass here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT could be "non-serious" slam interest, in case responder now wants to cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c very popular in England now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but should be alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one spade denied a 4-cd major (I was catching up and didn't get the alert in and it's too late once the auction ends)|pg||
nt|paulg:  and now he gets to play it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: auction inother room also interesting|pg||
nt|cherilou: this will go quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: a heartfelt "thank you partner"|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: Goren never bid hearts, AFAIK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: ok|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: john swanson remarks that 3N as a minimum slam try is VERY minimum|pg||
nt|swanson: It's about as non-serious as one can get.|pg||
nt|bobh1: personally i like to be able to play 3N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably alerted - 4+@D, if the last deal is anything to go by|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: transfer response to 1@C for both pairs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and NS open pretty much any 11 count (not sure about EW)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must finess in @d now and I can only see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, N bid 1@s with 4@s 6@d on board 1|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Richter:  "which cue bid I am going to pass"|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|swanson: It would be an unusual hand that wanted to declarer 3NT with an 8-card fit and a side suit raised.|pg||
nt|swanson: major fit|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c9|mc|10|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: should Wooldridge take another action here|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|iceking: its little dangerous, he should know his pd has 5+@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: good @S suit H all over the place so Meck gambled on game |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|pelu: nice game - until u see @Ss 5-0|pg||
nt|iceking: very good spot but it will not have a happy ending |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iceking: so 2 down little unlucky|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell close to claim 9 tricks, but :(:(|pg||
nt|iceking: its true 3nt is not that good spot on like @H lead or @C lead, but after 2@D overcall you do often get @D lead |pg||
pc|c8|pc|dQ|nt|iceking: This is a qualifier for Bermuda Bowl, the winner of this event will be USA2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Sigurbjörn (bessi)|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|iceking: USA1 is Levin and co|pg||
nt|iceking: welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk3: iceking and bessi2 are partners in the Iceland Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good luck to them!|pg||
nt|iceking: Zagorin in closed room took another view and passed 2nt|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3 imps probably to Bathurst|pg||
nt|bessi2: which was a very reasonable position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: USA1 for the Bermuda Bowl is the Fleisher team, who won last year's USBC - Marty Fleisher-Michael Kamil, Bobby Levin-Steve Weinstein, Chip Martel-Lew Stansby|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "Are spades 5-0?" Hurd: "yes" Rodwell: "okay, down 2"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|glen: nope|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: Aker team has to right the ship|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: In a match this close, 1 imp lost (had @D split 2-2) could be critical.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is natural but promises an unbalanced hand ... seems appropriate|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer responses to 1@D also it looks like|pg||
nt|paulg:  I expect 1NT is a game-forcing relay .. and then we'll be guessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cherilou: Howard's wondering........|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play similar methods myself, but there are many different ways of doing the relay responses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1@D is unbalanced hand, usually 5 diamonds unless 4 X 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bathurst might get optimistic here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|swanson: 4@S is a good save here except N-S can't make 4@H.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now Goren bids the hts and it doesnt make |pg||
nt|ritong: no, he stays disciplined|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: he can t be sure about the sixth @s|pg||
nt|ybob: 3NT lost by 5/0 @S|pg||
nt|ybob: @H lead defeat too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|peachy: Some consistency :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: i have a different definition of a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: Give south credit for putting it to them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wolfson thought pass was forcing |pg||
nt|ritong: bathurst frowns  smile will be back after @s K|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bobh1: good thing he did or he would lose 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment, 2@H there showing spade support|pg||
nt|cherilou: seems all is natural now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: what would he do with x  KJ109xx QJx xxx I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish he played differently I'd guess :)|pg||
nt|cherilou: oops--not now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe they play weak jump shifts. That can impact many other sequences|pg||
nt|santyclz: 8 tricks are easy, 9 needs to find the @hq.|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer cannot relinquiosh the lead at all, so making depends on finding H Q|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c showed shortage, will Richter try to show the void now|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is a break |pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of |pg||
nt|peachy: Aker needed some luck, but I dont quite understand playing a second club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherilou: responses to this type of KC vary by partnership when a X occurs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: still has a lot to do |pg||
nt|peachy: Still, not enough to let it make, Goren was counting on too many covers in partner's hand|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks like Richter is concerned about a heart lead and is hoping to hear a confirmatory redouble showing first-round control?|pg||
nt|cherilou: often pass shows 0--but not by their methods|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: but he still has to find an eight trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|glen: personally, on these hands where the high card points are split, say 18-22, long term forcing passes will not be a net plus|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ybob: no way |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|peachy: pesky J10, to give him option to do it either way :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down and Bathurst and Katz writing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wondering if EW play equal level conversion (might he have doubled with hearts and long diamonds)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: can't see the answer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bathurst has seen two heart discards so may look for a 2nd trick inthat sjuit|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least ended up in right spot |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I could not see what the late round auction shows|pg||
nt|cherilou: play will be fast again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker thought no Key Cards, but it was "no heart control" by agreement -- that's what they said after the auction but why 5@H if not KC?|pg||
nt|ritong: a @s now forces the 9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: then a @h|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|swanson: On this particular hand, South would double 4@S even if his partner's pass was not forcing.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: Still looks short of the right number|pg||
nt|ritong: more or less hi mark|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea, of course, is to force them to open the @cs without having too many tricks to lose|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If S plays @sJ, I´m convinced that N will have a @s trick on the @sQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  5@h is the bid of a man who does not trust his memory|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|peachy: EW do not have weak two in diamonds available, even if E might otherwise consider it|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure it is the right time for a semi pstch, with both opps passed|pg||
nt|ritong: psych*|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: yes, if no KC then missing @S A and @D K--only 5@D should be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is a hand where transfer responses are very useful|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: not sure how they play it  given their system,  should be weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||
nt|swanson: The bidding in the other room was a bit exuberant.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not a bad move by West|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||
nt|swanson: 4-5-2-2 hands are not pleasant to bid without Mr. Flannery's convention.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this one is kinda good for Mr F|pg||
nt|santyclz: Richter is playing with Aker, I beleive.|pg||
nt|ybob: -200|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  as Richter can continue with a constructive 2@s having shown his values|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  and heart length|pg||
nt|ritong: some would consider 1NT as completely mandatory|pg||
nt|ritong: since pard can have 14 or so|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes and also a hand where not opening 1NT with S hand gives EW bidding room|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzfc: 14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|paulg:  the flipside being that you prevent the opponents getting into trouble, as happened at the other table|pg||
nt|ybob: another low @S now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|swanson: Usually played as 11-15.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, West can infer some spade shortage with partner (not 100%), so it is not automatic - but I would do it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chessmaste: South can make a suit preference signal with this spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||
nt|swanson: But a 2@S rebid after partner's forcing 1NT is unattractive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes you need some kind of gazzilli to really show the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice escape.  Not going to make, but not doubled.  Still a minus on top of the -200 in CR will give Wofson a handy lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. I think W should play @dQ on @dA. N cannot have a 5-card @d, so It cannot be dangerous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can make now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: work OK to play the queen when partner has the jack, but might cause underlead otherwise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult to know what to play from Qx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherilou: but NS will go plus here so it all worked out fine. Look at that open room result|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A low club now and North has to get it right - looks easy enough|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|bobh1: opening 1N is another option|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  although the auctions look similar, there is a huge difference as it was a Precision 1@c in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  so East was not tempted to bid ...|pg||
nt|cherilou: both tables opened 1@C --difference was E's action|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: That's sick|pg||
nt|othered1: with a 5 loser hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: thanks! :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|glen: i think Roland would prefer the F word|pg||
nt|paulg:  here 1@c could be a weak notrump, so the West 1@s overcall is wide-ranging and East has to bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|swanson: Strange to me that North didn't double 1NT after his partner and West decided 1@S was not going to work for E-W.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: Maybe, but Es double tells a lot. W has @cQ and E not the other top honours, so how defeat?|pg||
nt|peachy: Good try, just didnt work|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: I would have pitched a @D  why not?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|peachy: not sure it matters|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfc: having played the @D2, pitching a diamond would have looked like he started withw doubleton|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cherilou: I think E should always bid when transfer responses are available. Get to show 5@H's some support and cards|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|glen: agreed John, since 1NTX making is not that bad a minus, and there could be a big plus in X|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  people bid too well if you leave them alone, in my experience|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
mb|2S|nt|swanson: Cohen makes another very conseravitve bid of a single raise.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think wolfson is bidding very conservatively|pg||
nt|swanson: Is South trying for game or slam?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N is a good spot on this one|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe thinking 3N might be better than 4@S.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Modern bridge:  everybody bids, then everybody passes.|pg||
nt|ritong: creative 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: astute bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: An overbid on these cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when asked about the pass of the X, S shrugged, N said strong|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@h certaiçnly denies 4@s|pg||
nt|ritong: so north offers a 4/3 fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|cherilou: S should get to 7 tricks here even with @D blockage|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: exactly, 2NT might be a try to get to 3NT on some hands|pg||
nt|glen: however 3NT directly over 2@S could be choice of games|pg||
nt|glen: specs note 6NT makes if you guess well|pg||
nt|peachy: Declarer's spade suit is a little fragile|pg||
nt|ritong: but south rejects|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I think he was flirting with 3NT, not suggesting spades as a place to play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  it does not always work, of course, and then you hear the more conservative people talk about not taking space, poor suit, insufficient values ... but it is a bidder's game|pg||

nt|glen: sad he plans to miss the worlds if the team Qs|pg||
nt|othered1: south took a "safety play" in trumps and got tapped down before the 4th @H could be set up.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 1N will make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good fit here |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it is not really practical to play that double by North guarantees four hearts, so South has a tough call over 2@s  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so Goren trying to hide his hand have pard transfer into major |pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect 4 @D says bid your major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: apologies for connection problems|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfc: Goren asking how many spades are there?  Donn: "easier to count the others"|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer has a problem with entries, so he might start with @c 10|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  4@h is a big bid when non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|cherilou: I think W should raise---4 trump plus not a minimum |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and raise he did!|pg||
nt|peachy: At 2S, no sweat|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|santyclz: A good hand to go for a little more caffeine...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they came to bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: they sure did|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might play the spades right with that lead but no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: if he knows the lead was not from KQ -- not sure how they lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cherilou: I think 3 was sufficient--E would take it to game. Often 2@H is bid with 5+ @H's and a stretch.........|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: curious, in a way, that no-one doubled. Perhaps the pairs are still feeling each other out - like the first few rounds of a boxing contest|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: good boy, nick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: and when W can see @hA, @hK and @sA on S, odds that @dQ is on N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: low trump?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: this is probably the best defence. a small trumph will W win on his hand and play a @c|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so easy, but a winning line is  a @d to @dA and a @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W could have taken the imps by doubling 4@h, trusting on partners 3@s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a diamond back would make things very awkward|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: threatening diamond ruff would be good -- NS play standard C & A (except upside down discards)so N can't be sure of the diamond distribution|pg||
nt|mdgraham: N taking his time, justifiably|pg||

mb|3D|nt|chessmaste: This type of deal suits a team ahead by 40 odd IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: 32-0 this set, and NS will just try to keep it on the fairway|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is probably takeout of spades, showing a hand he'd wished that he'd opened|pg||
nt|peachy: 1H is transfer to S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: in fact 6@c is quite good - solid if trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 6 clubs isn't so bad (but not today)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I reckon around 800 - but tricks sometimes go astray in this type of situation|pg||
nt|ritong: "a bunch" was a bit exagerrated by me|pg||
pc|c4|nt|swanson: If Cohen had passed, Levin would have doubled 1@S, showing a trap pass of 1@D.|pg||
nt|othered1: double pretty much says east had a penalty double of 1@D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|peachy: With minimum and 3card spades, opener would accept transfer|pg||
nt|peachy: I think thats how the script goes, anyway :)|pg||
nt|ritong: will be either +3 or -5 for zagorin|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|swanson: She will pass or bid 2NT here; not much percentage in doubling 2@S.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all up to North really - depends what view he takes of his trumps |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c should really set clubs, so 4@s should be a cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: why is N thinking? Can S still have the big type hand?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that anyone is thinking here|pg||
nt|paulg:  normally 1@s would deny a big balanced hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein thought it was Garner's lead  -- like me, he missed the 3@H bid and was thinking over 2@S by Garner|pg||

pc|h7|nt|santyclz: 12th trick is a problem.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|sybarra: diamong K or spd thru |pg||
nt|sybarra: cohen sorting ojut whether they can beat it|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: note the auction in the other room (same except 2@S was doubled)|pg||

nt|ritong: now down four is the maximum|pg||
nt|ybob: J@H is the best now|pg||

nt|bobh1: kind of surprising if W likes her hand that she bid her suits out of order|pg||
nt|paulg:  it all came down to whether he thought East was 4414 or 4315 ... i don't really see why he should get it right|pg||

nt|bobh1: win the @H K and play a low @C but maybe she's thought too long for that to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that is what she did|pg||
nt|swanson: The only hope for declarer is 3 heart tricks.  The defense could err because East did not make a negative double and will expect only a three card heart holding.|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't that work (low @C from dummy trick 2) if you guess the @C position next round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't the @H8 give the count?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think @h play is att with the T|pg||
nt|glen: another plan is wait for larry to fall asleep|pg||
nt|swanson: Levin has to win the @HK and lead a low club to give herself any chance I believe.  But South is going to shift to a diamond, which is a killer.|pg||
nt|glen: so everybody likes the @C Q at trick 2?|pg||
nt|glen: after winning @H K|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  awkward hand for West|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when opponents are in game as well|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bobh1: so how did she play it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe my crashing caused problems.  she won @HK and played a small club to Cohen's K; he returned a heart, Levin ducked, and wolfson played another club, locking her in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: danger will robinson lol|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: 3nt or 4@s - what´s your choise Mike?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: 3NT on Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: so Levin lost a club, a heart, two diamonds and two spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays |pg||
nt|sybarra: wolfson bidding 2 @H anyway |pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w red, that may be the end of their bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: a push board now !!|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mdgraham: Saturdays are for cricket |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@D is 6 spades with either good suit and good hand OR bad suit and bad hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: ok so she didnt actually tank at trick 1|pg||
nt|peachy: This Dbl likely just "cards"|pg||
nt|peachy: ie. a good overcall|pg||

mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfc: not very long|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT presumably good/good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I just tried to figure out saturdays contract, but you gave me the solution:)|pg||

nt|peachy: Ok, a little less excitement then :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

nt|peachy: Not to mention the kibitzers who pay such amounts of money to come and watch|pg||
nt|peachy: I think it was Jan Martel (sry if this is misquote) who ance said: Opearator is like a loongtailed cat in a room full of rocking rockingchairs|pg||

mb|1H|nt|cherilou: I do not think it is so automatic when the suit was opened on our left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: note Donn's @HTen lead in OR|pg||
nt|cherilou: he's a good partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a slam for n/s |pg||
nt|peachy: Those who might want to spy on both tables at the same time, here is the link http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|paulg:  the @h10 is clever|pg||
nt|peachy: NS system gasic 2/1|pg||
nt|peachy: *basic|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: third-in-hand....1@C?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 1@c in third hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you were faster Mike!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe because 1@C is any balanced hand, so may not have clubs so the adv a standard pair would have by opening 1@c IN 3rd is reduced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even 3@C, if you are feeling frisky|pg||
mb|3S|an|shortness|nt|paulg:  i wonder if East will balance with a double?|pg||
nt|peachy: sry all, frequent typos, ugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that's true enuff|pg||
nt|peachy: 1C=clubs or balanced. If balanced any shape in minors 12-14 or 18-bad 20.|pg||
mb|3N|an|OK hand for slam|nt|chessmaste: 3@S shortage|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|swanson: The diamond overcall is a pathetic trick-taking hand, but it gets the lead and obstructs the opponents bidding.|pg||
nt|swanson: South passed hoping East doesn't take a lot of overtricks - little does he know.|pg||
nt|peachy: Probably little welcome relief for the Aker team, this slam loos esy enough to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure what that was about|pg||
nt|santyclz: Undo?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: not sure to get it|pg||
mb|5H|nt|Vugraphzfc: garner: "they are after us"|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: in this case perhaps will go for a number against nothing|pg||
nt|cherilou: everyone's actions on this board are entirely reasonable yet NS will lose 5 or 9 imps|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks a lot closer to making on a non-diamond lead|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bobh1: i agree hard to pass especially at favorable|pg||
nt|santyclz: Missed an initial pass|pg||
nt|peachy: Initial Pass maybe missing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: now they don't get a @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  except that you might prefer to pitch a spade and take the (losing) club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Declarer is up to 6 tricks.  Time to play notrump.|pg||
nt|ritong: but hey|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: somehow you get the feeling that this should have been avoidable, but maybe it's just one of those things|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: certainly would have been different is either E had opened 1@C in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe, after the double, 3@D should be natural  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they were unsure; Weinstein said "if this comes up again we should play our 2@C defense" presumably what they play when regular Stayman is doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now...what do EW lead from (1) four small (2) three small |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and does South have Q10 or Q10x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Richter is thinking, so he is apparently not sure that W has 4 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: would he play the ten from QTx?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: <scotty> points out that S might have Q10x, wanting E to cash the king and cut himself off from West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: @HQ led in other room after a similar auction (with different bids :))|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@d is probably a 5-card suit, so count the tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important for South to maintain a passive demeanour here |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: without the double S would bid 3@D on any hand without a good 5-cd major -- this situation is undiscussed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know some Souths who would be berating their partners as soon as dummy went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down now and Richter asking Weinstein questions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if S has 3343 - shouldn´t he pass on 3@c dbl?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they had not discussed how the double changes things (if at all) in this auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd that an experienced NS pair would have no agreements over NT sequence doubles like this ones|pg||
nt|cherilou: this @H K lead I like|pg||
nt|cherilou: quite a tight match here--9 imps largest swing|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: probably nick has a subtle inference which gurantees the @d control|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Whenyou bid a slam already bid in the other room you always deserve a pat on the back|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|othered1: 2@D does use up space, but that @H holding is a real negative|pg||
nt|paulg:  Richter thinking about a heart or club switch|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|cherilou: and only 5 of the 11 boards with imps|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|bobh1: turns out larry should have given him a @H ruff|pg||
nt|paulg:  i dislike this tank now .. he should have thought about this before switching to a heart|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cherilou: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  @s10? That's a high card to pitch|pg||

nt|bessi2: complicated hand to play|pg||
nt|bessi2: just happy it isnt me who has to play it|pg||

nt|paulg:  he invested 200 points to make 570, so taking a 50% finesse very reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and still no plus scores for NS|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: or at least it looks easy from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: not easy, I don't think, to bid but 4@S seemed like Cohen was still play a big club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Solid suit with extras, I dont think 4S can be systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Par here is for E-W to save at 6@C - off 300 versus -650 defending 5@H.|pg||
nt|ritong: i have to admit i would cowardly check it, though|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|peachy: I like splinter with opener's hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Sorry, got the vulnerability reversed.  Have to sell to 5@H.|pg||
nt|peachy: W follows the current theory to strive to respond|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: deduced from not @s AKQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: and nothing in clubs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: After their 1M opening (natural), system is less complicated at least in the early rounds|pg||
nt|peachy: and with weak hands|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|paulg:  I'd have doubled with the South hand, recognising that this would help East play the hand in this instance|pg||
nt|paulg:  (doubled 1@h that is)|pg||
nt|cherilou: with the @H K on side he doesn't need to guess @C's|pg||

nt|sybarra: agree, that was why I withdrew my comment|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|cherilou: yes--he sure could go wrong here .........|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein would have opened with the ace of clubs in addition to what he has shown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they open almost all 11 counts|pg||
nt|paulg:  however, if they was ever a time not to open an 11 count it would be second in hand, vul against not|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfc: I like this hand more than Wolfson does|pg||
nt|paulg:  an opportunity missed by NS, although in their defence they did not know that declarer has misplayed the hand|pg||
nt|ritong: 12 tricks is a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the tables aren't linked apparently; wolfson is in good shape|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure its dinner yet|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chessmaste: Although there are still 46 deals after this one it is clear Nickell is going  to have to work hard to advance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: now if west opened 2NT, @ss were hidden and that explains this |pg||
mb|3H|an|spades|nt|ritong: sexy gadget|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 4@H probably shows specifically a 6-bagger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: apparently the tables got disconnected -- maybe someone can find the scores for us from the other table|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe with a singleton...not sure...can tell you it is not a sign-off|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: k, I think you are right, late dinners in this schedule, but break srill a nice things|pg||
nt|santyclz: But then, I keep thinking this is the last segment, but it's only the 1/2-way mark.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure how many diamond can (should make here)  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there is a break between segments 2 and 3 each day.  We finish by 8:30 or so local time each day|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: i suspect the  Koach is involved|pg||
nt|ritong: the koach is eric kokish, a remarkable player and, as his nick suggests, a top coach|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@H showed spades; 4@H was "a safety play in the bidding [in case Katz forgot]"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: When I can´t set up any suit on my hand, I´ll try to find my partners, so a @h lead for me|pg||
nt|paulg:  hands like the last one are the real bonus of having BBO vugraph ... we see all the good and bad plays|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so a great late cocktails and dinner |pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|chessmaste: I'll ask him in Toronto|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 3@S could be @H´s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  3@d a lot better contract than 3@c, but will not make any more tricks today|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfc: Katz was planning to bid 3N over the expected 3@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: Y'all agree with 4S by East?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4 more segments tomorrow.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: a bit frisky |pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: He changed horses in the middle of the stram, if it was a 2S bid, stick with that evaluation|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: *stream|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cherilou: next hand is the last for this set--will have a 1 hour 20 minute break then back for 2 more sets today.|pg||
nt|sybarra: but where were n/s going to play?|pg||
nt|peachy: maybe landed in 5D, oe 4D at least|pg||
nt|sybarra: with void in @D maybe he was afraid of 5 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: (making)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|peachy: Yes, the match is close enough to be interesting|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: not saying it would make, but he might think it would  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: declarer showing his hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cherilou: Thanks to Joe--great to hear what's happening at the table and thanks Paul for your commentary.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  thanks Cheri, great job Joe|pg||

nt|peachy: We'll soon see what other table thinks of those cards|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: slam is awful, but it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: last hand. well done Joe |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the commentators and to the specs -- we'll start the next segment soon |pg||
nt|peachy: before dark, if we are lucky :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good time to overbid|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mdgraham: EW have missed a couple of chances this set, but the deficit is manageable still|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  good luck with the rest of the day, my bed will be calling before you restart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: board is backward on the table -- so east is west and south is north, etc, and my job is very had for this one :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The trouble is after 1NT you fear wasted values in spades|pg||
mb|r|nt|swanson: In the Cohen version of Jacoby 2NT, 4@H shows a minimum, but no singleton.  I suppose South though his lack of high cards was compensation for the singleton.|pg||
nt|ritong: on an other planet, katz would get redoubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: We give special applause to BBO for putting on this great show--Roland for all his organization and of course to all the spectators!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chessmaste: Now we might have some fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: this is a different Stayman sequence than it appears but I don't know what it is -- some kind of Puppet I suspect|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, thanks to Jan Martel of USBF for organizing the vugraph of this great event, and to Roland Wald, our tireless BBO vugraph coordinator.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: 10 min left the director annouces|pg||
nt|peachy: They dont have Stayman at all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  you have my permission to give North a good slap for misplacing the board on the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@H was mixed raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  4@s is a big bid from Aker opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: from Richter, actually|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like it--don't want to defend 4@H when we have 9 @S|pg||
nt|peachy: 2C forces 2D, then describe|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't understand the bidding here.  Maybe I'm just too tired.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|peachy: Also thanks to Joe Stokes for excellent operator job!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going to be another swing for aker, to make the match quite close|pg||
nt|cherilou: EW will gain 9 on this board and close the margin to 10 with 90 boards to go.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and not last |pg||
nt|peachy: 2D was forced|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: last board! Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Ralf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the first of 8 15-bd segments for this match:  60 boards today and 60 tomorrow|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: thx Joe,  great job as always, (I miss being there) |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|swanson: Board 117 where E-W went for 300 was a loss.  N-S were evidently minus 100 at the other table.|pg||
nt|cherilou: N can get 2 @C ruffs.....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Garner, who actually holds the North hand, must feel a little uncomfortable to let two passed hands play in 4@s undoubled |pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Raija,  always fun to comment with you |pg||
nt|peachy: Fabulous job, Jow|pg||
nt|peachy: Joe|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs, for your comments and inputs,  we appreciate them |pg||
pc|h6|nt|swanson: Congratualtions to the Wolfson team.  The heavy underdog Silverstein team put up a great battle for the first 7 sessions.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chessmaste: I know some pairs play that as being for money - but they would have 5 diamonds. They would pass with four and North redoubles to play |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing for the club ruffs is very dangerous, as partner may have the @cK and you let the contract make|pg||
nt|cherilou: but his partner pre-empted and he has 2 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i'm sure he is uncomfortable defendingk, but not clear he think he can beat 4@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: This might make some sense if 2@h shows the majors rather than just @ss.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: ouch - don't think he can make it now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: special thanks to Jan Martel,  who organizes the vugraph at his great even |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cherilou: for sure---S has VERY heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was described as a mixed raise, so 4 trumps plus a card outside|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry I missed that|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  thanks all, have fun later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I missed some of the play -- it is surprisingly disorienting (at least for me) for the play to go counterclockwise relative to what I have on the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks again all -  back in a little over an hour|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks again--come on back and join us in 80 minutes. Bye.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: result on that last board was -2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: spade and a club to lose|pg||

nt|peachy: Yes, I need them badly!|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But South wanted to show the diamond control - nothing wrong with that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
