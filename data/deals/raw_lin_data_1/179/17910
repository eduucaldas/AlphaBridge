nt|Walddk4: Good evening to Michael Askgaard|pg||
nt|jcmax: 7@D looks like a great contract, but is likely to go down, because of the bad @H break. It could be made by squeezing N in @H and @S. But who would play for that?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's true that they can't bid a grand slam in diamonds if no one bids them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you bid 2@S or 2@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is game-forcing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But over 2NT then?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Still no 3@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Henner asks about leads and signals. Rodwell: "we play A from AK, upside down attitude, count & suit preference, and suit preference in trumps"|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|askgaard: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|jcmax: Wow! Lots of long suits here, but no "real" fit.|pg||
nt|jcmax: The most solid fit is in @D....Can anyone get to 7@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|askgaard: Would be a spectacular grand|pg||
nt|askgaard: Against odds though|pg||
nt|jcmax: Agree. But it's the kind of thing we love to see on BBO! :)|pg||
nt|askgaard: It would need spades 3-2 and diamonds 3-3 or @dTx, since declarer has to overtake the diamonds to draw trumps|pg||
nt|jcmax: Let's put it this way: If you have to bid a grand slam on this hand it should be in @D, definitely your best bet.|pg||
nt|askgaard: Perhaps @s4-1 and @d 3-3 is ok also|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzfe: writing by Katz to Chan|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: both Nickell and Lee are waving their hands|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Katz is pulling on his day old beard|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|vugraphzfe: no explanation on the 5 clubs|pg||
nt|jcmax: I assume that East's 4@S bid is not fast arrival here. the fast arrival principal says: when I jump to game, I have the worst hand possible.|pg||
nt|jcmax: another school dictates to jump to game in game-forcing auctions to show extras or specifically good trumps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: katz asked if chan had bid and he said yes I think I have five pass cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: katz reaches for bids and then pulls hand back|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|jcmax: He probably is wondering whether he should even bother asking for the trump queen. it is diffcutl to imagine partner can have solid spades considering his 3@D bid over 2N|pg||
nt|askgaard: Yes, and if partner shows @sQ he would still be wondering if partner also has the 7th spade|pg||
nt|jcmax: But on the other hand it doesn't really cost anything to ask.|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Does 4@s guarantee 7-4?|pg||
mb|5S!|mb|p|nt|jcmax: I defintely think he must have 7 spades. If he had AKQxxx in spades surely he would have bid 3N over 3@H?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|askgaard: I think so too|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Nickell play the ace before you do anything else|pg||
nt|jcmax: I think it guarantees 7 cards in @S, but not necessarily 4 cards in @D, could be just values.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzfe: they said they would :) know its 9 just for the first phone ring and threat for slow play|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|jcmax: That is really interesting! S didn't double 1N with a balanced 17 count just 2 or 3 hands ago and now he doubles with a balanced 14 count?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe because he at least has 3-3 in the majors?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|askgaard: Definitely the reason, but double here is not clear|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|askgaard: The odds depends on partner's aggressivity with a five card major in the first bidding round, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcmax: I can't help thinking that he felt, it would have worled out better to bid something last time. And that's why he bid something this time.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|askgaard: If partner would have overcalled 1M with any excuse on a five carder, then there is not much to gain from doubling 1N|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent grand slam now, should be biddable|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|an|limit raise or better|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Only clubs 5-0 might defeat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that's not even a certainty. There could be a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asked Uday whether 2NT promised 4 spades and U said no|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|pelu: for sure I prefer 2Nt as GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think that Henner just explained to Rodwell that 3@h was Blackwood, not sure what the rest of the auction showed, but Uday just wrote SQ HK DK CK, so I guess that's what his bids ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: showed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If 3@H is Blackwood, what is 4@C then, cuebid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Everyone except Meck has run out of space on the bidding tray - he astutely put his passes close together and still has room for a few more rounds of bidding|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|5D|nt|jcmax: Sout holds basically a yarborough opposite a wea-two. will he be tempted to psyche siomthing knowing the opponents must be in the slam zone?|pg||
nt|askgaard: Back to junior style preempts|pg||

nt|askgaard: Tough for EW, let us see...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Nickell has his hands over his head|pg||
nt|jcmax: Imagine you hold 17 hcp in 4th seat and everybody has bid in front of you and your first opportunity to say something is on the 5-level!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan is writing in his system notes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and the vugraph operator is hungry|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: very sold pull of 6 diamonds|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzfe: Lee pulls out x card and nIckell laughs|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Wow, fresh, now east will bid 7|pg||
nt|jcmax: A spec suggests pass as forcing here. More and more partnerships these days play fewer and fewer passes as forcing. this is the rule I have learned: it's not forcing unless even ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: the bartender knows it's forcing.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|askgaard: 5@c is a very nice contract here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Big Yawn by Lee |pg||
nt|jcmax: If one's style is to raise to 2@S immediately, the delayed 2@S would only be a doubleton|pg||
nt|askgaard: For me, 2@h then 3@c would show a gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe w has upgraded his hand to a game forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: director keeps checking|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 20 minutes left in this segment|pg||
nt|askgaard: Maybe|pg||
nt|jcmax: Good intermediates and good support for partner's suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Katz says sorry and Chan says you have time and Lee says you have 20 minutes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcmax: Does anyone know what they are talking about? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lee is now pointing his finger back and forth over all of Nickell and Katz's bid  up in the air looks like he is directing an orchestra|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no|pg||
nt|jcmax: 4@H now sounds like a choice of games kind of bid. Partner, you decide which game to play.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: not sure who I am waiting on as Nickell has block the entire view of the board and most of Lee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Katz's eyes are closed looks like he is napping|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Chan has his baseball cap pulled down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Nickell has his chin in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry its so slow|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|askgaard: Maybe Katz is afraid of a 3-card suit in clubs with partner? Passing 4@s with this spade holding is unappetizing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: In the first segment they were slow now Lee opens curtain to check the time clock|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|askgaard: But I don't know what he is considering of course|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|vugraphzfe: Chan is out of pass cards so touches his green pass on the tray|pg||
mb|p|nt|askgaard: Ok the wheels have come off here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now Lee opens the curtain again to check time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now a director has arrived in the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Looks around|pg||
nt|askgaard: It is hard to know where it went wrong when we don't know the meaning of the bidding.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmm, it's not quite clear what, but something seems to have gone wroong in the EW machinery here. usually that is the case when one jumps to 6 something over 4NT. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: slow pull of the pass card by Katz and Nickell asks if the other table is finished|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: IF west has upgraded to a gameforcing hand, he has bid a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Katz thinks Nickell is 4 1 5 4|pg||
