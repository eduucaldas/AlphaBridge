nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good evening all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Good evening Victor and all friends:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hey guys|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We're starting now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this might have some action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back cognoscenti and junkies:)|pg||
nt|daman: 2NT - 3NT?   stayman?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: EW can make 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate the opening but it is welland's style|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome back, 15 boards to go in this marathon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ty operator:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the Nickell team had a big 2nd session- now they introduce a new pair - Zia-Hamman who always generate some excitement|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what their 2NT range is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They play transfer advances over a dbl here. So 2@h = > LR|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: from the alert it appears that NS have at least 2 ways to raise over a double, most likely a transfer back to H shows a better hand with fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is one tough event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi guys, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: against 5 diamonds South has to lead a club or diamond ace and club switch|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
nt|daman: welcome to the first session of the Round of 8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 lead     most pairs lead 2nd highest from a bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: this auction makes no sense unless a 2NT opener is 21-22|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell says 2N here is 18-19. He must have down graded|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT should fail but Zia not stopping|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: perhaps their system didnÂ´t find the @d fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the clue was that Haman did not bid 3NT at first opportunity|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right the twostep showed multiple places to play and/or slam interest|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|daman: one is not permitted to downgrade with 20|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: you have to maintain a level playing field as a courtesy to your teammates|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This is going to be an intense match. Bathurst needs a good set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: operator has put up S first name to save space...he is Joel Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club switch gives a chance since Hamman blocked spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a partner of mine when he was about 14:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Claimed d1 after drawing trumps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: what happened?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: players too fast for the operator!?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no drama - session start always a difficult time for operators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is a fair case for the trump ace lead, though it is a hard problem. to beat this partner will need an entry, so maybe look at dummy before you decide what to do|pg||
mb|2C|an|NF|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe may fall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E showed a lot of restriant here|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this plays better from south|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surely not 2S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: That's all he could be thinking about at this point|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: no way- 1nt?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hopefully this set they play a little faster|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dream on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell in the tank atm. He has coffee this set!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: young and fearless|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surprised by the lack of a -ve type X from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 honour cards and may as well have none|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: very friendly lie|pg||
pc|hA|nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (if it stops here)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is an excellent case for a low club lead on this auction|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I am not awake yet... it does play better from north|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer points out 2 down with c ruff|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||

nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS cashing in their optimism|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfg: And there it is|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tez: deep finesse experts:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
nt|tez: sry.private|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2S is probably OK at match points BUT against good opposition at teams it is not a good idea|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|copeyj: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265 for E/W|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/robinson-boydrrevision.pdf is the card for N/S|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: not an encouraging start for the trailing team when your opponents bring home a 22 point 3NT|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the upside is too low and the downside is too large|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: Specs agree with you MArtin|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: This won't turn out to be the most effective lead, but still will defeat thecontract|pg||

pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: if North was givng up on 3-3 @C, I don'tknow why he wouldn't cash the Ace 1st|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's gonna go for a @h exit I think|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||
nt|roswolf: another disto hand -the dealong computer is working overtime|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point ed|pg||
nt|ady: differencce in overcalling at the 1 level at this table|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: par here is 4@SD, down 1 or 2|pg||
nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: outlawed in many events isn't it?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well an easy pass by south|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: west will redbl?|pg||
nt|othered1: with those good trumps, t hat's quite a decision by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Martin Johnson|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and hi all|pg||
nt|daman: hi|pg||
nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|Walddk5: All Canuck team of commentators. Is that good or bad? :)|pg||
nt|lml: very very good|pg||
nt|lml: so do you balance as south?|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|lml: me neither but I am old|pg||
nt|daman: on Board 18|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall: "No double? Seamon: "Can we double now?" after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|ady: the heart bid from west not robust|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if 2nt asks suit, i ignore and bid 3@S with self sufficient 6|pg||
nt|daman: you don't look old :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It wouldn't be particularly harmful here though. You just have to know when to make the junior bid :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is 3@H enough after the X?|pg||
nt|daman: Roland is old|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobh1: cannot believe bramley's bidding|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the minor Q's lok like complete trash|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nah, 106|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 losers if you guess @C here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: I dontÂ´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: it could have been staymanic too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very odd auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I would X that with West just to discourage partner|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good evening to Magnus Magnusson|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Magnus|pg||
nt|iceking: hello|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 canadians here |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk5: Who is the 3rd?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this match reminds me of a 60's match, roth-stoners versus standard bidders|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|iceking: me|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best chance for defense is a low spade back to the nine|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iceking: just a little:)|pg||
nt|daman: you are Canadian?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S doesnt put up the jack he might hve a guess later|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if he thinks E has ace, i mean|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: north must think the world is crazy and lets e/w get on withir|pg||
nt|roswolf: with it|pg||
nt|lml: you are going to want to let the opponents play hearts for the max tricks here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: jack is right card of course but sometimes reflexes take over|pg||
nt|odysseus69: gain for Nickell when they played last in 4S rather than 5 clubs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: will locate the @CQ I think|pg||
nt|iceking: my grandfather moved to iceland from canada when he was 17 so iam like 1/8th canadian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you came to canada and paid the 25$ exit fee we count you as Canadian|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: When you open by agreement on hands that once would have been considered semi-psyches, your later bidding has to allow for it.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: and 2@h dbl is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: they were never going to x 2@h though Ralf|pg||
nt|copeyj: who was going to penalise that?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: on 78 3nt made in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: hoping  doubleton honor diamond with west|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ralfwil: there is always an option|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: most americans play sound weak 2s and therefore  i think declarer will play for the outside strength to be with east who did rdbl|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|daman: better to cash|pg||
nt|iceking: this tourney is such a grind |pg||
nt|daman: on 18   EW went 1 down in 5@D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfg: NS are going to have to break @hs here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: But with all the spots it doesn't matter who plays them|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: might be a double partscore swing |pg||
nt|daman: for 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|lml: so far opening light has got too good results|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|tejjyid: I think Joe's X says enough for Mike to hit 4@S, in my style anyway |pg||
nt|tejjyid: sorry, East's X|pg||
nt|tejjyid: for West...etc.|pg||
nt|daman: 3@D +3 at this table    6IMPs to Nickell|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: I think if west had chosen to duck that club than north would have been endplayed|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzfd: zia: leads during the hand are attitude, not length|pg||
nt|chip: This is a good hand for semi-forcing NT, otherwise hard to stop so low.|pg||
nt|chip: On this hand can afford to be in 2N since the cards are very friendly, but much nicer to be in 1N.|pg||
nt|chip: 9 is sort of an honor lead: if Declarer has ATx need to finesse the 10.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are many who scoff at the label "semi-forcing", likning it to "semi-pregnant". admittedly the nomenclature is not ideal, but it does have a non-fatuous meaning|pg||

nt|marlowepi: a roland slam, with unlucky outcome:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iceking: not a friendly hand for ew here|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: pass is ofcourse mistake he probably opened 1@D|pg||
mb|1N|an|semi|nt|copeyj: it wasn;t strength showing with three queens :)|pg||
nt|lml: as the cards lie 4@S east-west can go down|pg||

nt|tejjyid: Operator, could u check this auction please?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: it was. I fixed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: battle of part scores here|pg||
nt|copeyj: South will (I guess) bid 2@S showing a fit now?|pg||
nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprised no opening by roy as west -he must respect the colors some of the time|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx, sorry|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT = 2 places to play the hand|pg||
nt|daman: might hard to pass the North hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Might even be 3, it's a general t/o|pg||
nt|lml: here north will convert clubs to diamonds to clarify|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah, the system is lagging. So it's hard getting the right bids in|pg||
nt|iceking: oh didnt see this would happen|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pushey for Roland but the mandatory opening bid may encourage North to sniff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passel shows a strong sense of rubber bridge pragmatism|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: an extension of support doubles -interesting idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: did north bid 4@H I DONT THINK SO|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|bobh1: barts hand is suddenly very prime|pg||
nt|roswolf: east no doubt is required to hold a good hand when he bids like this|pg||
nt|othered1: and he's right to get in -- they make a bunch of @H as cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am surprised passell did not use texas transfer, should play better from east|pg||
nt|marlowepi: youth, style, and vulnerability conspire to make an opening bid out of the S hand, and no denying it can work. still, S has a low offense-to-defense ratio, and insufficient Losing ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Trick Count to open by normal standards|pg||
nt|puncher99: welcome all the spectators and the operator|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bobh1: roy may not be done|pg||

pc|d7|nt|roswolf: what does east need to raise a 20 count?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: must have done|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@h retransfer is not so unlikely|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess almost unfettered aggression cuts both ways|pg||
nt|daman: looks like the same 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be 800|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more IMPs for Nickell on Board 19    double partscore swing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||
nt|copeyj: although game not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: 4 tricks for north isnt that down 4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|c6|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i think 5|pg||
nt|iceking: he asked for @H now so will get 2 ruffs east will get one more @D ruff the ace of @S and one @C trick in end 1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Katz is thinking about a @s from the looks of it|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure Nickells @D 4 meant something|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Maybe he's thinking about if Nickell signaled a stiff @h or @hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't think he imagined a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a full 1.5 losers short of the canonical criterion|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: AJ@H K@S J@C and Q@D might be an opening bid with some shape (singleton @C)|pg||

mb|2H|nt|roswolf: a peaceful 1nt!?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|daman: pass by Katz denies as little as 3 card @H support|pg||
nt|lml: Nickell doesnt need 3 card support though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know but it happens a lot when you have too many good options|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: favourable lie of cards here - no @S guess to get wrong, @H 3-3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is a 3@H stopper probe reasonable from East here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey really wants to bid 3nt..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT sems unilateral - I presume 3@D from West denied a good fit, so you can't run @D tricks|pg||
nt|daman: commonly referred to as a support double    which was invented by Eric Rodwell...who is playing in this match at the other table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: note that if you change club jack to queen  -- only 1 HCP and still an unsupported minor honor --  the prospects for making slam are considerably enhanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a double would have shown 3 card support and a raise to 2@H would guarantee 4|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if 3@H is forcing since it is alerted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D or 2S with West? |pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: probably not keen on either;)|pg||
nt|puncher99: since they play a club system  he knows their max is 25 and pard didnt opn nt so prob less|pg||
pc|d6|nt|puncher99: its usually a balanced hand  no 5 card majors to bid the nt|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meck is asking about 2@h by N|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall replies its fairly constructive|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  for all scores after 75 boards|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: South failed to bid 2@C   made a MP bid of 1NT instead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: presumably 1st round @D control|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think opening 2nt makes slam bidding easier, but of course grue's double does|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's forcing, the table confirms|pg||

pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: 3@D says LIke? Thn East claerly has to go on|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: going back to the 2D/2S question my view for hat its worth is that 2D is best when the hand is poor and the spade support is poor|pg||

nt|fabsayc: lead directing for me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nobody can deny that zia has a weak raise|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: pass was a big reach|pg||
nt|daman: it creates a playing field full of moguls|pg||
nt|iceking: oops are in strong seq so usually bids here from east should be naturalish shape showing, incase pd wants to compete |pg||
nt|iceking: east ofcourse has a incredible strong hand compare to NS bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really tell who is strong to make fine differences in meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: intermediate  opening - far too strong for a weak 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: nice fit - stiff @D opposite AXXX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 4@D to me showed diamonds, has to more we don't know|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think he can because he needs the entry to finesse hearts.  They got a trump lead in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: now he should bid 2@D|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and non vul too:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is S thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Knowing how aggressively NS overcall, I'm surprisd Lall can consider a move over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should be celebrating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just be happy you find spades|pg||
nt|iceking: so now the question is does 4@H set up forcing situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for that reason i would have doubled 3@S to confirm strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and avoid partner bidding 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nick bid with the yarb again. so maybe 4@h does do so|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding should end here i cant see N dbl this|pg||

mb|p|nt|gowdy: hi |pg||
nt|iceking: with so many@D and no spade spots i doubt he will dbl but he might|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia alerts the dbl as a game try of some kind, not penalty.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: fortunately it was not possible to catch them|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: 4@D was alerted as showing @C|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead normally would beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d showed @cs. Was the alert|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok i missed that obviously, but 6nt is always a possibility|pg||
nt|daman: they were saved|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: well it isnt clear to lead a diamond.  It sounds like West has them wired|pg||
nt|daman: we should expect to see a semblance of normal bridge|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes when you make a strange bid the defence does help out|pg||
nt|lml: because they believe you|pg||
nt|daman: they save you from yourself|pg||
nt|daman: he will x 6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C as a lead director on that poorish hand at unfavorable facing a passe dpartner is understandable, but the real flaw isn;t any of those things  -- it is that youy dont have an ...|pg||

nt|bobh1: i suspect roy will bid the slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the spade lead will be almost automatic|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have wrongsided it|pg||
nt|roswolf: since east will declare 6@H|pg||
nt|puncher99: best defence gets 800|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bobh1: all these transfers sometimes backfire|pg||
nt|daman: my partner overcalled and I have 4 trumps to an honor plus an Ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: I guess 5NT might leave the grand open as an option as well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: far too quick:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps doub will not know why he is getting the @S lead he requested|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the spade lead highlighted now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N overcalled at favorable and was forced to bid over 4HX. way too pushy to move|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: 90 secs:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: John Matheson points out that West dodged a bullet by not doubling with his dbleton @S and a 13 count|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|iceking: the good news 5@S was never makeing |pg||
nt|iceking: even 4@S probably dont make|pg||
nt|kit: and that best defense is coming|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: south thinks west has diamonds too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If not many @d, at least the KQ|pg||
nt|lml: even KQ10x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: point is, from S he only cares about the KQ, @hs are good with an entry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: or even just the K@d|pg||

nt|iceking: lets remember this pair ew are usually sound bidders |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|kit: the ace of clubs is the setting trick.  Is it conceivable that Meckstroth would defend thisway without a stiff diamond?|pg||

nt|dinos1: reverse suit-preference|pg||
mc|7|nt|tejjyid: right; there's nice, and there's realistic|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: and perfect for flannery (dare I say it)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on last another 5 for Bathurst when West rebid 2D rather than 2S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|copeyj: but E/W don't play it so has to settle for 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: do e/w play 2/1?|pg||
nt|roswolf: trappy hand for n/s|pg||
nt|kit: I've never thought that that sort of jump to 4@S is a winner.  You can outbid them if need be.  So why not make limit raise and give partner a chance to look at his hand.|pg||
mb|3C|an|=> 3!d|nt|lml: are we sure the score was making 5?|pg||

mb|3D|nt|copeyj: doubt it Geoff looking at that 2@D call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this double is effectively a short suit game try, but quite optomistic|pg||
nt|daman: yes   I agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless they develop into double pneumonia:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Double is not a SSGT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Alerted as willing to play 3@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Its either @ds or GF w/ @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: is it down on @D lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: run to 10 then|pg||
nt|iceking: makes then|pg||
mb|d|nt|copeyj: am sure this will be passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler: I have too much" as dummy comes down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: always grisly when it is the PARTNER of the NT bidder who starts with AK and gives RHO a rufff|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that confirms no 2/1|pg||
nt|iceking: and might do it|pg||
nt|puncher99: 6hearts only beaten by a trump lead  on lst hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfg: We're about to find out|pg||
nt|iceking: even N doesnt guess this,,, its going to be not that easy defend this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C or 2nt scramble would have been my choices instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: well West couldnt help with a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is asking about leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell explains if E has a choice, he should unblock the suit if possible|pg||
nt|lml: this is just an unfriendly hand for north south as the double suggests|pg||
nt|daman: it must be South who is hesitating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Theyre all thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not easy to beat 3N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but how to bid it? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has to play a D honor on first round i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if playing 14-16 NT might wander into it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 16-18 better|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe so:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: looks like e/w are playing 15-17 and n/s are playing 14-17 NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, tournament players have to narrow it from the standard 13-18 of rubber bridge:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: suicide bomber fared less well in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|copeyj: unlikely to make with @DQ offside, @CA offside|pg||
nt|lml: so do you play the double asks for a heart lead in this auction?|pg||
nt|kit: good reopening by Grue -- he found a nice catch|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: on board 22 not same tempo in open room,,, bidding ended in 5@D dbled down 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: is 800 pneumonia? or just a heavy cold|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: THIS MAY WELL PLAY QUITE WELL|pg||
nt|ady: again a trump lead best    but does not beat this one|pg||
nt|kit: Now Rodwell has to find diamond shift immediately|pg||
nt|kit: And that J109x of clubs is so, so, tempting|pg||
nt|kit: But with partner having 6 diamonds, it is hard to see how diamond shift can be wrong.|pg||
nt|puncher99: ur real lucky when u lead  a stiff trump and ur pards ajx doesnt get wasted|pg||
pc|s4|nt|copeyj: thats one hurdle dealt with|pg||
nt|iceking: Katz should figure this out, i assume Nickell will return @S 8 so he should have @D void|pg||
nt|iceking: he still though needs to guess what other H pd has like if he has Qx in @H not @C king he will need to play for upper-cut|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|copeyj: has chances now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well defence may help of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: just needs to avoid 3 @C losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4 @C losers I mean|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely to be a swing to Welland|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 imps or 7 imps depending on whether he makes or goes down 1|pg||
nt|daman: I do|pg||
nt|iceking: so this is not over by no means|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: THE @D9 is a very good card|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: and well earned.I dont like 1nt on E|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes and it seems that getting to @Cs would be worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think grue will have a singleton club around 95% of time for his double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it depends on what N does on the first round of diamonds in 3N:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|daman: a command   not a suggestion|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: and not 4 diamonds, so in effect both explanations the same|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|copeyj: not much choice in 2/1 Ralf|pg||
nt|kit: But there is still a catch -- West would have to not play a third round of diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|copeyj: unless you play 3@D as natural invitational|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|lml: they are going to have to cash out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking NOrth covered the @SJ|pg||

nt|daman: only my mother would open 2@C|pg||
mb|1S!|an|!hs|nt|roswolf: not likely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reminds me of the old lancia matches:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whoops|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|1N!|an|11-13 Bal|nt|roswolf: now how will north catch up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: transfers over 1@C opener might get you there with E opening 1@C but thats it|pg||
nt|lml: 2@h might have got through|pg||
nt|odysseus69: enough|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|roswolf: well that left nothing to spare|pg||
nt|daman: it won't now|pg||
nt|lml: he had to start with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: in the game now|pg||
nt|ady: could the diamond be short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ifyou compare this to 93,West has just made a very heavy simple raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2+ limited|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They're going to settle for 2@d. Katz doesn't want to start a double war.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can i have her phone number :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm about to lose the alerts. They're handing writing is like font 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: their*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: hand writing*.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The only thing i can read off 2@h alert is that its 19+|pg||
nt|kit: would be nice to follow their bids here, probably will be a long sequence with a lot of artificiality|pg||
mb|3C!|an|4!s 2!d/!h|nt|roswolf: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2N probably some kind of relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a quick-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: As 4@d come down in dummy, Nick says: "That's the good news"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meck made a mistake here I think|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, 6@H is a fine contract, and I would expect they will be able to find it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He changed his "@s" to @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Tie game again. Lets see if Grue and lall keep looking for blood. Not sure how many people dbl 3@h last hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: THIS WILL BE PASSED|pg||
nt|lml: well at least he has 1 dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: so|pg||
nt|lml: which will give him a second one later|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I was looking at 3 spade ...senior moment|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do now with the south hand assuming you were not looking at four hands|pg||
nt|lml: I might switch to clubs|pg||
nt|lml: @SK and then clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's probably thinking about if he can score his @hQ or not. So I think he's temped to play a trump. Not so much a @c when he sees no dummy entry to play towards hand yet|pg||
nt|lml: hard to play a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe|pg||
mb|5C|an|14 !h RK|nt|copeyj: spotlight to robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D probably 3@S maximum hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D openings require lots of special understandings in strong club auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: likely to be a game swing to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|copeyj: who are opening up a bit of a lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure I would have led @H too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad start for robinson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!  not for me! leads from 1087x and from J862 is forbidden if there isnÂ´t a very good reason|pg||
mb|5D|an|Q?|nt|fabsayc: i think they were the primary reason Garozzo abandoned Precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s just says he can't double 1N. They don't seem to have a lot to do this auction|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: good play|pg||
nt|lml: wow if Katz put up the @SQ which really doesnt cost much he can do very well|pg||
nt|iceking: agressive spot|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 12 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: even if S leads a @H|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the problem with opening 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: judging not to unblock |pg||
nt|odysseus69: c7 may be Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if playing Smith some play that high from leader means poor holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We have another director call|pg||
mb|p!|an|No Q|nt|tejjyid: yes, I like to remove all the balanced hands into 1NT - of course that creates other issues|pg||
nt|ady: initial trump lead best|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S probably RKC for hearts|pg||
nt|kit: 5@D asking for queen of trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: still I believe the Robinson team can bring in the recent Cavendish pairs winners Kit Woolsey and Fred Stewart in the next stanza|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N was inconsistent in the auction at best|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes and @C is his strongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought about it, and after the 5 min tank, he probably should have too.|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell    retakes the lead|pg||
nt|iceking: so with trump return now this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|iceking: there have been alot of unclear carding here so far |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Actually. This is the first time they are in the lead this match|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should have the cost is very little|pg||
nt|lml: and the award vrey big|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: By no Q there I meant no @d control|pg||
nt|puncher99: wonder what pass meant over the x for the q  ask?|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be No @hQ, no?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|daman: yes   it was a tie earlier|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh zagorin just gave it Katz didnt read it didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) the @C Q may have been a better choice|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave you now    it's been fun      see you tonight|pg||
nt|iceking: have fun at the hockey match|pg||
nt|iceking: isnt that always the case if Canadian needs to leave in hurry there is some ice hockey going on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead from king was normal so cashing spade ace first i can see why Katz misguessed|pg||
nt|gowdy: could  be curling as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only Vancouver team still in stanley cup of hockey|pg||
nt|iceking: Curling is forbidden in iceland actually we have law against that sport|pg||
nt|kit: anyway, they got to the good slam, which makes even on a trump lead with diamonds 3-3|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: it is often right to fall back on ancient principles|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lml: then its easy for us to say :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: covering heart not good|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfg: Apparently joel really needed a tissue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently victor was right about S catching a cold in 3H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hurd tells Zia not to think too hard|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: and 9 easy tricks now. N is squeezed|pg||
nt|copeyj: has 9 top tricks now and will make 2 overtricks I think when @SQ drops doubleton and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead will then be up to 40|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: This was much to lose with either the Q or T play. If he guesses right then he has an entry that opps will eventually give him.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: he needs the entry then so he can play hearts .. not sure a late entry is that good|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfg: He needed 33@hs i think. the late entry for @cs was just as a good|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: joel in his typical position with his cards held under the table|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: yes his cards are heavier than most people;s|pg||
nt|chip: With 3-3 diamonds he can get 10 tricks, but has to be a little careful.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hamman holds his cards close so he can see them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and takes his reading glasses off to look at dummy or the tray|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: noticing players' usual habits makes it easier to spot unusual body language|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd now leaning back, hands behind his head, which for him is unusual (but not for rodwell)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd usually either slouching forward or with one elbow on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: halfway bells go off|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof8 for scores through 45|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: or through 60 if anyone's very fast|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: zia has his elbows on the table, hands supporting his head, eyes turned to dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: zia playinng with his cards enough that one appears creased|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bending it this way and that, idly, while studying dummy's hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Zia has still not led to trick 4.  still looking for a way he might beat this|pg||
nt|chip: Welland is leading Jacobs by 3 and Wolfson is 40 ahead of Aker. |pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfd: 120 board matches, 60 today, 60 more tomorrow starting at 10 am PDT / 1700 GMT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: now joel stops to think.  could have foreseen this exit during the delay|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: at the grue-lall-meckwell table, often one defender took a long time to think, then the rest of the play was over in seconds|pg||

nt|copeyj: 11 to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: very diplomatic bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he's going to pass he should be content with 3@S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: EW are doing n well in the BAM scoring - not very useful for them, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey is taking his time while Grue calls dummy cards|pg||
nt|daman: they are finished in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I would guess that Meckstroth's pass showed no diamond control, which would explain why Rodwell gave up on getting to a grand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah, that was what Meck told Lall the pass was|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: n/s might attempt 3nt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1H for me|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: highest minor with any 4441|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would have opened also but perhaps these two are the opposite side of the coin to their opponents|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1nt 12-14?|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|gowdy: the key here is if W should have bid 4@D  perhaps game  with 3NT or perhaps even 3 @H  would be better|pg||
nt|odysseus69: an imp for Nickell although the defence was not electric here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then might have made 4 of diamonds on last trick via endplay....you dont see that every day|pg||
mb|r|nt|copeyj: 3N or 4@S for N/S|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better control of the bidding had ew used gazzilli maybe|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: they play k-s|pg||
nt|lml: anybody bid now with the south hand?|pg||
nt|lml: say DBL again?|pg||
nt|iceking: or cole or some convention over 2@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
nt|lml: I guess its a bit too rich|pg||
nt|kit: not so sure I agree with redouble -- leaves opponents free to bid a lot of spades while you haven't shown your heart support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: a routine bd|pg||
nt|roswolf: then 3nt never in the picture|pg||
nt|othered1: And rather orthodoxly|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S by Lall preemptive over the redouble -- pretty standard expert treatment|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we have some yes's and some no's.  the fear of the yes's is partner will bid and create a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Les Bart predicts Robinson will bid 4@S courtesy of having no sure entry to the @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: i much prefer a direct 3@C unless that has a special meaning|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Mixed Raise  = why should they go down when we can?|pg||
nt|daman: "stay fixed"|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid again but I would think I might be had|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: if p cant dbl 4@s to show something, you shouldn't bid anything with that hand. N has a very good pass|pg||
nt|iceking: over 1@S i meant|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@D had slam intentions|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 5@D would have been better picture bid of W hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that scenario, if N has seven of diamonds instead of 8 the correct defence for E is to exit with the six, not the two. that way N does not score the beer card|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: or just 3nt give it up|pg||
nt|iceking: problem ofcourse with 5@D as they play, 3@D might have been some fragmeant bid |pg||
nt|iceking: or what do they bid with some monster @H hands i assume 3@D or 3@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead interesting by Katz, figuring if partner cant bid he has to have openers suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: A lot of people would double with W's hand for the blacks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not show blacks|pg||
nt|iceking: well thought out lead |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: oh, 1@c was opened. sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Now this should be doubled, but Rodwell hasn't shown his trump support yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: dont they play transfers over 1M-X?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: overboard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: i can live with mixed raise, likely would not have bought hand for 2@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes I like the 4@S bid.  You dont have defense and you do have offense|pg||
nt|kit: they do play transfers, but only up to 2@H I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Theyre taking a smoke break after this hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: Many players can rebid nt with a singleton in partners major. I donÂ´t like it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: clearly seamon expects more points than partner is producing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: very optimistic if 2@C was weak|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: I want to trust at least a doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: never seems to cost however|pg||
nt|marlowepi: important psychological point when playing juniors, gotta be tough as nails|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Here 3@h is clearly a form of checkback to play @ss|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: Ugly -- even if declarer leads spade to queen, he has problem of of getting back to his hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: anything else is whimpy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dinos1: so 2@h 2@d 1@s and 1@c to lose|pg||
nt|kit: Now defense has to be careful -- they need to set up their diamond winners before giving club ruffs.|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 800 always there -- it is the 1100 the defense is after|pg||
nt|kit: no, sorry -- it is the 800|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: very interesting hand to play|pg||
nt|odysseus69: road home not obvious|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia is asking about their openings|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very hard hand. maybe spade knave now, and heart queen later|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|daman: so says Popeye|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gowdy: nice play however his 5@C was enough |pg||
nt|fabsayc: come on ralph this is cold|pg||
nt|iceking: nothing Katz can do here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Can't blame the man for trying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kevin and Katz discuss the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know this won't be popular, but i think their should be penalties for a single long pause either in bidding or play|pg||
nt|gowdy: he needs P to have the @d q and @H A and @C a or k 6   thats alot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If the table players dont mind, we shouldnt either.|pg||
nt|iceking: he also knows pd had kj @C and AK @H he really cant have much more, so should probably see the hand is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There has been a director call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you are stealing opponents time when they need to think|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree iam not big fan of these huge pauses in middle of hands|pg||
nt|gowdy: no  i believe some hands take more time than others  take time on the tough ones no proble here|pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell nailed them in 2@C|pg||
nt|iceking: so we are even again|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: where is my spinach|pg||
nt|kit: jack of diamonds shift makes a lot of sense now -- he has to know his partner has every missing high card for the redouble|pg||
pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: still difficult to see a way home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hands like this are what top-level bridge are all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hurd may have gotten a few more strands of gray hair since the last trick|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: he was engaged n hurd mentality|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|dinos1: now -2, coz W will be endplayed in @s's|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, the real cost of the Mixed Raise comes elsewhere. it dedicates a bid for small gains that could be used to cater to big ones|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: made this next door - will have to find out how later|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: naturally it has its successes too of course|pg||
nt|kit: now if declarer wins a diamond and exits with a diamond, queen of clubs, pitch, and defense wins out|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia has everything pegged now. He's probably thinking about what to pitch on the @h tho|pg||

mb|2S|an|something in !S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chip: Quite good from W, not so good from E with a H lead (have to guess whether to finesse or play for 2-2 D's.|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: there are advantages to methods like this, but the perenial downside of artificialities on GF or slam-interest hands is giving opps chance to doubele for lead. each partnership ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: must make its own decision about risk-reward assessment in that regard|pg||
nt|chip: not sure if E has clarified his strength (2H was a 10+ D raise).|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I don't know either, but if EW explain I will inform|pg||

mb|p|nt|chip: Kib asked about Zia's non-DBL of 3C: probably a combination of not giving away info, and not giving EW extra room.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E is on the big end of a slow pile, the sort of hand that often makes just 130 with no aces|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|chip: EW needed better methods where W could show club shortness.|pg||

nt|roswolf: 2nt = a strong club raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or defending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The TD hasn't bugged anyone yet. We have time.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: nor has west|pg||
nt|roswolf: pity "content" is no longer permissable|pg||
nt|bobh1: limit + i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: he just took 2 long time |pg||
nt|iceking: N had to do something|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|d|nt|bobh1: again roy restrains himself|pg||
nt|lml: in the other room north south bid spades which might have helped them get to slam |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|lml: but I think they will here too|pg||
nt|eok: Z is having a particularly poor session, really getting outplayed by Grue atother table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wlecome eric|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They didnt ruff the @d at the other table. I suspect it was a mistake|pg||
nt|puncher99: 2c must b diam positive|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I have to run.  Thanks all and bye for now.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he knows the sort of hands he opens:)|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|copeyj: can beat it if south ducks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 5@c was made in OR after a @s lead, A trumph lead play low |pg||
nt|roswolf: well south might have doubled but he has seen his pards neg dbls before obviously|pg||
nt|bobh1: he is right again|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: coffee hand|pg||
nt|kit: 6@D good contract here it looks like |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2N is some kind of 3way bid, again, I can't read it|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, in 6@d just ruff 2 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I think 2@C showed positive in diamonds -- after that, I don't know what their bids mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kibbers says: 3@c is- 4@s/6+@d/5(332) 11-13|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|ralfwil: S should play a small @s and return a @c|pg||
nt|copeyj: had to duck and switch to trumps when he got in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after haveing won next @s|pg||
nt|lml: I like 1NT as an opening bid.  Does anybody have a problem with it?|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|iceking: even i can make this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 85 n/s in the other room stopped in 4@D|pg||
nt|lml: There are quite a few including David Bird who think it is too strong|pg||
nt|lml: and you could miss a club slam|pg||
nt|kit: Problem for meckstroth is:  where is Rodwell's strength|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|lml: 2@S forced 2NT and then 3@C showed diamonds|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|roswolf: not clearcut|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C was a cue for one of the two duits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Then 3n is 5332|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@c/4@s are Q's for @hs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: With @d, 3@d was the bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: From W anyway|pg||
nt|lml: so 4@C is for hearts|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but ducking is in accordance with general principles|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: mahaffey did well not to lead a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@H probably RKC, 5@C asks for queen of trumps, 5@S shows it plus king of spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: the idea is that with diamonds you would accept the transfer|pg||
nt|daman: not a horrible auction|pg||
nt|lml: and they got to use a lot of gadgets|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: settling for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: I always like to get into the bowels of the system.  It helps me remember the unusual sequences|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: In this position N/S alerted the 1N as 14-16 not 14-17|pg||
nt|eok: I sometimes speak to Marshall in private about non-bridge things|pg||
pc|dA|mc|12|nt|kit: that really is an insult to Meckstroth -- he wouldn't have bid the slam without a stiff club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: After the @dA, he played @d and then claimed 6|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chip: 4S was a good save in the other room. 4H can be beaten by a club lead, but I suspect S would prefer a D.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: yes, best chance to beat 4H is if N leads a D out of turn|pg||

nt|roswolf: aouth needs to open this one|pg||
nt|daman: I can think of other body parts to suit me|pg||
nt|daman: the ulnar nerve for example|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good at least he claimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south|pg||
nt|ady: n/s will do well to play 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: hard, but not that difficult, as he can win trump cheaply so has two spade entries and trump entry to ruff 2 clubs and get back to draw trumps|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: after the lead S knows that W has a 4-card @s, probably a 7-card @c. A duck must be easy|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough maybe impossible to find in Precision|pg||
nt|dinos1: with @s4-2 no lead threats|pg||
mb|3D!|an|Mixed|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: baron means bid suits up the line|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BAron asks for 4 card suits up the line, including minors|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good score east-west.  First they have to get to a game and then they have to make it|pg||
nt|iceking: not often you see 2@D opening as weak|pg||
nt|iceking: agressive overcall from Katz|pg||
nt|iceking: Nickell thinking about 3nt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bobh1: they missed a good save|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|lml: I wouldnt bid it myself|pg||
nt|daman: West opened 1@S in the OR|pg||
nt|lml: Katz has a minimum and partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The system is lagging. We might lose connection|pg||
nt|gowdy: I am 2@S here with N  but 2@D has worked well here|pg||
nt|kit: I have never liked this artificial mixed raise -- too easy to double artificial call for lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: avoided the 4-4 major trap|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3 more bds after this|pg||
nt|daman: would be tough to keep EW out of game |pg||
nt|lml: shows what I know :)|pg||
nt|iceking: will he lead @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: These minor suit slam auctions are quite rare - a lot of people have the conventions on their card but won't have discussed them in depth|pg||
nt|lml: you are NV|pg||
nt|lml: you dont have to be so pushy NV|pg||
nt|imp_jan: easy defense here|pg||
nt|gowdy: yep :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm not a good awitch|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: After N dbl'd 3@d, they will probably get it right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense tough now but should prevail|pg||
nt|iceking: unblock?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If they play smith of some kind, they'll defend correctly.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: auction does not really work either as lall could be 3442|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Theycan go to 4NT with 16 + 14 quite comfortably, so there isplenty of room to explore|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually south can still have 4 clubs as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Why don't they work well? if he's 3442 then it doesnt matter. If Grue had 4@h he'd bid 3@h here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now south knows he can play diamonds after the dbl|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: needed a minor suit lead  for this to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: On this deal, Meckstroth (South) led his singleton but later decided not to ruff when declarer led a second spade towards dummy (letting the game through). |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT best here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is W close to 4C over 3S?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'd say so since p didnt bid 1@s-2@d//2@s-2n//3@h which is the lesser version of this auction as Zia explains to Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats part of the mystery (to me) of 2/1 - |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|iceking: this will go few down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: but N has to decide before he sees the smith signal|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some prefer mystery of 2/1 to misery of acol:)|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H could have been beaten with double-dummy club lead, but of course would have been diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: Now, can the defense work out to get a diamond ruff?|pg||
nt|puncher99: needs a club lead to beat 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: would have beaten the contract by continuing a club since a trump promotion was obtainablw|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can duck this trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tejjyid: I thnk SOuth would bid 4@C over 3@S, if he hadthem, => 4@C from North = 5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe|pg||
nt|daman: yes     he missed the defense|pg||
nt|odysseus69: defence need to switch to trump after heart to king (can duck first)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: and he found it |pg||
nt|kit: I must admit that it wouldn't have occurred to me to bid 4@S on the South hand -- all the defensive stuff in the minors, only 5 spades, doubleton heart, etc.|pg||
nt|dinos1: no need in @d ruff - cd lead @h then duck 1r of @s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: I've seen that 5NT general slam force 3 times in 2 days and not for years previously|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heart a bad idea|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|nt|lml: this will be over soon|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: welldone Wooldridge|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer now marked with 6-4-0-3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Now Hamman is going to have to play for split J T or 33@hs|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dinos1: then tap dcl with @h's|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: North's double showed the @DK, making the defense easy.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfg: It didn't show the K.. It's just implied after seeing dummy value and @sA with E|pg||
nt|lml: I think he does have to cash now though|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: Once it lead to an unplayable grand slam & twice it seemed redundant - I must research itsome more|pg||
nt|iceking: so 2 down |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: it is in fashion, but i am not sure what it shows in a variety of auctions|pg||
nt|lml: okay then|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If @hs with Jxx with N, it's still guess. So no claim|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: this is perhaps an even more effective defense -- trying to force declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: joel asks zia what hurd's distribution was|pg||
mb|3N|an|4major bid|nt|chip: Ducking the D could help if trumps are 3-0. If trumps are 2-1 3H is cold.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H luck is in|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: note says "4 of a major - anti positional" - in other words nothing to protect by declaring|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfd: zia graciously holds the note where I can read it more easily|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can only shake my head at closed room auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hamman looking at his bidding box for a long while|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzfd: can't read the note, have to crane my neck around hurd who is leaning over the table as usual|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3N an effective toss of the dice here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: new note from hamman says "probably 4 of a major"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: EW do not look prepared for this auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes unfortunate that competitiors dont have to subm,it their methods in advance:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3NT opening is on NS system summary under "bids that need advance preparation"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one would think|pg||

nt|marlowepi: club king would be an interesting shot|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, with heart  A ruffed, 4S is likely down 2.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfd: if left unmolested, was 4@H(N) making on the @D blockage?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: looks like eventually you have to take @C finesse and make|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, 4H is a quite lucky make.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that was the gist of my original comment, but havent revisitd it|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: specs point out it is a simple make after @DK lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lml: the Bathurst team is all pluses on the remaining boards|pg||

nt|kit: A true classic 4@H opening|pg||
nt|kit: Now, does Meckstroth accept the "transfer"?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: a @c-ruff will defeat 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: East wont do to well if getting busy here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes but unlikely to be found imo|pg||
nt|kit: Grue will know what to do if he does|pg||
nt|kit: This double looks very strange to me, unless the play it as penalties -- which is not the norm.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceking: could they end up 2 high here|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@s, 4N or pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@D looks like some kind of drury - 4+@H and max passed hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly natural:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: here again Fabsayc is thinking 2@C  :)|pg||
nt|iceking: depends little what 2@S meant|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and this time reaching 6@D|pg||
nt|iceking: it looks like just normal weak raise, popular for many 2over1 pairs to play 2@S like 8-10hcp|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually this is 1@S bid, since our jump shifts show 55|pg||
nt|iceking: Katz doing the math|pg||
nt|iceking: he knows his side has some good double fitt but very little value|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i think its close call here |pg||
nt|iceking: and i dont blame him going for it, he could also strike real gold here if lucky|pg||
nt|iceking: Zagorin should dbl this i think|pg||
nt|iceking: xxx in @S and xx in @C just not good enuff for pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but the bidding is in the dark for NS after the 4@S bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|tejjyid: disciplined pass by Lall|pg||
nt|puncher99: nice bid|pg||
nt|kit: If rodwell has to think, it isn't for penalties|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: yes, but now he will run|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: i think roy judged this one well|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: many of these conventional bid can help defence - either with a dbl or a pass |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm great lead - maybe|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean 11?|pg||
nt|lml: the negative double kept the heart suit out|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: so this will go 2 down for 300 nice pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: waiting for play atm. he's thinking|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door they used a toy that is popular in US - a jump response of 2H to show a limited hand ith 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: even worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: at one time that would have been a 2@H overcall, too much defense and too thin suits for Michaels|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if he pitches a @S from hand, can't he get 12?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes he can but main considerations is not losing a diamond|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|copeyj: more pain for Robinson's team|pg||
nt|gowdy: if pass is forcing  and red  vs white it should be  then X is clear in my view|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: ouch for robinson -welland on form|pg||
nt|copeyj: nothing they could do here - just an outstanding lead|pg||
nt|puncher99: hard to sit a x on a 3 cardsuit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|iceking: agree |pg||
nt|iceking: S cant do anything else then dbl with his holding|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C was a bad run -- he should bid 4NT, then redouble, emphasizing diamonds I think|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: defence need to play clubs early|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|iceking: why N didnt cash @C AK is something i dont really understand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: this looks like a push|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: I prefer this way; you show 10 cards, not 5 & texture is only a problem sometimes |pg||

pc|d4|nt|vugraphzfd: well picked by chip|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chip: This is fine. Sould play 4 rounds of D ending in dummy, if they all live, can ruff a club and cash the last D, If E ruffs in, can always score your trumps separately|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chip: That line is 100%.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d8|nt|chip: This way Zia could go down if spade A onside (he will exit with the spade K after cashing his last D).|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kind of unsporting to select a 100% line|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd reluctant to let go of his discards|pg||

nt|daman: just a routine push|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|iceking: long way to go, its to early play tired bridge now|pg||
nt|bobh1: in standard u open 1@D|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|tejjyid: maybe more defensible if you play specific 2 suiters, that's true|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobh1: again we see an 11 point special|pg||
nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this first session|pg||
mb|2S!|an|bal gf|nt|roswolf: north in the spotlight again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's not just popular in the US. It's a popular tool when playing precision. Where 2@h is less than INV with exactly 5@s 4@h and 2@s is the same with a INV|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Another difficult to id slam here|pg||
nt|kit: and with hearts 4-1, it doesn'tmake|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceking: slam time but will they get there|pg||
mb|d!|nt|bobh1: and roy will have to restrain himself|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C by south?!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 4@S wont work, would agree hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He does one better with 4@c.. They might get there now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: its 4+@h in some cases|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2N over either bid is hand asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: depends a little what dbl means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Doesn't promise extras|pg||
nt|iceking: if its just normal support dbl N could have 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like 3@H should show a 5-card suit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: EW will be regretting 109 & 110 right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes mere mortals may sniff a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d might be RKCB|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt they can miss slam now|pg||
nt|iceking: no matter what 4@D means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup, table confirmed. It's rkcb|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is still in the tank tho. He doesn't know to show the @s void or not|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iceking: iam not big fan of rkcb everytime here, imo it takes away alot of natural quebidding seq that could be importand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 110%|pg||
nt|iceking: instead you shoud use turbo when @C are trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: should|pg||
nt|iceking: in my opinion|pg||
nt|kit: Can't he bid 3@D and let his partner bid 3@H?|pg||
nt|dinos1: he bid 3@h to play right-sided i think|pg||
nt|dinos1: but cd it be p - p - XX from N?|pg||
nt|kit: could be, but seems odd|pg||
pc|cA|nt|copeyj: this looks like a not so exciting 4@S unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D was a decent sac|pg||
nt|copeyj: sure it was 500 against 620|pg||
nt|copeyj: worth finding but not a big deal in scheme of things|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps is manna when you trail by 50|pg||
nt|copeyj: true!|pg||
nt|ady: can get home    but if a spade is led and dducked  defence can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This tank can only help N/S here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can you explain how that works magnus|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even at favorable, opening an 8 loser hand without 2 honors in any suit and 4333 in a suit you dont want led seems..........arguable|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: Italians use Turbo instead of RKCB imyself only use it when @C are trumps, it means in quebidding seq you show even or odd number of aces instead of asking, it starts in 4@S from ...|pg||
nt|iceking: either side |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: investigating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although I think they were booked to lose on those at this table becasue of the other table results, but not as much as 25|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we are not stuck on this play|pg||
nt|lml: I have to leave you all now.  Dont get unto too much trouble|pg||
nt|daman: later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thank you|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: just guessing but it seems all of roy's bids are transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wish we knew what this auction meant|pg||
nt|ady: needs to take first trick if either diamond or spade led  to be sure of making   not easy|pg||
nt|daman: this is not as good as 4@S  especially if the defnese finds time to play @Hs|pg||
nt|iceking: this was the danger |pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile bathurst has bid 7 essentially on his own|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural nf competive i think N just gambled 2 much here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont have precise rules for void showing, you get into these problems with low level blackwoods|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural forcing its maybe calculated risk from north to bid 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There's been another TD call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why i proposed 5@C to start with, huge fit limited hand|pg||
nt|iceking: this table needs more love to manyTD calls here:)|pg||
nt|gowdy:  If5 @D showed 2 with void   he was hoping for more in  @H I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: N and E aren't getting along|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 5@d was 2 w/ Q. It didn't show a void|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont see any squeeze potential here|pg||
nt|iceking: even W has @S ace and 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes that is most likely bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@D by E might have had a shot until doug's double|pg||
nt|gowdy: then 7 is far fetched|pg||
nt|imp_jan: strange lead|pg||
nt|iceking: its 4card ending 4 @H in dummy w just keeps 3@H and @S ace i cant see it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good evening all|pg||
nt|iceking: so this looks like no play |pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not leading low?|pg||
nt|gowdy: N called  the D on Ralph for taking too much time  gloves are off in my book !|pg||
nt|iceking: agree rather standard lead low trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opening light -- and i am a big practitioner--should be about something|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the suit, or the multivalent playability, or something|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT can be held to 9 tricks on a @H lead I think     having said that.....EW would lose an IMP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It can still be held to 9|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: specs   the world knows 3NT can be held to 9 on a low @C back|pg||
nt|daman: North might play the @C King and cross his fingers|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: 1C-1S=art. GF - a spec informs me|pg||
nt|ady: just been pointed out 9 tricks   assuming of course get clubs right|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: transfer then second suit should be looking for best game not a slam try, apparently cohler thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: playing 2/1 not much can go wrong even if you open that hand. its not bad|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: maybe North is thinking about the @D suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since we are opening a minor i am not sure how 2/1 enters into it|pg||
nt|kit: this is actually a little tricky now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: the dbls have warned e/w off|pg||
nt|puncher99: if he ruffed 2 clubs in his hand he had a lock play for game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: not in 3NT  the dizzy heights of 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a low spade is safest lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it would be nice tobe abale to try forslam and stop in eiterh 4NT or 5@C though - you can see whay Cohler likes his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My feeling is that the jump to6@C has bit twice though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: so, maybe 4@D was the bid that goaded West onwards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: you're following ups are different|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: no way|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: what do you think can go wrong I mean?|pg||
nt|dinos1: now only @d's|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: if East had held a stiff diamond, he would have been down on thisline of play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: did he do that Dan?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, E wd get 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: 4@D ok, 4@S way too much|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: oposite a limited hand (NT opening) perhapsEast has the responsibility to slow things down|pg||
nt|kit: and now he is going down.  This must have been a blind spot|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|copeyj: So we are coming to our last board|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: I think the right line of play was 2 rounds of trumps ending in dummy, then duck a spade.  This cuts the enemy communication.|pg||
nt|kit: oh, sorry -- he is okay -- never mind|pg||
nt|kit: it is if East had a stiff diamond he could have been in trouble.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfg: He did it|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: do you have to guess? as long as you play the top clubs early does it matter which card ou then ruff?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|chip: kib points out that 6n can be made by guessing spades, but not a likely play (even wth the club DBL).|pg||
mb|5H|nt|marlowepi: yes, elopement better|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, can ruff either minor first, so should defintely make 6S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|an|!SQ + something else|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: holding !6S a few inches above tray|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: The gloves are off..|pg||
nt|kit: but I still don't like his line of play -- took needless risk|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tejjyid: right, it's not the worst slam youve been in when you are 40 behind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think they mostly bid this slam because trailing|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 7-4 shape led both rooms to open 4@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks to you too, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: another feisty hand|pg||

mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfg: Sorry, connection dropped|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Made 5 last hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: a sensible decision by north to go quietly|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make 5@H in theory|pg||
nt|iceking: another swing coming up ew will never reach game here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what from Zia- xx or some trick|pg||
mb|p|an|!c stopper, no major|nt|bobh1: prob will end in 5@C doubled|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: :)|pg||
nt|gowdy: See most of you all tonight  Thanks all !|pg||
nt|kit: if Rodwell pitches spade on third diamond, I think declarer can counter by leading king of spades|pg||
nt|kit: And yet another hand in the slam zone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easy, so thanks Geoffrey,Simon and specs. Bye for now:)|pg||
nt|iceking: i take that back |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back at 345pm PST or 645pm EST|pg||
nt|dinos1: he was still OK coz W had @sA (if cash 3 r of @hs)|pg||
mb|r!|an|Willing to play hand|nt|ady: dont like the east opening on flat 11  especially as diamonds not guaranteed|pg||
nt|kit: unless they play 2@C redoubled!!|pg||
nt|kit: which they just might|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: 960 if he passes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceking: dbl as some forward going hand would be usefull here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nope just a simple transfer to 4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: congratulations to bathurst team, deserving winners|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Last board, thx all. We'll be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|daman: this is very perilous|pg||
nt|odysseus69: simple 4H bid - was too obvious for me to suggest|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can make slam if he gets the spades right, and he might after the double of 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: If he doesn't get the spades right, I don't think there is an end position which works|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: adam would have been better off bidding 5@C immediately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but east has a "law2 decision|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: getting too high? you're p wont hang you for bidding 1@c imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm not sure what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Though 4NT = 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|daman: a better auction with 3334      would be 1@C - 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator anam|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D would be natural nf here so 3@H probably 2wayish natural or invitational strenght|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: seems they have got diamonds |pg||
nt|fabsayc: an extension of the only game try principle|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tejjyid: trump lead? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mahaffey might have bid slam here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought well and good about it but then came to the green card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace lead for me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|iceking: so now he just needs to make this |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems more realistic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or maybe a @S, try & build a 3rd trick|pg||
nt|kit: some are saying after bad spade news duck heart to South and then squeeze North, but second round of clusbs ruins enttries for that I believe|pg||
nt|dinos1: cd be dbl-sqz, @h - "both" suit|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfg: my point was its a very standard 12 pt opening. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: goiong for 200 against a making 4@H could be a meaningful pick-up|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|iceking: Gib says +1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade to ace is actually normal to avoid diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but GIB would drop the king of spades|pg||
nt|iceking: i would also looking at all hands|pg||
nt|kit: Well, let's see about the spade suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|tejjyid: excellent idea -maybe it will catch on :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, well it depends on your criteria for opening bids. unsupported honors are much better defensively  than offensively, and 7 LTC is the norm for an opener, and W had a tidy 8. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but chscun a son gout|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: e/w are known to open 11's too. I think its sound to say he'd always open that hand|pg||
nt|kit: 10- could be stiff 10, j10, 109, or J109 -- but odds change with the club length|pg||
nt|dinos1: but if play K now then dcl is sqz'd on @s|pg||
nt|dinos1: and sqz mb ruined with @h shift|pg||
nt|dinos1: is it safe to finesse now?|pg||
nt|kit: kibs talking about squeezes working, but I don't think so|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dburn: and a spade to the ace is not the best way to avoid losing a diamond ruff - suppose South had three spades to the king|pg||
nt|iceking: we are all genius here looking at all 4 hands:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: Ive got to play with this gib guy  never goes down when he sees all the hands|pg||
nt|dburn: or two spades to the king, and three diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Ive seen a gib revoke before :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the safety play is not 100%|pg||
nt|kit: well, now we will see|pg||

nt|daman: he will lose 1 in the wash     push|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: see you soon|pg||
nt|dburn: the "safety play" is actually more dangerous than the finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|nt|tejjyid: or, maybe it won't - how many down is this?|pg||
nt|ady: a poor result of a part score hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Everyone left again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggesting an alternative bid to 2@D is hard|pg||

nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
