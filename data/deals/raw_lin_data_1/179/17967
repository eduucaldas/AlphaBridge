mb|p|nt|iceking: should Wooldridge take another action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|an|takeout I think|nt|iceking: its little dangerous, he should know his pd has 5+@S|pg||

nt|bessi2: which was a very reasonable position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: USA1 for the Bermuda Bowl is the Fleisher team, who won last year's USBC - Marty Fleisher-Michael Kamil, Bobby Levin-Steve Weinstein, Chip Martel-Lew Stansby|pg||

mb|4D|an|shortness|nt|dburn: if Nickell and Katz carry on at this rate, they may leave Zia on the bench anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told - 8-10 spects: 4@C :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C was OK to me|pg||
nt|ybob: opening 3@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: to pass the West hand is not bridge for me|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, it is slightly flawed - two first-round controls, and so on|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C for me (not 4) - I would give my partner a chance to bid 3NT!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: still, the auction worked out badly enough that he didn't get another chance at a low level|pg||
nt|dburn: and now he needs to guess what to do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ybob: 5 more to Nickell|pg||
nt|pelu: if u dont take the chance u are offerd - only fine, that u dont get a 2. chance :)|pg||
nt|dburn: and whereas he guessed wrong not to bid, at least he guessed right not to double|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ybob: last chance to W|pg||
nt|pelu: can u explain that finess, David, ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: likely west has no hearts, so he can pitch a heart even if the finesse loses -- and it figure to win|pg||
nt|dburn: he thought it might hold - after all, he is looking at a couple of losing hearts and perhaps a couple of losing spades|pg||

mb|1S|nt|puncher99: i would agree with a nt overcall rather than a spade bid|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|iceking: what should Rodwell bid here|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... was a relatively straightforward 5@c save|pg||
nt|bessi2: 4@h|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@C 4@H? |pg||
nt|iceking: i dont like dbl here risks 5@D from pd |pg||
mb|4C|nt|iceking: agree looks like 1nt 2 me also|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: 4@c on the way|pg||
nt|iceking: can Meck pass this|pg||
nt|pef: is 4c forcing?|pg||
nt|iceking: or is this forcing?|pg||
nt|friggi: must be semi support|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bessi2: generally I dislike overcalling 1N with a 5 card Major.. especially when you can bid it at the 1st level|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might dbl this |pg||
nt|iceking: normal to play bids here nf at 3rd level not sure about 4th |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: playing strong @C i would think 2nt here would show good @D hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... very strange bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: would think with 4-4 minors you can dbl, they might play it as pen|pg||
nt|pef: I guess it was forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: anyway iam sure they know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: a spec told me that 2N asks for better minor|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|iceking: so 420 here|pg||
nt|pef: nice gains on both of the first two 140 for meckwell|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bessi2: that is a cool treatment|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|pef: so the match is now down to 30 imps|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|iceking: lead down to 30 imps |pg||
nt|iceking: and more to come|pg||
nt|iceking: board 78 is possible swing both ways|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: many would pass in East over 1NT - u are on lead and have a lot of losers|pg||

nt|iceking: i assume 0+@D do we know|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: dull 3nt here |pg||
nt|pef: the trick on this hand is to play 6c from the north side (and avoid a diamond ace lead)|pg||

mc|12|nt|iceking: ouch|pg||
nt|pef: so meckwell off to a huge start, we are probably close to even right now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: that gives grue a lot of red cards if he has a @s void|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting point is that meckwell changed places|pg||
nt|imp_jan: before meck was south and rod north|pg||
nt|iceking: i feel for the guy it was really not solvable Rodwell could have bid slam on many other hands with stiff @H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: it helped so far!|pg||
nt|ritong: meckstroth is always south  they really tried a voodoo coup|pg||
nt|imp_jan: some kibs say they often switch..|pg||
nt|iceking: short break|pg||
nt|ritong: jeff likes to be south in order to bring the boards on the table|pg||
nt|ritong: and when he has the momentum, they come real fast|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but that's north duty..|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps Grue intended his double of 6@c to ask for a diamond, since North had opened the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: East was correct to X - sh be lead-directing: @DJ = down 2|pg||
nt|dburn: but his partner didn't see it that way, since a 1@d opening does not actually show the suit|pg||
nt|dburn: so I imagine he tried to give his partner a spade ruff instead|pg||
nt|dburn: and that was not an entirely ridiculous thing to do - just an entirely unfortunate one|pg||

nt|iceking: is dbl one minor or both majors i assume|pg||
nt|bessi2: is dbl minor or both M's ?|pg||
mb|d|an|PEN|nt|pef: double there is "meckwell" which is a variety of hands, but most likely both majors|pg||

nt|iceking: thats a fine result they only make 2-3@S|pg||
nt|pef: three hearts, a spade, a diamond, and either a long club or a ruff.  defense needs to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting hand... with best defence, lall will need to duck when he plays a @d and north puts in an honour, if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: @s  king now|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|iceking: Meck trying to find pds suit|pg||
nt|iceking: thiswill lead to 1@D |pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell def carding is little speciall like here he play @H K before Ace to show @S interest|pg||
nt|pef: if he now plays a third heart and gives a ruff, meckstroth better switch to a spade immediately|pg||
nt|iceking: rev lavinthal in a way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck, who's thinking "sorry"|pg||
nt|pef: yes meckwell is one of the few pairs who besides playing udca, also play upside down suit preference|pg||
nt|iceking: will he not discard @S 5 looks correct card|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: rodwell likely to switch to @s king no matter what meck pitches|pg||

nt|iceking: not very often you see someone take this long on discard|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h6|pg||

nt|pelu: not easy to defeat 4@S - @cK will work - but a @H is normal. so 51H with odds!|pg||

nt|iceking: indeed|pg||
nt|iceking: not clear though what East will do in trick 2 in 4@S|pg||

pc|c2|nt|iceking: easy 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|pef: lall has seen partner's opening bids before (and made many of them himself)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 2NT - Grue: "he has a game try of some kind ... 3-level is all forcing to game"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: if that is so then 2nt was misbid |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might lead @D ace vs 4@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: i like that treatment very much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Since 2NT was forcing, he could also bid it with a game force where he didn't want to describe anything|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "why didn't you bid a NT?"|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|bessi2: 4@h now ?|pg||
nt|pef: seems likely|pg||
nt|iceking: or 4@C fitt showing or 4@H splinter |pg||
nt|dougdscsu: might do well to bid 4@c here|pg||
nt|iceking: might just bid 4sp and 5sp later|pg||
nt|pef: be interesting to see who buys this.  probably stops at 5 spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: true.. i like 4¨@s|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 5@s X probably par|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 5@S minus one most likely result|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. ak on defence on the 5th level is good.. better bid 4@h and let pd decide maybe  or 4@c|pg||
nt|pef: on the hand where meckwell doubled 2c for down 1 they actually lost 3 imps because nickell katz stretched (and that's putting it mildly) to 4 hearts which mercifully wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|pef: one would think south with akq9 of trumps and kqxx of spades might risk a double|pg||
nt|iceking: 5@S is ofcourse minus 2 |pg||

mb|3C|nt|iceking: challange here in 3nt |pg||

nt|bessi2: but I do expect to learn something from the way he plays it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: yes 2@S 1@H 3@C 3@D more like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not sure Joe can dbl this|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: well.. he has 14 hcp and pd opened the bidding...  so for his dignity's sake|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "Maybe not the best way to bid it"|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bessi2: when he sees hurd discard on the third @h he will know Wooldridge doesn't hold @c king|pg||
nt|pelu: even if u have no entry for the @hs play on and protect pd from finesses|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed good point Peter|pg||
nt|bessi2: most would overcall with KQJ8xx + a king|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|iceking: looking at 7hearts and his black suit holding, i would not think this would go alot down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: board 70 was 11 imps to Brathurst |pg||
nt|iceking: bidding on that board in closed looks like misunderstanding so there might have been some problems there|pg||
nt|iceking: its Bathurst sry:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: complicated hand to play|pg||
nt|bessi2: just happy it isnt me who has to play it|pg||
nt|iceking: yes he could be thinking about Q of @C from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: or low @C to ace alot of options|pg||
nt|iceking: also thinking about what he should discard|pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will discard @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: ...it meant that his partnership sacrificed a level higher than it needed to|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Yep -- not good idea to save in 5@S when opponents only in 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: after 1@D - 1@s - 2@H S tryed 3@C - and then over 4@H N bid 5@C - and they were in 5@s down 300 - and not 4@S-1|pg||
mb|2N|nt|dburn: and he would probably have got a club lead anyway - either that, or @sA and a club shift|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Katz won't sell to 4@S, that's for sure|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, the tempo of the auction is different here|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: so also 5@s here?|pg||
nt|dburn: Bathurst doesn't want anything led - he just wants the auction in 4@s as fast as possible|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kit: And Zagorin will have no difficult finding the club lead|pg||
mb|p|an|1 key card|mb|p|nt|kit: But he believed the opponent's 4NT call|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he's not allowed to lead against his own contract|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Katz doesn't really know who can make what|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West's pass probably shows 1 keycard|pg||
nt|kit: So Katz knows 6@H can't make|pg||

nt|kit: Defense had to take heart, then 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|ybob: can E pass over 5@C in OR with @S void ?|pg||

nt|iceking: no problems with discards home, one @H and one @D is save|pg||
nt|pelu: and the @S-finess cant cost the contract |pg||
pc|h2|nt|dougdscsu: no reason to duck, either 3 or 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks if this is an upside down signal and Lall says "yes, we always play upside down"|pg||
nt|pef: you are really weighing 50 points vs. 30 points|pg||
nt|pef: if he wins and the diamond finesse is off he's minus 100 instead of -50.  if he ducks and it's on he's +420 instead of +450|pg||
nt|ritong: ...?|pg||
nt|ritong: the point is: when can it be good to duck?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell thinking about play of the hand I think - he's moving spades around, so most likely on later tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: if the answer is : never, then you don t:)|pg||
