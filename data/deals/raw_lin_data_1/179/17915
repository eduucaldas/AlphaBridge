nt|chorush: Jacek Pszczola is commonly called Pepsi, so I shall take the liberty of doing so during this viewgraph|pg||

nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfg: And there it is|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|copeyj: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=787&pid=265 for E/W|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  Hurd had to switch to a club at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|henryb:  tough switch|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|chorush: or another club. Just not a spade |pg||
nt|henryb:  tough to find 3N after that start, but maybe Woolridge should bid 3N rather than 3@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: in the other room, the trap pass of 3@D worked|pg||

nt|ady: e/w have a comfprtable 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: not sure why Roy doubled|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: perhaps x is transfer to 1@S|pg||
nt|othered1: to show @S in a transfer style?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: so here the operator is just putting in the final contract to help us catch up|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: hurd rearranging his hand below the table|pg||
nt|chorush: clever of defense to manufacture an entry for declarer to take a losing finesse. The defensive hands do not have great cummunication with each other|pg||

nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprised no opening by roy as west -he must respect the colors some of the time|pg||

mb|d|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||

nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess almost unfettered aggression cuts both ways|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||
nt|copeyj: although game not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzfd: gave Seamon one but the Polish 2@H bid interferes|pg||
nt|iceking: do we know what 2@H means|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: it's Polish I would expect 5+ 5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: wooldridge writes @H + any? and pepsi nods yes|pg||
nt|chorush: They have to contend with a Polish 2 bid, showing 5+ hearts and 5+ of another suit (or a lower suit) depending on the version they play|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: not in 3NT  the dizzy heights of 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a low spade is safest lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it would be nice tobe abale to try forslam and stop in eiterh 4NT or 5@C though - you can see whay Cohler likes his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My feeling is that the jump to6@C has bit twice though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: so, maybe 4@D was the bid that goaded West onwards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: 4@D ok, 4@S way too much|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: oposite a limited hand (NT opening) perhapsEast has the responsibility to slow things down|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: right, it's not the worst slam youve been in when you are 40 behind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think they mostly bid this slam because trailing|pg||
mb|1D|nt|copeyj: 7-4 shape led both rooms to open 4@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks to you too, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: another feisty hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|roswolf: a sensible decision by north to go quietly|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make 5@H in theory|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: prob will end in 5@C doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: support dbl|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easy, so thanks Geoffrey,Simon and specs. Bye for now:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dont like the east opening on flat 11  especially as diamonds not guaranteed|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: adam would have been better off bidding 5@C immediately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but east has a "law2 decision|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: seems they have got diamonds |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|nt|othered1: goiong for 200 against a making 4@H could be a meaningful pick-up|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

mc|5|nt|tejjyid: or, maybe it won't - how many down is this?|pg||
nt|ady: a poor result of a part score hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Everyone left again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggesting an alternative bid to 2@D is hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah that's it for play |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if whales can swim anywhere anytime, why not bridge players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imagin if every 8 board match you played was decided by 3 imps - you'd have no nervous system left|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I actually gave up opening balanced 11's after 20 years, butthen I gave up altogether soon afterwrds, 'cos I never gotany openign hands..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I need a new space bar...OK, back soon folks forthe final boards|pg||
