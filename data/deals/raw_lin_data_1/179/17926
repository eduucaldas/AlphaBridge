mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and if you do open, it would be nice to get to 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Burn, live from the venue in Antalya|pg||
nt|rv: they might get to 3n here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Hi David|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: some sympathy for that opening - quite a few intermediates|pg||
mb|p|nt|pfbr: hi david@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but 3NT certainly preferable to 4@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: this could make on a @d lead with right @s guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was it Bob Hamman who noted that one of the great traps of bidding is the 5-3 major suit fit with a pair of balanced hands?|pg||
nt|dburn: and likely to make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer could also make it on right @c guess as cards are, though I presume he will run @hs and play on @s for 9th trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might play hearts, squeezing everyone, including himself|pg||
nt|rv: well bid, better contract and right-sided as well|pg||
nt|rv: Koksoy's pass in 3rd seat with 11 hcp might be crucial in Lauria misguessing @s|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria might go down here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rv: sry Versace|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: as long as diamonds are 5-3 and South has at least one spade honour (all of which is likely from the bidding and the lead), Versace knows he will be OK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|rv: as expected|pg||

pc|h7|pc|s2|nt|dburn: North would probably not have passed in third seat with @sAQ and @dKQxxx|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: my apologies, well played, he didn't cash @h early and could play @s twice from dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: so this is the most likely way to succeed by far|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If you asked me to pick one to make a contract to save my life I would choose Lauria|pg||

nt|mamos: well done  -- as so often the great players make things look easy |pg||
nt|Walddk2: True David, I would still choose Lauria|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bjacobs: Funny, another hand where you have to stay off your 5 card spade suit on lead|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: he might have to work to make this one if South avoids a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Bill, yes, you should have been here last night when Meck made a 3NT contract destined to go 3 down|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may elect not to play the hand at all, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a tiny help from his friends|pg||
nt|rv: will Versace double in balancing seat with KX in @hs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, E/W are not going to get rich in 2@H doubled, so already they are behind the 8-ball|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I have the hand nearby|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: Well, that's a surprise|pg||
nt|dburn: well, now North will have to avoid leading his own suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/may/meckwell-heading-disaster  here it is|pg||
nt|dburn: but that may be slightly easier on the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: Versace's 2n could be conventional here, don't suppose it is natural, weak single suiter hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's also got to stay off the club lead|pg||
nt|rv: 2n could be with all competitive hands and direct 3@c/3@d would be stronger?|pg||
nt|rv: sort of good-bad 2n|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although maybe I have that wrong ... the club lead wreaks havoc with the communications, despite conceding lots of club tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|dburn: well, whatever 2NT meant to Versace was not what it meant to Lauria|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh man ... some conventional 2NT bid seems to have exploded on the launch pad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like it showed more than 13 HCP|pg||
nt|dburn: who thought his partner had another ace or so, as I admit I would have thought|pg||
nt|rv: maybe we and in all likelihood one of Versace or Lauria got meaning of 2n wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: makes us all feel good.  If it can happen to Versace Lauria ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: and even if Lauria were playing this one, I don't think I would back him to make it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: won't lead @h fdor sure|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Versace intended 2n as bad variety of good-bad 2n, Lauria took him more seriously as natural 2n|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bjacobs: Spec asking if Versace - Lauria are a new partnership ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, 11,919 BBO'ers would have led a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No further comment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Conceding the club suit like that seems to be the optimum result for the defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a strange world|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe isn't bridge wonderful |pg||
nt|dburn: well, cashing the ace of hearts and shifting to a spade would be the optimum defence|pg||
nt|rv: even on this lead, this contract hardly cold because of @d blockage and break|pg||
nt|dburn: but that would be found only in a very strange world|pg||
nt|mamos: no on predicted 4NT :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No David, this is better, because won't Versace be upset when he sees what happens in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The irritation factor has got to be worth at least an undertrick|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine he is fairly upset already - he did not want to play this in 4NT|pg||
nt|rv: poetic justice Roland?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, he has a hugely complicated decision at trick 1, even though we all know he is doomed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a greek gift?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it is true that if he finds he has four club tricks, he will be momentarily cheered, only to be dismayed again when he only has three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he could go for broke and go many down here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has to play to make it, of course|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may as well play diamonds first, I guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where he needs to .wav file of glass shattering|pg||
nt|dburn: and now I don't think he can do better than down three|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a matter of 13 or 14 IMPs away|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|mamos: it makes very little diff in imps how maNY HE GOES OFF  ONCE HES NOT MAKING|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Same as the defence taking their 6 tops ... PLUS all the sweat, tears, recrimminations ...|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|dburn: surprisingly, it does - each undertrick is an IMP until the fourth|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|rv: only temporary consolation for Versace is that since @ds don't break, he might expect 3n to be down in CR and not lose mch|pg||

nt|andyv:  if accept, response in keycard is if @s were trump?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many would play this as ace asking for spades, but that it is not a good treatment in my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you want to set spades, you must go through a cuebid first, then 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A direct 4NT is the quantitaive|pg||
nt|andyv:  most now play texas transfer and then 4N (some play 4@s over 4@h) is keycard|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: we certainly got our money's worth on that deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dburn: this one is odd - how did South come to be declarer in diamonds?|pg||
nt|mamos: no one has much of a fit here|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, I see - North bid 2NT at some point|pg||
nt|mamos: but 3@d looks very odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: and South no doubt thanked him very much for his efforts|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria's 2@d shows 6+@h limited hand and Versace can super-accept or cross 2@h with extras|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Venky|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, West generously did not double him, so he escaped quietly for down three|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can also be spades|pg||
nt|rv: 6+M|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: Is it dependent on being a passed hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: don't think so - 2@d one major, 2@h weakish with both majors, 2@s something else (can't remember what)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is invitational with 6+ clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Versace may just about be OK in this|pg||
nt|rv: not cashing second @c honor might help declarer here, no entry for North hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but the contract is a bit dodgy, so once again Lauria will let Versace play it rather than take Roland's life in his hands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace asked me for a game the other day, sadly it was not bridge|pg||
nt|rv: you politely refused?|pg||

nt|psyck: Rolands slams are very refined, about 12.89% (he does not bid slams on 3 finesses)|pg||

mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h2|nt|rv: great lead|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a careful @h9|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The auction did clue South in a little - knowing @SK will probably be on his right.   Still, it takes courage to back this up with the non-spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mamos: apologies for slight lateness|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Danish Format was devised by the Danish engineer J.H. Monrad for the Chess Olympics in 1928. It was adopted by bridge soon afterwards|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The format is known as Monrad in Denmark and Norway|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bjacobs: Nice double there, based on the horrid spade break, and the invitational auction|pg||
