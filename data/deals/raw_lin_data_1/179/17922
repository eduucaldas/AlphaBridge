mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: leads 3 or low|pg||
nt|glen: or in 3rd seat anything goes|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's pass is encouraging as normally played, then sough would bid 6D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: they invert meaning of  pass/dbl  in forcing situations|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||

mb|1H|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: full credit to system there|pg||

nt|marlowepi: is not exactly weak in an absolute sense, but IF he catches a fit then his defensive potential plummets|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17    NS NT range varies a bit|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: specifically announced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4th best diamond lead will let 3nt make i think, if declarer reads it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i meant MY guess was close enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: the EW system summary form just says  "strong nt"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: slam on a finesse, another hand welcomed by the lagging team, but I am not sure Gordon can take advantage on tis.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perfect fitting cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson says use your judgement|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: actually the defence may still be able to hold the position|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S only game in with a theoretical chance, but would need hand record to make it|pg||
nt|athene: north has to just keep a diamond, the @HA and @SQxx, and he has enough room for that even when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless low D lead of course:)|pg||
nt|athene: low diamond lead looks very normal from south's hand|pg||
nt|athene: with no sure entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding  usually    upside-down: count, attitude, suit pref AND smith   but there are exceptions|pg||
nt|athene: but berkowitz shouldn't be that happy about playing notrumps, with those clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure i agree. as W is marked with a lot of cards in 2 suits, likely to be short in diamonds. so a top diamond is not that likely to cost and may gain hugely|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a 5-5 fit it just doesn't bode well for notrumps because it ties up too many of your cards; there is almost sure to be a weakness elsewhere|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west is likely to have short diamonds, but east isn't?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 92 where bigtrain  [johnson] made 4@S  his teammates were in 4@H down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cokin is telling Johnson its his lead and he is a kibitizer and Johnson says the bidding is not over|pg||
nt|athene: east might try 4@S now :)|pg||
nt|athene: or 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: he still isn't sure which major west actually has, so he can't really offer 4@S as the moysian of choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is, W is likely short and thus N probably doesnt have a doubleton. so top card picks up a stiff honor in dummy and doesnt have much downside. here it reaps an unexpected ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: windfall, but that is not the reason for the high D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Doug has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might find it works nicely when it picks up stiff @DQ/@DJ in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tell Allan the first tournament one attends is always the hardest :)|pg||
nt|glen: can Cokin take over for him?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOLL|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didn't think kib were allowed to talk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe he sang it|pg||
nt|athene: or signalled it in semaphore :)|pg||
nt|glen: its only the us trials, at club games not allowed to talk|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many creative ways to bypass these regulations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct spelling is      guidelines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and STILL we're ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is in the tank|pg||
nt|glen: a problem here for E is a little as @D Txx in W can produce hands that play best in 3NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he had to "GO GET" a director? cab to the casino?|pg||
nt|glen: *as little|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in suit   that translates to 2 quick losers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: NS just don't have the power to bid this almost 50% slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: even 9xx could be enough. even if 5 card suit on lead, third hand may have HTx|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you start trying to imagine particular layouts it's easy to think of ones to support almost any action|pg||
nt|athene: so that is a bad way to go about bidding i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: laugh is who was thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: not sure if this asks for count or attitude :(|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: it tends to obscure the odds play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure this asks attitude|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, if we carry that line of thought to its conclusion, we stop visualizing typical hands for partner and just bid our points|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Johnson says we can miss a slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well, when they see all the cards they won't be too upset, as they won't expect EW at the other table to be making any game|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm, west has the sort of hand that sometimes forces people to respond 2@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you play weckmell style supp X, on all hands with 3 card support, you could still easily belong in 3N and methods need toprovide for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: pass forcing   |pg||
nt|gracelin: whatever method they use, I would encourage partner to double with the suth hand.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: well, just deciding to give up on 3nt whenever opps overcall and raise is a possible position you might take|pg||

pc|d8|nt|vugraphzfe: He has one :) says Berky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great bid from Berk|pg||
nt|gracelin: thought 5 imps away they can afford that.  Anyway better than 5D -1 for 13 imps.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: but what do you have to lose by broadening the scope of inquiry? what is the downside of the more flexible interpretation?|pg||
nt|athene: east has a fairly natural 2@S rebid but he doubles in case west has a diamond stack i suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all are taking deep breaths at this table|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he is catering for long hearts opposite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of Big Club/limited 1M   sonty might have tried  1@S-4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cokin asks if anybody is there and Berkowitz responds you and me boy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: deep breaths cater for long hearts:) especially when players reach this age:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 3N if that shows 3M(433) as Choice of Game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal  17+ bal|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so tuen the M and W upside down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force  @S or BAL     then we see what Berk bids|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|glen: weckmell lite is where you play everything upside down lightly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: calling my lawyer right now to secure the intellectual property rights|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: there is an RM Lite [aka Meckwell Light]    so maybe  our pair  RM Jr|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D perhaps just fractionally on the wet side of sensible?|pg||
nt|glen: 1@H by N is a game force, @S or big bal|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's ok at game all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  that's right Glen   if BAL then 11-13|pg||
nt|athene: now i assume NS play pass/double inversion|pg||
nt|gracelin: the match is getting more exciting.  Only 16 imps difference with 3 boards to go, and we heard, some swingy boards.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfe: Simson asks what is 3 clubs|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
nt|athene: the pass basically asks partner to double|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in match to determine who meets our winner   Wolfson over Silverstein by 30  with 5 to score|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess they will also end up in 5C and -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the various possibilities show slightly different hands depending whether the strong side have agreed a fit or not|pg||
nt|glen: i prefer 6@C to 6@D, the short @D implied by not doubling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did great job of crowding the auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but he wants to keep grand in picture|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about 5N|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: however understand 6@D, S wants to play 6@S opposite @S, and higher opposite big bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: uh oh|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks that south has just a monster one suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another reason for 5N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction strongly suggest  @S|pg||
nt|athene: south could have bid 5nt pick a slam over 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: but he wanted to emphasize the void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even now  6@S accounts for both of North's possible hands|pg||
nt|athene: i think it was optimistic to imagine that partner would be able to bid a grand slam though|pg||
nt|athene: when you are looking at all those honours, you really expect partner to bid 7?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: whoa |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it was identical auction until Sontag's PASS|pg||
nt|gracelin: a great decision by Alan, at the risk of missing a Vul. game.  Very discipline bidder.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and it's the location of the DK to decide the merit of his courageous pass.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as if not enough drama with the bidding/play    we're adding wonders of connectivity|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: thinking|pg||
nt|gracelin: rehi|pg||
nt|gracelin: wonder if this 6 imps be crucial in the outcome of this match.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: auction reduces the deck to 30 or 34 points   |pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfe: now Simson in the thinker pose|pg||
nt|glen: 6@S = punt problem to other side of table|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Rodinwell|pg||
nt|athene: couldn't north have the 11-13 balanced for his bidding so far?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think clever sequence from Johnson  even if they don't find either grand, he sure did try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are reasonably safe as long as they dont go past 8NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe [keword]  11-13 bal bids 6N at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or stop in a red suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: according to the way some people play pass/double inversion, south should actually not have bid 3@H because that shows a 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is now asking a questions|pg||
nt|athene: given NS were in a game force at that point|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: sticky situation. hard to evaluate N final decision without knowing a lot that we dont know, like what is a typical hand for the N pass over 5D|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: but this RDBL wasn't points  it just showed @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes sometimes they do, but in my opium it should have backfired there. when red opps jam to 5D their fit is pure. all the more reason to be bullish with the NS cards|pg||
