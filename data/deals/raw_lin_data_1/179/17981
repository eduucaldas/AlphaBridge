mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|kit: push limit raise leads to no-play game off first 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Kranyak says call me the "lady man on this board"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East was perhaps looking for a few more men, or preferably, bullets|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, @HK instead of @HQ is now suddenly an ok vul game|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: Just proving that  bidding is not an exact science|pg||
nt|kit: admittedly a little unlucky king of diamonds opposite singleton.  With king of hearts instead,   game would be fine|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Thought East might try to sneak a diamond at trick 2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: good news is no cards have been played|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The internet belched?|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: yes it has overeaten today|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 8 matches being shown|pg||
nt|bjacobs: a surfeit of bridge today on BBO|pg||
nt|kit: declarer not trying to steal diamond trick -- instead by going after hearts first hoping to make defenders think hand is other than what it is.|pg||
nt|kit: A very sensible approach|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good point Kit, and perhaps another way to sneak a diamond would be to discard all three of them on hearts?|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- many possibilities.|pg||
nt|kit: and the did steal it in the closed room at least according to the scoreboard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: screen down by Wolpert to ask ? of Moss|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I followed the play, but it stopped at the crucial moment.  Declarer did try to sneak a diamond, apparently, so no idea how it made|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Unless, club ace was ducked, then three clubs pitched on the good hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: finger on club a|pg||

nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||

nt|puncher99: welcome to the spectators and the operator|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: ah he didnt play the ace|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dQ|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||
nt|passell: or catching 3 spades in the weak 2 bidders hand|pg||
nt|psyck: At this vul, 2@h-x-pass could well be the favorite|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the cards this favorable game might conceiveably be made|pg||
pc|h4|nt|passell: looks like down 2|pg||
nt|gulyas: he could make with W having 3631, and @SJ9 doubleton in E|pg||
nt|passell: yes exactly or both dia onside and east forgetting to cover the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: welcom -- sorry for the slightly late start|pg||

nt|kit: From the closed room movie, the result there looks suspect|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Moss's comment is spot on.  This was a very tricky defensive hand, with the heart threat|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: undisclosed|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I think Gitelman Moss are one of the world's greatest pairs ... though they fly under the radar somewhat|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S extremely lucky make here, and was bid in closed room|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: you can say that again|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kit: If Moss invites, Gitelman will reject everything |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Gitelman is doing something here that is worth paying attention to.  He rebids 2@S, then 3@D, showing his weak 6-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: big yawn by Kranyak|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Rather than rebid 2@D the first time|pg||
nt|kit: So this will be 6 IMPs for Deutsch.  Wish we knew for sure whether or not 4@S made on the first board in other room.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s will be no picnic for declarer|pg||

nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||
nt|puncher99: choice of lebensol or neg x here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: more ketchup?|pg||
nt|puncher99: may be playing better minor lebensol|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: making |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||

nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like 8 tricks here...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|caitlin: Greetings|pg||
pc|sK|nt|viren169: and probably a flat bd|pg||
pc|s6|nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
pc|s9|nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Apart from the incredibly fortunate spade position, his @CKQ just happened to be opposite the doubleton rather than the singleton|pg||

pc|c9|nt|vugraphzfe: rusinow leads|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now Wolpert is looking at convention cards for leads|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT a lot more secure, but it looks like 4@H will stagger home.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What do you think Kit about West's rebid after the transfer?   I must admit, 3NT looks more appropriate than 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: I think 3NT is percentage action, but obviously 4@H could be right ifpartner has weak spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, but he'd not only have to have weak spades, he'd also presumably have only 2 hearts (to pass 3NT), so it seems a small target|pg||
nt|kit: With something like QJxxx of hearts and maybe no entry, more argument for 4@H call|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So a hand where you expect to have to run hearts, but don't think they can run in notrumps, due to no entry|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer still not home in his mind, since the fourth round of clubs is a problem.  He doesn't know how favorably the diamonds are.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Wolpert and Moss have a discussion|pg||
nt|kit: right Bill|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Trying to cross ruff it, somehow|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will still survive -- he can pitch his club on the third round of diamonds, and ruff is with natural trump trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Wolpert is pulling his hair a bit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: don't blame him|pg||
nt|kit: and if he ruffs a spade, that lives also|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he needs a succession of good things to happen|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: keeps pulling the king of diamonds to the front of his cards|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will ruff a spade and play a diamond up -- he knows he isn't overruffed in spades as North marked with queen|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Now the club ruff with the queen is 100% safe for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|2N|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
nt|viren169: anothe dble by greco?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 2n=leb or scramble I guess|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|viren169: looks like leb|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
nt|viren169: this is destined to go 1 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|d6|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
nt|viren169: with 2@S likely to make another flatish bd|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|d8|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
nt|puncher99: mite b goin to 4hrts|pg||
nt|puncher99: if they find 44|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a good raise|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Susan|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4h but not 4s|pg||
nt|caitlin: Board 105...can't make 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: bd 105 or 106?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 105|pg||
nt|caitlin: 106|pg||
mb|4H|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
nt|viren169: re|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
nt|ybob: re :)|pg||
nt|viren169: a t/out dble would have been more interesting!|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 is correct|pg||
nt|jtmckee: sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: i don't have it anymore|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3@S limit in hearts with spades|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
nt|ybob: E-W can win 3NT |pg||
nt|jtmckee: 4 s can be beat with a d tap|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|caitlin: which one Jay?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
nt|viren169: spade lead may defeat 3N|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if duck first trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: or second trick too|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so good result for n-s|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||
nt|jtmckee: this one|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ybob: win and @D ...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bessi2: indeed... seems to be by far the safest line|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @HA|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|passell: good sing 10 of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wb Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 106 made|pg||
nt|jtmckee: 106 was mistake|pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: making 6 is easier in 5  than in 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day mike|pg||
pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: Covering was a mistake I fear|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: indeed|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably holds at least one of the high hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|viren169: with the @cs breaking 3@D looks like 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: Now declarer needs all three spades and a club to live|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ybob: only @H lead from N defeat 3NT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
mc|10|nt|psyck: some invert the meanings of pass & double in forcing pass situations|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: 4@H down one is an excellent result for the Diamond team.  5@D looks easy|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: they actually got blown out of their 12-card diamond fit in closed room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@H - passed versus 1@H doubled |pg||
nt|bjacobs: what do we all think about South's decision over 1@H?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Still, you would think North would take a chance and bid 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Takeout double looks clear to me on South hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I guess the @HQJx turned him off in the CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: moss lays his hand down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: About the takeout double decision.  The question is this:|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Does a double suggest 4 spades?  Or does it suggest "support for the other 3 suits"?|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c110|st||md|4SKQTH2DQ8432CA642,S942HKT64D5CQJT53,S653HQJ3DAKJT976C,SAJ87HA9875DCK987|sv|o|nt|passell: quite a bid by wolpert   3nt has the widest possible range|pg||
nt|benjent: Goodness me. The dealing machine is still set on "goulash" :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|sommer: a-live:)|pg||
nt|sommer: live!|pg||
nt|roswolf: good always good to see some real bridge|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|jtmckee: makes 5d n-s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
nt|ybob: 140 here|pg||
nt|viren169: best to pass with a mis-fit|pg||
nt|caitlin: 5@D|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow he passed|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
nt|ybob: 11 now|pg||
nt|viren169: defense need to be quick to hold it to 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|viren169: but not on that lead!|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the same 11 tricks as the OR|pg||
nt|ybob: not sure if he play to 11, K@D @S to  k@S and low @C ?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
pc|d3|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dT|nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: will try a @S now|pg||
nt|ybob: now 10|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jtmckee: so down 2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtmckee: 1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
mc|9|nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|benjent: 2 off? Kranyak's just going to pump @c's and accept a certain fate I would think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: ducked c a|pg||
nt|jtmckee: on 106?|pg||
pg||
