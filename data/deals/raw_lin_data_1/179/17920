mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|bobh1: wolfson stayed out of the auction...a very good move|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty decent spot, but not necessarily as these cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3N is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents quiet, they're unlikely to be able to find it.  |pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder what E is thinking about?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: don't know but she is thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: not slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bobh1: apparently yes she is thinking of slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|othered1: Is that kickback (RKC in @H?)|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: doesnt seem like her partner can have 3 kcs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: why not -- isn't she unlimited?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west, I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i guess you're right forgot that E reversed|pg||
mb|7H|nt|Vugraphzfc: obviously she expected more from 3@H (not 4@H)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: did well to find 3N in other room|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H by west over 2@H, "fast arrival," I guess would require east to always have either 4@H or 3@S.  Is that absolute in their style?|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|bobh1: senseless overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good point|pg||
nt|bobh1: reminds of the hand that won the Cavendish for Stewart-Woolsey|pg||
nt|bobh1: Stewart's  opponent opened 4@H and he was inspired to pass a hand than many would overcall 4@S with|pg||
nt|othered1: This was going to be a big swing to Wolfson, now merely bigger maybe 16 instead of 12.|pg||

nt|andyv:  I play that acceptance at 3 level just shows 4 pieces and does not say whether min. or max. nt|pg||

nt|andyv:  game is a little better than 50% here|pg||
nt|bobh1: true it is a good game|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|benjy: it must have been|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing the great one|pg||
nt|benjy: best is to win in hand and play a @H i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and zia's fire will be met with fire|pg||
nt|benjy: Carroll will be delighted that his partner had a trump to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=14  for results|pg||
nt|benjy: over the moon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This has been a double elimination format where the one remaining undefeated team, Penfold, have special privileges. They can choose their opponents in the semi-finals, and they ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: can elect to play a 40-board match if they are behind after 32 (but they can only do it once). |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Penfold vs Hinden in the other SF|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Maybe @sK then @c?|pg||
nt|mamos: It's an interesting twist that MOssop beat Hinden by 62 imps in the first round  so a final rematch would have some "history" :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 52  |pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in such positions you just set up dummy's long suit because then at least that's one suit the defence can't play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: and you let them do other things to help you|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes bad things happen to good games|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|benjy: if you are going to play on @Cs then is there any gain in taking the @SK as opposed to running it to hand?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hi All|pg||
nt|mamos: Heart certainly looks best|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men med 3-3, går det väl också hem|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|hesse: ikke lett å bete denne kontrakten, forsvaret var avhengig av @c stjeling som ikke er lett å finne|pg||
nt|athene: but that really only works well when there aren't any clear avenues of attack for them|pg||
nt|xenya: 7th trick|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: surprising duck|pg||
nt|athene: here they would just plod away at spades|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the fouled board from the last set?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it had 2 @d5's & no @h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably some other board had two @H5's and no @D5   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe nobody noticed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N trying to come up with a way toget 4 more tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: west just not reading his partner's @C3 on the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|benjy: was east correct in ducking the opening lead?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjy: perhaps he wished to keep an entry for later?|pg||
nt|athene: he wasn playing declarer for AK or AQ doubleton|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|nt|benjy: Just going back to the bidding, what do you guys think of the 1S opener? Personally i prefer 1@C as i would really like a @C lead, however i accept that there is pre-emptive value ...|pg||
nt|benjy: to 1@S|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Rätt Arild eftersom utgången i alla fall hänger på tr 3-3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hate 1S if opening at all 1c|pg||
nt|benjy: east has made a mess of this, why not ruff in and continue trumps?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Stratford-upon-Avon is a market town and civil parish in south Warwickshire, England. The town is a popular tourist destination owing to its status as birthplace of the playwright ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and poet William Shakespeare, receiving about three million visitors a year from all over the world|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Maximising the third seat pre-emptive value John|pg||
nt|benjy: and also when partner thinks you have 5 then sometimes they jump to the three level and get doubled|pg||
nt|jcomyn: still dont like it andf shd have been -300|pg||
nt|ianmcc: fittingly board  1 much ado about nothing|pg||

nt|hesse: her var det flere mindre gode vurderinger|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll if WEst wins this hed better know what to do next|pg||
nt|henryb:  which normally denies a spade control|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|psyck: Basically NS play a simple 2/1 udca, & EW play a more complicated version|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  1@s should prevail but E will work hard to not lose any imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: declarer can't get back to hand but if she leads the @CQ, then the @CJ10x come down|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer can't get off the dummy though, so this will still fail|pg||
nt|athene: i mean lead @CQ after winning the king and unblocking in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even then a diamond shift takes the entry out before west's trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: so you still can't use the @C9 as a discard|pg||
nt|xenya: even that won'y help him|pg||
nt|benjy: her|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is similar to a 4@S in the semi-final|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @C9 here is playing for east to have misdefended|pg||
nt|athene: because with @CJ10x, objectively, he had to split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Aj10 of clubs with East is best faint hope|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E hesitated before playing @c3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjy: pitch a @C on the established @S winner and lead trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course East would have played the 10 but sometimes people make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: now she might continue @CQ but really east can't do anything then but play a diamond, can he?|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hesse: og tilslutt endte det meget heldig for nordmennene som lå inne for slakt|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|joest: garner may be just working through whether north is more like to have stiff ace of hearts or A10xx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: vad kostar 5@dX 500 eller 800|pg||
nt|athene: he might be worried she has @DQx(x) in hand but if she has, there's no stopping the contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: sabine could have walked into it here she could be going for a number instead of -80|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no upside|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: think all the same that N action very dangerous on vul|pg||
nt|friggi: strange line of play|pg||
nt|benjy: very odd, did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: ok, good play to give the defence a chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: now there is no point playing for 4-1 trumps (so you can cash the @C9) because then east would have a trump winner anyway|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mamos: NS  making their aggressive intentions clear from the very first boards  -  the opening skirmishes of the longer battle|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, she is obviously pursuing an aggressive policy (early on at least)|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed Ben but tommy doesnt know how to spell PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you double there as often as possible|pg||
nt|athene: because your main upside is the penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|benjy: but you know partner isn't passing with the north hand|pg||
nt|benjy: looking at the north cards|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: well, it's unlikely if east is sane, but if partner DOES have a pass, it's big money territory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 10 tricks-as long as she doesnt cover this(she wont)|pg||
nt|athene: and we saw here east doesn't really have a 2@C overcall|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: according to the textbooks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|friggi: it is agressive at least|pg||
nt|andyv:  then E bid 2@c and W invited with 3@d|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|benjy: but if partner bids 2@S which they often will, won't you wish you had passed out 2@C?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|athene: 2@H is risky, i agree, because it's a misfit auction - hearts can easily be north's best suit here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hesse: Nå er gjerne spillefører glad hun ikke fikk @d ut|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not 10 tricks |pg||
nt|athene: partner will usually have five spades to bid 2@S there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 now|pg||
nt|mamos: it depends on which textbooks you have|pg||
nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i agree, it can go wrong|pg||
nt|peachy: At IMP scoring, this was probably what one might call "insurance" just in case 4H makes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjy: I agree with one of the specs that if you are going to bid then at least overcall directly then you have the upside of getting to a game|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately we only have brief system summaries & no detail convention cards avaialble for the pairs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|benjy: but passing is also a big position, so it's not clear|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: this one is kinda good for Mr F|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Usually played as 11-15.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||

nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||

nt|athene: will zia try a slam on a finesse?|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: the only time you lead to the queen is if you need two fast diamonds or you have only one dummy entry and you have to play the suit immediately|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|psyck: 2@d multi for 1 major|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s = pass/correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3S is P or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since he just wants to keep her off lead to stop her cashing that thirteenth heart|pg||
nt|joest: yes.   It certainly met the % requirements for a vul game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hesse: Rimstedt overfører til @s|pg||
nt|nubmaster: x=3-stöd|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think Jill and Bob are playing forcing passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NS will find their way to 4S I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: syd vil nok stå på til utgang, tror dere ikke?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Nu kommer Mikael säkert att bjuda utgång, eller åtminstone invit|pg||
nt|henryb:  In fact with brilliant guessing N-S can make 6N, 6@s or 6@d. But unlikely to bid any slam|pg||
nt|henryb:  or make one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: Sabine would prefer to open that hand 1@H i am sure! (in her regular partnership she plays 4-card majors)|pg||
nt|benjy: could she be 4351 for this bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@C must be splinter with four spades so i guess either is possible|pg||
nt|ybob: 300 |pg||
nt|psyck: South heard enuf & is glad to be saved from an awkward decision|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nubmaster: 3@s nu och S måste passa|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: garbage Stayman|pg||
nt|ybob: good result to NS, probably down 1 in 5m|pg||
nt|psyck: true|pg||
nt|joest: g-w might be able to get this 2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcomyn: danger levels on the horizon|pg||
nt|joest: should be able to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT either showing clubs or a puppet to 3@c, may bid again|pg||
nt|andyv:  Jill and Jill...sorry|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is quite a nice position to play transfers after the double|pg||
nt|bobh1: looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe but auction is odd|pg||
nt|bobh1: S just didnt have enough to bid 4N|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: 3nt???|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Om partnern har 2 stick som krävs så lirar nog 4@s minst lika bra|pg||
nt|athene: zia loves all his cards now - @DQJ doubleton were a bit rubbish when he picked the hand up but they improved when partner opened 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks Hearts agreed|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence from west - most Acol players would bid 2@S second time|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: maybe they play that as constructive with five spdes|pg||
nt|benjy: they must play it as something|pg||
nt|athene: or a relay perhaps|pg||
nt|psyck: the Rumpelsohl version uses transfers, I suppose regular leb here though|pg||
nt|psyck: either way, they bidding would be the same|pg||
nt|psyck: *the|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  but she had more than enough to open...her opening bid was not a passs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: shows what i know|pg||
nt|benjy: 4nt looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|mamos: EAst has asked for Spade lead but Diamond looks best |pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer can throw a diamond on a spade and take a ruffing diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to go down yet though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is this hopeless? one pointed suit give pitches for the other|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hesse: nord kan kanskje vinne denne?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: går att spela hem|pg||
nt|psyck: transfers generally have the advantage of being able to show an additionaly hand type, at the cost of a natural bid|pg||
nt|psyck: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
nt|peachy: In 4, play presents no problems|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not hopeless at all|pg||
nt|joest: garner has a tough exit if he does overruff this|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hesse: men det skal spilles pent|pg||
nt|athene: does he have the required entries? i think he does - he can just set up dummy|pg||
nt|athene: @S9, @D109|pg||
nt|athene: ah no, the ruffing finesse not enough|pg||
nt|benjy: you have to pitch a @D on the established @S and then take a ruffing @D finesse to make|pg||
nt|athene: since he has only one trump left|pg||
nt|athene: he has to actually drop the doubleton @DK|pg||
nt|bobh1: I think someone said the board was marked incorrectly |pg||
nt|bobh1: it indicated W was the dealer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yes.  The board was marked as W dealer.  Should have been S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Apparently, I was supposed to say something|pg||
nt|andyv:  so W passed initially and not S?|pg||
nt|bobh1: right|pg||
nt|bobh1: W passed and N acceoted it|pg||
nt|andyv:  strange... they didn't have that problem in other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: right ... but BBO does not let me pass out of turn :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  good luck with revokes:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have a different set of boards over there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: the boards are duplicated ... so it was a different physical board|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty:)...in meantime, back to the contract...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I told the director.  That is how I found out I should have noticed the problem and said something before the bidding started|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I have all I can do to keep up with normal things ... not up to abnormal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: They are taking a short break|pg||
nt|andyv:  It doesn't make sense for the operators to take active roles.  Are you supposed to tell them about revokes since bbo won't accept those either?|pg||

mc|11|nt|nubmaster: oj|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. cash the @DA and lead the @D2, not the @D10|pg||
nt|benjy: this won't make, surely he will just take a @D finesse|pg||
nt|athene: too hard (in my opinion)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well zia will give it his best shot|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate all these dull boards!! :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well this one DID look dull|pg||
nt|athene: sabine's missing fifth diamond is costly :) you are right, 4-3-5-1 would have had much more offensive potential|pg||
nt|benjy: yes but the downside of no eight card fit|pg||
nt|benjy: the specs have suggested that Sabine would bid 2nt to show 4@S over the 2@S enquiry and hence 4@C showed 4441|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there's plenty of room to show the shape exactly over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but you would need to be a more longstanding partnership than NS i think for that|pg||
nt|athene: now zia knows if he draws trumps he is short of tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine he will take straightforward finesse|pg||
nt|benjy: opposite a 4441 i think Zia had a slam try not a slam drive personally, if he had just bid 4@D that would involve partner, but perhaps he thought 4@C showed extras?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: thats why he is Zia|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamonds or nt?|pg||

nt|psyck: S may not wan't to give up easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, true, the diamond pitch was revealing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hesse: nord vil neppe tilføye noe nå|pg||
nt|peachy: For many 2/1 players, 1C-1NT = 8-10, 1D is used as temporizing bid when fewer than 8HCP and no 4-card major|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi|pg||
nt|henryb:  and 1@c-1@d-1@h is not a balanced hand|pg||
nt|joest: thats what explains 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: S got enuf room to show his hand other room & could lie low on 4@h|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D response of course can also be natural and unlimited, just isnt here :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is either 4-4-4-1 or promises 5+@c|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|joest: great lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N |pg||
nt|joest: now this is an interesting trick one issue.   Some players just play 'automatic count' when the queen appears in the dummy.  Others signal attitude|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hesse: der tok jeg feil :)|pg||
nt|hesse: så får vi se om syd finner trumfvarianten|pg||
nt|athene: that is always something to watch out for - if a defender pitches a painless early card from a suit where dummy has four, it's almost aways from 5+|pg||
nt|athene: you just need partner to have @SA or @CK and one heart stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR bidding 1@c 3@c (limit raise) and N passed|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|hesse: og så skal @ceren løses|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Totalställningen just nu: Nor 77, Dan 75, Sve 73, Fin 55|pg||
nt|hesse: mye som skal ordnes før hjemgang kan noteres|pg||
nt|hesse: eller er kontrakten alltid beit?|pg||
nt|hesse: Kurt Ove Thommasen kommenterer at det mangler overgang til intrafinessen|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Man kan spela @h mot J och tar V så spelar man J sen|pg||
nt|hesse: dermed ender det kanskje med 9 stikk om syd løser @cfargen|pg||
nt|hesse: *Thomassen|pg||
nt|benjy: if 3nt is the right spot then 2@S will get you there, i don't understand the reasoning behind 3@C|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not know what G-W open with 1-4-4-4, so ...|pg||
nt|joest: 1=4=4=4 = 1@d|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: yes it was a bit odd|pg||
nt|psyck: he can crossruff a few now|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|hesse: spar ut vil kanskje også gjøre spillefører noe kort og rar i @h..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: having decided not to bid 1NT over 1H then over 3H it looked a good idea|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: i thought at first south was bidding 3@C with the idea that if it went 3@H P P he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe even taking @c fin on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: yep A@D , @C finesse , then ruff @D and @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s xfer to @c|pg||
nt|henryb:  that's what I do also; its nice to know that I am not alone.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: sort of trying to coax a 3nt bid from partner|pg||
nt|joest: Jill gave her a partner a suit pref for spades by returning a high diamond|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|athene: whereas if you start 2@S and it goes 3@H P P|pg||
nt|athene: now you can't really show the club stop and ask for a heart stop|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjy: why did it look a good idea? you have nothing in @S, one stop in @@H and need pd to have solid @Ds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: I thinK West can hardly be blamed for discarding a Diamond from the cards he held|pg||
nt|jcomyn: wonder what is wests normal lead without the x from e|pg||

pc|d3|nt|joest: yeah|pg||
nt|peachy: good def|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, I guess it does|pg||
nt|joest: heart pitch does no good and he runs out of his own trumps before he gets hearts going|pg||
nt|henryb:  I guess he needed to win the @cA, or start @h before playing @c|pg||
nt|peachy: he had too much to do from the beginning|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: from garner's perspective, declarer has four club tricks + 2 spades + 1 heart. He has to play partner for the @hj|pg||

nt|peachy: It is a style matter, many have agreed not to pass with an ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or even discarding @h instead of @d on the 3rd @c, prevents entry to South for trump promotion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so East will make a try|pg||
nt|psyck: 14-16 is close to the borderline between strong & weak NT's, so those who play different defenses against strong/weak, will need to be clear what they play there (generally ...|pg||

nt|henryb:  snd me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: it will cost her a trump trick to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: but that may be safest which is most important|pg||
nt|joest: yes and then you :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|benjy: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: S has discouraged @c by 4 & 2, and N decides to continue defending passively|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobh1: thx for clarifying|pg||
nt|andyv:  3C is natural (I think); 3D is a relay.  Now this should start shortness.|pg||

nt|joest: not sure what Steve was looking for with a low heart back there to be quite honest|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfh: W ;;; "hmmm"|pg||
nt|psyck: Dec can't see his way to 9 tricks, probably cause they aren't there|pg||
nt|ybob: try @D now|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, he may run @d9 for want of anything better to do|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@D discard shows like and  5 surely but  ...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|nt|bobh1: disappointing that they did not double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie said Russ should be 3154|pg||
nt|andyv:  worried perhaps that 6N may make?|pg||
nt|bobh1: N had the trumps, S had the points|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4c set H's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4d said did not like Hs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4s was blackwood|pg||

nt|henryb:  I think they couldn't quite blow it|pg||
nt|henryb:  they certainly seem to be trying|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps Garner is concerned that south has 7 seven spades in which case he needs to switch to a club right now but then declarer would still be cold|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hesse: nå kan Sverige ta beta om de spiller @h|pg||
nt|henryb:  partner probably would not pass 2@sX with a singleton @s|pg||
nt|joest: fair enough|pg||
nt|joest: then just give him a ruff and be done with it?|pg||
nt|joest: although as against that, he might have nowhere to run|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: anyway sometime before dawn, this will drift one away|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: hehe|pg||
nt|henryb:  Well, he didn't show 4@h, and he has only 6@d, so he would have to have 4@c with a stiff @s|pg||

nt|psyck: S knew that if dec had @sKQ, there were 9 tricks, so the @d discard was ill judged|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mamos: that was a quick +12 or whatever|pg||

nt|peachy: North chose 1C with 1-4-4-4, matter of partnership agreement whether 1C or 1D|pg||
nt|henryb:  see, Jack, some people open 1@c with 4-4 in the mminors|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hesse: kun 1 imp som skiller|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 8 tricks and run|pg||
nt|benjy: what was the range for 1NT? was it 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: yes|pg||
nt|benjy: hands up if you X with the south cards?|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately the chances of leading @s on that bidding were zilch|pg||
nt|joest: a revolting development from east's point of view|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c was not what East wanted to see  |pg||
nt|joest: some pairs (like Meckwell once upon a time) have even conventionalized the 4@c response|pg||
nt|bobh1: I'm sure we will find out they somehow stumble into 4@H|pg||
nt|joest: just not us dinosaurs|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like 2@d is red suit flannery|pg||
nt|joest: i guess they rebid 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 4@c is a little harder to make than 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Er der et resultat, der skal rettes, Signe?|pg||
nt|hesse: operatør, kan du endre spill 20 til 2 bet?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobh1: see i was right|pg||
nt|peachy: I like clear "rules. 3-3 1C, 4-4 1D|pg||
nt|henryb:  well I would open 1@d and rebid 1N -- I want to make it easy for partner to bid a non-forcing 2@h with 5-4 in the majors|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|benjy: So west had a normal pass, opposite a 15-17 then west is always going to bid game|pg||
nt|psyck: that vul game will cost a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: J is std|pg||
nt|bobh1: never heard of that one andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Russ showed 2542 with Ax or Kx in one of dbletons|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N was inquiry, 3N was balance and gene saxe tells me 4@c was further inquiry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4c set H's 4H said did not like slam chances|pg||
nt|peachy: And 1D even with some 4d-5c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: the auction tempoed completely different next door, after South had opened|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Giv mig spil nr. spilfører, og antal stik, så får du koden|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 4HS-2|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjy: in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: not me i don't think|pg||
nt|benjy: not me|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjy: but don't you make 9 tricks on a @H lead?|pg||
nt|benjy: so was there a @S lead in the other room perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: OK, will sign off and try to check the network before the next set|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it would have to have been @s 10|pg||
nt|athene: but 1NT sort of counts as a club bid so maybe this is just showing majors|pg||
nt|athene: and doesn't promise clubs at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest: turns out they needed to be playing hearts quickly|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|joest: Meyers perhaps played too quickly.  She can see spades a risk.  Winning the second diamond and switching to hearts is a path to four tricks from her vantage point|pg||
nt|joest: even so Garner would need to be pretty double dummy to make it now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: Henry made comvincing argument in favor of 1D|pg||
nt|henryb:  not me. I prefer that my partner not take a preference to @d with equal length in the minors|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: and pass says "bob's your uncle"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk3: Klik på MOVIE og overskriv|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice when an auction works the way it was drawn|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: they will now play 95 replacement board which I do not have|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie's in 3NT ... but without seeing hand I can only report on outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I could describe what the players are wearing to keep everyone entertained but just not that interesting|pg||
nt|bobh1: do you know what the contract in the other room was?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i dont|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|joest: of course in the days of the dinosaurs, you opened 1@h, the suit below the singleton|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: you had no problems finding your 4-4 heart fit back in the day!|pg||
pc|s7|nt|benjy: or me it just shows the majors, but you have so much in the minors|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, 11 imps - 1NT= at the othe table|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|joest: on the actual lie, Garner could have made this by discarding on the diamond and forcing Meyers to ruff.|pg||
nt|joest: maybe not such a bad line either|pg||
nt|psyck: may well go a couple down playing for black suits fav now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was the age of the trilobytes, pre dinosaur|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|joest: i'm surprised no king of spades there.  the position seemed sort of clear|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: defence looking good now - diamond, club, spade, club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not necessarily in that order, as Eric Morecambe said to Andre Previn |pg||
nt|psyck: NS have bought the countract relatively cheaply anyway with opps holding the balance of the pack, so will be ok with -1|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|athene: well, it's love all, you aren't too happy letting opps play 1nt|pg||

pc|c7|nt|mamos: those eight went in a flash|pg||
nt|benjy: 4 imps to Sinclair when 1NT was passed un the OR and made 90|pg||
nt|athene: one other point worth a mention|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's really important to get into the bidding over 1nt if you have only a 4-4 fit |pg||
nt|athene: because that 44 fit just isn't taking so many tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: so with 44 majors maybe double 1nt is right and you just accept the other flaws|pg||

nt|henryb:  and Weinstein, with four good trumps AND 4 Aces will certainly cooperate|pg||
mb|4N|nt|joest: 2@c is artificial|pg||
nt|joest: he may just blackwood, then announce all the aces to see if his partner can kick it in|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a tad overboard|pg||
nt|joest: gazzilli yesw|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rmb1: For EW 1C is clubs and 1S is spades :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North will be a bit surprised to find his partner with two hearts |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: after only minor fit found, 3@h should be asking for check & not a cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the time to try anything fancy on lead|pg||
nt|ybob: S could bid X over 2@H ...|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N just assumed opps to have 9 card fit for bidding to 4 level, but not at this vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N and E pantomining something ... now i think discussing 3H bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: W is definitely in the tank|pg||
nt|psyck: If he finds @hA lead, @h4 (udca) will be a clear enough signal even if dec drops @hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as the Hideous Hog said, so contract can be bad if it provokes a lead that is even worse  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N asked W (on other side of screen) if he knows it's his lead.  he acknowledges he does|pg||
nt|psyck: NE & SW generally on same sides of screen|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
nt|henryb:  Partner just might|pg||
nt|joest: 5@h shows all aces and asks for kings|pg||
nt|joest: Steve will reason the grand is at worst on a hook|pg||
nt|joest: if partners' club queen is the diamond queen it lays down|pg||
mb|7S|nt|bobh1: the relays misfired on this one|pg||
nt|peachy: Garner has them all 3, if singl is considered equivalent of K|pg||
nt|joest: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  with 11 tricks off the top and the ability to take 2 finesses, a good 6NT was missed here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie showed the distribution but I did not hear what honors he showe|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: will they be able to stop in 6@S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine that|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It's a wonder they are allowed to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: wont play too well unless declarer takes good view in hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  even with this hand it is just on 3-2 spades: declarer simply ruffs two clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|joest: now the over and under begins on how long it takes Howard to play this hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hesse: her måtte vel gjerne @d ut for bet|pg||
nt|benjy: if east has one @S then 7@S is decent|pg||
nt|ppiglett: As the said a few years ago about bidding, the club suit is well gone, diamond are now gone and hearts and spades need to be carefull. Such a joy to see a few suits natural |pg||
nt|bluejak:  After 1 stanza:  Sinclair 14  Mossop 21   +++  Hinden 23  Penfold 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: its not as if they dont have slam values|pg||
nt|henryb:  64@s tricks, 4@h, 2@d, 1@c and two ruffs = 13|pg||
nt|peachy: 11 NT tricks so 2 ruffs somewhere|pg||
nt|joest: that line however Henry might induce declarer to use the heart ace for a secondary entry!|pg||
nt|joest: win the king of hearts, ace of clubs, ruff a club, back with a heart...|pg||
nt|joest: this was a potentially devastating opening lead for the 'ruff two clubs' line|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? @hA, @cA, @c ruff, @sK, @sA, @cruff, @dA ...|pg||
nt|joest: culd play ace of clubs club ruff, tworounds of spades club ruff then back a diamond|pg||
nt|joest: we agree.|pg||
nt|joest: now back to the over and under|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: ok but lets see what suit they play in and at what level|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like std, system said udca|pg||
pc|h5|nt|benjy: if you play on @Hs which looks normal, do you play one to the 8, then you might make, or the king?|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, looked wrong, system says std|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N telling S that he should double to show values.  3H shows shortness|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe it does and maybe it doesn't - is it written down anywhere?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i don't know ... can only report what happens :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: short break.  all back now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bloodaxe: lengste og beste farge ut mot NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx forbidden in some partnerships|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein maybe wishing he had opened 1NT and avoided this whole thing|pg||
nt|psyck: With the poor @h suit & useful cards in the doubletons, 1N is fine, but normal to open 1@h playing gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: very friendly table ... both halves the players have been very nice to Opps|pg||
nt|joest: agreed.  this is all in retrospect|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hesse: og det var ikke naturlig for Simonsen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 7c on?????|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: really 5@s...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant be surely|pg||
nt|rmb1: Even if you bid clubs naturally, they get lost if you use blackwood|pg||
nt|benjy: firstly i dont think 7@C is making|pg||
nt|benjy: to the king looked normal to me|pg||
nt|psyck: I play repeat stayman, so the @h suit can be found if pd has a gf hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: somebody underbid|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well better than 5s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjy: secondly opposite 3 key cards for many 5@S would be forcing, but that is a matter for agreement|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: settle for six-something|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: fairly arbitrary - but someone might duck the king when they should not|pg||
nt|joest: in all fairness to Howie, playing a touch and go grand slam in the final eighth of a close trials make deserves a lot of attention|pg||

nt|nubmaster: Det svänger gott, 10 imp tillbaka till Sverige|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice duck by North|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, as spec points out, @s break...so slam well above 80%|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|benjy: true|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|joest: and the jack of spades was a creative play as well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: whereas no one will mistakenly duck the eight|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bluejak:  Score from first stanza as you see: 26-10|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|s5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bobh1: if i knew their system better i might be able to say who|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|bobh1: so the match tightens up|pg||
mc|13|nt|joest: well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: players taking break|pg||
nt|joest: north-south have to just HOPE their teammates cover that one|pg||
nt|henryb:  well done. cheering and stomping the the back rows of the audience|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Yes that wasa grand slam try I believe|pg||
nt|benjy: they may pick up on the board if they reach grand in the other room|pg||
nt|benjy: which would not surprise me|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Yes that is very possible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one good thing about having system files is that things like that can be written down|pg||
nt|psyck: good result here for Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: still, credit to the EW barrage|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h = Michaels|pg||
nt|psyck: Looks like 3N should go down on @h attacks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psyck: about 11 tricks in a @h contract here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|joest: how high will garner fly?|pg||
nt|joest: i supposed a lead directing 3@c is possible but I really can't see him doing that|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, will just bid 3@h i think|pg||
nt|joest: even 3@h will put a lot of pressure on Levin|pg||
nt|joest: +600 is a great result in the other room.  Will be very hard for north-south to do that well here|pg||
nt|bobh1: canape style here i guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: y3wv... 1s was quasi alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will keep S out of trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, they may not stop in 3N in the 1st place|pg||
nt|joest: Garner with a choice of openings.  He has already decided to 'go big' and revers|pg||
nt|joest: *reverse|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: why couldnt someone have agreed clubs somewhere|pg||
nt|psyck: NS obviously will not make life easy for them at this vul|pg||
nt|joest: some warning signs. |pg||
nt|peachy: he has lots of playstrength with any sort of fit in minors|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would not dream of doing anything else|pg||
nt|joest: no negative double from partner, no spades in his hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest: "the fourth and final NT"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very hard fo NS to go plus now|pg||
nt|joest: you would not dream of bidding over 2@s henry?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: E writing N a note|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: samme meldingsforløp som i lukket rom|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H double negative?|pg||
nt|joest: tough bid but I'm guessing she'll just pref to 4@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hesse: Simonsen lykkes bedre med @h ut i dette spillet|pg||
nt|psyck: If @h was continues after @dK other table, 3N would have been beaten|pg||
nt|psyck: should end here|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c was already a stretch|pg||
nt|joest: agreed.  Given that 2NT was NF (I think) it certainly seems like the auction could end here.|pg||
nt|psyck: nobody likes playing in 4m vul|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, of not opening 1@c with West hand|pg||
nt|joest: no Howie waits to see if anyone doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrt: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C is Gazzilli?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: med @h ut er det muligheter for beit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which measns??|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good system |pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may go on - she knows roughly South's hcp, and may not be inclined to place her with such good hearts |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: another reluctant P by N |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that could be a dangerous lead - declarer's second suit. Will work ok here |pg||
nt|bobh1: canape backfired on this one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: a @d can go on 4th @c...|pg||
nt|joest: this will be a lot of back and forth.  north-south have to avoid getting their 'suit' going b/c that is Weinstein's source of tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  not obvious where he will get 9 tricks if N shifts to a @h|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein has a tough pitch right here right now|pg||
nt|peachy: I think he'll rely on one of the minors, let opps play spades if they unsust|pg||
nt|peachy: *insist|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ppiglett: I dont have nothing, I have absolutely nothing|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: which means a hand that would bid 2@D then make a second negative over whatever South bid next ,,,|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C looks like some sort of transfer|pg||
nt|benjy: Does anyone possess an intimate knowledge of the bulgarian bidding methods?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's gazzilli?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another Jxxx lead?|pg||
nt|joest: gotta switch now|pg||
nt|joest: well done|pg||
nt|henryb:  I like unsust. I will put it in my dictionary: persistent error|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bloodaxe: dårlig med innkomster i vest|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I believe 2C shows various strong hands but only a guess |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ybob: or @C on @D :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Wolfson has come back strongly after trailing by 23 imps at the start of this seqment|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Svenskarna kom i 6@c på 4-3 på br 28, spelar just nu|pg||
nt|nubmaster: deras sista bricka|pg||
nt|hesse: 6@c skal spilles fint for hjemgang|pg||
nt|bloodaxe: Harald må skifte ruter inne på spar|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: I am told it was Gazzilli|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|hesse: @d avkastet til Eide var uheldig (på 3dje @hrunde)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c ut och tillbaka, han fick stjäla en @d och nu måste han maska @s för hemgång i 6@c|pg||
nt|hesse: men Eide hadde et vanskelig kast, og @d avkastet var gjerne naturlig|pg||
nt|joest: tough play for Weinstein now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so Wolfson goes to the double century - well batted|pg||
nt|joest: Levin could at least go plus for what that's worth if she makes a double dummy guess|pg||
nt|joest: but once east has 5-5 in teh majors + one club it is probably ruight|pg||
nt|joest: *right|pg||
nt|psyck: needs 2 discs for @s, so will play Q|pg||
nt|joest: unless of course east is 4=5=3=1 but that seems unlikely|pg||
nt|psyck: W's was an NV bis, will still likely lose to @dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  this shold be down 4 with accurate defense|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hesse: nå har kontrakten gode muligheter|pg||
nt|bluejak:  I thought Gazilli was a rebid after 1M - 1NT, 2C being artifiical|pg||
nt|psyck: *bid|pg||
nt|peachy: I don't mind if you don't credit me with the invention....|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm like the OED: first use quotes for all words :)|pg||
nt|joest: they did duplicate the grand in the open room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry ... lost wifi connection for a second there|pg||
nt|peachy: np Bob|pg||
nt|henryb:  ve haf notissed this and vill take appropriate action|pg||
nt|peachy: Good defense, I think declarer's goose is cooked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|henryb:  same contract in the other room, but @hQ lead|pg||
nt|joest: i'd say the goose was well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hesse: syd må lasje nå rettnok|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so you cannot ever bid 2h in a natural sense then|pg||
nt|psyck: unless he tries something fancy, this should make in comfort|pg||
nt|ybob: @D to 8 ? later u can cash AK @C and play for squeeze m's to N|pg||
nt|psyck: he will try for either minor 33 or a Hx placed right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hesse: og heller ikke dekke @d10 med sin @dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  or more|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjy: it can be played in different situations|pg||
nt|psyck: also, W may not have been so eager to lead single @c with @dKx instead of @h|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|benjy: well 2nt might show a @H positive|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|psyck: now he cannot do anything wif S guarding both minors|pg||
nt|psyck: so will just play for @d 33|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H = 0-4 no King, 2NT would be a real positive in hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjy: going back to the opening lead for a moment, for me it would be a @H lead, trying to go as passive as possible|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ppiglett: You can bid naturally at the three level with a six card suit and decent values or transfer after 2Nt|pg||
nt|rmb1: ... a turkish spec tell me.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jcomyn: right makes sense|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|benjy: !Q squeezes south now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|benjy: for down 1|pg||

nt|joest: +400 a solid result for Silverstein|pg||
nt|henryb:  trussed and basted and ready to serve?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: NS  all the way from Turkey, it's a strong team!|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: also used after 1-1 |pg||
nt|joest: 1|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d tends to be distributional|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: svenskene ser ut til å gå noe beit i 6@c|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 3 bet, toppade @s|pg||
nt|psyck: going down only cost 2 imps though, the board was decided other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N and E chatting about what 1D showed |pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 2D = constructive spade raise, 2S would be weaker.|pg||
nt|dburn: Gazzilli (actually an American convention called Cole but pinched by the Italians) is a 2@c rebid after 1m-1M|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds :)|pg||
nt|psyck: they use 1@c for balanced hands...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: W tells S that 1D is unbalanced|pg||
nt|joest: double = 8+ but east does not owe west another call|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hesse: 11 imp inn til Norge i spill 28|pg||
nt|joest: this might well induce Garner to ask with 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: or 2@s I guess :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  but a likely push unless Jill guesses right which minor to play and how, in which case she can hold it to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: discussion about 2S ... maybe S and minor?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Levin, in this case|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: surely North's values outside spades are too soft to splinter |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so trying someting else.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: now I guess east just closes his eyes and bids 3@d|pg||
nt|joest: trump start isbest|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hesse: 2@d=weak or strong|pg||
nt|hesse: 2@d er svak eller sterk med @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sista brickan här och några imp in|pg||
nt|psyck: Declarer played on @c intead of @d other table for the same 11 tricks last deal in other room|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, trying for slam with N is looking for too specific cards|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjy: I wonder what 2@H is?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or West does :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  shows how dumb I am. with a balanced hand I let them play 1N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hesse: og betydelig med imp tilbake til Sverige|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presume showing a good overcall|pg||
nt|rmb1: a random game try (last train at the two level)??|pg||
nt|benjy: if it was last train, which has been suggested to me, then why on earth is east bidding game?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Some sort last train style bid to describe a reasonable overcall and stay below 2S?|pg||
nt|benjy: terrible minor suit holdings, no ruffing value and minimum in points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes very soft values outside trumps|pg||
nt|benjy: i would be more worried about going off in 3@S than making game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in fact a useless hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and against both opps bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: as will be demonstrated in the play no doubt|pg||
nt|joest: that might be a part score swing|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bloodaxe: 2@D er 6kort hjerter, enten WJS eller solid utgangskrav uten sidefarge|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East clearly thought that West has a minor shortage and his J-xxx of hearts would be of help.|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Strange: I play 1m - 1M - 2C as Cole, and 1M - 1N - 2C as Gazilli|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N in the other room was a great contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest: I would have thought Weinstein would have been thrilled to get the green pass card out there last round :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely East didn't think 2@s was natural|pg||
nt|psyck: no, 3@s was just showing stopper|pg||
nt|joest: no.  both east and west are showing their spade stoppers to each other|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, over a nebulous 1@d there is a case for 2@d to be natural|pg||
nt|joest: I like playing it natural|pg||
nt|psyck: as Jack said, there was no need for E to do that though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1D is not nebulous|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d here is at least 4 often 5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: trumps off top for -50|pg||
nt|ppiglett: If the club Ace is onside and the Spade King with North - is this my lucky day?|pg||
nt|psyck: some play 3@d & some play 3other major after a major response to stayman as gf with slam interest|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: ...with fit of course|pg||
nt|psyck: with 45 in minors they would open 1@d i guess, most other times 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  again the 3@c bid made it difficult for NS |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but the other room also bid 3@C|pg||
nt|peachy: or a push, 1NT making vs 100|pg||
nt|henryb:  yeah: 1N down when I go down in 2@s|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: stopped in time|pg||
nt|joest: depends on how strong the hand is|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: with the 3-1 trump break, 5 level was unsafe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, sry. Thought 1@d could be 1+|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N passed the 3@c bid and S dbld then converted 3@s to 3N...so that sequence must have shown clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: but 1NT is not going down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nubmaster: Men Finland har nu 61-65 mot Danmark med några brickor kvar så det ser ut som vi får årets NM-mästare U25 från Norge|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|psyck: they have 1@c for either balanced hands or @c's|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many zs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all jumps by N/S are limited to 16 and stronger hands use Gazzilli after 1any- 1any|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|ianmcc: that's a low-looking @d|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: she can't be thinking of ducking this?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be thinking South has 1@s and 3@h|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobh1: good judgment by Larry in the open room i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: pretty sure Jill's got him ... only lose 2S's and a club in this  position|pg||
nt|peachy: I have no prob with the 2S bid, Henry, bidders game|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|ianmcc: indeed|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bloodaxe: Harald hadde mer til 4@H enn 2@H|pg||
nt|milton_se: Grattis till Norge - Sverige nog tvåa|pg||
nt|joest: would switch to spade at T2 if that were true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nubmaster: Tack alla|pg||
nt|benjy: but not the lowest|pg||
nt|benjy: perhaps suggesting a liking for @C but not at all costs?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it's getting late. What use was @d9?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rmb1: Is this a claim for -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: N dropped h9 - it made|pg||
nt|rmb1: ? There are still two losers|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but if that was the case, she would have played a spade at trick 2, no?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: we are havng a spelling bee next week - details available on request|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|joest: oddly it's a little riskier balancing with an AKQxx suit which clearly could take a bunch of tricks vs 1NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  You know, every one tells me that. But I think the hardest thing to learn is to say pass|pg||
nt|peachy: With the proliferation of "open nearly all 11 point hands" and so on, the game must have become easier :)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|joest: what a brutal ending for Meyers.  Tucked in at the end to put dummy in with the club ace|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: somehow you feel that that was an error  |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: may be best with that trump suit to run the six on the first round|pg||

nt|joest: let 2 tricks get away there|pg||
nt|andyv:  well played...3N easier |pg||
nt|henryb:  and the number of 23 and 24 point games that the "field" bids, going down 2 or so, is amazing|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|bobh1: i think 3N is pretty pushy|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2@d is a bid that Weinstein would only make at favorable I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcomyn: 11 tricks how|pg||
nt|benjy: definitely best unless your |pg||
nt|bobh1: on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: rdbl was forced (i think)|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = ART. either clubs or some good hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's interesting that in OR, E was able to open 1@h and win the auction with 2@h|pg||
nt|joest: south has an obvious pass for +300|pg||
mb|2H|nt|joest: unless you rebid 1NT!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did South have to ruff @SJ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: RHO smoothly ducks with AKQx|pg||
nt|joest: [just kidding]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy: 12 imps to Sinclair when Zia Auken stopped in 6@C|pg||
nt|benjy: on board 9|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a Twisted Swine kind of seq, either to runout or to play in 1Nxx (which would not be a success here)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will North read that as take-out?|pg||
nt|joest: if not the heart went away|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: E clarified something toN|pg||
nt|bobh1: no harm no foul i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 2NT er GF|pg||
nt|rmb1: Zia-Auken manage to find 6@C on board 9 for 12 to Sinclair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT probably two places to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2NT ... N looking at E and shrugging ... now writing what i cannot see|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure, but she still has her trump trick, unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|joest: this contract doesn't play as well as clubs|pg||
nt|joest: we have arrived partner|pg||
nt|henryb:  in the 3-3 when partner was making a game try with 3-6-1-3 shape?|pg||
nt|joest: yup :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: bara -1 i 5@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: men med @s-stöld skall detta inte gå gem|pg||
nt|ianmcc: the better slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Wow it made. The dangers of the suit preference card in defence for a ruff. They are only GUIDLINES not demands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 2N would certainly not make sense unless it was some kind of scrambling bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: hem... mitt tangentbord kan inte stava rätt|pg||
nt|hesse: kan kanskje bli 2 bet om Grönkvist snur spar nå|pg||
nt|psyck: S bidding too much, esp NV & with E's bids|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and may not get away with it |pg||
nt|andyv:  not a horrible contract and looks like it should make|pg||
nt|henryb:  And then you probably want your 1000 pounds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  for holding a true yarborough|pg||
nt|joest: I think the hardest thing to learn is to say pass|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: well, he will certainly do that - his partner might have the singleton jack, after all|pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: lucky to excape unchopped|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, no double no trouble, as the saying goes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: she can get trump couped in practice|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can come to 8 tricks in pretty quick order|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: thats what i thought 11 is impossible as is 10|pg||
nt|andyv:  but W should get squeezed in @s and @d on run of @cs and @h|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: så hemhång i stället|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs playable but not a great contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: funny, in a way - they found 3@c on a 4-3 fit but can't find 2@C on a 5-4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|benjy: why isn't it great victor?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: your system can do that to you sometimes |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hesse: heldig spill for de norske farger|pg||
nt|joest: you convinced me too!|pg||
nt|peachy: Me too, I would have passed 2H...|pg||
nt|joest: I believe in the open room they are still struggling in3NT on Board 115|pg||
nt|joest: it looks like WEinstein only went -200 here not -400 as i thought|pg||
nt|henryb:  When my ex asked me for advice on how to become a better player, I suggested that every morning (this was before bidding boxes) she practice saying pass 100 times before breakfast|pg||
nt|joest: i see why she is now your ex :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  well, since then she has won 5 NABCs and has a win and a third in World championships|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: so I guess the two tables are now disconnected|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|joest: board 115 a push|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|bobh1: wd|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie:  well played|pg||
nt|joest: north sout win one on board 116|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|joest: so the spread is now 29|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|joest: so 6 to silverstein|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb:  the first three NABCs and the first world championship came while we were still together|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|8|nt|joest: this match feels as though it is about to be ov er|pg||
nt|henryb:  and after she learned to say pass|pg||
pg||

nt|odysseus69: on 2nd thoughts 6C looks a good spot|pg||
nt|benjy: if trumps are 3-2 you are almost home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Director is hovering ... they did have to replay 74.|pg||
nt|bobh1: a breather board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: players are taking a break|pg||
nt|bobh1: mystery board 95 swung 2 imps to silverstein so match is very tight|pg||
nt|joest: she divorced you|pg||
nt|joest: no.  seriously she started winnning everythig in sight, right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: wow.  pass is sorta conservative by WEinstein|pg||
nt|joest: at any other colors west might try 5@c |pg||
nt|henryb:  first she won everything in sight after learning to say pass. Then she divorced me. Then she won a few more things|pg||
nt|joest: red vs. white that's a bit rich|pg||
nt|joest: so what would you do here with Garner's hand?|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@c if I could|pg||
nt|joest: my guess is he will try 3NT  which is their equivalent of 4@c|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzrt: yes, @c went on @H when N dropped 9|pg||
nt|rmb1: What happened to @SK if it make 11?|pg||
nt|psyck: raise?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i didn't know they played acol 2 bids|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  North might think he could beat that|pg||
nt|joest: eight card suits grow on trees here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: thats incredible|pg||
nt|joest: in the other room they had what seems to me an impossible auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: I like 2C michaels|pg||
nt|peachy: wasnt there a possibility that E leaves it in|pg||
nt|joest: with a stiff heart???  I doubt it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Poor south :( no suit longer than four cards.|pg||
nt|joest: garner might double|pg||
mb|d|nt|joest: 1@c-1@s; 1NT - 2@h; 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: the infamous UMJOODO (5-4 in the majors)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i know just kidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H was 10-15 ... not sure of what shapes it covers|pg||
nt|joest: = "I want to bid 5@c but just in case you want to defend..."|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: another quick board|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not think Weinstein will avail himself|pg||
nt|joest: this seems like a fast 5@c to my tired eyes|pg||
mb|5C|nt|benjy: i'm not sure who i would blame for missing slam, south to a small degree, but his pd had perfect cards for him, the @HJ being critical|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well maybe not, declarer will agonize|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I agree Ben - my first thought was that hearts 4-3 and clubs 3-2 was not great but more to it|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't stop them, though it is beaten on @h ruff|pg||
mb|5H|nt|psyck: not that that defense was likely to be found even after @cQ lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H showed 5S and  4H|pg||
nt|joest: Eric Rodwell invented this: "Unusual Major Jumps Over One Diamond Openers"|pg||
nt|joest: to fill a gap in his system|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Jxxx leads very popular!|pg||
nt|henryb:  double, pass or 5@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: well judged by all|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: 2c s and a h ON TOP|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|psyck: yje joodo has worked fine here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: q@S?|pg||
mc|11|nt|psyck: as specs point out, 10th trick still not in sight|pg||
nt|psyck: but rinning trumps will put pressure on S|pg||
nt|psyck: running you long suit is often the best cure for your troubles & may well work here|pg||
nt|henryb:  The tables seem to be disconnected|pg||
pg||
qx|c119|st||md|1SKQ75HAT7654D93C3,S9842H2DKJ5CKQJ84,SAJHKQJ9DA842CA76,ST63H83DQT76CT952|sv|b|nt|ppiglett: 2C showed the hand very well.|pg||
nt|rmb1: No option but to finesse @D losing a spade and two hearts|pg||
nt|rmb1: Mossop also went -1 in 2NT on board 10|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NS will probably make 4s here if we are to judge by defence on that crazy 4s|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "No" :)|pg||
nt|joest: Yes they've been disconnected since the crash|pg||
nt|joest: The winner of ths match will play the Aker team tomorrow I believe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: was the crash when i lost connection?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|peachy: Watch the other table simulatneously http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if they play 1c-2h as weak 54, then maybe the seqeunce was invitational|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nubmaster: Ser ut som 3NT med öst som spelförare|pg||
nt|hesse: ja, men Eide har gode kort, og vil nok innlede med et kravbud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good time to bid 3c -what does it mean|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C weak jump shift (showing this hand)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3C invitational with clubs - unfortunate hand for S|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Unfortunately a remark was made at the other table in this match about board 16 and was heard in the other match.  So Hinden v Penfold is playing a substitute board 16.|pg||
nt|joest: 2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hearts|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: that would be a good hand to check later with deep finesse (you can download it freely)|pg||
nt|joest: 1NT = 17-19|pg||
nt|henryb:  On 116 Silverstein gaine 1, but lost 9 on 117, and 118 was a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: ja|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D is good heart raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1N was alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk7: EW were lucky in he oher room. A pade lead beats 5@H|pg||
nt|joest: hey roland!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i think bigger than 14-16 1NT opener|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Awful keyboard|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW have not mentioned their 10-card fit yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: JillM writing note to Ronnie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: long note :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Russ and JillL joking around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie reading note ... i am guessing distinguishing amongst Q bid choices|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D could have been 0@D  or  4@D & 5+@S   with some tame distributions in between|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5@C might be a really good save|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: JillM continuing to write|pg||
nt|bobh1: the kind that makes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: JillL just gave Russ a short note|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: almost like 6th grade with all the note passing|pg||
nt|joest: so they are down about 38 right|pg||
nt|joest: and they have b id a slam in the other room on this boar|pg||
nt|joest: *board|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: Roland the Seventh|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: Or Cohen could have switched from Kx. Too tough|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jcomyn: I think it is a daft bid|pg||
nt|benjy: if my pd made a weak jump shift i would pass like a shot|pg||
nt|psyck: other table played for either @cA or @hT to be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: small H to Q and then duck a H would do it ... just has to find it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: me too I have aces for him|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never mind it will probably make|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = retransfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wasn't easy to lead @s after both opps bid it|pg||
nt|bobh1: this might change the leaderboard|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I am told 3@C is invitational with @C in which case it is super light|pg||
nt|benjy: but it would explain south bidding 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who was it said  in and old comic -Daft I casll it|pg||
nt|ppiglett: You reach some ropey 3Nts with this type of bid. Partner can judge with Kx in clubs and 2.5 outside winners to push to game|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s = 4+ spades GF|pg||
nt|henryb:  do you play 4@s is a cue or Redwood here?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjy: well i just wonder what north would do with an outside Q or K, force to game?|pg||
nt|joest: depends on who I am playing with|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hesse: Eide garderer seg i fall makker er blakk i @d|pg||
nt|joest: I think 4@s is less important as blackwood over hearts |pg||
nt|joest: playing 'minorwood' is very important|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hesse: god bridge etter min mening|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 4@s =, @d ut bästa försvar|pg||
mc|12|nt|joest: so if My  s are right, it is Wolfson +38 going into the last board|pg||

mb|2H|nt|benjy: 2@D multi, X showing 12-15 bal or a strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  you are most welcome, and thank you|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: old dilemma - 2@d or 2@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: P of splinter alerted ... presumably declined to make some kind of lead direction dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: solid 3NT contracts seem the flavour of the day|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal now, the next session will start shortly after this ends. Thanks to my co-commentators Mike & Roberto.  Good job by our Operator Bob.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & ...|pg||
nt|psyck: for their inputs.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 14 opp 11|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: On bpard 11, Auken went off in 3@S when Price made 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly surprisin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: uh oh|pg||
nt|joest: they will pay a heavy price for getting to the five level on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk7: KJxx opposite a splinter and 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure while Meyers likes her hand so much|pg||
nt|joest: I think game time tomorrow is 1:00 p.m. New York time|pg||
nt|joest: for all other scores, check out http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16 |pg||

pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: he didn't make he was allowed|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H is competitive in spades|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: this hand been kind of a breakeven set for north south until now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 5@c cue|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tejjyid: 4@S maybe keycard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true|pg||
nt|psyck: splinters are generally limited hands too (othe options available with stronger hands), in addition to the @d wastage & aceless hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: correct 4S was kickback|pg||
nt|joest: a charter member of the Optimist's Society.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you wanted toproceed with the South cards, BW would be the logical way to do it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ppiglett: No surprise there - it needed the King and Queen come down under the Ace to make|pg||
nt|joest: this is brutal punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = invite with 5@D??|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: we need a bold & italics option in bbo for that IF, just capitals aint enuf|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: looks like 2S was some kind of ask.|pg||
nt|psyck: Many (including me) raise with 3 cards, generally unbalanced hands or with extras.  It is normal to follow the raise with a relay to find shape & values|pg||
pc|dA|nt|benjy: 2@H and 2NT transfers?|pg||
nt|dburn: this appears to be a strong club auction with an artificial positive and perhaps some relays|pg||
nt|psyck: so 3@d may have been 3 cards, min hand, @d length|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfh: not sure ... clearly theysaid invitational notsure of inference of relaying thru 2d|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: 1@H transfer|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: W has shown 18-19 bal, explains E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could just be any invite without 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|psyck: *3 cards @h...|pg||
nt|henryb:  two "upsets" Aker beat Gordon and Bathurst beat Mahaffey|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Nickell now leading by 45|pg||
nt|psyck: bye for now, see you shortly in next set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many use 1@C-1@D//1N-2N as puppet to 3@C|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|bobh1: holding it to -1 is worth 3 imps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: bye|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: which i think is doable|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably XX (instead of 2H) is competitive in neither major|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Bathhurst team has I believe 11 world Junior Championships to its credit|pg||
nt|henryb:  or maybe 13|pg||
pc|cK|nt|benjy: would a @D lead have beaten this?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
