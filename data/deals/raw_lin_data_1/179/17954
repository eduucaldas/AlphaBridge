nt|petergill: He is concerned that if trumps are 4-1, he might lose trump control|pg||
nt|petergill: Most likely he will make 11 tricks, but all he wants is the very best line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: East's dbl shows 3 or 4 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: EW's bidding shows hearts to be 4-4, not 5-3|pg||
nt|petergill: East has 2 clubs, thus either 3=4=4=2 or 4=4=3=2 shape|pg||
nt|petergill: Ignore me, lost|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|passell: his only legitimate make is both dia honors onside|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 2 hearts is good 3 diamond raise|pg||
nt|petergill: S downgraded his short jacks|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D is routine, but how would 3NT by North go? |pg||
nt|petergill: Gavin Wolpert is a great player, but finding @HQ lead is somewhat double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 clubs is not forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: so 2 hearts is only forcing raise|pg||
nt|petergill: @HA lead would defeat 3NT, but could be wrong if North has KJx(x). On a low @h lead, what happens in 3NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: Just 4 tricks for the defence then, so on "normal" defence 3NT makes|pg||
nt|petergill: 430 at other table -130 = 7 useful imps|pg||
nt|petergill: -110 = 8 useful imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Kranyak is looking around like what is taking so long|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe Brian Platnick is taking a break on the other side of the screen from him?|pg||

nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|h6|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||

mb|d|mb|4S|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||

nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|benjent: Good @h return - I reckon that was tough after the @s lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||

nt|petergill: Settles for his contract, unwiling to risk it for an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: restart tomorrow at 10:00 PST|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfe: just announced 10 minutes left|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|petergill: sorry about any confusion, but we lack "instant reply" technology, even in 2011|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|petergill: Last board - thanks to Debbie Hyatt and to the organizers in Las Vegas (which usually means Jan Martel, though I cannot be sure)|pg||
nt|petergill: This is a 120 board match which continues tomorrow|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Yes Jan is our most valuable operator to bring the BBO to you world wide|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if 2NT is "2 places to play"|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|petergill: or some form of Lebensohl|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|petergill: 3@S suggests that this sequence by North showed values, suggested bidding on|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: North's values in their (@S) suit are not that good, so it's possible that they were on different wavelengths|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: though 4@H is a reasonable contract, it won't make with @d not coming in, and trumps 4-1|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|petergill: so it should be 2 imps to Diamond at half-time in the match|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||

nt|benjent: So 7 imps to Deutsch and the set is nearly square|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: another in a series of well played and well guessed 3NT in this segment|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfj: last board here -- thanks to the specs|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|benjent: tempting to try for game, too tempting|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: these quarter-final matches resume tomorrow, about 14 hours from now (10 local time)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|bessi2: wow.. that 3@s is one serious underbid in my opinion.. but at first glance it looks successful|pg||
pc|s7|nt|benjent: Kranyak's accept is marginal, Wolpert's invite is marginal, the @s break is poor, and this is going to sail off|pg||

nt|bessi2: it was difficult for Larsen to resist the temptation for the ruff there|pg||
nt|bessi2: nearly impossible|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjent: Assigning the blame for this, I'd say majority North. 3@h is just too pushy after a plain 2@s raise|pg||
nt|benjent: The @d's finesse was desperate, and has cost him an extra undertrick|pg||
