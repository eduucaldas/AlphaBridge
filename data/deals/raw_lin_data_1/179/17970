nt|vugraphzfd: ok, inserted an intermediate @D which held on the @D5|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: so sorry   1@H=game force   5+@S or 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after being so slow for the first 9 boards I have not had a chance to recover since the crash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   Johnson likes his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but we've almost caught up with other room|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s likely went down on club, ace and a spade, club to force the last trump off dummy and endplay into giving up a heart.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4C|nt|kareno: That south distribution has an interesting name.  It's called the Albatross after that ungainly bird with about a ten-foot wing span :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H doesn't make either   entry to North|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4-8 = albatross?    never heard that |pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: payback for all the slow EW relay auctions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5N   pick-a-slam ??|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Six spades makes if declarer wins first trick and simply concedes a spade.  Better odds of heart finesse than of singleton spade king.|pg||

nt|othered1: nice salvage job by EW|pg||
nt|stc: On 84 EW in 2NT in OR,will give 11 to Aker|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pef: so what do you bid at favorable on the east hand now, victor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, he was down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks in @h|pg||
nt|glen: EW will find 4-4 @S fit and reach 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seemed a tired play |pg||
nt|lml: so now they thing that opening 1C without clubs is peachy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pef: chris probably meant 4n as natural there.  great call.|pg||
nt|glen: will trumps 3-2, its just 3 losers and a push|pg||
nt|glen: this form of double, made popular by the italians, acts as a @S transfer|pg||
nt|glen: it designed to increase the chances of overcaller being on lead into the opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: and raising with 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|glen: here 2@S promises 4, while a double would be support with 3|pg||
nt|mpny:  both tables opened 4S, i'd have opened 1|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S on board 70 was a full game swing to Aker, when east in the OR didn't find a winning play against the @H lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@S inOR was a phantom by a couple of tricks. See if it's duplicated here.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: I know 6-5 hands can be treated as having a 7-card suit, but it plays havoc with Lawful follow-ups|pg||
nt|mpny:  it will be hard for schermer not to bid 5,|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, especially since he thinks east's twosuits are minors|pg||
nt|othered1: If he knew one was @H,  he'd stay out|pg||
nt|stc: wow, 6@s but not 6@h !!|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure yet!!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|pelu: in OR EW could not stop after Welland oen 1@H in W - they are in 3NT|pg||
nt|mr murray: that is super light|pg||
nt|mr murray: only 5332|pg||
nt|mr murray: not choice of most|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass over the double denied 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: 4 10s!|pg||
nt|glen: W tries for slam, George is not driving anywhere|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing he will bid 5S, duplicating the other room result|pg||
nt|stc: excl BW|pg||
nt|caitlin: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|caitlin: tell me key cards but NOT in clubs|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|othered1: So here's another way, not exactly obvious, how the 6-5 can make evaluation tough.   But partner's on lead and he might not even have a @H to lead|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h = Q@s ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mpny:  he may still be afraid that no spade will cash|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: and the limo brakes soon enough|pg||
nt|glen: if W bids again, he will switch to taxi driving|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: wow, what a judgment|pg||
nt|mpny:  very well judged, at least sucessfully|pg||
nt|othered1: possible 13 imps to welland, assuming the wheels don't fall off on defense|pg||
nt|stc: vwd|pg||
pc|c3|nt|stc: best lead is a @H !!!|pg||
nt|stc: ruff and play a small @s from dummy :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: I think we will only get final result on hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb sorry|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: system card for Welland: we open almost all 11+ hands|pg||
nt|mr murray: forgot about the 10's  4 10's = 2 jacks|pg||
nt|mr murray: He is exonerated :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder id south's double of 1@D was for takeout of the rounded suits or just showed @D.  I'd assume the former.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: schermer asking drew what he would have led if he has splintered in clubs!|pg||
nt|othered1: more than half, rather|pg||
mb|1D|nt|glen: and now the prepostpenultimate board, the kokish abbreivated as penultimate|pg||
nt|othered1: In the OR, North made limited opening, so south had no real interest in slam.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: they need to stay even here, and bid the slam |pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|othered1: Best not play the 8-card @H fit, which is down on the lead of either black suit.  But good 7-card suits shouldn't go quietly|pg||
nt|lml: I was just looking to see why they got to slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||
nt|glen: E's bid here depends on system, and whether 2@C is natural or artificial|pg||
nt|glen: experts have worked hard to convert every @C bid into an artificial meaning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George seems to be in pain, head in his hands|pg||
nt|glen: he is thinking about page 431 of the notes|pg||
nt|glen: do we play xyz over this sequence or abc?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I hate it when I can't remember who I have what agreements with |pg||
nt|othered1: NS in OR stayed out.  Let's see how tough they can make it in this room.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: now stan dard practice is to bid immediate 2H with weak hand|pg||
nt|glen: he hopes that 2NT is a puppet to 3@C, often a @C signoff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve thought for a while, then alerted|pg||
nt|glen: but on page 531 it is revealed as super-blackwood grand slam try|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing just 4S now|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless S gets involved maybe|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pelu: now I dont exp that they can stop in 3@c|pg||
nt|glen: but with a forced waiting bid of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George fakes applauding when steve bid shows up|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Do you think that west has another bid?  I do, given the light hands they open.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Wrong again, I guess|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 2@C was a transfer to @D.|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT seems like a big bid by north after alreday bidding 3S|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: wonder what 2 @D would have been for them, given 1 nt was "other suits" minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 2 @H for that matter, or 2 nt |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew said he wasn't sure what the double of 1NT would be, if I heard him correctly.  With my hearing it could have been something else thoughh|pg||
nt|othered1: south was a passed hand, so 1N looks normal, if they choose to enter at all.  2N looks to dangerous to me at equal nonvul.|pg||
nt|othered1: Here?  I agree.|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: good trump lead|pg||
nt|glen: declarer's best line was to ruff a bunch of @Hs in the short @C hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: only if 2Nt is transfer to 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: it was but steve bid 3 nt anyways|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Bob|pg||
nt|mr murray: many play 2n/t asks partner to bid 3 clubs. apparently not here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wolff (still like the word snapdragon better.)|pg||
nt|pelu: a @S-lead will help E a lot|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: but after the bidding a @D would be normal|pg||
nt|pelu: so another game/partscore flat board?? :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his hand as a 17-19pt nt.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is not the worlds worst contract if clubs were nicer|pg||
nt|stc: 3Nt was an easy make, 4@s is not|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: I would much rather have heard 4@C cue from partner, and even then 4N seems very pushy.  Maybe in their methods, however, a 4@H return cue would not have shown extras|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: N should continue with the program|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Now a @d.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: but Jacobs was on the right track - His 2Nt ask for 3@C - the winning partscore|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: just trying to find a bid Ed, that moves it forward |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|pelu: overrules by partner|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt have extras after 3@S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps this will come down to the final board|pg||
nt|mr murray: uknow what happens when u overrule your partner:)  the gods take over and slap u in the face|pg||
nt|othered1: they've found their major lengths already and there's no reason to think you have to boost them out of slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: surprised he didn't eant the @C pitch here|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: @HJ also work fine here - when pd has 10 8! - why not just @D???|pg||
nt|mr murray: he has time for diamond|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wants all he is entitled 2|pg||
nt|mr murray: chazur in pure yiddish . all bridge players want more :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: turns out a good shift. heart return better than diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|glen: when you play a suit and declarer continues it, well, the program was better|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: why - also down 1 on @HJ|pg||
nt|mr murray: down2?|pg||
nt|pelu: or 2 - ok|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|pef: berkowitz and sontag somewhat miraculously stopped in 4c on board 118 and n/w didn't bid 4s, so that's going to be another 6 imps to gordon|pg||
nt|pef: with 2 go go we are down to 14 imps|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mr murray: get your nap in yet?  :)|pg||
nt|lml: so trump losers  = 1 down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: 3 trump losers|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mr murray: he is going to make it. well-done|pg||
nt|lml: push|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|othered1: west looked like he was in good position, then the roof fell in|pg||

nt|mr murray: unlucky that heart 5 was almost unreadable|pg||
nt|santyclz: What's this?  An actual game???|pg||
nt|othered1: Match is only half way over and 21 imps can come back in a couple of heartbeats.|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: better to play low card = come on - from bad suits u can affort to play high|pg||
nt|mpny:  welland seems to have opened 1N in the other room. here it was hard. east might have done more, but his values did not really look slammish|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you.  If he is playing hearts he should take the pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm going to nap through the 3rd segment and hope to be awake for the 4th.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have a longish break now or is this last hand for the day? |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mr murray: nice hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: this time upside down would be best of course|pg||
nt|glen: and the last board of the set, still another 15 boards for this evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: this is it|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D likely transfer to @H, leaving east wihtout a good call unless double shows @H.|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard not to be in 4@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mr murray: c uall later. enjoyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for the day  |pg||
nt|lml: well Richter had those covered :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: cant make but cant blame Jim for bidding on.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The bidding isn't over...|pg||
nt|mr murray: can he not bid 5 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Joe - Its bedtime for me 23.50 here - but tx for at nice evening Joe and Murray  and good job wd by u Bob|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3rd segment is due to start in a little less than an hour.|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye for now.  Nice specs|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a lot to say as there was not a lot to do |pg||
nt|mpny:  again potentially dangerous|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will pick up the matches tomorrow |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Michael and Ed,  great fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree. the ugly NT opening with a good 5-card major and a worthless doubleton in the other paid huge dividends in the OR|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like Aker played east for that good a h and.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: The redouble showed hearts I think|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @s|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye Joe and Peter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Murray.|pg||
nt|glen: now W can bid 3@D|pg||
nt|glen: some specs liked 2@D by W on the round b4|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: hi all - no problem in the play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  you can make 5, even without a heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: and he'll earn an overtrick, too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: yikes, 4@H is falling in love with the wrong person|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Bob, our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
nt|caitlin: I wish open room was faster so we could compare results|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzff: George said something I couldn't catch as he put down the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for the helpful (and often funny) comments  |pg||
nt|stc: even the lucky position in @c is not enough here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mpny:  a very bad end for Casen Krekorian|pg||
nt|othered1: this is easily makable.  Just strip the black suits and play 3@D and north will  be endplayed in @H.  But there are alternatives|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|glen: with George it was something very funny|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and thx to Jan Martel who works hard to organize the operators and the USBF for bringing this great tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: no, 5 was makable.  I didn't notice west toppling over|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a few  hopeless slams in this set across both tables.  Unusual for play at this level, I'd th ink.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: See you all tomorrow for 2nd half of round of 8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: its a mystery to me why anyone would want to bid hearts on East after 1Dx|pg||
nt|glen: he has a great sense of humor|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
nt|pef: now is a good time to thank my fellow commentator, victor silverstone|pg||
nt|pef: and both bbo and the usbf for making this possible |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.  The next segment is sched to start in about 25 min.|pg||

nt|pef: there will be all four of the quarterfinal matches on bbo starting tomorrow at 10:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time|pg||
nt|pef: the score is incorrect, somehow 118 was marked as a passout, they were actually in 4 clubs, I believe, making 4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mpny:  they were unlucky to be mirrored|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|pef: ah, they just fixed it|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: what I have told my students: only lead a doubleton if its partners suit! - even if u get a ruff u lose tempo|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: yep|pg||

nt|mr murray: yes even with ace lead it should still be down 1|pg||
