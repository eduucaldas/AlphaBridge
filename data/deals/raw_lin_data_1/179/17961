nt|vugraphzfd: gave it some thought, breathing deeply, before selecting 2@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: partnership agreement essential here    some use 5@C as 2nd suit - to help partner sacrifice  but bigtrain [walter johnson] obviously lead-direct|pg||

nt|santyclz: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: cant seem to find 6 tricks for def.|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s, 1@h, 4@d, 2@c will suffice here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|benjent: Both play natural with a strong NT. EW in the 2/1 style. Both with some nifty stuff in the mid-auction|pg||
nt|glen: N would not pick the 5-2 fit if he knew the @D shortness was the @D ace|pg||
nt|mr murray: quite a possition taking out to 4 hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S is a phantom, in that it can be beaten by a @S lead and unlikely @D shift.  But 5@S is a normal spot and requires good defense to beat it.  6@H looks like south is simply ...|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding one more for "safety."  But he knows they have huge red fits|pg||
pc|s6|nt|benjent: Yeah, South knew he had @d shortage as well ... and still volunteered for 3NT, rather than trying, say, 3@d|pg||
nt|glen: this has no play with the the layout of the major suits|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing wonderful but this is truly poor|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3n/t has certain chances|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing any good on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: With @dQ-5th over the J, 3NT is doomed on reasonable defence|pg||
nt|mr murray: Pass seemed logical choice over 2 hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: @S in trick 2 to K and A gave W the overtrick|pg||
nt|mr murray: it is not like they are behind in match|pg||

nt|brolucius: Without the 5@C bid, North might either have led a club anyway or led the @CK to take a look at dummy.|pg||
nt|brolucius: @HK...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: postmortem discussion on both sides of screen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S never a shorter 2nd suit but often longer other|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|ART < 3 !S|nt|vugraphzfd: simson now asking ekeblad about hand shapes for 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 61  Garner in 6@HX|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am please to have Al as a co-commentator if the E/W bidding is going to be fancy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmm  i thought 2@D was 6+@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much point in North asking about the bidding at this stage, I would have thought. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  also includes 5@H invite|pg||
mb|2H|an|not a singleton|mb|p|mb|2S|an|5 hearts INV|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H was non-force opposite a hand with @H|pg||
mb|3H|an|three of them|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S the 5@H invite hand  might have 2nd 5 card suit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: They are getting close to "ax' time|pg||
nt|brolucius: No double. A bit surprising. Where were they going to run to? And North could tell that South had an invite hand with 5 hearts, it seems.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: you know nothing about my hand except that I don't have 6+ @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BJ Becker had a character who often bid DBL with trump void   but i can't recall her name|pg||
nt|chorush: I am somewhat surprised that Simson let this go undoubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: Poorly judged, it seems, because the E/W bidding was limited and they had nowhere to run.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still asking ekeblad about potential shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps feared Ekeblad had a canape into @C or @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: he has a minimal opening|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson passed it out in tempo, then questions, then the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sometimes when I enter multiple passes they don't all get through|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad thought he had declined the invitation with 3@H but rubin carried on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after pause    play @S9    when that wins    another pause|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: ah, so|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: closes the window|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't hear ekeblad's whispers over voices at director's table nearby|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4  15-board sets today to complete the Round of 8     4 winning teams advance to play 120 board Semi-Final  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: all I picked up was simson: "it's not attitude"|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Play will speed up when he sees the trump break and knows that there is no chance.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: he showed invitation, I signed off|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: what did you throw, walter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: deuce of clubs.  feel free to ask us...happy to let you see|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps North needed the @H9 as well.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was hoping we had some BJ Becker fans in the crowd  ---  thinking now his character was Shirley|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: If I remember rightly, Becker made a well-advertised point of not playing Stayman.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @HT pulled and put back|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "let me see here just a minute"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he played 2 conventions    Stayman and Splinters   [invented by his partner Dorothy Hayden (later Truscott)]|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am sure there was some-one who did not play Stayman.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe you're right and it was Blackwood but not Stayman|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: What fraction of US tournament players would respond Stayman with 4-3-3-3 shape and game values, Al?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Someone asked me today.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at top level?   extremely low|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson looking back and forth between his hand and dummy|pg||
nt|chorush: That depends on the hand. With minimal game values and a poor major, very few|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: at club level   way too many|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's not a good idea to bid Stayman iwth that shape, but someone thought that most players did anyway.|pg||
nt|chorush: with 13-14 opp NT, almost no one, Most likely case is with fairly minimal values and a good major|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: most players in most US tournaments do - most players in this tournament do not|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Thanks, John. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose those who play BOTH    2@C Stayman and  2N or 3@C Puppet Stayman  that some might try Puppet|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks to see the trick one more time.  rubin simply states: ten of diamonds|pg||

nt|glen: doesn't NS start behind by 3 imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
nt|glen: and that increases to 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it may have come too early in the segment|pg||
nt|pelu: tx for that :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzff: clubs|pg||
nt|mr murray: rather chase 3 imps than 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT will be Lebenshol, forcing a 3@C bid|pg||
nt|glen: N only has 5@Cs, but wants to push EW out of 2@S|pg||
nt|mr murray: must be lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George shows John the 3C card and John nods|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: auction messed up by me|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cant say I understand the bidding|pg||
nt|pef: that wasn't the auction, victor|pg||
nt|santyclz: With a 4 loser hand w makes a practical bid.  Unfortunately e has no cover cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3 loser hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 loser |pg||
nt|mr murray: they got it right|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S will promise 4 (playing support doubles), therefore E knows he has a 5-4 major fit, but 3 points keep saying pass pass pass|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mr murray: cept it becomes 4 by attrition :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS i OP never found the @C-fit (3@d direct from Welland in East|pg||
nt|santyclz: E's x showing 3 card supt for w's presumed @hs?|pg||
nt|mr murray: all true|pg||
nt|glen: this should make, losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|glen: unless declarer takes a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve asks Neil something, gets an answer and puts his hand down and assumes the Thinker pose|pg||
nt|mr murray: might make a n overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: I was having a problem, and missed auction|pg||
nt|mr murray: on misdefense of course|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: hello |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Hi, Linda!|pg||
nt|lml: Interesting that the heart void decided to penalty double|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like EW went through a Bart-type auction, where 2@D showed @H length.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: not the dummy he was hoping for, he may even have to duck @d's twice to go -1, could well go -2 |pg||
nt|lml: what do you think of Garner's double?|pg||
nt|othered1: Since 2@D normally shows 5 @H exactly, and east didn't rebid in @H, south "knows" north should have 5 of them.|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: I think the spade length in his hand helps too.  |pg||

pc|sA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus69: I did suspect as much- I only come on to BBO to study bidding on slam and near-sla hands- and this is what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: this hand show why I 100% prefer that 1@D = 4+ card|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mr murray: but shioukdnt have it as he would bid 3 spades with a stiff and 5 tumps|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: both pairs take a standard but with lots of specialized sequences approach|pg||
nt|lml: they didnt double at the other table so this is going to be a swing|pg||

nt|tomi2: the double with no trumps migh mislead the declarer, he will not expect this maybe|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: Garner gets some imagination points here.  Was the auction similar or did west respond 2@H?  That might have dissuaded north from drawing them a road map with a double and would ...|pg||
nt|othered1: have kept south from drawing the same inference as Garner|pg||
nt|lml: it did pinpoint the @DA|pg||
nt|lml: so that the diamond play wasnt much of a guess|pg||
nt|othered1: might be only 5 imps|pg||

nt|othered1: south is treating his hand as 17-19, balanced, I think.  thus 1@C opening.   See system summary: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop...|pg||
nt|othered1: =1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||

mb|3S|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S shows a power hand in two ways: by bidding again above 2@D and by looking for a fit in a suit that W has|pg||
nt|glen: however N could care less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John just wrote a long note for George|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S by north is down on a double-dummy @D lead and continuation, but it figures just to be a push|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3h natural no extras prob no stopper|pg||
nt|glen: dear george, how are the white soxs doing this year?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, it won't take long to play|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if EW are on same wavelength|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: at this vul, I would have expected S to be happy to defend|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: I think Aker decided the 4-3 in spades was best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: must be about the bulls|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tomi2: how could they bid if not so? west had no @D stopper so he raised his partners suit with some fit|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense has to be careful  here or declarer can scoot by with 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S easy down 2, so both room "unlucky"|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|othered1: I think it would be found < 1 percent of the time|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|lml: its not obvious to me looking at the south hand what is the right play|pg||
nt|othered1: @HA and more @D should do it but the ruff sluff defense, while some specs think it's obvious (since east figures to be in a 4-3) it will be a nice effort.|pg||
nt|lml: it is true that south can deduce that north has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: I think a ruff sluff without the @HA will work quite well|pg||
nt|othered1: either, I think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|othered1: maybe not so trivial|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt over though|pg||
nt|othered1: still room for misguessing, but it is there if east can work it out.  @C position may not be clear at all in context of the auction|pg||
nt|lml: East really feels he has to find the trump queen|pg||
nt|othered1: and t hen he still needs to find a way to run the @C, which he may believe are 3-1|pg||
nt|lml: well if he decides Garner has the @SQ a spade to the 10 seems a start|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure it is makeable if clubs are 3-1.  Can you think of a way?|pg||

mb|1N|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs makes by leaning to the East side|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 2 was the opposite of prosaic though|pg||
nt|mr murray: well played|pg||
nt|othered1: He might have been playing south for a flat 13 count, w hich still w ouldn't have given north much of a negative double.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|tomi2: had he started with spade to the 10, then spade honor pulling trumps and then overtake clubs, he needs clubs 2-2, spade queen with south and either 3-3 OR 4-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: what is the problem with 1NT? if N can penalty D then 2@C by EW is a nice contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 4 @H cant he?|pg||
nt|othered1: game in a rounded suit is likely here. Slam won't make on best lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, and @SK first would have made with south holding Qx or Qxx in @S, if he could read the position|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, north chose the unfortunate lead of the @da.  Still, that wasn't enough by itself.|pg||
nt|glen: by Namyats, he means 4@C=long @Hs, good hand|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H=it better be a GOOD hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Neil shows his hand to Steve who says "wow"|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: then highlight the board you wish to review by clicking on it and click the "Next" button to step though the play.|pg||
nt|mr murray: those guys get mostly good results from their off-shape dble. Finally coming to all the bridge world . Look what the Italians did to the bridge community in the 50-60's|pg||
nt|othered1: south is laying out hands where slam will make and you can come up with quite a few.  This is a very experienced partnership, so they know each other's proclivities.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: wouldn't think you would lead C Q against 6H|pg||
nt|sybarra: not the first lead that pops to mind just looking at W hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mr murray: Yhey had everyone talking to themselves|pg||
nt|pelu: at that time they were better bidders and better card-players|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: strong club opening, 2c response showing a positive response in diamonds, and now the south hands becomes huge (on the 6d slam hand)|pg||
nt|mr murray: they made many off shape dbles|pg||
nt|mr murray: they were also great card players|pg||
nt|mr murray: so are most of the experts now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: right.  Earlier I only said neither rounded slam makes against the best lead.  Likely to be found in @C, but not @H|pg||
nt|othered1: and the slam killing @D lead was found against 5@C in OR.|pg||
nt|tomi2: in the OR everybody hat spade he had to mention|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: the modern double likely  just shows extras|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: Was 4@S kickback (RKC-like with @H as key)?|pg||
nt|othered1: If it were a cue-bid, north could be thinking laying out possible hands for a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I only saw hand signals, not sure what it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I wonder if 5NT would have been choice of slams?|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing it or thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: high-level partnerships need to discuss all sorts of subtletries applicable at the slam level.  And most do, but it seems that there are always situations that haven't been ...|pg||
nt|othered1: explicitly discussed and maybe are subject to general, meta-agreements.  |pg||
nt|othered1: Eventually, I'll bet north does not punt the grand and is really just considering which slam is likely better.|pg||
nt|othered1: FWIW, in my preferred style, n orth tends to deny 3-card @H support when he bids 3@C.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: time for someone to quote the rabbi's law but not me- I dont know it|pg||

nt|santyclz: The standard of bridge has improved greatly in the past 50 years.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pef: very simple--if the king is singleton, drop it|pg||
nt|Walddk1: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk1: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: Cue-bidding was my early speculation.  Just shows how tough these auctions actually are to pull off consistently.  But even small slam in @C was going to cost a bunch of imps ...|pg||
nt|othered1: against the normal @D lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Drew pulls out the redouble card and shows it to Neil|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 7 actually is going to cost only two more imps than stopping in 6 with @C lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: the question was what would lead be agst 6 @H |pg||
nt|othered1: west, having heard the auction is thinking, "can he really be asking for a @C lead?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: doubt E can X 6 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John and Neil talking, Drew said he is thinking|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think he could have doubled 6 and I don't think west would have found the lead unassisted|pg||

nt|odysseus69: there is a N/S sacrifiice here and it looks likely here.-both playing lead directing overcalls- partnership harmony|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, last hand was +3 for 150|pg||
mb|2C|nt|santyclz: Not quite a "Bramley" x.  For that the 4 card suit must be the one x'd.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: yes was alerted |pg||
nt|glen: 4@S in the open room doomed by the losing @C finesse|pg||
nt|glen: now do NS have two suit runouts, or will S just transfer to (or bid) @Hs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: donn, choosing to play in either a 4-3 major fit or 2d|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfettered, this may maybe not be as easy to bid |pg||
mb|2H|nt|mr murray: e-w can make 90 in diamonds|pg||
nt|mpny:  i guess 2S|pg||
nt|othered1: Interesting, Blackwoodless auction to 7 in OR, helped I think by EW getting their @D into the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: quite common nowadays to play xfrs on 1M-(x)|pg||
nt|psyck: allows you to show more hand types including good & bad raises|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @cT lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: An interesting lead problem.  The @h seems obvious, but s "bid" @cs and is most likely short in @ss.  So...|pg||
nt|glen: E was planning on bidding @S next, but could sit for this X with Axx|pg||
nt|othered1: would be anice hand to be playing 3@C rebid by south as forcing (as in Kaplan-Sheinwold)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for the S hand with a void to blackwood|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: yes, trying for @s ruff could be considered|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: hmm, maybe the play puppet stayman|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 2C may be 5cd stayman|pg||
nt|othered1: Now 4@D if not some specialized bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggests exclusion blwd|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play it, nor usually kickback, so my 4@D bid would be a simple splinter, slam try in @C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry, don't know|pg||
nt|pef: I have a feeling it went pass 3d, here, but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table Wold opened the n hand 1@h and was briefly in 2@hxx'd.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed, |pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: if declarer could quickly draw trumps, there would be 2@Hs, 1@S, 5@Ds, and perhaps a @C|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: OK, exclusion blackwood it is and south will find the ace.  Will he now be able to let north count tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1430 over excl. |pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: thus this opening lead is working for declarer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: Count tricks by assuring north that all keys are held.  If that's what 4N does, I think north can bid the grand right here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this seems very polite now,your suit no partner your suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: I guess chris really did make a game try on his hand.  well, I suppose it's a good save over 3d by e/w|pg||
nt|pef: We are no longer getting scoring comparisons after that breakdown.  Board 112 was a push.  I'll try to keep you updated on the actual scores|pg||
nt|pef: On board 113, e/w played 3d making 4, so 1 imp to aker.  the actual score is now 239 to 201|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for a hand that couhldnt muster a bid over 2C the North hand is about maximum although I tend to dislike 6-3-2-2. The South hand by contast does not have ennogh to suggest that ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: game is on - however the state of the match may be affecting players' judgement|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N (isn't 3@S a violation of Hamman's Law?) would depend on having the @DK on lead, absent a miracle @H lead to get the shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: still frozen board|pg||
nt|othered1: Actually with the lucky @C holding, you don't even need that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes I probably would bid 3NT with the east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: and he does.|pg||
nt|mpny:  well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nice auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, very well reasoned auction|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 4 baby @D's got tucked in pocket |pg||
nt|sybarra: (in N)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Hard to find a grand slam try in south 's hand that would have @HA alone and not @SAK|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H will play OK, as cards lie|pg||
nt|lml: the good news is they get a diamond lead from the king because they both suggested weakness in that suit|pg||
nt|othered1: and may provide 2 more overtrick imps|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: they didn't have much option here anyway, esp vul...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some pairs seldom let a freely bid 2M stand unless they know it's breaking badly.|pg||
nt|mpny:  5D can be beaten several ways|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  4H is better, but has problems due to 52 spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: Drew can XX this |pg||
nt|sybarra: for first round control |pg||
nt|othered1: and 4-1 @H also may present a problem on @C lead|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume east is still unlimited at this point.  But ugly trumps may make west want to back off a bit.|pg||
nt|mpny:  west does not really even have an opening bid, he will cooperate in no slam tries|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|pelu: when both sides try for the same contract normal at least one side are wrong :)|pg||
nt|lml: I bid clubs then spades... I think of it as a good hand|pg||
nt|othered1: This will take some careful play.|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with this vulnerability.  If it were safer to pass then come in, I'd consider it.|pg||
nt|lml: you know that is exactly the mistake I made a couple of days ago.  I had a 6-5 but definitely much worse than this one and I passed|pg||
nt|lml: and when the auction was back to me it was at 4@S and I was vul|pg||

pc|c4|nt|sybarra: and here comes the club lead |pg||
nt|lml: I liked your point about the vul too|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mpny:  i think 4-1 trump + 5-2 spades is too much|pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz: I sent a suggestion to the ACBL that all 1nt contracts be scored as 1nt x'd to add interest.  They didn't respond.|pg||
nt|glen: now the @H Q|pg||
nt|glen: or jack depending on style|pg||
nt|glen: some play second highest thru declarer|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: lots of ways to approach this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: and would be fairly easy if suits broke|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure he's down all the time,  South's having tha 3rd @D may be a key.  But he's gonna have to take a right view or two at least.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may take a moments (as it should)|pg||
nt|othered1: the only real hint from the auction, the double of 4@C, doesn't tell  him all that much.  Can he infer that south wanted to get a tap started with that lead (likely normal anyway)?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|glen: no, back to @S ville|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mr murray: cant imagine y|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: Garner knows clubs are breaking and he expects the 6-5.  Can work out a heart is cashing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|othered1: I think that's a winning line|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: this will make 4, 4 hearts, 2 spades, 3 clubs, and 1 diamonds|pg||
nt|mr murray: then chambers pass of 1n/t when they had game would have worked out well. 1n/t dbled with 2 overtricks would be good :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mr murray: ACBL silly not to respond to u :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mpny:  a good play, north likely did not know declarer's minor shape|pg||

nt|othered1: GIB will make an overtrick from here, I assume (GIB peeks).  Don't think a human will, however|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz: Sorry, I misdescribed.  A 2M where the bidding implies an 8+ card fit.|pg||

nt|mpny:  see how different it would be if west no longer had a D|pg||
nt|othered1: right. I'llhave to go back to see if @D duck by north would have beaten this.  Still not sure it would have, if west takes a winning line.|pg||
nt|mpny:  i think it can still be made, but harder|pg||
nt|mpny:  very hard for north, west could be 5512|pg||

nt|pef: imp|pg||
nt|mr murray: these partscores are certainly not raising my blood pressure|pg||
nt|pelu: here we go - fight on 5-level|pg||
nt|santyclz: Another IMP to Jacobs, they are (very) slowly tightening this up.|pg||

nt|glen: i don't know if I would call AKQ5 pieces|pg||
nt|othered1: After a very exciting start, with a bunch of imps up in the air, this match (and the hands) have settled down.|pg||
nt|othered1: west  has an awkward hand to bid.  Maximumish, if queeny pass, but nothing exactly descriptive over the @S bid.|pg||
nt|lml: West has a bidding challenge here.  I dont like negative double but may be the best choice|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: I could try 2@C, but they open short @C, so that may not be attractive|pg||
nt|lml: well it is a good 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: on this hand leading from the three card suit won't work very well|pg||
nt|pef: chris has a horrible hand to lead from.  you really hate to lead from axxx against 1nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong kind of boards for trailing side- great boards if leading|pg||
nt|pef: yes, this set started with several potential swing boards, but the last five or six have been very dull|pg||
nt|mr murray: bidding looks strange|pg||
nt|othered1: There is a price to pay for opening 1@D only on unbalanced hands.|pg||

nt|pelu: @h-lead can defeat 4@c|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, network problems, Barry is making this but i cant tell how many up tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the hands are so dull that my lights keep going out|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, he was down 1|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|pef: chris probably meant 4n as natural there.  great call.|pg||
nt|glen: will trumps 3-2, its just 3 losers and a push|pg||
nt|glen: this form of double, made popular by the italians, acts as a @S transfer|pg||
nt|glen: it designed to increase the chances of overcaller being on lead into the opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: and raising with 3|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|glen: here 2@S promises 4, while a double would be support with 3|pg||
nt|mpny:  both tables opened 4S, i'd have opened 1|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S on board 70 was a full game swing to Aker, when east in the OR didn't find a winning play against the @H lead.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|othered1: 5@S inOR was a phantom by a couple of tricks. See if it's duplicated here.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I know 6-5 hands can be treated as having a 7-card suit, but it plays havoc with Lawful follow-ups|pg||
nt|mpny:  it will be hard for schermer not to bid 5,|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, especially since he thinks east's twosuits are minors|pg||
nt|othered1: If he knew one was @H,  he'd stay out|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR EW could not stop after Welland oen 1@H in W - they are in 3NT|pg||
nt|mr murray: that is super light|pg||
nt|mr murray: only 5332|pg||
nt|mr murray: not choice of most|pg||
nt|othered1: west's pass over the double denied 3@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|santyclz: 4 10s!|pg||
nt|glen: W tries for slam, George is not driving anywhere|pg||
nt|mpny:  guessing he will bid 5S, duplicating the other room result|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: So here's another way, not exactly obvious, how the 6-5 can make evaluation tough.   But partner's on lead and he might not even have a @H to lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  he may still be afraid that no spade will cash|pg||
pc|cT|nt|glen: and the limo brakes soon enough|pg||
nt|glen: if W bids again, he will switch to taxi driving|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|othered1: wow, what a judgment|pg||
nt|mpny:  very well judged, at least sucessfully|pg||
nt|othered1: possible 13 imps to welland, assuming the wheels don't fall off on defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||

nt|santyclz: In the open room w treated his hand as a 17-19pt nt.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is not the worlds worst contract if clubs were nicer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: I would much rather have heard 4@C cue from partner, and even then 4N seems very pushy.  Maybe in their methods, however, a 4@H return cue would not have shown extras|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|glen: N should continue with the program|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Now a @d.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: but Jacobs was on the right track - His 2Nt ask for 3@C - the winning partscore|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: just trying to find a bid Ed, that moves it forward |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|pelu: overrules by partner|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt have extras after 3@S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps this will come down to the final board|pg||
nt|mr murray: uknow what happens when u overrule your partner:)  the gods take over and slap u in the face|pg||
nt|othered1: they've found their major lengths already and there's no reason to think you have to boost them out of slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: surprised he didn't eant the @C pitch here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: @HJ also work fine here - when pd has 10 8! - why not just @D???|pg||
nt|mr murray: he has time for diamond|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wants all he is entitled 2|pg||
nt|mr murray: chazur in pure yiddish . all bridge players want more :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: turns out a good shift. heart return better than diamond|pg||
pc|c8|nt|glen: when you play a suit and declarer continues it, well, the program was better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: why - also down 1 on @HJ|pg||
nt|mr murray: down2?|pg||
nt|pelu: or 2 - ok|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pef: berkowitz and sontag somewhat miraculously stopped in 4c on board 118 and n/w didn't bid 4s, so that's going to be another 6 imps to gordon|pg||
nt|pef: with 2 go go we are down to 14 imps|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mr murray: get your nap in yet?  :)|pg||
nt|lml: so trump losers  = 1 down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: 3 trump losers|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mr murray: he is going to make it. well-done|pg||
nt|lml: push|pg||
nt|lml: woops|pg||
nt|othered1: west looked like he was in good position, then the roof fell in|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: you didn't have stiff @DK?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p!|nt|ahollan1: P=0-2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard nowadays to respond with an ace. Michael Rosenberg extends this principle to include hands where you do not hold an ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bells go off so we're into overtime.  next segment supposed to start at 25 after|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: fairly safe to respond light facing limited opener|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Any new kibitzers at this moment will be saying 'They play fast at this table'. Little do they know.....................|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and prudent to respond to short @D|pg||
mb|3D|nt|brolucius: South's Pass doubtless shows fewer than 3 hearts (no Support Redouble).|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and Aker raised to 3!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and thank you for your entertaining commentary and analysis|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Well at least we did not fall asleep (easily done).|pg||

nt|mr murray: unlucky that heart 5 was almost unreadable|pg||
nt|santyclz: What's this?  An actual game???|pg||
nt|othered1: Match is only half way over and 21 imps can come back in a couple of heartbeats.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|pelu: better to play low card = come on - from bad suits u can affort to play high|pg||
nt|mpny:  welland seems to have opened 1N in the other room. here it was hard. east might have done more, but his values did not really look slammish|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you.  If he is playing hearts he should take the pitch|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: I'm going to nap through the 3rd segment and hope to be awake for the 4th.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have a longish break now or is this last hand for the day? |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mr murray: nice hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: this time upside down would be best of course|pg||
nt|glen: and the last board of the set, still another 15 boards for this evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: this is it|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D likely transfer to @H, leaving east wihtout a good call unless double shows @H.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mr murray: c uall later. enjoyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for the day  |pg||
nt|lml: well Richter had those covered :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: cant make but cant blame Jim for bidding on.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The bidding isn't over...|pg||
nt|mr murray: can he not bid 5 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Joe - Its bedtime for me 23.50 here - but tx for at nice evening Joe and Murray  and good job wd by u Bob|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3rd segment is due to start in a little less than an hour.|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye for now.  Nice specs|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a lot to say as there was not a lot to do |pg||
nt|mpny:  again potentially dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will pick up the matches tomorrow |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Michael and Ed,  great fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree. the ugly NT opening with a good 5-card major and a worthless doubleton in the other paid huge dividends in the OR|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like Aker played east for that good a h and.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzff: The redouble showed hearts I think|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @s|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye Joe and Peter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Murray.|pg||
nt|glen: now W can bid 3@D|pg||
nt|glen: some specs liked 2@D by W on the round b4|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: hi all - no problem in the play here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mpny:  you can make 5, even without a heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: and he'll earn an overtrick, too|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|glen: yikes, 4@H is falling in love with the wrong person|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Bob, our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzff: George said something I couldn't catch as he put down the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for the helpful (and often funny) comments  |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mpny:  a very bad end for Casen Krekorian|pg||
nt|othered1: this is easily makable.  Just strip the black suits and play 3@D and north will  be endplayed in @H.  But there are alternatives|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|glen: with George it was something very funny|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: and thx to Jan Martel who works hard to organize the operators and the USBF for bringing this great tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: no, 5 was makable.  I didn't notice west toppling over|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a few  hopeless slams in this set across both tables.  Unusual for play at this level, I'd th ink.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: See you all tomorrow for 2nd half of round of 8|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its a mystery to me why anyone would want to bid hearts on East after 1Dx|pg||
nt|glen: he has a great sense of humor|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
nt|pef: now is a good time to thank my fellow commentator, victor silverstone|pg||
nt|pef: and both bbo and the usbf for making this possible |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.  The next segment is sched to start in about 25 min.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: also our noble vugraph operator, Bob, and of course Roland Wald for the huge work that goes into arranging for all the commenators|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and I thank you Peter our Vugraph operator and al who have stayed here till the end|pg||
nt|pef: there will be all four of the quarterfinal matches on bbo starting tomorrow at 10:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time|pg||
nt|pef: the score is incorrect, somehow 118 was marked as a passout, they were actually in 4 clubs, I believe, making 4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mpny:  they were unlucky to be mirrored|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
mc|10|nt|pef: ah, they just fixed it|pg||
