nt|vugraphzfe: now 3 of them have returned|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks all his card are high because he forgot the last spade it is not beyond reason to pitch @CA. He is also allowed to forget if Katz has a heart or a club left, provided ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: that Katz did not show out earlier|pg||
