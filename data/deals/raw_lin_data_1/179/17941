nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||

nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||

nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||

pc|d6|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|h9|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
mc|11|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
