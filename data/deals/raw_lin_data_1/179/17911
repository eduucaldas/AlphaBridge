nt|ianmcc: was 2NT a raise?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not could did|pg||
nt|psyck: S shifts to @s's before they are discarded on @d's|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjy: it must have been|pg||
nt|ianmcc: testing the great one|pg||
nt|benjy: best is to win in hand and play a @H i think|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and zia's fire will be met with fire|pg||
nt|benjy: Carroll will be delighted that his partner had a trump to lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=14  for results|pg||
nt|benjy: over the moon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This has been a double elimination format where the one remaining undefeated team, Penfold, have special privileges. They can choose their opponents in the semi-finals, and they ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: can elect to play a 40-board match if they are behind after 32 (but they can only do it once). |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Penfold vs Hinden in the other SF|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Maybe @sK then @c?|pg||
nt|mamos: It's an interesting twist that MOssop beat Hinden by 62 imps in the first round  so a final rematch would have some "history" :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 52  |pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in such positions you just set up dummy's long suit because then at least that's one suit the defence can't play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and you let them do other things to help you|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjy: if you are going to play on @Cs then is there any gain in taking the @SK as opposed to running it to hand?|pg||

nt|mamos: Heart certainly looks best|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: men med 3-3, går det väl också hem|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|hesse: ikke lett å bete denne kontrakten, forsvaret var avhengig av @c stjeling som ikke er lett å finne|pg||
nt|athene: but that really only works well when there aren't any clear avenues of attack for them|pg||
nt|xenya: 7th trick|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: surprising duck|pg||
nt|athene: here they would just plod away at spades|pg||
nt|mamos: well I didnt think it was obvious lol|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Playing captain Anita Sinclair and David Greenwood sitting out in this set|pg||

nt|mamos: East needs to play trumps now|pg||
nt|benjy: Looks normal to continue trumps here, his spots are so good, he can ruff in and keep drawing them|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the fouled board from the last set?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, it had 2 @d5's & no @h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably some other board had two @H5's and no @D5   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe nobody noticed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N trying to come up with a way toget 4 more tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|athene: west just not reading his partner's @C3 on the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|benjy: was east correct in ducking the opening lead?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjy: perhaps he wished to keep an entry for later?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|odysseus69: right if declarer had k10 or q10|pg||

nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: people don't wait around for perfect patterns to double anymore|pg||
mb|1N|nt|nubmaster: Får se om dom hittar 5@c, enda utgången som står|pg||
nt|hesse: aggressiv innmelding fra nord|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Risken är annars 4@h med en bet|pg||

nt|hesse: syd vil neppe gi seg under utgang nå|pg||
nt|nubmaster: nej...|pg||
nt|hesse: alt han ser er en drømmetilpasning|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Skall man starta med 3@d här? Om då partnern hoppar till 4@s så kan man bjuda 5@c... att bara chansa in 4@h känns inte rätt|pg||
nt|hesse: kortfargebud i @d nå?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: varför inte först bjuda @h och sedan stödja @c?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: för mig är 2@h krav för en rond|pg||
nt|nubmaster: 2@h är väl inte krav här?|pg||
nt|joest: and with 4-4 in the majors I don't think you can afford to!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjy: 1@C is carrot, 9-12 or 17+ i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes they play that system|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double is one of those things that has to be done. If partner bids clubs, too bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|benjy: ok, i stand corrected|pg||
nt|benjy: i think you can discount partner leading from /aqxx|pg||
nt|joest: yeah.  good luck! :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|nubmaster: 5@c nu och väst dubblar med AAK|pg||
nt|mamos: Roland has the same CC as me :)|pg||
nt|mamos: I hardly dare say the defence has four obvious tricks here|pg||
nt|joest: this appears to be headed to a push but you never know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nubmaster: nää|pg||
nt|ralfwil: och varför? antingen tål jag att bjuda om @h-färgen eller annars ett @c stöd|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|nubmaster: ja|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: they have to shift to a diamond at some point|pg||
pc|d7|nt|nubmaster: åhh|pg||
nt|athene: before the diamond goes on a club|pg||
nt|benjy: this could make if west continues with a 3rd @S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|benjy: looks like this should make|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how to get opps into the right contract|pg||
nt|athene: it's not clear for either defender to attack diamonds|pg||
nt|benjy: how does he know his pd does not hold A10 of @S when it would be critical to continue the suit|pg||

nt|hesse: her var det flere mindre gode vurderinger|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll if WEst wins this hed better know what to do next|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|psyck: Basically NS play a simple 2/1 udca, & EW play a more complicated version|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|athene: declarer can't get back to hand but if she leads the @CQ, then the @CJ10x come down|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer can't get off the dummy though, so this will still fail|pg||
nt|athene: i mean lead @CQ after winning the king and unblocking in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even then a diamond shift takes the entry out before west's trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: so you still can't use the @C9 as a discard|pg||
nt|xenya: even that won'y help him|pg||
nt|benjy: her|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is similar to a 4@S in the semi-final|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @C9 here is playing for east to have misdefended|pg||
nt|athene: because with @CJ10x, objectively, he had to split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Aj10 of clubs with East is best faint hope|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E hesitated before playing @c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|benjy: pitch a @C on the established @S winner and lead trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: of course East would have played the 10 but sometimes people make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: now she might continue @CQ but really east can't do anything then but play a diamond, can he?|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hesse: og tilslutt endte det meget heldig for nordmennene som lå inne for slakt|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|joest: garner may be just working through whether north is more like to have stiff ace of hearts or A10xx|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: vad kostar 5@dX 500 eller 800|pg||
nt|athene: he might be worried she has @DQx(x) in hand but if she has, there's no stopping the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: sabine could have walked into it here she could be going for a number instead of -80|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no upside|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: think all the same that N action very dangerous on vul|pg||
nt|friggi: strange line of play|pg||
nt|benjy: very odd, did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: ok, good play to give the defence a chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: now there is no point playing for 4-1 trumps (so you can cash the @C9) because then east would have a trump winner anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hesse: det ville gitt svenskene mye imp uavhengig av motspill :)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Förmodligen 800 om inte man maskar @h för ett @s sak|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c=is an artificial raise with anywhere from mixed to a 3+ card minimum forcing raise.|pg||
nt|psyck: The match is fairly tightly poised at the midway stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@c = 'a minimum'|pg||
mb|4S|nt|psyck: ok, they have more gadgets in their arsenel than just 3@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: cant see explanations|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: godt resultat for Norge i lukket|pg||
nt|athene: if Penfold doesn't use them at all, can she save them up for next year? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the main argument against the balancing double is that Zia couldn't overcall over 1@C, so the chances of finding him with a 5-card red suit are not so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS  making their aggressive intentions clear from the very first boards  -  the opening skirmishes of the longer battle|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, she is obviously pursuing an aggressive policy (early on at least)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed I would expect blood to be spilled in this match 4 very aggressive players|pg||
nt|mamos: Now the Irish find themselves in a rather uncomfortable spot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3c was any minimum|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ybob: values + supp surely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: fit jumps are common with passed hands, though usually in 5 carders|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner apparently showed H values|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, thx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: using 3@c as any maximum can be done too - gives more room to explore.|pg||
nt|joest: true.  I haven't seen that done but...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hesse: om spillefører nå gjør alt riktig kan det bli mye stikk|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|hesse: bra dukk av Simonsen|pg||
nt|athene: it's worth noting that Auken re-opens with double despite holding only *two* in the unbid major|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcomyn: indeed Ben but tommy doesnt know how to spell PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you double there as often as possible|pg||
nt|athene: because your main upside is the penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|benjy: but you know partner isn't passing with the north hand|pg||
nt|benjy: looking at the north cards|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: well, it's unlikely if east is sane, but if partner DOES have a pass, it's big money territory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 10 tricks-as long as she doesnt cover this(she wont)|pg||
nt|athene: and we saw here east doesn't really have a 2@C overcall|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: according to the textbooks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|friggi: it is agressive at least|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|benjy: but if partner bids 2@S which they often will, won't you wish you had passed out 2@C?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: 2@H is risky, i agree, because it's a misfit auction - hearts can easily be north's best suit here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hesse: Nå er gjerne spillefører glad hun ikke fikk @d ut|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not 10 tricks |pg||
nt|athene: partner will usually have five spades to bid 2@S there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 now|pg||
nt|mamos: it depends on which textbooks you have|pg||
nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: yes, i agree, it can go wrong|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree with one of the specs that if you are going to bid then at least overcall directly then you have the upside of getting to a game|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately we only have brief system summaries & no detail convention cards avaialble for the pairs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|benjy: but passing is also a big position, so it's not clear|pg||

nt|psyck: They open pretty light, even vul|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: N and E discussing carding|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: i assume 1nt by opener would be the weak balanced hand so everything else is 17+ and game-forcing|pg||

nt|athene: will zia try a slam on a finesse?|pg||

nt|hesse: skal vi se en heis fra nord nå ?|pg||
nt|hesse: slembudet vurderes...|pg||
nt|hesse: @sJ er et nøkkelkort som nord ikke har kontroll på|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Varför bjöd inte N 3@d efter 3@c så S kunde bjuda 3@h? Eller var dom inne i en konv budg som inte erbjöd den chansen?|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H showed a minimum - Auken does have a max in terms of high cards, but 4333 is terrible and especially three small spades|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Nej, det N funderar på är @h kontroll men S borde ha det som bjuder 4NT så bjud slammen nu|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Danmark nu +20 mod Finland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: vad är 6@d?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Förmodligen @d äss och erbjuder 6NT som alternativ|pg||
nt|hesse: nå ser det ut til at svenskene kan hente inn en klase imp, siden @sK sitter pent|pg||
nt|hesse: syd vet om @s-tilpassen, så dette kan neppe gå galt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: för mig är det storslamsinvit, eftersom färgen inte nämnts  tidigare som trumffärg|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Finns inte så många andra alternativ såvida inget missförstånd skett tidigare i budgivningen|pg||
nt|benjy: well if 2@S is gf then 3@H may show 3433|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h2|nt|athene: many people just finesse the queen first with this suit|pg||
nt|athene: but that's clearly wrong|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: still some guesswork involved here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two easy heart discards for East|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nubmaster: Mer spännande än en Horror Movie på kvällen :)|pg||
nt|joest: a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the spade finesse must be percentage|pg||
nt|joest: clears that suit up for partner, who must worry at the moment if Levin has Q8 left|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks it, anyway|pg||
nt|joest: looks the most straightforward|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: you must lose a trick anyway even if the king is onside|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h7|nt|athene: so you either lay down the ace first or take a deep finesse just in case the J10 are onside |pg||
nt|psyck: could cask @sAK & play towards J|pg||
nt|joest: hard to see why she would get this right|pg||
nt|psyck: if hoping @c44|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|joest: that's true|pg||
nt|joest: clubs not 4-4 clearly on the carding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but why do that?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: if she plays @SK next, she's going down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: the only time you lead to the queen is if you need two fast diamonds or you have only one dummy entry and you have to play the suit immediately|pg||
nt|benjy: you could also play a @S to the 10 early, is the correct line clear?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|joest: not if she plays ace next|pg||

nt|athene: yes, maybe, with 3@S/4@D being splinters and 4@H being 2-4-2-5|pg||

nt|mdgraham: bit of a random swing there|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|psyck: 2@d multi for 1 major|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@s = pass/correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3S is P or correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: since he just wants to keep her off lead to stop her cashing that thirteenth heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Nu kommer Mikael säkert att bjuda utgång, eller åtminstone invit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: Sabine would prefer to open that hand 1@H i am sure! (in her regular partnership she plays 4-card majors)|pg||
nt|benjy: could she be 4351 for this bidding?|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@C must be splinter with four spades so i guess either is possible|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: this is quite a nice position to play transfers after the double|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: 3nt???|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Om partnern har 2 stick som krävs så lirar nog 4@s minst lika bra|pg||
nt|athene: zia loves all his cards now - @DQJ doubleton were a bit rubbish when he picked the hand up but they improved when partner opened 1@D|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks Hearts agreed|pg||
nt|athene: interesting sequence from west - most Acol players would bid 2@S second time|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they play that as constructive with five spdes|pg||
nt|benjy: they must play it as something|pg||
nt|athene: or a relay perhaps|pg||
nt|psyck: the Rumpelsohl version uses transfers, I suppose regular leb here though|pg||

nt|benjy: 4nt looks like an overbid to me|pg||
nt|mamos: EAst has asked for Spade lead but Diamond looks best |pg||
nt|athene: on a spade lead declarer can throw a diamond on a spade and take a ruffing diamond finesse?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: has to go down yet though|pg||
nt|ianmcc: is this hopeless? one pointed suit give pitches for the other|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hesse: nord kan kanskje vinne denne?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: går att spela hem|pg||
nt|psyck: transfers generally have the advantage of being able to show an additionaly hand type, at the cost of a natural bid|pg||
nt|psyck: http://gerbenbridge.blogspot.com/2005/12/your-sohl-or-mine.html|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: not hopeless at all|pg||

pc|h6|nt|hesse: men det skal spilles pent|pg||
nt|athene: does he have the required entries? i think he does - he can just set up dummy|pg||
nt|athene: @S9, @D109|pg||
nt|athene: ah no, the ruffing finesse not enough|pg||
nt|benjy: you have to pitch a @D on the established @S and then take a ruffing @D finesse to make|pg||
nt|athene: since he has only one trump left|pg||
nt|athene: he has to actually drop the doubleton @DK|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|nubmaster: Om öst sticker @hQ så kan det gå hem om dom inte fortsätter @d hela tiden, nu blev det automatbet|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|nubmaster: oj|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. cash the @DA and lead the @D2, not the @D10|pg||
nt|benjy: this won't make, surely he will just take a @D finesse|pg||
nt|athene: too hard (in my opinion)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well zia will give it his best shot|pg||
nt|mamos: I hate all these dull boards!! :) |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well this one DID look dull|pg||
nt|athene: sabine's missing fifth diamond is costly :) you are right, 4-3-5-1 would have had much more offensive potential|pg||
nt|benjy: yes but the downside of no eight card fit|pg||
nt|benjy: the specs have suggested that Sabine would bid 2nt to show 4@S over the 2@S enquiry and hence 4@C showed 4441|pg||
nt|athene: yes, there's plenty of room to show the shape exactly over 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: but you would need to be a more longstanding partnership than NS i think for that|pg||
nt|athene: now zia knows if he draws trumps he is short of tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine he will take straightforward finesse|pg||
nt|benjy: opposite a 4441 i think Zia had a slam try not a slam drive personally, if he had just bid 4@D that would involve partner, but perhaps he thought 4@C showed extras?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|hesse: @h ess var nok ikke beste forsvar|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: depends if 2@S was GF, perhaps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|benjy: Zia encouraged on the A@D as he wanted a ruff, /sabine thought he held the Q@D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: i think the way people play these days, if you only raise partner to 2 and you have a singleton, you are always minimum|pg||
nt|athene: in other words 1@D - 1@H; 3@H is any non-min with a singleton|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: but they surely would?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 14-16 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or even discarding @h instead of @d on the 3rd @c, prevents entry to South for trump promotion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so East will make a try|pg||
nt|psyck: 14-16 is close to the borderline between strong & weak NT's, so those who play different defenses against strong/weak, will need to be clear what they play there (generally ...|pg||

nt|psyck: unfortunately the chances of leading @s on that bidding were zilch|pg||
nt|joest: a revolting development from east's point of view|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c was not what East wanted to see  |pg||
nt|joest: some pairs (like Meckwell once upon a time) have even conventionalized the 4@c response|pg||

pc|d8|nt|benjy: in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: not me i don't think|pg||
nt|benjy: not me|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|benjy: but don't you make 9 tricks on a @H lead?|pg||
nt|benjy: so was there a @S lead in the other room perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: OK, will sign off and try to check the network before the next set|pg||
nt|ianmcc: it would have to have been @s 10|pg||
nt|athene: but 1NT sort of counts as a club bid so maybe this is just showing majors|pg||
nt|athene: and doesn't promise clubs at all|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|joest: turns out they needed to be playing hearts quickly|pg||
pc|d9|nt|joest: Meyers perhaps played too quickly.  She can see spades a risk.  Winning the second diamond and switching to hearts is a path to four tricks from her vantage point|pg||
nt|joest: even so Garner would need to be pretty double dummy to make it now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||

nt|benjy: 4 imps to Sinclair when 1NT was passed un the OR and made 90|pg||
nt|athene: one other point worth a mention|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's really important to get into the bidding over 1nt if you have only a 4-4 fit |pg||
nt|athene: because that 44 fit just isn't taking so many tricks in defence to 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: so with 44 majors maybe double 1nt is right and you just accept the other flaws|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: W is definitely in the tank|pg||
nt|psyck: If he finds @hA lead, @h4 (udca) will be a clear enough signal even if dec drops @hQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: N telling S that he should double to show values.  3H shows shortness|pg||

nt|psyck: With the poor @h suit & useful cards in the doubletons, 1N is fine, but normal to open 1@h playing gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: very friendly table ... both halves the players have been very nice to Opps|pg||

nt|rmb1: Even if you bid clubs naturally, they get lost if you use blackwood|pg||
nt|benjy: firstly i dont think 7@C is making|pg||
nt|benjy: to the king looked normal to me|pg||
nt|psyck: I play repeat stayman, so the @h suit can be found if pd has a gf hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well better than 5s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjy: secondly opposite 3 key cards for many 5@S would be forcing, but that is a matter for agreement|pg||

nt|hesse: men Eide hadde et vanskelig kast, og @d avkastet var gjerne naturlig|pg||
nt|joest: tough play for Weinstein now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so Wolfson goes to the double century - well batted|pg||
nt|joest: Levin could at least go plus for what that's worth if she makes a double dummy guess|pg||
nt|joest: but once east has 5-5 in teh majors + one club it is probably ruight|pg||
nt|joest: *right|pg||
nt|psyck: needs 2 discs for @s, so will play Q|pg||
nt|joest: unless of course east is 4=5=3=1 but that seems unlikely|pg||

mb|d|nt|ppiglett: 2D = constructive spade raise, 2S would be weaker.|pg||
nt|dburn: Gazzilli (actually an American convention called Cole but pinched by the Italians) is a 2@c rebid after 1m-1M|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds :)|pg||
nt|psyck: they use 1@c for balanced hands...|pg||

nt|ralfwil: sista brickan här och några imp in|pg||

mb|3D|nt|benjy: I wonder what 2@H is?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or West does :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: og betydelig med imp tilbake til Sverige|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presume showing a good overcall|pg||
nt|rmb1: a random game try (last train at the two level)??|pg||
nt|benjy: if it was last train, which has been suggested to me, then why on earth is east bidding game?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Some sort last train style bid to describe a reasonable overcall and stay below 2S?|pg||
nt|benjy: terrible minor suit holdings, no ruffing value and minimum in points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes very soft values outside trumps|pg||
nt|benjy: i would be more worried about going off in 3@S than making game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in fact a useless hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and against both opps bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: as will be demonstrated in the play no doubt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bloodaxe: 2@D er 6kort hjerter, enten WJS eller solid utgangskrav uten sidefarge|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East clearly thought that West has a minor shortage and his J-xxx of hearts would be of help.|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Strange: I play 1m - 1M - 2C as Cole, and 1M - 1N - 2C as Gazilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I would have thought Weinstein would have been thrilled to get the green pass card out there last round :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely East didn't think 2@s was natural|pg||
nt|psyck: no, 3@s was just showing stopper|pg||
nt|joest: no.  both east and west are showing their spade stoppers to each other|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, over a nebulous 1@d there is a case for 2@d to be natural|pg||
nt|joest: I like playing it natural|pg||
nt|psyck: as Jack said, there was no need for E to do that though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1D is not nebulous|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d here is at least 4 often 5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: ...with fit of course|pg||
nt|psyck: with 45 in minors they would open 1@d i guess, most other times 5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: stopped in time|pg||
nt|joest: depends on how strong the hand is|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck: with the 3-1 trump break, 5 level was unsafe|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: 1@c-1@s; 1NT - 2@h; 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: the infamous UMJOODO (5-4 in the majors)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: another quick board|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: i'm not sure who i would blame for missing slam, south to a small degree, but his pd had perfect cards for him, the @HJ being critical|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well maybe not, declarer will agonize|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I agree Ben - my first thought was that hearts 4-3 and clubs 3-2 was not great but more to it|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't stop them, though it is beaten on @h ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: not that that defense was likely to be found even after @cQ lead|pg||

nt|psyck: not much of a problem discarding for dec as he has 3 @h's in hand|pg||
nt|psyck: he can throw 2@h & 3@c, both defenders on the other hand will have problems finding 5 discards|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: this is the penultimate hand of this session|pg||
nt|paulg:  probably what the bid deserved, to be fair .... i think NS actually had a misunderstanding over the values for 2@h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|daman: he was a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|paulg:  true, and they have been opening aggressively|pg||

mb|2N|nt|daman: why did he bid 1@H I wonder?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|daman: this will be nasty|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: if you play transfer over this 2NT, better know when to accept the transfer and when to do something else|pg||

nt|rmb1: No option but to finesse @D losing a spade and two hearts|pg||
nt|rmb1: Mossop also went -1 in 2NT on board 10|pg||
nt|jcomyn: NS will probably make 4s here if we are to judge by defence on that crazy 4s|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: "No" :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|mdgraham: if they play 1c-2h as weak 54, then maybe the seqeunce was invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|nubmaster: Ser ut som 3NT med öst som spelförare|pg||
nt|hesse: ja, men Eide har gode kort, og vil nok innlede med et kravbud|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not a good time to bid 3c -what does it mean|pg||
nt|rmb1: 3@C weak jump shift (showing this hand)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3C invitational with clubs - unfortunate hand for S|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Unfortunately a remark was made at the other table in this match about board 16 and was heard in the other match.  So Hinden v Penfold is playing a substitute board 16.|pg||
nt|joest: 2+|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|joest: hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that would be a good hand to check later with deep finesse (you can download it freely)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2D is good heart raise|pg||

nt|Walddk7: EW were lucky in he oher room. A pade lead beats 5@H|pg||
nt|joest: hey roland!|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Roland the Seventh|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi all|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|Walddk7: Or Cohen could have switched from Kx. Too tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I think it is a daft bid|pg||
nt|benjy: if my pd made a weak jump shift i would pass like a shot|pg||
nt|psyck: other table played for either @cA or @hT to be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: small H to Q and then duck a H would do it ... just has to find it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ianmcc: me too I have aces for him|pg||
nt|jcomyn: never mind it will probably make|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = retransfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: wasn't easy to lead @s after both opps bid it|pg||
mb|2S|nt|benjy: I am told 3@C is invitational with @C in which case it is super light|pg||
nt|benjy: but it would explain south bidding 3@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: who was it said  in and old comic -Daft I casll it|pg||
nt|ppiglett: You reach some ropey 3Nts with this type of bid. Partner can judge with Kx in clubs and 2.5 outside winners to push to game|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s = 4+ spades GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: well i just wonder what north would do with an outside Q or K, force to game?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hesse: Eide garderer seg i fall makker er blakk i @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: god bridge etter min mening|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|benjy: lovely switch to the @DJ a surrounding play|pg||

nt|psyck: for their inputs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: On bpard 11, Auken went off in 3@S when Price made 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly surprisin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: uh oh|pg||
nt|joest: they will pay a heavy price for getting to the five level on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk7: KJxx opposite a splinter and 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure while Meyers likes her hand so much|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ianmcc: he didn't make he was allowed|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H is competitive in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: this hand been kind of a breakeven set for north south until now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 5@c cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: 4@S maybe keycard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true|pg||
nt|psyck: splinters are generally limited hands too (othe options available with stronger hands), in addition to the @d wastage & aceless hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: correct 4S was kickback|pg||
nt|joest: a charter member of the Optimist's Society.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you wanted toproceed with the South cards, BW would be the logical way to do it|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ppiglett: No surprise there - it needed the King and Queen come down under the Ace to make|pg||
nt|joest: this is brutal punishment|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psyck: we need a bold & italics option in bbo for that IF, just capitals aint enuf|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfh: looks like 2S was some kind of ask.|pg||
nt|psyck: Many (including me) raise with 3 cards, generally unbalanced hands or with extras.  It is normal to follow the raise with a relay to find shape & values|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|benjy: 2@H and 2NT transfers?|pg||
nt|dburn: this appears to be a strong club auction with an artificial positive and perhaps some relays|pg||
nt|psyck: so 3@d may have been 3 cards, min hand, @d length|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|xenya: 1@H transfer|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
