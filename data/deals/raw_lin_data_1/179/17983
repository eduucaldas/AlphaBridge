nt|iceking: Welcome everyone|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|iceking: will probably end 2 down |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: hi glenn:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: with @S K onside this is all about if Joe can guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  this looks like a terrible contract, but might make on a restricted choice play:  low diamond from dummy and a finesse on the way back|pg||
nt|iceking: importand board for team Bathurst |pg||
nt|iceking: slam was not bid in closed room as we can see |pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will get this right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The director came in and told me I should say something so Grue's reputation as a fast player wouldn't be destroyed :). I said I already had |pg||
nt|iceking: its the % play get this right so i think he will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are also endplay possibilities so not so simple|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue apologizes - I guess he lifted the screen and it knocked M's coffee over|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|iceking: hi Peter|pg||
nt|pelu: Even playing 14-16 NT I would open 1@D in N|pg||
nt|iceking: not my style either open hands like these 1nt|pg||
nt|pelu: no @S-stop, no @H-stop and bad @C-stop :)|pg||
nt|iceking: its like Helgemo Hellness they open 1nt everytime they can it seems|pg||
nt|iceking: Hurd will probably duck this for control he can always play for drop later in the play|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT : only a red lead bring it home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I'm trying to get the computer in another room on the internet - so I didn't see the play here. Will enter score as soon as I can|pg||
nt|iceking: we been waiting for Meckstrooth, there was some cofee accident |pg||
pc|h4|nt|iceking: so we didnt get to see the play Hurd did fine end 2 down was a ugly spot|pg||

nt|marlowepi: operator, something suspected wrong here|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|iceking: 2@S with inviting range,, 2nt was min so bidding ended there|pg||
nt|iceking: 10 tricks in 1nt in closed room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asking about spot card leads - if 4+ clubs, Ten is Rusinow; if 3 or fewer, it's standard (I think)|pg||
nt|iceking: thats a lot looking at this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 2@D alerted probably becouse it is less then 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and easy to defend |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: in trick 2 in CR N played @H4 to 6 and A!|pg||
nt|iceking: that looks right play |pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|iceking: nice lead|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|iceking: try to keep east of the hand for @D play|pg||
nt|pelu: almost the same|pg||
nt|iceking: and Rodwell picked that line also well done |pg||

nt|marlowepi: The Swing, by Robert Louis Stevenson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "how many clubs you have, 6?" Meck: "yes"|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: not sure about there style though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: for some maybe.. i like grue's pass|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|iceking: so will they end up in 2nt again|pg||
nt|puncher99: smolen or puppet auction to 4h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think Meck wrote 20-21, but not positive|pg||
mb|3D!|an|!hs|nt|iceking: should Wooldridge take another action here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|iceking: its little dangerous, he should know his pd has 5+@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clear to move|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: but i would have like 3@c opener better than that 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding in closed room is little odd|pg||
nt|warrens:  if Meck tries, I think they can make 4@H by playing low from S first, guessing the layout|pg||
mb|3S!|an|4-5, 5-4 or 5-5 Majors|nt|puncher99: good declarer play to pin the heart 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: the first double was 5-8 hcp|pg||
mb|4D|nt|iceking: good @S suit H all over the place so Meck gambled on game |pg||
nt|iceking: its a strong @C opening |pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: have to lead a club to score one, then don;t have the tempo to prevent the intrafinesse in trumps|pg||
nt|puncher99: also prob non club lead if Rodwell plays it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: nice game - until u see @Ss 5-0|pg||
nt|iceking: very good spot but it will not have a happy ending |pg||
nt|iceking: fine stop here again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: passing 1@H is 2 much possion to take, as pd could have alot of hands he could not open weak 2 bids exs 4-6-0-3 shapes|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so 2 down little unlucky|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell close to claim 9 tricks, but :(:(|pg||
nt|iceking: its true 3nt is not that good spot on like @H lead or @C lead, but after 2@D overcall you do often get @D lead |pg||
nt|iceking: play not very interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi|pg||
nt|iceking: Hi Henry|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|iceking: This is a qualifier for Bermuda Bowl, the winner of this event will be USA2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Sigurbj√∂rn (bessi)|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|iceking: USA1 is Levin and co|pg||
nt|iceking: welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk3: iceking and bessi2 are partners in the Iceland Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk3: Good luck to them!|pg||
nt|iceking: Zagorin in closed room took another view and passed 2nt|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3 imps probably to Bathurst|pg||
nt|bessi2: which was a very reasonable position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: USA1 for the Bermuda Bowl is the Fleisher team, who won last year's USBC - Marty Fleisher-Michael Kamil, Bobby Levin-Steve Weinstein, Chip Martel-Lew Stansby|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "Are spades 5-0?" Hurd: "yes" Rodwell: "okay, down 2"|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: i am absolut with Meckstroth - 3Nt a nice shot|pg||
nt|puncher99: now he has the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck said he told the opps that Rod probably 3-3 in Majors for 4@d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: right, but if no club lead then no club trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|iceking: thats cute|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|iceking: its a possible swing here on this board both ways|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|iceking: Joe is a tuff player to play against, very creative|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|iceking: with good guess you make 4@H on @S lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can get rid of both @C's, though he'll be left with a @S loser|pg||
nt|puncher99: now he can afford 2 heart losers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D ten coming down|pg||
nt|warrens:  no, take that back, since the @D 10 falls|pg||
nt|warrens:  but he doesn't know that yet|pg||
nt|puncher99: since he must ruff spade in hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on club lead, should put up knave from dummy to ensure maximal entries to hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  .|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell studying dummy - he of course doesn't know all these favorable things |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: yes his passes were very creative here|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|bessi2: he will misguess this|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "sorry"|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: usually they are in games makeing or going down:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|iceking: maybe Joe should have taken some time and think this board over |pg||
nt|marlowepi: did it matter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2 clubs and a D|pg||
nt|iceking: after he wins @D Q he can return @C instead of @S and minus 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: club shift when he won the diamond, I think|pg||
nt|warrens:  a typical meckwell result: an aggressive game made when the defense couldn't find the right play|pg||
mb|3N|nt|warrens:  not that it was so easy to see|pg||
nt|iceking: true it wasnt easy hand to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: but he might have figured it out why does Meck play @D in trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|bessi2: this will make comfortably enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pelu: I hate to play 2Nt - as one commentator put it: 2Nt is like a fly-terminal: u dont stay there but find out where to go|pg||
nt|iceking: wow|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure what is going on here|pg||
nt|pef: this double is not going to work out so well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bessi2: indeed.. very strange dbl|pg||
nt|iceking: actually if Meck just ducks @C then later cashed his @C Ace and Joe gets endplayed in @S |pg||
nt|iceking: he was probably always going to make it|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|puncher99: nice pass by Rodwell|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|pelu: 2@S is described as a very weak support|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont like this 2@C opening either|pg||
nt|puncher99: trick number 9 is hard to find|pg||
pc|hK|nt|iceking: this looks one down also so 3 more imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|iceking: 4 or 5@C for me|pg||
nt|iceking: probably 4|pg||
nt|friggi: not after 4@S|pg||
pc|sK|nt|iceking: this is little dangerous though Meck after winning @D ace has to return @C king|pg||
nt|iceking: so this one is not over |pg||
nt|iceking: lets say Justin playes low @D to Q now Meck has to win with the @D Ace and return @C K then Justin is cooked|pg||
nt|iceking: duck @C K doesnt work as Meck can just play @D and wait for his @H winners|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: generally I dislike overcalling 1N with a 5 card Major.. especially when you can bid it at the 1st level|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might dbl this |pg||
nt|iceking: normal to play bids here nf at 3rd level not sure about 4th |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is poster child for limited openers, standard wouldnt rebid 3C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about the DBL and I think Grue is saying no specific agreement|pg||
nt|iceking: could bid 4@D maybe or just 5@C |pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceking: playing strong @C i would think 2nt here would show good @D hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... very strange bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|iceking: would think with 4-4 minors you can dbl, they might play it as pen|pg||
nt|pef: I guess it was forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|iceking: anyway iam sure they know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: a spec told me that 2N asks for better minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does that mean they have a non-specific agreement?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|iceking: so 420 here|pg||
nt|pef: nice gains on both of the first two 140 for meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: Meck knows 4@H will go down but he is vul|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, does Rodwell's pass invite 6@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it ought to|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might think pd has 6-5 now|pg||
nt|iceking: and probably 6@C and 5@S as no 4@S bid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|bessi2: that is a cool treatment|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|nt|pef: so the match is now down to 30 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "spirited auction"|pg||
nt|iceking: well done now he needs to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: lead down to 30 imps |pg||
nt|iceking: and more to come|pg||
nt|iceking: board 78 is possible swing both ways|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reckon he will|pg||
nt|iceking: yes he will make this for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some chuckling at the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: many would pass in East over 1NT - u are on lead and have a lot of losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about auction and they say they haven't discussed anything after 3@s|pg||
nt|puncher99: prev hand it was actually the suicide sq  if Rodwell didnt cash the heart  his partner couldnt of been squeezed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: In answer to a few questions, we're not showing the Jacobs-Welland match this segment, because one of our operators had to go home and it seemed the least-interesting match|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  Grue's 5 over 5 was pretty risky, as we can see|pg||

nt|warrens:  I don't see why anyone would double on this auction|pg||

nt|puncher99: its not easy on defense not to take ur tricks to avoid squeezing partner|pg||

nt|warrens:  oh, :)|pg||

nt|ritong: so, @s or @d?|pg||
nt|iceking: and will Justin read it as @S void or AK-AQ in @D|pg||
nt|iceking: 2 hard problem i think he will lead @S|pg||
nt|pef: good question|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lall asked about somethiing and Rodwell wrote "4+ @cs, game force" |pg||
nt|pef: I think he'll think about it for quite a while :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: yes as we see NS can not dbl 4@H here|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, West opened a weak 2, raised to 4, and S made a takeout double|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like normal weak 2 opening to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as michael polowan  points out from the wings, the double in the other room was a big action, carryng the equal-level conversion principle to a hiuh level|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|iceking: just 2 hard you really cant blame the guy|pg||
nt|iceking: so 9 imps back to Bathurst |pg||
nt|iceking: alot of action so far this set|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nice score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue puts the screen down to ask about the lead "A from AK in this situation" and signal at trick 1 "standard here"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|iceking: win @D ace in dummy cash @C Ace enter home with @D finnesse|pg||

pc|h3|nt|iceking: ouch|pg||
nt|pef: so meckwell off to a huge start, we are probably close to even right now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: that gives grue a lot of red cards if he has a @s void|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting point is that meckwell changed places|pg||
nt|imp_jan: before meck was south and rod north|pg||
nt|iceking: i feel for the guy it was really not solvable Rodwell could have bid slam on many other hands with stiff @H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: it helped so far!|pg||
nt|ritong: meckstroth is always south  they really tried a voodoo coup|pg||
nt|imp_jan: some kibs say they often switch..|pg||
nt|iceking: short break|pg||
nt|ritong: jeff likes to be south in order to bring the boards on the table|pg||

mb|1H|nt|iceking: doing alot of right things this set Meckwell|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: predict 4th seat 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: or maybe he just felt like it on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: well if it were +120 in 2nt on four boards in a row I'd believe that!|pg||
nt|iceking: is dbl one minor or both majors i assume|pg||
nt|bessi2: is dbl minor or both M's ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pef: double there is "meckwell" which is a variety of hands, but most likely both majors|pg||
nt|iceking: they played like that many years|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceking: another dull 3nt with some overtricks |pg||
nt|iceking: real coffee hand|pg||
nt|pef: it could also be a single suited minor suit hand|pg||

nt|pef: three hearts, a spade, a diamond, and either a long club or a ruff.  defense needs to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting hand... with best defence, lall will need to duck when he plays a @d and north puts in an honour, if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: @s  king now|pg||
nt|iceking: normal return @S now it seems |pg||

nt|iceking: thiswill lead to 1@D |pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell def carding is little speciall like here he play @H K before Ace to show @S interest|pg||
nt|pef: if he now plays a third heart and gives a ruff, meckstroth better switch to a spade immediately|pg||
nt|iceking: rev lavinthal in a way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck, who's thinking "sorry"|pg||
nt|pef: yes meckwell is one of the few pairs who besides playing udca, also play upside down suit preference|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: rodwell likely to switch to @s king no matter what meck pitches|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: Meck did so another 50 50 guess i got wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy to defeat 4@S - @cK will work - but a @H is normal. so 51H with odds!|pg||

nt|iceking: problem here is they might end up in 7@D|pg||
nt|iceking: i think 6@H here should mean we have all keycards but i dont know what to do pd:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bessi2: on a heart lead declarer would probably lead a @d at which time Meck needs to fly in with the ace to play 3 rounds of @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: easy 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|pef: lall has seen partner's opening bids before (and made many of them himself)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 2NT - Grue: "he has a game try of some kind ... 3-level is all forcing to game"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceking: if that is so then 2nt was misbid |pg||

pc|h3|nt|iceking: Meck might lead @D ace vs 4@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: i like that treatment very much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Since 2NT was forcing, he could also bid it with a game force where he didn't want to describe anything|pg||
nt|pef: bathhurst broke the shutout on board 82, nickell-katz got too high.  so lead back to 15 imps|pg||
nt|bessi2: Grue's decision to bid only 4@d on board 82 just earned them 5 imps their first of the set|pg||
pc|hA|nt|warrens:  I agree.  promises the @D ace and denies the @C king|pg||

nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 6@h - Grue says I think he's just letting me know we had all the keycards & 6@c would be Q ask and 6@d maybe natural?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: great auction. the long hesitation might have create potential issues, but sometimes one just has to reflect|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, the 6@d maybe natural was Lall's statement agreeing with Grue about the others|pg||

pc|cT|nt|iceking: but that is matter of style ofcourse|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|warrens:  he knows W is 1156, so I think the Ace of @C and a small @H is best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "sorry"|pg||
nt|warrens:  it is possible declarer is 2056 if the @S Q was a false card from Q5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell still thinking and Meck suggests the 3 of them take a break while he thinks, so they've gone off to smoke while Rodwell figures out the hand :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue "why didn't you bid a NT?"|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt he made overtrick|pg||
nt|warrens:  not 1050, I'm sure|pg||
nt|warrens:  thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: fixed - sorry - forgot he was in 5, I was thinking he was only in 4 so there was an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck: "nothing I can do on that one" Rodwell: "no, I don't think you can"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|bessi2: 4@h now ?|pg||
nt|pef: seems likely|pg||
nt|iceking: or 4@C fitt showing or 4@H splinter |pg||
nt|dougdscsu: might do well to bid 4@c here|pg||
nt|iceking: might just bid 4sp and 5sp later|pg||
nt|pef: be interesting to see who buys this.  probably stops at 5 spades|pg||
nt|bessi2: true.. i like 4¬®@s|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: 5@s X probably par|pg||
nt|iceking: yes 5@S minus one most likely result|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. ak on defence on the 5th level is good.. better bid 4@h and let pd decide maybe  or 4@c|pg||
nt|pef: on the hand where meckwell doubled 2c for down 1 they actually lost 3 imps because nickell katz stretched (and that's putting it mildly) to 4 hearts which mercifully wasn't doubled|pg||
nt|pef: one would think south with akq9 of trumps and kqxx of spades might risk a double|pg||
nt|iceking: 5@S is ofcourse minus 2 |pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4@C?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|iceking: challange here in 3nt |pg||
nt|iceking: duck @H 2 times then guess @D |pg||

nt|imp_jan: close :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: we all meant to say 3@c didn't we ? :)|pg||

nt|imp_jan: 4c wld spade supp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: see what i mean|pg||
nt|puncher99: Lall should of unblocked club 10 at trk 2|pg||
nt|puncher99: much easier if pard plays the spade suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Justin: "must be really bad ... balanced 10?" Rodwell: "if I'm supposed to raise with this ..."|pg||
pc|c6|nt|iceking: true he doesnt |pg||
nt|pelu: the alert on 1Nt = 14-16 - In Europe we dont alert NT-bid when balanced, but diff style here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@S 1@H 3@C 2@D is 9 |pg||
nt|bessi2: but I do expect to learn something from the way he plays it :)|pg||

pc|cA|nt|iceking: not sure Joe can dbl this|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  thanks, Jan.  we all appreciate the great job you do as operator|pg||
nt|puncher99: he was lucky to catch qjx in his pards hand|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "Maybe not the best way to bid it"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bessi2: when he sees hurd discard on the third @h he will know Wooldridge doesn't hold @c king|pg||
nt|pelu: even if u have no entry for the @hs play on and protect pd from finesses|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed good point Peter|pg||
nt|bessi2: most would overcall with KQJ8xx + a king|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|iceking: looking at 7hearts and his black suit holding, i would not think this would go alot down|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|iceking: board 70 was 11 imps to Brathurst |pg||
nt|iceking: bidding on that board in closed looks like misunderstanding so there might have been some problems there|pg||
nt|iceking: its Bathurst sry:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: complicated hand to play|pg||
nt|bessi2: just happy it isnt me who has to play it|pg||
nt|iceking: yes he could be thinking about Q of @C from dummy|pg||
nt|iceking: or low @C to ace alot of options|pg||
nt|iceking: also thinking about what he should discard|pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will discard @S|pg||
nt|bessi2: what about @s discard.. club to the ace, diamond up ?|pg||
nt|bessi2: simple line for simple souls like myself|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|bessi2: I hope Lall plays the @h jack after cashing his second @d trick|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|pelu: Nickell-Katz also in 6@h|pg||

pc|h8|nt|dougdscsu: no reason to duck, either 3 or 5|pg||

nt|pef: you are really weighing 50 points vs. 30 points|pg||
nt|pef: if he wins and the diamond finesse is off he's minus 100 instead of -50.  if he ducks and it's on he's +420 instead of +450|pg||
nt|ritong: ...?|pg||
nt|ritong: the point is: when can it be good to duck?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell thinking about play of the hand I think - he's moving spades around, so most likely on later tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ritong: if the answer is : never, then you don t:)|pg||

mb|2N|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: double is a game try?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and RD?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: not sure -- nothing alerted -- think just showing strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: actually, hat they mean here is secondary to the most important point. we should all, in our regular partnerships, have firmly  established agreements about what these calls mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia was headed to 3@H all along|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: sure. the benefit to be derived here is simply the crucial impirtance of clear agreements. otherwise disaster lurks around every red and blue corner|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N set trap for himself by doubling 2N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then when he passed 3Hm S felt he had to bid on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S seems tohave concluded -- and believed strongly in his conclusion -- that N sequence showed only a 3 card spade raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hurd's 2@S bid did limit his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: yes, there major suits raises after 1m - 1M are usually 3 card raises -- I think they have another way to raise with 4, but I'm not sure what it is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: their major suit raises....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am getting a lot of messages, which i cant answer. the point is that many different agreements are possible here, and if NS have something special agreed we dont know about it. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so all commentary here is speculative|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: seems like they will bid 4@S as in the other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N maybe lost in maze of uncertainties about who has or hasnt promised or forced what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: congrats to the Bathurst team, who played very well today and beat a very strong opponent.  No time to celebrate, however, as they have a tough match tomorrow as well|pg||

mb|1S|nt|iceking: last board of this session coming up |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board of this set - we'll probably restart shortly after the other table finishes.|pg||
nt|iceking: still one more 15 board session left tonight|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|iceking: not many action boards on this set|pg||
nt|pef: this looks like a dull 3nt to end the set|pg||
nt|iceking: strong @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck looking at hands on a previous board so not ready to bid here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pef: well maybe not so dull if meckstroth passes here|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: this is the last board of 5th session 3 more later today|pg||
nt|pelu: last board here - tx to Jan for a perfect job as operator and to my 2 fiends from Iceland and to many very active spects :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will not pass in a million years|pg||
nt|iceking: not there style i think pass here|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: Bathurst leads now with 47 before last session|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|pef: sorry play resumes in an hour and 4 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  only two top losers in @C's, but lots of work to do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Not very many winners, even if not very many losers :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pef: thanks, Jan.  that's Jan Martel who is coordinating everything from the USBF side and is also our vugraph operator|pg||
nt|pef: one more time an hour and 45 minutes|pg||
nt|iceking: anyone who red Meckwells book Win Bermuda bowl with me should know that:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. been a pleasure|pg||
nt|pef: time for a break for the commentators too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell, answering a question about the auction: "we've never had this auction before ... pass is supposed to be a trap or 0-5"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks about lead - Lall: " here we play Rusinow"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should mak ehere|pg||
nt|iceking: not easy here might duck once then win in dummy and lead @C Ace then @C |pg||
nt|iceking: or win home and lead @C to Q this is very close|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might. i'll bet you a nickell he plays ace and queen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceking: if @C king is onside he will unlbock the suit with 3 rounds of @C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceking: yes its a rather odd action |pg||
nt|iceking: Meck really should not havet this hand he has |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|iceking: if this was 70 years ago Peter we would be your 2 friends from Denmark:)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|iceking: standard carding i assume|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pef: he showed good judgment.  1d doubled would probably be down only 2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lalling him into a true sense of security|pg||
nt|warrens:  my double dummy line: duck a @D, then win second trump, ruff a @D, then @H up, lose one @D, and 2 @h's|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|iceking: thx everyone|pg||

nt|pelu: next session in 35 min X.25|pg||

pc|h3|nt|warrens:  perfect|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzfc: results will be available at bridgewinners.com soon after the session ends|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when a team beats Nickell by 40 one hesitates to impugn, but....2H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: welcome to 21st century bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: if the 21st century promises to keep objective ledger of track record of this approach, and subject it to scrupulous analysis, i could conceivably get on board, but pretty big IF ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|marlowepi: 4C again> not with a bang but a whimper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: there certainly are hanging in there and playing hard, despite probably knowing they are beat (but with Meckwell at the other table.....)|pg||
