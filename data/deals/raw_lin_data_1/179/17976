nt|warrens:  this looks like a terrible contract, but might make on a restricted choice play:  low diamond from dummy and a finesse on the way back|pg||
nt|iceking: importand board for team Bathurst |pg||
nt|iceking: slam was not bid in closed room as we can see |pg||
nt|iceking: i think he will get this right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The director came in and told me I should say something so Grue's reputation as a fast player wouldn't be destroyed :). I said I already had |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck back|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are also endplay possibilities so not so simple|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||

nt|pelu: no @S-stop, no @H-stop and bad @C-stop :)|pg||
nt|iceking: its like Helgemo Hellness they open 1nt everytime they can it seems|pg||
nt|iceking: Hurd will probably duck this for control he can always play for drop later in the play|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT : only a red lead bring it home|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I'm trying to get the computer in another room on the internet - so I didn't see the play here. Will enter score as soon as I can|pg||
nt|iceking: we been waiting for Meckstrooth, there was some cofee accident |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|iceking: little lucky here slam wasnt that good, but hard to know in the bidding |pg||

nt|iceking: 10 tricks in 1nt in closed room |pg||

nt|iceking: thats a lot looking at this layout|pg||
mb|d|nt|iceking: 2@D alerted probably becouse it is less then 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: and easy to defend |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in trick 2 in CR N played @H4 to 6 and A!|pg||

pc|hK|mc|8|nt|puncher99: hi there|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: not sure about there style though|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|bessi2: for some maybe.. i like grue's pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|iceking: so will they end up in 2nt again|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: should Wooldridge take another action here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|iceking: its little dangerous, he should know his pd has 5+@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clear to move|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: but i would have like 3@c opener better than that 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding in closed room is little odd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: the first double was 5-8 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: good @S suit H all over the place so Meck gambled on game |pg||
nt|iceking: its a strong @C opening |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|pelu: nice game - until u see @Ss 5-0|pg||
nt|iceking: very good spot but it will not have a happy ending |pg||
nt|iceking: fine stop here again|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|iceking: passing 1@H is 2 much possion to take, as pd could have alot of hands he could not open weak 2 bids exs 4-6-0-3 shapes|pg||
pc|d8|nt|iceking: so 2 down little unlucky|pg||
nt|pelu: Rodwell close to claim 9 tricks, but :(:(|pg||
nt|iceking: its true 3nt is not that good spot on like @H lead or @C lead, but after 2@D overcall you do often get @D lead |pg||
nt|iceking: play not very interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there|pg||

nt|iceking: USA1 is Levin and co|pg||

nt|Walddk3: iceking and bessi2 are partners in the Iceland Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Good luck to them!|pg||
nt|iceking: Zagorin in closed room took another view and passed 2nt|pg||
nt|iceking: so 3 imps probably to Bathurst|pg||
nt|bessi2: which was a very reasonable position|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: USA1 for the Bermuda Bowl is the Fleisher team, who won last year's USBC - Marty Fleisher-Michael Kamil, Bobby Levin-Steve Weinstein, Chip Martel-Lew Stansby|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Grue: "sorry"|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: usually they are in games makeing or going down:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|iceking: maybe Joe should have taken some time and think this board over |pg||
nt|marlowepi: did it matter?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2 clubs and a D|pg||
nt|iceking: after he wins @D Q he can return @C instead of @S and minus 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: club shift when he won the diamond, I think|pg||
nt|warrens:  a typical meckwell result: an aggressive game made when the defense couldn't find the right play|pg||
mb|3H|an|good playing strength|nt|warrens:  not that it was so easy to see|pg||
nt|iceking: true it wasnt easy hand to defend|pg||
mb|d!|an|4+ !ss|nt|iceking: but he might have figured it out why does Meck play @D in trick 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bessi2: this will make comfortably enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I hate to play 2Nt - as one commentator put it: 2Nt is like a fly-terminal: u dont stay there but find out where to go|pg||
nt|iceking: wow|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure what is going on here|pg||
nt|pef: this double is not going to work out so well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: indeed.. very strange dbl|pg||
nt|iceking: actually if Meck just ducks @C then later cashed his @C Ace and Joe gets endplayed in @S |pg||
nt|iceking: he was probably always going to make it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|puncher99: nice pass by Rodwell|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|pelu: 2@S is described as a very weak support|pg||

nt|iceking: this looks one down also so 3 more imps to Nickell|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|iceking: 4 or 5@C for me|pg||
nt|iceking: probably 4|pg||
nt|friggi: not after 4@S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|iceking: this is little dangerous though Meck after winning @D ace has to return @C king|pg||
nt|iceking: so this one is not over |pg||
nt|iceking: lets say Justin playes low @D to Q now Meck has to win with the @D Ace and return @C K then Justin is cooked|pg||
nt|iceking: duck @C K doesnt work as Meck can just play @D and wait for his @H winners|pg||
nt|iceking: Justin actually is in hand not dummy|pg||

mb|3C|nt|dougdscsu: 4@c on the way|pg||
nt|iceking: can Meck pass this|pg||
nt|pef: is 4c forcing?|pg||
nt|iceking: or is this forcing?|pg||
nt|friggi: must be semi support|pg||
nt|iceking: N has very powerful hand now|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: generally I dislike overcalling 1N with a 5 card Major.. especially when you can bid it at the 1st level|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might dbl this |pg||
nt|iceking: normal to play bids here nf at 3rd level not sure about 4th |pg||
nt|marlowepi: this is poster child for limited openers, standard wouldnt rebid 3C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about the DBL and I think Grue is saying no specific agreement|pg||
nt|iceking: could bid 4@D maybe or just 5@C |pg||
mb|r|nt|iceking: playing strong @C i would think 2nt here would show good @D hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... very strange bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: would think with 4-4 minors you can dbl, they might play it as pen|pg||
nt|pef: I guess it was forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|iceking: anyway iam sure they know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: a spec told me that 2N asks for better minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: does that mean they have a non-specific agreement?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|iceking: so 420 here|pg||
nt|pef: nice gains on both of the first two 140 for meckwell|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: Meck knows 4@H will go down but he is vul|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, does Rodwell's pass invite 6@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it ought to|pg||
nt|iceking: Meck might think pd has 6-5 now|pg||
nt|iceking: and probably 6@C and 5@S as no 4@S bid|pg||
mb|6C|nt|bessi2: that is a cool treatment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: so the match is now down to 30 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "spirited auction"|pg||
nt|iceking: well done now he needs to make it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceking: lead down to 30 imps |pg||
nt|iceking: and more to come|pg||
nt|iceking: board 78 is possible swing both ways|pg||
nt|marlowepi: reckon he will|pg||
nt|iceking: yes he will make this for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: some chuckling at the dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: many would pass in East over 1NT - u are on lead and have a lot of losers|pg||
pc|h9|nt|warrens:  Grue's 5 over 5 was pretty risky, as we can see|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|warrens:  at the other table, West opened a weak 2, raised to 4, and S made a takeout double|pg||
nt|iceking: looks like normal weak 2 opening to me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as michael polowan  points out from the wings, the double in the other room was a big action, carryng the equal-level conversion principle to a hiuh level|pg||

nt|iceking: is dbl one minor or both majors i assume|pg||
nt|bessi2: is dbl minor or both M's ?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pef: double there is "meckwell" which is a variety of hands, but most likely both majors|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: DBL of 2@c that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: Hamman also opened 1nt |pg||

pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|pef: but this looks like only down 1|pg||
nt|iceking: this will probably end up 1 down|pg||
nt|iceking: thats a fine result they only make 2-3@S|pg||
nt|pef: three hearts, a spade, a diamond, and either a long club or a ruff.  defense needs to be a little bit careful|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting hand... with best defence, lall will need to duck when he plays a @d and north puts in an honour, if i am not mistaken|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: @s  king now|pg||
nt|iceking: normal return @S now it seems |pg||
nt|pef: board 80 is gong to be a push|pg||
nt|bessi2: to escape one down that is|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|iceking: Meck trying to find pds suit|pg||
nt|iceking: thiswill lead to 1@D |pg||
nt|iceking: Meckwell def carding is little speciall like here he play @H K before Ace to show @S interest|pg||
nt|pef: if he now plays a third heart and gives a ruff, meckstroth better switch to a spade immediately|pg||
nt|iceking: rev lavinthal in a way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck, who's thinking "sorry"|pg||
nt|pef: yes meckwell is one of the few pairs who besides playing udca, also play upside down suit preference|pg||
nt|iceking: will he not discard @S 5 looks correct card|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: rodwell likely to switch to @s king no matter what meck pitches|pg||
nt|iceking: might first discard @D 7|pg||
nt|bessi2: this will end up down 1...|pg||
nt|iceking: not very often you see someone take this long on discard|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|pef: on board 81, bathurst is in 6 diamonds doubled (at the moment) so most likely 15 imps to nickell on that board to pull the match with within 10 imps|pg||

nt|iceking: now 5nt maybe odd number aces void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, as 13 are there|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe Justin should bid 6@H now|pg||
nt|iceking: that looks right to me either 6@C or 6@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: grand there facing Jxx and Kxxxxx (club ace known), and E can have more, so must  be forward going now|pg||
nt|iceking: problem here is they might end up in 7@D|pg||
nt|iceking: i think 6@H here should mean we have all keycards but i dont know what to do pd:)|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bessi2: on a heart lead declarer would probably lead a @d at which time Meck needs to fly in with the ace to play 3 rounds of @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: easy 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|pef: lall has seen partner's opening bids before (and made many of them himself)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 2NT - Grue: "he has a game try of some kind ... 3-level is all forcing to game"|pg||
mb|7S|nt|iceking: if that is so then 2nt was misbid |pg||
nt|iceking: like it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: Meck might lead @D ace vs 4@S|pg||
nt|bessi2: i like that treatment very much|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Since 2NT was forcing, he could also bid it with a game force where he didn't want to describe anything|pg||
nt|pef: bathhurst broke the shutout on board 82, nickell-katz got too high.  so lead back to 15 imps|pg||
nt|bessi2: Grue's decision to bid only 4@d on board 82 just earned them 5 imps their first of the set|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I agree.  promises the @D ace and denies the @C king|pg||
nt|warrens:  well done|pg||
nt|iceking: brilliand stuff in my humble opinion|pg||
nt|iceking: yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck asks about 6@h - Grue says I think he's just letting me know we had all the keycards & 6@c would be Q ask and 6@d maybe natural?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: great auction. the long hesitation might have create potential issues, but sometimes one just has to reflect|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, the 6@d maybe natural was Lall's statement agreeing with Grue about the others|pg||
nt|iceking: thats the problem 6@C would ask for trump Q|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|iceking: but no reason wonder about that as we will never know|pg||
nt|warrens:  right, forgot about that|pg||
nt|iceking: though many pairs dont ask for trump Q after void respond|pg||
nt|iceking: this is such a good bidding when you think about Joe and Justin are not regular pdship|pg||
nt|iceking: 5nt was odd number of aces + a void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell, still thinking about what to play "sorry"|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|pef: board 83 is going to be a push|pg||

nt|iceking: going to be fun night|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: why hasnt he claimed|pg||
nt|pef: only the jacobs--welland match is a runaway with welland up a lot|pg||
nt|iceking: Justin has 11 tricks now so i agree he could really claim here|pg||
nt|iceking: doubt Meck would ever underlead @D ace in this ending|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck is thinking. I don't know why Lall isn't claiming, but I guess if Meck had the @d A, he might underlead it and they certainly aren't in any time trouble|pg||
nt|bessi2: and no real hope for a 12th.. unless he expect meck to underlead his @d ace|pg||

nt|kit: 3@H splinter -- Zia will like his hand a lot!|pg||
nt|kit: He will probably bid RKC however they bid it.|pg||
nt|chip: actually 7S decent and makes|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: Turns out that spades is better trump suit due to source of tricks in clubs for diamond pitches.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|kit: I can't imagine that they will get to a grand though.  Zia would need to find out about the jack of clubs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|santyclz: 1 + a working void.|pg||
nt|kit: 6@C probably one keycard and a heart void|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: think this is 6-card KC (diamonds and spds)?|pg||
nt|chip: Might get to 7 now since i) Zia loves to bid grands, and ii) now not enough room to find out what they are missing. But better be in spades!|pg||
nt|kit: Zia won't be bidding a grand if he thinks he is off a keycard|pg||
nt|kit: He is just trying to choose the right small slam|pg||
nt|chip: Which is the key suit? spades or D?|pg||
nt|kit: spades I think, but apparently king of diamonds is counted as keycard|pg||
nt|chip: Or both as a kibbizer asks. Don't think they play double, but not sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Zia could work out his partner has the good club suit -- but ace of clubs instead of king of diamonds might be missing (assuming double keycard)|pg||
nt|chip: Of course this assumes that Zia knows 6C shows one keycard and trusts Hamman to know it too.|pg||
nt|santyclz: If it's not 2-suit, then 6@h should ask for anything else, such as the @dk.|pg||
nt|chip: Kib points out Zia may expect 6 clubs after the 2C response, no immediate spade raise and a H void.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Assuming it was for @ss.|pg||
nt|kit: Impressively, Lall-Grue got to 7@S in other room!|pg||
nt|santyclz: To view more than one table at a time: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   Open 1 browser window per table.|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|7D|mb|p|nt|kit: 20 IMPs riding on Zia's decision now|pg||
nt|chip: Perhaps he will make 7D by running the Q successfully.|pg||
nt|kit: if it is double keycard, seems like Zia has to pick spades and hope the hand is what it is|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|7N|nt|kit: But if not, then Zia has a real problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: oh no|pg||

nt|bessi2: well.. ak on defence on the 5th level is good.. better bid 4@h and let pd decide maybe  or 4@c|pg||

nt|kit: 2 rounds of trumps by defenders prevents ruff, and declarer has only 6 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 1 club -- unless 8 of spades comes into play for  10|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: When spade is led towards king, will be important for Woolridge to not split|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Hurd needs to lead a red suit, and he probably will|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: after spade to king and ace, Hurd must recognize what declarer is doing with the hand concealed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zia showed an "OK hand for hearts, not the best, not the worst"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: They play upside-down count and attitude, so he should recognize the danger|pg||
nt|kit: And so he did -- very well done|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|kit: only hope now is to ruff out king-doubleton of clubs, and that doesn't happen|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Woolridge under some pressure here -- must pitch diamond|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dQ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: very good discarding by Wooldridge -- there just isn't a winning end position|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|iceking: as he played low @D to ten did keep that entry though|pg||
nt|iceking: why didnt Rodwell pass 5@C it was only one down:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bessi2: it is no coincidence that this is such a close and tough match.. the bathhurst team is Strong and playing well|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|pef: eric rodwell invented the support double that was just used here by his partner|pg||
nt|iceking: lets all remember this is a grueling event players get tyred |pg||
nt|marlowepi: grue ing event|pg||
nt|iceking: hehe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck: "another max" Lall, laughing "as always"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised at no 2C overcall|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: all good here with @D onside|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c9|nt|pelu: Nickell-Katz also in 6@h|pg||
nt|iceking: Wooldridge @S holding is hidden so should probably run @C now |pg||
nt|iceking: no problems with discards home, one @H and one @D is save|pg||
nt|pelu: and the @S-finess cant cost the contract |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: no reason to duck, either 3 or 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks if this is an upside down signal and Lall says "yes, we always play upside down"|pg||
nt|pef: you are really weighing 50 points vs. 30 points|pg||
nt|pef: if he wins and the diamond finesse is off he's minus 100 instead of -50.  if he ducks and it's on he's +420 instead of +450|pg||
nt|ritong: ...?|pg||
nt|ritong: the point is: when can it be good to duck?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell thinking about play of the hand I think - he's moving spades around, so most likely on later tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: if the answer is : never, then you don t:)|pg||
nt|pef: it's good to duck if the diamond finesse is off, you might gain an imp|pg||
nt|pef: it's not clear to win it, as Rodwell just proved by ducking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|iceking: as it happened so 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bessi2: this will be a good result for nickell.. a thin game that will likely be missed at the other table|pg||
pc|sT|nt|iceking: Bathurst has scored 40 imps in last 3 boards |pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that will have to suffice until a good run comes along|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pef: I think I'd say "possibly" rather than likely|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: theres also a slim chance @s are 5-0|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. flat 12 vs flat 10... only an 8card fit|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: in which case  u cant afford to ruff a @h in dummy|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|dougdscsu: nvm|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: take that back ;)|pg||
nt|pef: well at any rate, with one board to go let me thank my fellow commentators, both Icelandic and otherwise :)|pg||
nt|pef: an both bbo and USBF for making this possible|pg||

pc|s8|nt|kit: Best play in diamond suit is low to 9 I think -- gives East chance to err by going up with king-doubleton.|pg||
nt|kit: Otherwise it is still 2 finesses -- East for jack, and if that doesn't work West for king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hurd:  "I want to think about the whole hand"|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|iceking: last board of this session coming up |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board of this set - we'll probably restart shortly after the other table finishes.|pg||
nt|iceking: still one more 15 board session left tonight|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|iceking: not many action boards on this set|pg||
nt|pef: this looks like a dull 3nt to end the set|pg||
nt|iceking: strong @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|pef: well maybe not so dull if meckstroth passes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this is the last board of 5th session 3 more later today|pg||
nt|pelu: last board here - tx to Jan for a perfect job as operator and to my 2 fiends from Iceland and to many very active spects :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: he will not pass in a million years|pg||
nt|iceking: not there style i think pass here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|iceking: Bathurst leads now with 47 before last session|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pef: sorry play resumes in an hour and 4 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|pef: thanks, Jan.  that's Jan Martel who is coordinating everything from the USBF side and is also our vugraph operator|pg||
nt|pef: one more time an hour and 45 minutes|pg||
nt|iceking: anyone who red Meckwells book Win Bermuda bowl with me should know that:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: thx all.. been a pleasure|pg||
nt|pef: time for a break for the commentators too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell, answering a question about the auction: "we've never had this auction before ... pass is supposed to be a trap or 0-5"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks about lead - Lall: " here we play Rusinow"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should mak ehere|pg||
nt|iceking: not easy here might duck once then win in dummy and lead @C Ace then @C |pg||
nt|iceking: or win home and lead @C to Q this is very close|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might. i'll bet you a nickell he plays ace and queen|pg||
pc|dA|nt|iceking: if @C king is onside he will unlbock the suit with 3 rounds of @C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: yes its a rather odd action |pg||
nt|iceking: Meck really should not havet this hand he has |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceking: if this was 70 years ago Peter we would be your 2 friends from Denmark:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|iceking: standard carding i assume|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pef: he showed good judgment.  1d doubled would probably be down only 2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lalling him into a true sense of security|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||

nt|pelu: next session in 35 min X.25|pg||
