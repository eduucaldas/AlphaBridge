nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||

pc|h6|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||

nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
mb|d|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|sT|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|s5|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
mb|3H|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
mb|6C|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||

nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||

nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|benjent: EW play precision, but their 1NT is a little stronger than usual - 14-16|pg||

nt|bessi2: pretty good 6@c contract here but seems doomed to fail as the cards lie|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|benjent: Is it playable? Sure, but he'll need to pull off some magic in the @c suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||

nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||
