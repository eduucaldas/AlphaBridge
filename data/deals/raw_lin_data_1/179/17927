nt|dburn: curious, this - not really a lot of point in bidding 3@s, because partner has no idea what he should be bidding game with|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: so you might as well bid 2@s or 4@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|serhat: other did well staying out of game|pg||
nt|dburn: so thinks Erbil, at any rate, and I don't blame him|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|april7: totally wrong points in p's hand, although it is an ACE!!!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: Koksoy might have taken a swing at this - the test you apply is "will this go two down more often than it will make?"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Yes, and if you do open, it would be nice to get to 3NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Burn, live from the venue in Antalya|pg||
nt|rv: they might get to 3n here|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rv: Hi David|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: some sympathy for that opening - quite a few intermediates|pg||
nt|tez: 3@s i tam yapacak sanýyorum|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pfbr: hi david@h|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: but 3NT certainly preferable to 4@h|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rv: this could make on a @d lead with right @s guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was it Bob Hamman who noted that one of the great traps of bidding is the 5-3 major suit fit with a pair of balanced hands?|pg||
nt|dburn: and likely to make|pg||
nt|rv: declarer could also make it on right @c guess as cards are, though I presume he will run @hs and play on @s for 9th trick|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might play hearts, squeezing everyone, including himself|pg||
nt|rv: well bid, better contract and right-sided as well|pg||
nt|rv: Koksoy's pass in 3rd seat with 11 hcp might be crucial in Lauria misguessing @s|pg||
nt|rv: Lauria might go down here|pg||
nt|hobakan: merhabalar ..:)|pg||
nt|tez: hoþgeldiniz:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: sry Versace|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: as long as diamonds are 5-3 and South has at least one spade honour (all of which is likely from the bidding and the lead), Versace knows he will be OK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|h6|nt|rv: as expected|pg||
nt|dburn: so he will play heart, spade, duck a diamond, etc|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|dburn: North would probably not have passed in third seat with @sAQ and @dKQxxx|pg||
mc|9|nt|rv: my apologies, well played, he didn't cash @h early and could play @s twice from dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: so this is the most likely way to succeed by far|pg||

nt|mamos: well done  -- as so often the great players make things look easy |pg||
nt|Walddk2: True David, I would still choose Lauria|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Funny, another hand where you have to stay off your 5 card spade suit on lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|dburn: he might have to work to make this one if South avoids a spade lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Bill, yes, you should have been here last night when Meck made a 3NT contract destined to go 3 down|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may elect not to play the hand at all, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With a tiny help from his friends|pg||
nt|rv: will Versace double in balancing seat with KX in @hs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, E/W are not going to get rich in 2@H doubled, so already they are behind the 8-ball|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I have the hand nearby|pg||
nt|defiant: skorlar için: http://clubs.vugraph.com/tbricfed/teams_round.php?round=3662|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Well, that's a surprise|pg||
nt|dburn: well, now North will have to avoid leading his own suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://bridgetopics.com/news/2011/may/meckwell-heading-disaster  here it is|pg||
nt|dburn: but that may be slightly easier on the bidding|pg||
nt|rv: Versace's 2n could be conventional here, don't suppose it is natural, weak single suiter hand?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's also got to stay off the club lead|pg||
nt|rv: 2n could be with all competitive hands and direct 3@c/3@d would be stronger?|pg||
nt|rv: sort of good-bad 2n|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although maybe I have that wrong ... the club lead wreaks havoc with the communications, despite conceding lots of club tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|afcevik: herkese merhaba |pg||
nt|defiant: merhaba|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|dburn: well, whatever 2NT meant to Versace was not what it meant to Lauria|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh man ... some conventional 2NT bid seems to have exploded on the launch pad|pg||
nt|ianmcc: looks like it showed more than 13 HCP|pg||
nt|dburn: who thought his partner had another ace or so, as I admit I would have thought|pg||
nt|rv: maybe we and in all likelihood one of Versace or Lauria got meaning of 2n wrong|pg||
nt|hobakan: hoþgeldin:)|pg||
nt|tez: mrb:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: makes us all feel good.  If it can happen to Versace Lauria ...|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn: and even if Lauria were playing this one, I don't think I would back him to make it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: won't lead @h fdor sure|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Versace intended 2n as bad variety of good-bad 2n, Lauria took him more seriously as natural 2n|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: Spec asking if Versace - Lauria are a new partnership ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, 11,919 BBO'ers would have led a spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No further comment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Conceding the club suit like that seems to be the optimum result for the defence|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a strange world|pg||
nt|mamos: hehe isn't bridge wonderful |pg||
nt|dburn: well, cashing the ace of hearts and shifting to a spade would be the optimum defence|pg||
nt|rv: even on this lead, this contract hardly cold because of @d blockage and break|pg||
nt|dburn: but that would be found only in a very strange world|pg||
nt|mamos: no on predicted 4NT :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No David, this is better, because won't Versace be upset when he sees what happens in diamonds|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The irritation factor has got to be worth at least an undertrick|pg||
nt|dburn: I imagine he is fairly upset already - he did not want to play this in 4NT|pg||
nt|rv: poetic justice Roland?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, he has a hugely complicated decision at trick 1, even though we all know he is doomed|pg||
nt|ianmcc: a greek gift?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it is true that if he finds he has four club tricks, he will be momentarily cheered, only to be dismayed again when he only has three diamond tricks|pg||
nt|rv: he could go for broke and go many down here|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 2@h demeli çünkü ortaðýn davetini kabul edecek el var|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|dburn: well, he has to play to make it, of course|pg||
nt|tez: @s rua dam uçuyor..@d empas geçiyor |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|dburn: but he may as well play diamonds first, I guess|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is where he needs to .wav file of glass shattering|pg||
nt|dburn: and now I don't think he can do better than down three|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was a matter of 13 or 14 IMPs away|pg||

nt|hobakan: baþtan 3@d daha iyi olurmuydu bu elle doðudan bilemiyorum|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d2|pc|cJ|nt|rv: Lauria's 2@d shows 6+@h limited hand and Versace can super-accept or cross 2@h with extras|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Venky|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, West generously did not double him, so he escaped quietly for down three|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can also be spades|pg||
nt|rv: 6+M|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it dependent on being a passed hand Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2010Ostend-european/OpenTeams/italy/lauria-versace.pdf|pg||
nt|dburn: don't think so - 2@d one major, 2@h weakish with both majors, 2@s something else (can't remember what)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is invitational with 6+ clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, Versace may just about be OK in this|pg||
nt|rv: not cashing second @c honor might help declarer here, no entry for North hand|pg||
nt|dburn: but the contract is a bit dodgy, so once again Lauria will let Versace play it rather than take Roland's life in his hands|pg||
