mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|mikam1: 2@C is a puppet to 2@D...preparatory to a signoff or other things|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I suspect 2 clubs was a relay to 2D but it was not alerted|pg||
nt|mikam1: I presume|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was alertedI didn't see it trying to recover from the internet glitch|pg||
nt|mikam1: It's a useful tool|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: that 2@C gets alerted only if natural :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Kit not one to go quietly...and he has the right shape, etc.|pg||
nt|mikam1: Probably this will end in 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hovering over bidbox|pg||
nt|chorush: Woolsey suspects thievery.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: schermer points at the red card - stewart points at the 2@C card - they exchange whispers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: note: "in theory we play for penalty"|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think he'll bid 3@D right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores after 5 of 8  15-board segments   http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: seemed like his instinct was to bid 3@D but wanted to know more about the X|pg||
nt|chorush: both 3 clubs and 3 diamonds are likely to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: stewart asking how many @D 1@D showed|pg||
nt|mikam1: One of those law of total tricks things|pg||
nt|chorush: yes 19 trumps = 18 trickes here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Doub [name mispelled in other room]  playing 3@D|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder what Fred is thinking about here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: schermer writes that they open 1@C with 3-3 in minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he is thinking about whether the X is for business|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing different set of boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: but holding @DAQ he cannot believe it could be|pg||
nt|mikam1: Really...doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe confusion over what types of hands would bid 2@C on this auction|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: Stewart reaches his par. Now Schermer has his chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit was just swapping @Cx and @DK from opening the west hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: has written "I don't buy it" under "In theory we play for penalty" on the pad|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: shrugged after finally bidding 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what hand passes 1st seat then penalizes 2@D??|pg||
nt|chorush: So after a few more bids the same contract as in the closed room is reached|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: schermer: "so kit, your double was penalty?"|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well, after much ado about nothing, the auction was normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: kit: "do you want me to answer?"|pg||
nt|mikam1: Kit no doubt sneers at the question|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: cellphone goes off!|pg||
nt|mikam1: Oh no!|pg||
nt|chorush: Schermer will have a trump on the table at the first opportunity and will calim 3 when they break|pg||
nt|mikam1: That can be costly|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director: "as a general rule, when you turn in your cellphones, it's better to turn them off!"|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||

nt|mikam1: Best for EW to stay low on this|pg||
nt|mikam1: Maybe best for everyone to stay low|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|chorush: Look like they use intermediate here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the intermediate vulnerable jump overcall discussed last segment now appears|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Intermediate Jump Overcall when vul?   but is that the right suit/shape??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: A poor time for it, turns out|pg||
nt|mikam1: Weakish diamonds, playability in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if AQ97xx (or AKT7xx last time) is not enough suit quality, the IJO doesn't come up often enough to be useful|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: but yes, this was a bad time|pg||

nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: I will relay what explanations I can read or overhear|pg||
nt|mikam1: North probably should rdbl to show strength and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Schermer PASS  Stewart has tough rebid|pg||
nt|mikam1: Anyway, that's what many play for those types of redoubles|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and for the rest, rely on Al and his readings of the system notes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: pulled out 2@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: finally put it back|pg||
mb|2C|an|transfer cuebid|nt|mikam1: Wonder what that means?|pg||
nt|mikam1: Aha!|pg||
nt|chorush: Most pairs nowadays use transfers in auctions like these; usually, 1NT transfers to 2C, 2C to 2D which becomes a cue bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mikam1: Interesting|pg||
nt|chorush: 2D would be a constructive heart raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is interesting when playing against a Precision 1@D    opponents treat @D as a bid suit,  opening side does not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D shows 0-2@S  [Support DBL situation]|pg||
nt|chorush: Partnerships also have agreements on whether 2H here is weaker than pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: chambers writes explanation of 2@C that I can't read.  then asks about 2@D.  woolsey says natural and chuckles|pg||
mb|2H|an|thumbs down = weak|mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfd: lightning 3@D on Jx|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: woolsey rocking slowly in his chair, eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: stewart meanwhile rocking side to side|pg||
nt|mikam1: Kit probably trying to muddy the waters as to who has values|pg||
nt|chorush: Schermer is confronted with a pinochle deck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wildavsky in 4@H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no meld|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not sure I would have bid 2@H weak opposite a cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he has the dix of his partners suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: This is quite a reasonable overcall...smart bid by Schermer to protect his diamond holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm with you michael   6th @H compensates for  downgrade of @SQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: Chambers should probably pass...his diamond holding is death for hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: chambers has his cards face up, well below the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: stops studying them to have another look at the tray, particulary that 3NT card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: shakes head and passes|pg||
nt|mikam1: I really think it would be an error to pull this...you just "know" 4@H is wrong with lead through partner's diamonds|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mikam1: And Neil felt the same|pg||
nt|chorush: game can be made in either contract if the hearts are guessed|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|mikam1: This will probably fail with hearts 4-1, but...we'll see|pg||

mb|d|an|clubs|mb|r|an|business|nt|mikam1: Many pairs play a double by South here would be "cards" - not lead directing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even as passed hand??|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sorry - missed that :)|pg||
nt|chorush: over 10-12 NT many play that dbl just shows cards. Schermer and Chambers evidently do not use this treatment|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Schermer must still feel like it's his hand - who can blame him?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|chorush: This will be a mistake. The cards were lying so well for EW that they would succeed in 3NT|pg||
nt|mikam1: This one will do quite well|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mikam1: agreed Ira|pg||
nt|ahollan1: methinks Chambers DBL of 2@C ranks up with his earlier [ill-advised]  intermediate jump overcall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. Schermer expects SOME values other than just long @C|pg||
nt|mikam1: I really don't blame him here...if it's purely lead directing...certainly doesn't want any other lead|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'll bet he didn't promise values|pg||

nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||
