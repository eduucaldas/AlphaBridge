mb|1H!|an|4+ !ss|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW are probably playing Ekeblads own version of strong @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hi Al :) welcome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|iceking: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/ for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/  but each match playing different boards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 1N would show 11-13, so Johnson probably rebids 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be 1435  or more normal @C/@D distributions|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: what should north do 4@D maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not that hi|pg||
nt|iceking: or maybe just bid 5@D|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you were right Magnus|pg||
nt|hedyg: most annoying :( he usually is|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@D is no overbid probably fine value bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes after all N is a ph|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: little problem with it is that pd might value his hand wrong holding stiff @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he is limited|pg||
nt|iceking: but fine job good spot 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought opposite possible 1435  he would settle for 3@D   but guess that is such low % hand type ...|pg||
nt|iceking: look at north hand if his pd has stiff @S hand should fitt really well |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner-Weinstein also in 5@D|pg||

nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty decent spot, but not necessarily as these cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on a finess on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3N is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents quiet, they're unlikely to be able to find it.  |pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder what E is thinking about?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: don't know but she is thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: not slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but bid it?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobh1: apparently yes she is thinking of slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two philosophies about transfers over 1@c - show a 4-card major first in a weakish hand, or show the long minor first|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry -- lost my connection but we didn't miss anything.  Garner thinking|pg||
mb|3C|nt|othered1: Is that kickback (RKC in @H?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: doesnt seem like her partner can have 3 kcs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: why not -- isn't she unlimited?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west, I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i guess you're right forgot that E reversed|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Vugraphzfc: obviously she expected more from 3@H (not 4@H)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: did well to find 3N in other room|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|othered1: 4@H by west over 2@H, "fast arrival," I guess would require east to always have either 4@H or 3@S.  Is that absolute in their style?|pg||

nt|iceking: no but @S king might give it|pg||
nt|hedyg: even on a @H lead..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rubin asks about 2@S - just wanted S to play NT. "does he deny a 4 card Major?" "denies one he wanted to show" |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: thnx Jan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like that phrasing|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the cards ain;t worth a dime, if you don;t lay 'em down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT (and sometimes with real clubs, of course)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|marlowepi: some would overcall 1S with N hand too|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: risk/reward of 1@S overcall is not good opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: can W find the killing @d lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the NS responses to 1@c (at the 1-level, anyway) seem remarkably like what I play with one of my partners  |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like 3N isn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are frozen so 4C is a making sve on a squeeze i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same bid in both rooms -- better than 4@H -- shows what they open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 1@s from N alerted as S didn´t support with a 4-card suit?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT could be "non-serious" slam interest, in case responder now wants to cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c very popular in England now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but should be alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one spade denied a 4-cd major (I was catching up and didn't get the alert in and it's too late once the auction ends)|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||

nt|mdgraham: presumably alerted - 4+@D, if the last deal is anything to go by|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: transfer response to 1@C for both pairs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and NS open pretty much any 11 count (not sure about EW)|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@c might be 6+|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceking: indeed |pg||
nt|iceking: and give Bigtrain credit for his 3@H bid it was the winner|pg||

nt|hedyg: or just BIG?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5@S & 4+@H  less than invite|pg||
nt|iceking: this is ver popular convention today 2@H to show weak hand 5@S and 4@H |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: commonly called  reverse flannery|pg||
nt|iceking: if you play transfers after 1@D you use 2@D for this hand|pg||

nt|iceking: i play this convention and we have it possible shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conventionally i think possible, but  with that shape  i suspect more often treated as 1-suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|2D|an|5 spds, 4 hearts, 6+ pts|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||
nt|swanson: The bidding in the other room was a bit exuberant.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||
nt|swanson: 4-5-2-2 hands are not pleasant to bid without Mr. Flannery's convention.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this one is kinda good for Mr F|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||
nt|swanson: But a 2@S rebid after partner's forcing 1NT is unattractive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes you need some kind of gazzilli to really show the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice escape.  Not going to make, but not doubled.  Still a minus on top of the -200 in CR will give Wofson a handy lead.|pg||

nt|Walddk7: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. I think W should play @dQ on @dA. N cannot have a 5-card @d, so It cannot be dangerous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can make now|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Johnson told Rubin earlier in the auction that DBL of 1@s almost guaranteed exactly 4 @hs, so I don't think they'd use support DBLS here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: defense can prevail if they can get it right|pg||
nt|bobh1: win the @H K and play a low @C but maybe she's thought too long for that to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that is what she did|pg||
nt|swanson: The only hope for declarer is 3 heart tricks.  The defense could err because East did not make a negative double and will expect only a three card heart holding.|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't that work (low @C from dummy trick 2) if you guess the @C position next round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't the @H8 give the count?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think @h play is att with the T|pg||
nt|glen: another plan is wait for larry to fall asleep|pg||
nt|swanson: Levin has to win the @HK and lead a low club to give herself any chance I believe.  But South is going to shift to a diamond, which is a killer.|pg||
nt|glen: so everybody likes the @C Q at trick 2?|pg||
nt|glen: after winning @H K|pg||

nt|mdgraham: maybe, after the double, 3@D should be natural  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they were unsure; Weinstein said "if this comes up again we should play our 2@C defense" presumably what they play when regular Stayman is doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now...what do EW lead from (1) four small (2) three small |pg||

nt|ralfwil: probably not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: <scotty> points out that S might have Q10x, wanting E to cash the king and cut himself off from West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: @HQ led in other room after a similar auction (with different bids :))|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@d is probably a 5-card suit, so count the tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important for South to maintain a passive demeanour here |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: without the double S would bid 3@D on any hand without a good 5-cd major -- this situation is undiscussed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know some Souths who would be berating their partners as soon as dummy went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down now and Richter asking Weinstein questions|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: other table has been on 115 a very long time (since our break) maybe something is wrong|pg||
nt|swanson: North might well have considered passing 3NT, but East would removed in any event.  (3NT showed a long minor - not to play.)|pg||

mb|3D|an|no good 5-cd Major|nt|bobh1: the tables aren't linked apparently; wolfson is in good shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|an|no 4-cd Major|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 4@H probably shows specifically a 6-bagger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: apparently the tables got disconnected -- maybe someone can find the scores for us from the other table|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe with a singleton...not sure...can tell you it is not a sign-off|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: last hand. well done Joe |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the commentators and to the specs -- we'll start the next segment soon |pg||
mb|3H|an|weak|nt|mdgraham: EW have missed a couple of chances this set, but the deficit is manageable still|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|nt|swanson: In the Cohen version of Jacoby 2NT, 4@H shows a minimum, but no singleton.  I suppose South though his lack of high cards was compensation for the singleton.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|swanson: Board 117 where E-W went for 300 was a loss.  N-S were evidently minus 100 at the other table.|pg||
