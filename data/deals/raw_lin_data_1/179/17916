nt|marlowepi: is not exactly weak in an absolute sense, but IF he catches a fit then his defensive potential plummets|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17    NS NT range varies a bit|pg||

mb|2D|nt|vugraphzfe: specifically announced|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|athene: 4th best diamond lead will let 3nt make i think, if declarer reads it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i meant MY guess was close enough|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: the EW system summary form just says  "strong nt"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: actually the defence may still be able to hold the position|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4S only game in with a theoretical chance, but would need hand record to make it|pg||
nt|athene: north has to just keep a diamond, the @HA and @SQxx, and he has enough room for that even when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless low D lead of course:)|pg||
nt|athene: low diamond lead looks very normal from south's hand|pg||
nt|athene: with no sure entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding  usually    upside-down: count, attitude, suit pref AND smith   but there are exceptions|pg||
nt|athene: but berkowitz shouldn't be that happy about playing notrumps, with those clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure i agree. as W is marked with a lot of cards in 2 suits, likely to be short in diamonds. so a top diamond is not that likely to cost and may gain hugely|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a 5-5 fit it just doesn't bode well for notrumps because it ties up too many of your cards; there is almost sure to be a weakness elsewhere|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west is likely to have short diamonds, but east isn't?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 92 where bigtrain  [johnson] made 4@S  his teammates were in 4@H down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cokin is telling Johnson its his lead and he is a kibitizer and Johnson says the bidding is not over|pg||
nt|athene: east might try 4@S now :)|pg||
nt|athene: or 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: he still isn't sure which major west actually has, so he can't really offer 4@S as the moysian of choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is, W is likely short and thus N probably doesnt have a doubleton. so top card picks up a stiff honor in dummy and doesnt have much downside. here it reaps an unexpected ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: windfall, but that is not the reason for the high D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Doug has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might find it works nicely when it picks up stiff @DQ/@DJ in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tell Allan the first tournament one attends is always the hardest :)|pg||
nt|glen: can Cokin take over for him?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOLL|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didn't think kib were allowed to talk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe he sang it|pg||
nt|athene: or signalled it in semaphore :)|pg||
nt|glen: its only the us trials, at club games not allowed to talk|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many creative ways to bypass these regulations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct spelling is      guidelines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and STILL we're ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is in the tank|pg||
nt|glen: a problem here for E is a little as @D Txx in W can produce hands that play best in 3NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he had to "GO GET" a director? cab to the casino?|pg||
nt|glen: *as little|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in suit   that translates to 2 quick losers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: even 9xx could be enough. even if 5 card suit on lead, third hand may have HTx|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you start trying to imagine particular layouts it's easy to think of ones to support almost any action|pg||
nt|athene: so that is a bad way to go about bidding i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: laugh is who was thinking|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: not sure if this asks for count or attitude :(|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: it tends to obscure the odds play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure this asks attitude|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, if we carry that line of thought to its conclusion, we stop visualizing typical hands for partner and just bid our points|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: well, when they see all the cards they won't be too upset, as they won't expect EW at the other table to be making any game|pg||

nt|athene: north thinks that south has just a monster one suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another reason for 5N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction strongly suggest  @S|pg||
nt|athene: south could have bid 5nt pick a slam over 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: but he wanted to emphasize the void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even now  6@S accounts for both of North's possible hands|pg||
nt|athene: i think it was optimistic to imagine that partner would be able to bid a grand slam though|pg||
nt|athene: when you are looking at all those honours, you really expect partner to bid 7?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: auction reduces the deck to 30 or 34 points   |pg||

nt|athene: couldn't north have the 11-13 balanced for his bidding so far?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think clever sequence from Johnson  even if they don't find either grand, he sure did try|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they are reasonably safe as long as they dont go past 8NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe [keword]  11-13 bal bids 6N at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or stop in a red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: according to the way some people play pass/double inversion, south should actually not have bid 3@H because that shows a 1-suited hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is now asking a questions|pg||
nt|athene: given NS were in a game force at that point|pg||

nt|glen: those S&Bs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and there  does Willenken start with very heavy 1@H or 2@C   if 2@C, does East enter the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: ace of diamonds was valuable  but could be a problem in 7s if you don't have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so were back to     sometimes preempts work|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: starting with 1M on a 2-loser hand is a death wish|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|glen: remember the sonty hand with 5-5 in another event?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes sometimes they do, but in my opium it should have backfired there. when red opps jam to 5D their fit is pure. all the more reason to be bullish with the NS cards|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzfe: Simson says extra's and Johnson laughs and says I've seen you play them and all laugh|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even with favorable lead still not cold|pg||
nt|athene: not a good hand to try the intra-finesse in spades (small to 9 and J, then lead the Q playing west for 10x)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: maybe he will try stripping the diamonds and playing ace and a club|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: carding = std|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the first part of the intrafinesse lan is ok:)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|athene: endplay doesn't help that much though does it? they can just give a ruff and discard|pg||

pc|d4|nt|glen: this discusses the 5-5 hand in the spingold: http://cam.bridgeblogging.com/?p=474|pg||
nt|athene: and you are still stuck with this 4-4 spade fit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: couldn't hurt|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz puts his hand on top of his head and shakes it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shakes head or hand?|pg||
nt|glen: and that 5-5 hand helped fred's team to the first round bye in this event|pg||
nt|marlowepi: most of us can do that without our hand helping|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and excellent point from spec   here  @C ruff sluff also gives full dist since Sonty will outshow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but maybe wih a black card:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @SA @S to Q is 100%|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h3|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: results get posted to http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16|pg||
