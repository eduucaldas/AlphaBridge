mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW standard signals|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the choice of a 2H  opener suggests EW may be playing 2-tiered weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: leads 3 or low|pg||
nt|glen: or in 3rd seat anything goes|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north's pass is encouraging as normally played, then sough would bid 6D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: they invert meaning of  pass/dbl  in forcing situations|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sontag says looks like overtricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so PASS encourages DBL|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|glen: "looks like overtricks" = "I don't have @H ace"|pg||

mb|1H|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||

nt|ahollan1: full credit to system there|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: sontag says i need to lead a spade and berky says that doesn't help|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs play a form of Precision  so  non 1@C openers  all approximately 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both sides playing a form of Precision  so non 1@C openings are limited|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: this slam may in fact seal the fate for Gordon.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: this is not the auction but the final contract|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: NS have 2 tricks and Berkowitz has 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: sorry about the crash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction adds corroborative evidence to the supposition that EW are playing 2-tiered weak 2s. or else berk is channeling  howard schenken|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Berky say's I can't get them to bid|pg||

nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: is not exactly weak in an absolute sense, but IF he catches a fit then his defensive potential plummets|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17    NS NT range varies a bit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: close enuf|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfe: specifically announced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4th best diamond lead will let 3nt make i think, if declarer reads it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i meant MY guess was close enough|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: the EW system summary form just says  "strong nt"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: slam on a finesse, another hand welcomed by the lagging team, but I am not sure Gordon can take advantage on tis.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perfect fitting cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson says use your judgement|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: actually the defence may still be able to hold the position|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S only game in with a theoretical chance, but would need hand record to make it|pg||
nt|athene: north has to just keep a diamond, the @HA and @SQxx, and he has enough room for that even when declarer runs the clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless low D lead of course:)|pg||
nt|athene: low diamond lead looks very normal from south's hand|pg||
nt|athene: with no sure entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS carding  usually    upside-down: count, attitude, suit pref AND smith   but there are exceptions|pg||
nt|athene: but berkowitz shouldn't be that happy about playing notrumps, with those clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure i agree. as W is marked with a lot of cards in 2 suits, likely to be short in diamonds. so a top diamond is not that likely to cost and may gain hugely|pg||
nt|athene: if you have a 5-5 fit it just doesn't bode well for notrumps because it ties up too many of your cards; there is almost sure to be a weakness elsewhere|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west is likely to have short diamonds, but east isn't?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 92 where bigtrain  [johnson] made 4@S  his teammates were in 4@H down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cokin is telling Johnson its his lead and he is a kibitizer and Johnson says the bidding is not over|pg||
nt|athene: east might try 4@S now :)|pg||
nt|athene: or 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: he still isn't sure which major west actually has, so he can't really offer 4@S as the moysian of choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the point is, W is likely short and thus N probably doesnt have a doubleton. so top card picks up a stiff honor in dummy and doesnt have much downside. here it reaps an unexpected ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: windfall, but that is not the reason for the high D lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Doug has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you might find it works nicely when it picks up stiff @DQ/@DJ in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Simson has gone to get a director|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tell Allan the first tournament one attends is always the hardest :)|pg||
nt|glen: can Cokin take over for him?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: LOLL|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: didn't think kib were allowed to talk|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe he sang it|pg||
nt|athene: or signalled it in semaphore :)|pg||
nt|glen: its only the us trials, at club games not allowed to talk|pg||
nt|athene: there are so many creative ways to bypass these regulations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct spelling is      guidelines|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and STILL we're ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Berkowitz is in the tank|pg||
nt|glen: a problem here for E is a little as @D Txx in W can produce hands that play best in 3NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he had to "GO GET" a director? cab to the casino?|pg||
nt|glen: *as little|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in suit   that translates to 2 quick losers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: NS just don't have the power to bid this almost 50% slam|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: even 9xx could be enough. even if 5 card suit on lead, third hand may have HTx|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you start trying to imagine particular layouts it's easy to think of ones to support almost any action|pg||
nt|athene: so that is a bad way to go about bidding i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: laugh is who was thinking|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: not sure if this asks for count or attitude :(|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: it tends to obscure the odds play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure this asks attitude|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, if we carry that line of thought to its conclusion, we stop visualizing typical hands for partner and just bid our points|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Johnson says we can miss a slam|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: well, when they see all the cards they won't be too upset, as they won't expect EW at the other table to be making any game|pg||

nt|gracelin: in 6S, after DQ wins, declarer needs to play HK, finesse HJ, and use S9 as entry to dummy to cash HA.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Berky showing hand|pg||

pc|d4|nt|marlowepi: true enough. to some extent it is a matter of IMP philosophy, organizing your style to cater to the big-ticket items, and accepting the occasional small losses on partscore hands ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as simply the cost of doing IMP business|pg||
nt|gracelin: if team event maybe you can stand those small losses but in MP game it's vital to play the right partial.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: Berk would have brutal choices of lead against 2@S|pg||

nt|pef: chris is thinking if michael can bid 2c on kqjx, I can certain bid 2d on kqjx|pg||
nt|pef: not michael trying to decide how many diamonds (or something even more creative) to bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there is a N/S sacrifiice here and it looks likely here.-both playing lead directing overcalls- partnership harmony|pg||
nt|pef: if he bids 5d, east might easily bid 5h which is too high|pg||

nt|pef: on slightly different auctions (but both started with a strong 1c) both norths preempted only to 4d leading to the push|pg||
