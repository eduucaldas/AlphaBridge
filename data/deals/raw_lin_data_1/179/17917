nt|bobh1: true it is a good game|pg||
pc|h2|nt|benjy: it must have been|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://www.ebu.co.uk/events/?eventid=14  for results|pg||
nt|benjy: over the moon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This has been a double elimination format where the one remaining undefeated team, Penfold, have special privileges. They can choose their opponents in the semi-finals, and they ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: can elect to play a 40-board match if they are behind after 32 (but they can only do it once). |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Penfold vs Hinden in the other SF|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Maybe @sK then @c?|pg||
nt|mamos: It's an interesting twist that MOssop beat Hinden by 62 imps in the first round  so a final rematch would have some "history" :)|pg||
nt|mamos: 52  |pg||
nt|athene: sometimes in such positions you just set up dummy's long suit because then at least that's one suit the defence can't play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: and you let them do other things to help you|pg||
nt|bobh1: sometimes bad things happen to good games|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ralfwil: men med 3-3, går det väl också hem|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|hesse: ikke lett å bete denne kontrakten, forsvaret var avhengig av @c stjeling som ikke er lett å finne|pg||

pc|dA|nt|jcomyn: how to get opps into the right contract|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|psyck: Basically NS play a simple 2/1 udca, & EW play a more complicated version|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|andyv:  1@s should prevail but E will work hard to not lose any imps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: declarer can't get back to hand but if she leads the @CQ, then the @CJ10x come down|pg||
nt|benjy: declarer can't get off the dummy though, so this will still fail|pg||
nt|athene: i mean lead @CQ after winning the king and unblocking in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but even then a diamond shift takes the entry out before west's trumps are drawn|pg||
nt|athene: so you still can't use the @C9 as a discard|pg||
nt|xenya: even that won'y help him|pg||
nt|benjy: her|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is similar to a 4@S in the semi-final|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @C9 here is playing for east to have misdefended|pg||
nt|athene: because with @CJ10x, objectively, he had to split|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Aj10 of clubs with East is best faint hope|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Hello, David Stevenson here, Tournament Director.  The offical scores from the last stanza of the semi-finals [running scores in brackets] were: Sinclair  30 [104]  Mossop  19 [72]   ====  Penfold 20  [70]  Hinden  17  [66]|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: E hesitated before playing @c3|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|benjy: pitch a @C on the established @S winner and lead trumps from dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: of course East would have played the 10 but sometimes people make mistakes|pg||
nt|athene: now she might continue @CQ but really east can't do anything then but play a diamond, can he?|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Since Penfold did not use her eight extra boards in the semi-final she can claim them in the final after 32 boards if she is losing.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hesse: og tilslutt endte det meget heldig for nordmennene som lå inne for slakt|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: garner may be just working through whether north is more like to have stiff ace of hearts or A10xx|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: vad kostar 5@dX 500 eller 800|pg||
nt|athene: he might be worried she has @DQx(x) in hand but if she has, there's no stopping the contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcomyn: sabine could have walked into it here she could be going for a number instead of -80|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no upside|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcomyn: think all the same that N action very dangerous on vul|pg||
nt|friggi: strange line of play|pg||
nt|benjy: very odd, did he really pitch a @D?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: ok, good play to give the defence a chance to go wrong|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: now there is no point playing for 4-1 trumps (so you can cash the @C9) because then east would have a trump winner anyway|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hesse: det ville gitt svenskene mye imp uavhengig av motspill :)|pg||

nt|joest: 3@h = extra values plus some 5422 pattern|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: They have an art 3@c bid avail here|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c=is an artificial raise with anywhere from mixed to a 3+ card minimum forcing raise.|pg||
nt|psyck: The match is fairly tightly poised at the midway stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@c = 'a minimum'|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, they have more gadgets in their arsenel than just 3@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: cant see explanations|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hesse: godt resultat for Norge i lukket|pg||
nt|athene: if Penfold doesn't use them at all, can she save them up for next year? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think the main argument against the balancing double is that Zia couldn't overcall over 1@C, so the chances of finding him with a 5-card red suit are not so great|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS  making their aggressive intentions clear from the very first boards  -  the opening skirmishes of the longer battle|pg||
nt|athene: but on the other hand, she is obviously pursuing an aggressive policy (early on at least)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed I would expect blood to be spilled in this match 4 very aggressive players|pg||
nt|mamos: Now the Irish find themselves in a rather uncomfortable spot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3c was any minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: values + supp surely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: minor distribution for E is unclear on the auction.  could even be 4-6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psyck: fit jumps are common with passed hands, though usually in 5 carders|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Garner apparently showed H values|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, thx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: using 3@c as any maximum can be done too - gives more room to explore.|pg||
nt|joest: true.  I haven't seen that done but...|pg||
nt|bobh1: strange looking auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hesse: om spillefører nå gjør alt riktig kan det bli mye stikk|pg||
nt|benjy: I don't agree with the X on the last hand and 2@H on that collection is madness in my opinion|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|andyv:  I was just checking with operator to see if that really was the auction... it makes no sense...I have a feeling that Jill bid @h and W might have bid 1@s|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hesse: bra dukk av Simonsen|pg||
nt|athene: it's worth noting that Auken re-opens with double despite holding only *two* in the unbid major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: indeed Ben but tommy doesnt know how to spell PASS|pg||
nt|athene: you double there as often as possible|pg||
nt|athene: because your main upside is the penalty pass from partner|pg||
nt|benjy: but you know partner isn't passing with the north hand|pg||
nt|benjy: looking at the north cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: well, it's unlikely if east is sane, but if partner DOES have a pass, it's big money territory|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 10 tricks-as long as she doesnt cover this(she wont)|pg||
nt|athene: and we saw here east doesn't really have a 2@C overcall|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: according to the textbooks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|friggi: it is agressive at least|pg||
nt|andyv:  then E bid 2@c and W invited with 3@d|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjy: but if partner bids 2@S which they often will, won't you wish you had passed out 2@C?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is risky, i agree, because it's a misfit auction - hearts can easily be north's best suit here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hesse: Nå er gjerne spillefører glad hun ikke fikk @d ut|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry - not 10 tricks |pg||
nt|athene: partner will usually have five spades to bid 2@S there|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 now|pg||
nt|mamos: it depends on which textbooks you have|pg||
nt|joest: so a push|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: yes, i agree, it can go wrong|pg||
pc|h3|nt|benjy: I agree with one of the specs that if you are going to bid then at least overcall directly then you have the upside of getting to a game|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately we only have brief system summaries & no detail convention cards avaialble for the pairs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|benjy: but passing is also a big position, so it's not clear|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: I can see no one will be allowed to play in anything less than 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: not 11 surely?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: made 8 tricks, will correct|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nubmaster: bra att fortsätta @c, möjlig bet annars|pg||
nt|bobh1: or perhaps S doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  that may be even more likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sorry ... yes ... Jill bid 1H and Ronnie bid 1S|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: and Russ bid 2c and Ronnie 3d|pg||
nt|andyv:  now it makes sense and still down at least 1:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: anyway, this will run out of steam|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: david bird should be here as i doubt if anyone will play in 1nt|pg||
nt|benjy: to put the bid in perspective, partner has 2 aces and a trump honour, trumps are as favourable as they can be and it would still have been 500|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hesse: ja, men Rimstedt er nok fornøyd med å ta sine 9 stikk :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: there's going to be a swing here - which way though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N and E discussing carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i assume 1nt by opener would be the weak balanced hand so everything else is 17+ and game-forcing|pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: 2@h guarantees 4 cards|pg||
nt|athene: will zia try a slam on a finesse?|pg||

nt|hesse: slembudet vurderes...|pg||
nt|hesse: @sJ er et nøkkelkort som nord ikke har kontroll på|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Varför bjöd inte N 3@d efter 3@c så S kunde bjuda 3@h? Eller var dom inne i en konv budg som inte erbjöd den chansen?|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if 3@H showed a minimum - Auken does have a max in terms of high cards, but 4333 is terrible and especially three small spades|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Nej, det N funderar på är @h kontroll men S borde ha det som bjuder 4NT så bjud slammen nu|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Danmark nu +20 mod Finland|pg||
nt|ralfwil: vad är 6@d?|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Förmodligen @d äss och erbjuder 6NT som alternativ|pg||
nt|hesse: nå ser det ut til at svenskene kan hente inn en klase imp, siden @sK sitter pent|pg||
nt|hesse: syd vet om @s-tilpassen, så dette kan neppe gå galt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: för mig är det storslamsinvit, eftersom färgen inte nämnts  tidigare som trumffärg|pg||
nt|nubmaster: Finns inte så många andra alternativ såvida inget missförstånd skett tidigare i budgivningen|pg||
nt|benjy: well if 2@S is gf then 3@H may show 3433|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|athene: many people just finesse the queen first with this suit|pg||

pc|h5|nt|nubmaster: Mer spännande än en Horror Movie på kvällen :)|pg||
nt|joest: a club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the spade finesse must be percentage|pg||
nt|joest: clears that suit up for partner, who must worry at the moment if Levin has Q8 left|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks it, anyway|pg||
nt|joest: looks the most straightforward|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, jumped the gun|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you must lose a trick anyway even if the king is onside|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|athene: so you either lay down the ace first or take a deep finesse just in case the J10 are onside |pg||
nt|psyck: could cask @sAK & play towards J|pg||

nt|benjy: you have to pitch a @D on the established @S and then take a ruffing @D finesse to make|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hesse: der tok jeg feil :)|pg||

nt|athene: that is always something to watch out for - if a defender pitches a painless early card from a suit where dummy has four, it's almost aways from 5+|pg||
nt|athene: you just need partner to have @SA or @CK and one heart stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR bidding 1@c 3@c (limit raise) and N passed|pg||

nt|hesse: *Thomassen|pg||
nt|benjy: if 3nt is the right spot then 2@S will get you there, i don't understand the reasoning behind 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|psyck: he can crossruff a few now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|hesse: spar ut vil kanskje også gjøre spillefører noe kort og rar i @h..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: having decided not to bid 1NT over 1H then over 3H it looked a good idea|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: i thought at first south was bidding 3@C with the idea that if it went 3@H P P he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe even taking @c fin on the bidding|pg||
nt|ybob: yep A@D , @C finesse , then ruff @D and @C|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s xfer to @c|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: sort of trying to coax a 3nt bid from partner|pg||
nt|joest: Jill gave her a partner a suit pref for spades by returning a high diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|athene: whereas if you start 2@S and it goes 3@H P P|pg||
nt|athene: now you can't really show the club stop and ask for a heart stop|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|benjy: why did it look a good idea? you have nothing in @S, one stop in @@H and need pd to have solid @Ds|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|athene: but they surely would?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 14-16 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: or even discarding @h instead of @d on the 3rd @c, prevents entry to South for trump promotion|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so East will make a try|pg||
nt|psyck: 14-16 is close to the borderline between strong & weak NT's, so those who play different defenses against strong/weak, will need to be clear what they play there (generally ...|pg||
nt|psyck: defended as Strong)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ....eventually.....|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: S bid 2@s, but does not matter|pg||

nt|ybob: 3NT/5@D even 4@S win N - S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2H can be very weak|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: 2C alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: lots of writing!  don't know what it says|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Gazzilli, perhaps?|pg||
nt|psyck: I would rebid 2@c, on some days i may open 1N too|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mdgraham: EW at the 4-level on eight trumps and a 9-count!  |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 2@c is artificial|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|psyck: a tad overboard|pg||
nt|joest: gazzilli yesw|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: For EW 1C is clubs and 1S is spades :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North will be a bit surprised to find his partner with two hearts |pg||
nt|mdgraham: however.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: after only minor fit found, 3@h should be asking for check & not a cue|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the time to try anything fancy on lead|pg||
nt|ybob: S could bid X over 2@H ...|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe N just assumed opps to have 9 card fit for bidding to 4 level, but not at this vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N and E pantomining something ... now i think discussing 3H bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: W is definitely in the tank|pg||
nt|psyck: If he finds @hA lead, @h4 (udca) will be a clear enough signal even if dec drops @hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as the Hideous Hog said, so contract can be bad if it provokes a lead that is even worse  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N asked W (on other side of screen) if he knows it's his lead.  he acknowledges he does|pg||
nt|psyck: NE & SW generally on same sides of screen|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|benjy: this won't play too well on a @D lead|pg||
nt|joest: 2Nt = less than 7 points, no doubleton heart, no fifth spade|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: the relays misfired on this one|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andyv:  with 11 tricks off the top and the ability to take 2 finesses, a good 6NT was missed here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Ronnie showed the distribution but I did not hear what honors he showe|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjy: will they be able to stop in 6@S?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: imagine that|pg||
nt|ianmcc: It's a wonder they are allowed to play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: wont play too well unless declarer takes good view in hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hesse: her måtte vel gjerne @d ut for bet|pg||
nt|benjy: if east has one @S then 7@S is decent|pg||
nt|ppiglett: As the said a few years ago about bidding, the club suit is well gone, diamond are now gone and hearts and spades need to be carefull. Such a joy to see a few suits natural |pg||
nt|bluejak:  After 1 stanza:  Sinclair 14  Mossop 21   +++  Hinden 23  Penfold 7|pg||
nt|bobh1: its not as if they dont have slam values|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: ok but lets see what suit they play in and at what level|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like std, system said udca|pg||
pc|sT|nt|benjy: if you play on @Hs which looks normal, do you play one to the 8, then you might make, or the king?|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, looked wrong, system says std|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N telling S that he should double to show values.  3H shows shortness|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe it does and maybe it doesn't - is it written down anywhere?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i don't know ... can only report what happens :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: short break.  all back now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bloodaxe: lengste og beste farge ut mot NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: leading from Jxxx forbidden in some partnerships|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein maybe wishing he had opened 1NT and avoided this whole thing|pg||
nt|psyck: With the poor @h suit & useful cards in the doubletons, 1N is fine, but normal to open 1@h playing gazzilli|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: very friendly table ... both halves the players have been very nice to Opps|pg||
nt|joest: agreed.  this is all in retrospect|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hesse: og det var ikke naturlig for Simonsen|pg||
nt|jcomyn: with 7c on?????|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: really 5@s...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: cant be surely|pg||
nt|rmb1: Even if you bid clubs naturally, they get lost if you use blackwood|pg||
nt|benjy: firstly i dont think 7@C is making|pg||
nt|benjy: to the king looked normal to me|pg||
nt|psyck: I play repeat stayman, so the @h suit can be found if pd has a gf hand|pg||
nt|bobh1: somebody underbid|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|jcomyn: well better than 5s|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|benjy: secondly opposite 3 key cards for many 5@S would be forcing, but that is a matter for agreement|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcomyn: settle for six-something|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dburn: fairly arbitrary - but someone might duck the king when they should not|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nubmaster: Det svänger gott, 10 imp tillbaka till Sverige|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice duck by North|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  and, as spec points out, @s break...so slam well above 80%|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|benjy: true|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: and the jack of spades was a creative play as well|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|dburn: whereas no one will mistakenly duck the eight|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bluejak:  Score from first stanza as you see: 26-10|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|othered1: note that east didn't try a  vulnerable weak jump raise, if it was available, even with the Law giver in chief sitting north|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Would you all pass?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: There would probably be little handling after lead of spade 9|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: still, credit to the EW barrage|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h = Michaels|pg||

nt|psyck: should end here|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@c was already a stretch|pg||
nt|joest: agreed.  Given that 2NT was NF (I think) it certainly seems like the auction could end here.|pg||
nt|psyck: nobody likes playing in 4m vul|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: another reluctant P by N |pg||

nt|hesse: @d avkastet til Eide var uheldig (på 3dje @hrunde)|pg||
nt|nubmaster: @c ut och tillbaka, han fick stjäla en @d och nu måste han maska @s för hemgång i 6@c|pg||
nt|hesse: men Eide hadde et vanskelig kast, og @d avkastet var gjerne naturlig|pg||
nt|joest: tough play for Weinstein now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so Wolfson goes to the double century - well batted|pg||
nt|joest: Levin could at least go plus for what that's worth if she makes a double dummy guess|pg||
nt|joest: but once east has 5-5 in teh majors + one club it is probably ruight|pg||
nt|joest: *right|pg||
nt|psyck: needs 2 discs for @s, so will play Q|pg||
nt|joest: unless of course east is 4=5=3=1 but that seems unlikely|pg||

nt|andyv:  this shold be down 4 with accurate defense|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hesse: nå har kontrakten gode muligheter|pg||

nt|psyck: they use 1@c for balanced hands...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: W tells S that 1D is unbalanced|pg||
nt|joest: double = 8+ but east does not owe west another call|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 11 imp inn til Norge i spill 28|pg||
nt|joest: this might well induce Garner to ask with 3@h|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: or 2@s I guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: surely North's values outside spades are too soft to splinter |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so trying someting else.... |pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest: now I guess east just closes his eyes and bids 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: 2@d=weak or strong|pg||
nt|hesse: 2@d er svak eller sterk med @h|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sista brickan här och några imp in|pg||
nt|psyck: Declarer played on @c intead of @d other table for the same 11 tricks last deal in other room|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, trying for slam with N is looking for too specific cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: I wonder what 2@H is?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or West does :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hesse: og betydelig med imp tilbake til Sverige|pg||
nt|jcomyn: presume showing a good overcall|pg||
nt|rmb1: a random game try (last train at the two level)??|pg||
nt|benjy: if it was last train, which has been suggested to me, then why on earth is east bidding game?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Some sort last train style bid to describe a reasonable overcall and stay below 2S?|pg||
nt|benjy: terrible minor suit holdings, no ruffing value and minimum in points|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes very soft values outside trumps|pg||
nt|benjy: i would be more worried about going off in 3@S than making game|pg||
nt|jcomyn: in fact a useless hand|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and against both opps bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: as will be demonstrated in the play no doubt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bloodaxe: 2@D er 6kort hjerter, enten WJS eller solid utgangskrav uten sidefarge|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East clearly thought that West has a minor shortage and his J-xxx of hearts would be of help.|pg||
nt|bluejak:  Strange: I play 1m - 1M - 2C as Cole, and 1M - 1N - 2C as Gazilli|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3N in the other room was a great contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: I would have thought Weinstein would have been thrilled to get the green pass card out there last round :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: surely East didn't think 2@s was natural|pg||
nt|psyck: no, 3@s was just showing stopper|pg||
nt|joest: no.  both east and west are showing their spade stoppers to each other|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mind you, over a nebulous 1@d there is a case for 2@d to be natural|pg||
nt|joest: I like playing it natural|pg||
nt|psyck: as Jack said, there was no need for E to do that though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1D is not nebulous|pg||
nt|joest: 1@d here is at least 4 often 5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: trumps off top for -50|pg||
nt|ppiglett: If the club Ace is onside and the Spade King with North - is this my lucky day?|pg||
nt|psyck: some play 3@d & some play 3other major after a major response to stayman as gf with slam interest|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|nt|psyck: ...with fit of course|pg||
nt|psyck: with 45 in minors they would open 1@d i guess, most other times 5|pg||
nt|andyv:  again the 3@c bid made it difficult for NS |pg||
nt|bobh1: yes but the other room also bid 3@C|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: stopped in time|pg||
nt|joest: depends on how strong the hand is|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|psyck: with the 3-1 trump break, 5 level was unsafe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, sry. Thought 1@d could be 1+|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N passed the 3@c bid and S dbld then converted 3@s to 3N...so that sequence must have shown clubs|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|nubmaster: Men Finland har nu 61-65 mot Danmark med några brickor kvar så det ser ut som vi får årets NM-mästare U25 från Norge|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: they have 1@c for either balanced hands or @c's|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: how many zs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all jumps by N/S are limited to 16 and stronger hands use Gazzilli after 1any- 1any|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|ianmcc: that's a low-looking @d|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|joest: she can't be thinking of ducking this?|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Did South know West would play a club if South didn't cash @CA earlier?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: was it Ernie Entwhistle|pg||
nt|benjy: would a 4th diamond from east have beaten this by another trick? i think it may have|pg||

nt|royhughes: Different styles.  For me, 1 1/2 quick tricks and a 6430 is plenty to open|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vdoubleu: Depends on yr partnership style really..."What does partner expect of me?"|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: agreed|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vdoubleu: Now do they have this down pat here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vdoubleu: Is this inverted?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think they will know 2@c is forcing|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: ;-)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: After that last debacle|pg||
nt|othered1: card says it's forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|royhughes: Where do you want to play on the NS cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|vdoubleu: good Q|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I hope my partner wld put on the brakes|pg||
nt|royhughes: A diamond partial might be nice, but hard to get to after raising clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hard to get to diamonds|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, now it is|pg||
nt|othered1: I've known people to bid an invitational 2N on south's hand, thought I'd prefer 1@D, even with inverted|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think I prefer a 1@d response|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Do they play their inv. m's forcing to 3 of a minor?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vdoubleu: A lot of players do|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 4@s is a playable spot|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well , question answered|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|othered1: I play it forcing to 2N or 3m, but I really don't like inverted minors with a strong NT structure|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Surprise...|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This will be short, but no so sweet|pg||
nt|royhughes: This 3NT didn't have much play even on an underlead of the heart ace|pg||

nt|vdoubleu: Yes, thx|pg||

nt|bobh1: on the second last board of the second last segment a lead change|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final segment scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psyck: Last deal. Thanks Jack & Mike. Good job again Bob.  Thanks kibs.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|benjy: 2@D multi, X showing 12-15 bal or a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: old dilemma - 2@d or 2@H?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfh: P of splinter alerted ... presumably declined to make some kind of lead direction dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: solid 3NT contracts seem the flavour of the day|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal now, the next session will start shortly after this ends. Thanks to my co-commentators Mike & Roberto.  Good job by our Operator Bob.  Thanks to the kibs for joining us & ...|pg||
nt|psyck: for their inputs.|pg||
nt|bobh1: 14 opp 11|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|rmb1: On bpard 11, Auken went off in 3@S when Price made 4@S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hardly surprisin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: uh oh|pg||
nt|joest: they will pay a heavy price for getting to the five level on this one|pg||
nt|Walddk7: KJxx opposite a splinter and 4@S?|pg||
nt|joest: not sure while Meyers likes her hand so much|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: he didn't make he was allowed|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2H is competitive in spades|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest: this hand been kind of a breakeven set for north south until now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 5@c cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|tejjyid: 4@S maybe keycard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true|pg||
nt|psyck: splinters are generally limited hands too (othe options available with stronger hands), in addition to the @d wastage & aceless hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: correct 4S was kickback|pg||
nt|joest: a charter member of the Optimist's Society.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you wanted toproceed with the South cards, BW would be the logical way to do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: No surprise there - it needed the King and Queen come down under the Ace to make|pg||
nt|joest: this is brutal punishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = invite with 5@D??|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: we need a bold & italics option in bbo for that IF, just capitals aint enuf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: looks like 2S was some kind of ask.|pg||
nt|psyck: Many (including me) raise with 3 cards, generally unbalanced hands or with extras.  It is normal to follow the raise with a relay to find shape & values|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjy: 2@H and 2NT transfers?|pg||
nt|dburn: this appears to be a strong club auction with an artificial positive and perhaps some relays|pg||
nt|psyck: so 3@d may have been 3 cards, min hand, @d length|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: not sure ... clearly theysaid invitational notsure of inference of relaying thru 2d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 1@H transfer|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzrt: W has shown 18-19 bal, explains E|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could just be any invite without 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: *3 cards @h...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: thanks all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|Gerben42:  Nickell now leading by 45|pg||
nt|psyck: bye for now, see you shortly in next set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many use 1@C-1@D//1N-2N as puppet to 3@C|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: holding it to -1 is worth 3 imps|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d5|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: bye|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobh1: which i think is doable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Presumably XX (instead of 2H) is competitive in neither major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|benjy: would a @D lead have beaten this?|pg||
