nt|benjent: Hi everybody, and welcome to segment 3 of the USBC quarter final between Jacobs & Welland|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mr murray: dbl?|pg||

nt|pelu: by N|pg||
nt|santyclz: Snapdragon.|pg||
nt|pelu: a Terence Reese X :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: It's a bid weak, though.|pg||
nt|santyclz: *bit|pg||
nt|mr murray: like the word snapdragon. try to use the bid as much as I can :)|pg||
nt|pelu: S could also X here - = good hand 3 card @S (or he would bid 2@s)|pg||
nt|benjent: In good footy parlance ... we've got the close one!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mr murray: 2 diamonds a game force|pg||
nt|glen: good evening all (such as all is), with some high profile matches going on, we will have a close knit group here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: shows 3 spades|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mr murray: wont matter what game they get 2. easy rider this hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: cant seem to find 6 tricks for def.|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s, 1@h, 4@d, 2@c will suffice here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Both play natural with a strong NT. EW in the 2/1 style. Both with some nifty stuff in the mid-auction|pg||
nt|glen: N would not pick the 5-2 fit if he knew the @D shortness was the @D ace|pg||
nt|mr murray: quite a possition taking out to 4 hearts|pg||
pc|d6|nt|benjent: Yeah, South knew he had @d shortage as well ... and still volunteered for 3NT, rather than trying, say, 3@d|pg||
nt|glen: this has no play with the the layout of the major suits|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing wonderful but this is truly poor|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3n/t has certain chances|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing any good on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: With @dQ-5th over the J, 3NT is doomed on reasonable defence|pg||
nt|mr murray: Pass seemed logical choice over 2 hearts|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: @S in trick 2 to K and A gave W the overtrick|pg||

nt|psyck: EW play standard American 2/1. NS play natural opening bids with some artificial followups|pg||

nt|santyclz: *word|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mr murray: dont worry non e of us can spell|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't NS start behind by 3 imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
nt|glen: and that increases to 11|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: it may have come too early in the segment|pg||
nt|pelu: tx for that :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzff: clubs|pg||
nt|mr murray: rather chase 3 imps than 11|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT will be Lebenshol, forcing a 3@C bid|pg||
nt|glen: N only has 5@Cs, but wants to push EW out of 2@S|pg||
nt|mr murray: must be lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George shows John the 3C card and John nods|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzff: auction messed up by me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cant say I understand the bidding|pg||
nt|pef: that wasn't the auction, victor|pg||
nt|santyclz: With a 4 loser hand w makes a practical bid.  Unfortunately e has no cover cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3 loser hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 loser |pg||
nt|mr murray: they got it right|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S will promise 4 (playing support doubles), therefore E knows he has a 5-4 major fit, but 3 points keep saying pass pass pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: cept it becomes 4 by attrition :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS i OP never found the @C-fit (3@d direct from Welland in East|pg||
nt|santyclz: E's x showing 3 card supt for w's presumed @hs?|pg||
nt|mr murray: all true|pg||
nt|glen: this should make, losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|glen: unless declarer takes a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve asks Neil something, gets an answer and puts his hand down and assumes the Thinker pose|pg||
nt|mr murray: might make a n overtrick|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|1C|an|2+|mb|1D|nt|mr murray: big dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|glen: Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are|pg||
nt|glen: that's actually a bogus study, but fun to quote|pg||
mb|d|an|S & H|nt|santyclz: This may get out of hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2c  GF  could be balanced|pg||
nt|mr murray: so true and I am glad that came out :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S shows a power hand in two ways: by bidding again above 2@D and by looking for a fit in a suit that W has|pg||
nt|glen: however N could care less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John just wrote a long note for George|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3h natural no extras prob no stopper|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||

nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room they played a prosaic 4@s on bd 1 to lose 4 imps.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is good decision|pg||
nt|pelu: for I dont like that X with 3-3 i major - why not 1Nt (as Welland in OR??|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he chose n/t he would not like it|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is going to work out better|pg||
nt|santyclz: A genuine "Bramley" x.  4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs makes by leaning to the East side|pg||

nt|mr murray: well played|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: what is the problem with 1NT? if N can penalty D then 2@C by EW is a nice contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, north chose the unfortunate lead of the @da.  Still, that wasn't enough by itself.|pg||
nt|glen: by Namyats, he means 4@C=long @Hs, good hand|pg||
nt|glen: 4@H=it better be a GOOD hand|pg||

nt|santyclz: Nice.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: I am sure schermer wanted to make a slam try but hesitated|pg||
nt|glen: this hand shows why some like to open 11s in a 11-13 style, it kept the open room low in 1NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|glen: here the 11 count passed, but then had to take the 3rd seat opening up to 2NT|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: ok- cant expect them t bid 5S|pg||
nt|pef: play here won't take long, I don't think, draw trumps, take the diamond finesse, peacefully go down 1 unless n/s have a major accident and never get their heart ace|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: schermer asking drew what he would have led if he has splintered in clubs!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||
nt|glen: E's bid here depends on system, and whether 2@C is natural or artificial|pg||
nt|glen: experts have worked hard to convert every @C bid into an artificial meaning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George seems to be in pain, head in his hands|pg||
nt|glen: he is thinking about page 431 of the notes|pg||
nt|glen: do we play xyz over this sequence or abc?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I hate it when I can't remember who I have what agreements with |pg||
mb|2N|an|weak with clubs|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: now stan dard practice is to bid immediate 2H with weak hand|pg||
nt|glen: he hopes that 2NT is a puppet to 3@C, often a @C signoff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve thought for a while, then alerted|pg||
nt|glen: but on page 531 it is revealed as super-blackwood grand slam try|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|pelu: now I dont exp that they can stop in 3@c|pg||
nt|glen: but with a forced waiting bid of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George fakes applauding when steve bid shows up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|glen: good trump lead|pg||
nt|glen: declarer's best line was to ruff a bunch of @Hs in the short @C hand|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: only if 2Nt is transfer to 3@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzff: it was but steve bid 3 nt anyways|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Bob|pg||
nt|mr murray: many play 2n/t asks partner to bid 3 clubs. apparently not here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wolff (still like the word snapdragon better.)|pg||
nt|pelu: a @S-lead will help E a lot|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: but after the bidding a @D would be normal|pg||
nt|pelu: so another game/partscore flat board?? :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||

nt|mr murray: chazur in pure yiddish . all bridge players want more :)|pg||

nt|pelu: or 2 - ok|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|pef: berkowitz and sontag somewhat miraculously stopped in 4c on board 118 and n/w didn't bid 4s, so that's going to be another 6 imps to gordon|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
