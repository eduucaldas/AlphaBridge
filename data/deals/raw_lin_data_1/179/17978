nt|stc: is all this true ?|pg||
nt|stc: a very brave 4@h !!|pg||
nt|caitlin: 4@H seems very aggressive with 11 HCP 3-4-3-3 shape|pg||
nt|stc: I still don't trust the bidding ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: operator is this full bidding?|pg||
nt|caitlin: This will be a forcing defense with 4-1 trump break and with @S losers...can play 2@S trump down declarer.....|pg||
nt|stc: 4@h probably -2...|pg||
nt|stc: the result in OR looks OK|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|stc: we may have a major swing here|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||

nt|santyclz: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_double|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|mr murray: cant seem to find 6 tricks for def.|pg||
nt|psyck: 1@s, 1@h, 4@d, 2@c will suffice here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|benjent: Both play natural with a strong NT. EW in the 2/1 style. Both with some nifty stuff in the mid-auction|pg||
nt|glen: N would not pick the 5-2 fit if he knew the @D shortness was the @D ace|pg||
nt|mr murray: quite a possition taking out to 4 hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@S is a phantom, in that it can be beaten by a @S lead and unlikely @D shift.  But 5@S is a normal spot and requires good defense to beat it.  6@H looks like south is simply ...|pg||
nt|othered1: bidding one more for "safety."  But he knows they have huge red fits|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should still be able to bring this home without too much problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play xfers 1@D and 1@h over their 1@c opener|pg||
nt|andyv:  Mark Epstein is our operator|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mark|pg||
pc|dK|nt|benjent: Yeah, South knew he had @d shortage as well ... and still volunteered for 3NT, rather than trying, say, 3@d|pg||
nt|glen: this has no play with the the layout of the major suits|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing wonderful but this is truly poor|pg||
nt|mr murray: 3n/t has certain chances|pg||
nt|mr murray: nothing any good on this layout|pg||
nt|benjent: With @dQ-5th over the J, 3NT is doomed on reasonable defence|pg||
nt|mr murray: Pass seemed logical choice over 2 hearts|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: @S in trick 2 to K and A gave W the overtrick|pg||
nt|mr murray: it is not like they are behind in match|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: Perhaps west might have considered a double to try to get the @D back.  |pg||

nt|ady: clear|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Has to be very careful though.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'd be giving up a trump that way but needed to probably play the Q@c... hard for E to read the situation|pg||
nt|andyv:  now in dummy gives Steve a bunch of choices and probably headaches too|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|othered1: nice shift, 12 imps back to Aker|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|h2|nt|santyclz: E needs to get his @h trick in before he can coup n.|pg||
nt|mr murray: he could slip but not likely|pg||
nt|mr murray: long as he hooks club there can be no problem|pg||
nt|psyck: one @c entry to play @h, another to play @s for ruff & then exit to get couple of trumps more|pg||

nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mr murray: dont worry non e of us can spell|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't NS start behind by 3 imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
nt|caitlin: 3N better than 4@H|pg||
nt|stc: better not to overbid here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
nt|glen: and that increases to 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it may have come too early in the segment|pg||
nt|pelu: tx for that :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzff: clubs|pg||
nt|mr murray: rather chase 3 imps than 11|pg||
nt|stc: slam needs @h 3-2 and @d finesse, so not good|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
nt|caitlin: brb sorry|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
nt|glen: 2NT will be Lebenshol, forcing a 3@C bid|pg||
nt|glen: N only has 5@Cs, but wants to push EW out of 2@S|pg||
nt|mr murray: must be lebensohl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: George shows John the 3C card and John nods|pg||
nt|caitlin: not yet:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: auction messed up by me|pg||
nt|ady: has 10 tricks in diamonds  assuming no peek of stiff K@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cant say I understand the bidding|pg||
nt|pef: that wasn't the auction, victor|pg||
nt|santyclz: With a 4 loser hand w makes a practical bid.  Unfortunately e has no cover cards.|pg||
nt|psyck: 3 loser hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3 loser |pg||
nt|mr murray: they got it right|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S will promise 4 (playing support doubles), therefore E knows he has a 5-4 major fit, but 3 points keep saying pass pass pass|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mr murray: cept it becomes 4 by attrition :)|pg||
nt|pelu: and NS i OP never found the @C-fit (3@d direct from Welland in East|pg||
nt|santyclz: E's x showing 3 card supt for w's presumed @hs?|pg||
nt|mr murray: all true|pg||
nt|glen: this should make, losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|glen: unless declarer takes a view|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Steve asks Neil something, gets an answer and puts his hand down and assumes the Thinker pose|pg||
nt|mr murray: might make a n overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  better go up with ace|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Vugraphzff: I was having a problem, and missed auction|pg||
nt|mr murray: on misdefense of course|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lml: hello |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|othered1: Hi, Linda!|pg||
nt|lml: Interesting that the heart void decided to penalty double|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like EW went through a Bart-type auction, where 2@D showed @H length.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|psyck: not the dummy he was hoping for, he may even have to duck @d's twice to go -1, could well go -2 |pg||
nt|lml: what do you think of Garner's double?|pg||
nt|othered1: Since 2@D normally shows 5 @H exactly, and east didn't rebid in @H, south "knows" north should have 5 of them.|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|lml: I think the spade length in his hand helps too.  |pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|lml: welcome|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Thomas!|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry for my delay|pg||
nt|tomi2: have missed one huge swing already it seems|pg||
nt|othered1: Two wild hands to start.|pg||
nt|andyv:  should lose 2@c, and 1@s|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|mr murray: declarer tryint to put e on a sti9ff club|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I did suspect as much- I only come on to BBO to study bidding on slam and near-sla hands- and this is what happens|pg||
nt|pelu: this hand show why I 100% prefer that 1@D = 4+ card|pg||
nt|ady: would havgone down on spade lead if finessing  if defence takes 2 spade ruffs and the 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  might not take @s finesse as he can afford to lose 3@c tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mr murray: but shioukdnt have it as he would bid 3 spades with a stiff and 5 tumps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|othered1: both pairs take a standard but with lots of specialized sequences approach|pg||
nt|lml: they didnt double at the other table so this is going to be a swing|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: in the bidding here !NT sh be alerted = @C-suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it was |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|lml: same contract no double|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|d3|nt|tomi2: the double with no trumps migh mislead the declarer, he will not expect this maybe|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|othered1: Garner gets some imagination points here.  Was the auction similar or did west respond 2@H?  That might have dissuaded north from drawing them a road map with a double and would ...|pg||
nt|othered1: have kept south from drawing the same inference as Garner|pg||
nt|lml: it did pinpoint the @DA|pg||
nt|lml: so that the diamond play wasnt much of a guess|pg||
nt|othered1: might be only 5 imps|pg||
nt|ady: then would male 11|pg||
nt|ady: make|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW play several gadgets when they open 1@c but 1@c is not precision style|pg||

mb|2H|nt|othered1: Again:  http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=790&pid=302|pg||
nt|andyv:  although W certainly has 2@d bid|pg||
mb|3D|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
nt|glen: 2@S shows a power hand in two ways: by bidding again above 2@D and by looking for a fit in a suit that W has|pg||
nt|glen: however N could care less|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: John just wrote a long note for George|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S by north is down on a double-dummy @D lead and continuation, but it figures just to be a push|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3h natural no extras prob no stopper|pg||
nt|glen: dear george, how are the white soxs doing this year?|pg||
nt|othered1: In any case, it won't take long to play|pg||
nt|tomi2: if E had bid 3NT - he would have a nice surprise ;)|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT must promise heart support|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: I couldn't ssee f thats what he said, but it ws in red ink|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure a @D lead is easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if EW are on same wavelength|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: at this vul, I would have expected S to be happy to defend|pg||
nt|ady: not clear for this to be doubled   but likely 2 down|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a beautiful contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think so, also this is Bob Lafleur operating|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: I think Aker decided the 4-3 in spades was best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|glen: must be about the bulls|pg||
nt|stc: just made ?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tomi2: how could they bid if not so? west had no @D stopper so he raised his partners suit with some fit|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense has to be careful  here or declarer can scoot by with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bob:)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@S easy down 2, so both room "unlucky"|pg||
nt|mr murray: So many hands I can think of that it makes|pg||
nt|pelu: but here -800 :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wasright it looks like|pg||
nt|mr murray: very true|pg||
nt|mr murray: 500  which is too much|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|othered1: I think it would be found < 1 percent of the time|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: its not obvious to me looking at the south hand what is the right play|pg||
nt|othered1: @HA and more @D should do it but the ruff sluff defense, while some specs think it's obvious (since east figures to be in a 4-3) it will be a nice effort.|pg||
nt|lml: it is true that south can deduce that north has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|lml: I think a ruff sluff without the @HA will work quite well|pg||
nt|othered1: either, I think|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|othered1: maybe not so trivial|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: this isnt over though|pg||
nt|othered1: still room for misguessing, but it is there if east can work it out.  @C position may not be clear at all in context of the auction|pg||
nt|lml: East really feels he has to find the trump queen|pg||
nt|othered1: and t hen he still needs to find a way to run the @C, which he may believe are 3-1|pg||
nt|lml: well if he decides Garner has the @SQ a spade to the 10 seems a start|pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure it is makeable if clubs are 3-1.  Can you think of a way?|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bob|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: he decided that too|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzff: creative typing our theme today|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: possible to go down 3 if another spade finesse is taken   then defence switches to diamonds|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pef: goren seems to be helping declarer here|pg||
nt|caitlin: a @H|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  however on @c back by S, E should get suspicious|pg||
nt|ady: problem  though  no entry to east hand to take 2nd spade finesse|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 3 in OR in 2@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve is a very deliberate player|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pef: although it looks like declarer always has 5 trumps, 3 clubs, and the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: giving up beer card early |pg||

nt|pef: not michael trying to decide how many diamonds (or something even more creative) to bid|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there is a N/S sacrifiice here and it looks likely here.-both playing lead directing overcalls- partnership harmony|pg||

nt|mpny:  i guess 2S|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: quite common nowadays to play xfrs on 1M-(x)|pg||
nt|psyck: allows you to show more hand types including good & bad raises|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe @cT lead|pg||
nt|santyclz: An interesting lead problem.  The @h seems obvious, but s "bid" @cs and is most likely short in @ss.  So...|pg||
nt|glen: E was planning on bidding @S next, but could sit for this X with Axx|pg||
nt|othered1: would be anice hand to be playing 3@C rebid by south as forcing (as in Kaplan-Sheinwold)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for the S hand with a void to blackwood|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: yes, trying for @s ruff could be considered|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: hmm, maybe the play puppet stayman|pg||

nt|othered1: Now 4@D if not some specialized bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: a spec suggests exclusion blwd|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't play it, nor usually kickback, so my 4@D bid would be a simple splinter, slam try in @C|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry, don't know|pg||
nt|pef: I have a feeling it went pass 3d, here, but I could be wrong|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table Wold opened the n hand 1@h and was briefly in 2@hxx'd.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am with you Ed, |pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: if declarer could quickly draw trumps, there would be 2@Hs, 1@S, 5@Ds, and perhaps a @C|pg||
nt|stc: very pushy, bad, but making !!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did we miss a step or is 3N a max. with 3 @s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: OK, exclusion blackwood it is and south will find the ace.  Will he now be able to let north count tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 1430 over excl. |pg||

mb|p|nt|glen: thus this opening lead is working for declarer|pg||

pc|c4|nt|lml: this seems very polite now,your suit no partner your suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: I guess chris really did make a game try on his hand.  well, I suppose it's a good save over 3d by e/w|pg||
nt|pef: We are no longer getting scoring comparisons after that breakdown.  Board 112 was a push.  I'll try to keep you updated on the actual scores|pg||
nt|pef: On board 113, e/w played 3d making 4, so 1 imp to aker.  the actual score is now 239 to 201|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for a hand that couhldnt muster a bid over 2C the North hand is about maximum although I tend to dislike 6-3-2-2. The South hand by contast does not have ennogh to suggest that ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: game is on - however the state of the match may be affecting players' judgement|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N (isn't 3@S a violation of Hamman's Law?) would depend on having the @DK on lead, absent a miracle @H lead to get the shift|pg||

nt|othered1: 4@H will play OK, as cards lie|pg||

nt|psyck: many do not like to distort the major suit lengths...|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here N could also X (= @h-suit) - but too weak|pg||
nt|mr murray: nice pass|pg||
nt|pelu: in my normal system I can bid 3@S in West (weak support)|pg||
nt|pelu: @h-lead can defeat 4@c|pg||
nt|stc: too high, could even go -2|pg||
nt|caitlin: but he has his bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: if the play in the closed room is correct, it looks like 3nt is going to go down on board 115 which should take the majrgin to about 30 imps with 5 boards to go|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|othered1: As with most ambiguous openings that don't show extra strength, it's usually right to compete aggressively.|pg||
nt|lml: one way from here is for declarer to draw two trumps and then play diamonds ... that exquals 1 down  5S a trump, a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be down 1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|d4|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|stc: On 84 EW in 2NT in OR,will give 11 to Aker|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s back by N may either have been:  don't want @c back (denying a void) or upside down suit preference|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, he was down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 8-9 tricks in @h|pg||

mb|2N|nt|pef: chris probably meant 4n as natural there.  great call.|pg||
nt|glen: will trumps 3-2, its just 3 losers and a push|pg||
nt|glen: this form of double, made popular by the italians, acts as a @S transfer|pg||
nt|glen: it designed to increase the chances of overcaller being on lead into the opening hand|pg||
nt|lml: and raising with 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: here 2@S promises 4, while a double would be support with 3|pg||
nt|mpny:  both tables opened 4S, i'd have opened 1|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S on board 70 was a full game swing to Aker, when east in the OR didn't find a winning play against the @H lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@S inOR was a phantom by a couple of tricks. See if it's duplicated here.|pg||
nt|ady: can only see 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: unless club trick |pg||
nt|andyv:  E can't open 1@d, thus the opener of 1@c with only 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: North needs to av oid touch clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  4th best leads|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: I know 6-5 hands can be treated as having a 7-card suit, but it plays havoc with Lawful follow-ups|pg||
nt|mpny:  it will be hard for schermer not to bid 5,|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, especially since he thinks east's twosuits are minors|pg||
nt|othered1: If he knew one was @H,  he'd stay out|pg||

nt|caitlin: not sure yet!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 9 would have promised 0 or 2|pg||

nt|mr murray: that is super light|pg||

nt|mr murray: not choice of most|pg||

nt|stc: excl BW|pg||
nt|caitlin: exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|caitlin: tell me key cards but NOT in clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|othered1: So here's another way, not exactly obvious, how the 6-5 can make evaluation tough.   But partner's on lead and he might not even have a @H to lead|pg||
nt|stc: 5@h = Q@s ?|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mpny:  he may still be afraid that no spade will cash|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|othered1: wow, what a judgment|pg||

nt|othered1: possible 13 imps to welland, assuming the wheels don't fall off on defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: yes, they can actually make 5s if they guess to pin the j of hearts|pg||

nt|andyv:  true|pg||

nt|andyv:  looks like relays with W providing info...I don't have info on their system for this part|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: This h as the potential to tighten the match up quite a bit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: ok- cant expect them t bid 5S|pg||
nt|pef: play here won't take long, I don't think, draw trumps, take the diamond finesse, peacefully go down 1 unless n/s have a major accident and never get their heart ace|pg||

pc|s4|nt|pef: on 117, it looks like gordon will also gain some imps as east bid 5c over a strong 1c opening.  5c doubled goes down 3 for -500 which would be 5 imps for gordon.  it could be more ...|pg||
nt|pef: if n/s do anything but double 5c|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Drew said he wasn't sure what the double of 1NT would be, if I heard him correctly.  With my hearing it could have been something else thoughh|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty to David and thanks to all the specs who joined us|pg||
pc|c2|nt|santyclz: Now a @d.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    thx Bob   and Andy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: but Jacobs was on the right track - His 2Nt ask for 3@C - the winning partscore|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: just trying to find a bid Ed, that moves it forward |pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|pelu: overrules by partner|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt have extras after 3@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pef: down to 20 imps now with board 118 still to come in|pg||
nt|pef: so perhaps this will come down to the final board|pg||
nt|mr murray: uknow what happens when u overrule your partner:)  the gods take over and slap u in the face|pg||
nt|othered1: they've found their major lengths already and there's no reason to think you have to boost them out of slam|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: surprised he didn't eant the @C pitch here|pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  final set of this round of matches will start in about an hour|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|nt|glen: in the Kokish style, S bids a quiet 1@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|glen: and gets loud later|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|glen: in the Italian style, now played more in the US, you double to get values shown, then quietly bid suits|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: given how light Donn-Goren NV overcalls may be|pg||
mb|2D|nt|glen: typically modern bridge, six straight calls with no pass|pg||
nt|othered1: This is the last board of the seventh eighth of the match.  thanks are due to John Stonebraker for the outstanding presentation and commentary.   Thanks also to my fellow ...|pg||
nt|othered1: commentator, Glen Ashton for all h e has added.  Finally we are appreciative of the USBF's bringing this prestigious event to BBO vugraph.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: extending the range to this south hand might be unworkable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Ed and all for joining us|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfd: comments on 2@D vs penX of 1@S?|pg||
nt|glen: this is the old question: if more than one suit shown, do cuebids ask or show stoppers|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfd: cohen touches the red Xs around the tray|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: nice auction, lots of action by EW but NS still got to 3NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfd: barry: can you guys get these?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and takes off.  he's local to Las Vegas and is going home.  they may be out for the final segment then|pg||

nt|glen: thanks John!|pg||
nt|glen: and Ed!|pg||
nt|glen: and specs, a small but dedicated group|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and the slam attempt in the other room brings the match closer.  closing down for now, back at 10 after|pg||

nt|mr murray: unlucky that heart 5 was almost unreadable|pg||
nt|santyclz: What's this?  An actual game???|pg||
nt|othered1: Match is only half way over and 21 imps can come back in a couple of heartbeats.|pg||
nt|caitlin: sorry back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Start time will be 10 minutes after the hour...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pelu: better to play low card = come on - from bad suits u can affort to play high|pg||
nt|mpny:  welland seems to have opened 1N in the other room. here it was hard. east might have done more, but his values did not really look slammish|pg||
nt|lml: I agree with you.  If he is playing hearts he should take the pitch|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: I'm going to nap through the 3rd segment and hope to be awake for the 4th.|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think we have a longish break now or is this last hand for the day? |pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: nice hand|pg||
nt|mr murray: this time upside down would be best of course|pg||
nt|glen: and the last board of the set, still another 15 boards for this evening|pg||
nt|andyv:  Wolfson able to extend their lead by 11 this set...only 29 imps exchanged over 14 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|andyv:  so in about 33 minutes|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT or 5@D  both ok for n/s|pg||
nt|andyv:  that is what you call a solid overcall|pg||
mb|3D|an|mixed|nt|othered1: this is it|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@D likely transfer to @H, leaving east wihtout a good call unless double shows @H.|pg||
nt|caitlin: hard not to be in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: c uall later. enjoyed|pg||
nt|sybarra: last hand for the day  |pg||
nt|lml: well Richter had those covered :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes     maybe double followed by diamonds  unless finding a spade fit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mr murray: cant make but cant blame Jim for bidding on.|pg||
nt|santyclz: The bidding isn't over...|pg||
nt|mr murray: can he not bid 5 diamonds?|pg||
nt|pelu: wd Joe - Its bedtime for me 23.50 here - but tx for at nice evening Joe and Murray  and good job wd by u Bob|pg||
nt|santyclz: 3rd segment is due to start in a little less than an hour.|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye for now.  Nice specs|pg||
nt|mr murray: not a lot to say as there was not a lot to do |pg||
nt|mpny:  again potentially dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|mr murray: If he doesnt he is a genius in waiting|pg||
nt|glen: W shows some values with 1@H then 2@H, since could open 2@H in 4th seat with just a minimum opening|pg||
nt|glen: thus E has just enough to bid again on a misfit|pg||
nt|glen: the secondary cards are tempting, and on layouts where N has the @S Q, there could be enough for 9 nt tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: will pick up the matches tomorrow |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Michael and Ed,  great fun|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N may still be found|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d does well too|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pef: did redouble show hearts there?  they probably play transfers after doubles|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree. the ugly NT opening with a good 5-card major and a worthless doubleton in the other paid huge dividends in the OR|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like Aker played east for that good a h and.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: what is 4@C I wonder?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzff: The redouble showed hearts I think|pg||
nt|pelu: D = 3 card @s|pg||
nt|mr murray: bye Joe and Peter|pg||
nt|santyclz: Bye Murray.|pg||
nt|glen: now W can bid 3@D|pg||
nt|glen: some specs liked 2@D by W on the round b4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't know but they got to 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: hi all - no problem in the play here|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mpny:  you can make 5, even without a heart lead|pg||
nt|othered1: and he'll earn an overtrick, too|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Steve better not think too long here|pg||
mb|6D|nt|glen: yikes, 4@H is falling in love with the wrong person|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Bob, our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
nt|caitlin: I wish open room was faster so we could compare results|pg||
nt|ady: south considering?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: George said something I couldn't catch as he put down the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs for the helpful (and often funny) comments  |pg||
nt|stc: even the lucky position in @c is not enough here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mpny:  a very bad end for Casen Krekorian|pg||
nt|othered1: this is easily makable.  Just strip the black suits and play 3@D and north will  be endplayed in @H.  But there are alternatives|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I guess so|pg||
nt|andyv:  mix up somewhere|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he didn't think long at all...|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C  I dont understand|pg||
nt|ady: may not lead a club    a slight chance|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't comment since I don't know what meaning this pair would attach to it|pg||
nt|ady: but even then  will have to play 3 rounds of trumps to get to the heart discard|pg||
pc|s4|nt|glen: with George it was something very funny|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: and thx to Jan Martel who works hard to organize the operators and the USBF for bringing this great tourney to bbo |pg||
nt|othered1: no, 5 was makable.  I didn't notice west toppling over|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a few  hopeless slams in this set across both tables.  Unusual for play at this level, I'd th ink.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: See you all tomorrow for 2nd half of round of 8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: its a mystery to me why anyone would want to bid hearts on East after 1Dx|pg||
nt|glen: he has a great sense of humor|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe Steve was playing Howard for the A@c|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|ady: of couurse a spade lead still ok  as club can be cashed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pef: the gordon team has made an amazing comeback over the last 6 boards.  I believe they are only down by 14 now with 2 boards to go at the other table, and both boards 119 and 120 ...|pg||
nt|pef: quite good for them.  I think it's going to be very close|pg||
nt|pef: now is a good time to thank my fellow commentator, victor silverstone|pg||
nt|pef: and both bbo and the usbf for making this possible |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the last bd of this segment.  The next segment is sched to start in about 25 min.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mc|11|nt|pef: also our noble vugraph operator, Bob, and of course Roland Wald for the huge work that goes into arranging for all the commenators|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and I thank you Peter our Vugraph operator and al who have stayed here till the end|pg||
nt|pef: there will be all four of the quarterfinal matches on bbo starting tomorrow at 10:30 AM Pacific Daylight Time|pg||
nt|pef: the score is incorrect, somehow 118 was marked as a passout, they were actually in 4 clubs, I believe, making 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't understand how a constructive raise can have 2 aces|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all...cu in little while|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: thanks all, see you in 25|pg||
nt|ady: that made the set fairly level|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
pg||
