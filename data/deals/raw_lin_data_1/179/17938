mb|1D|nt|odysseus69: possibilities here|pg||
nt|pef: 6 diamonds is certainly a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|pef: and with the spade suit frozen and hearts favorable should actually make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kind of against the odds slam that you might bid when you are behind and running out of boards|pg||
nt|pef: yes, good point|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mr murray: out of school too long|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: it may have come too early in the segment|pg||

mb|d|nt|mr murray: some of us never went to school. I was raised as a shepard. Had a hard time finding work in USA so retired early to become a bum :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: And how's that working for you?|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR easy for West to support 1@D (4+ and unbalanced hand)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: EW here play 5 card major and open the better minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: auction messed up by me|pg||

mb|1D|nt|chorush: Wold would have to venture a double on an extremely dubious hand. I wound't consider it|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't necessarily disagree. But what would you like him to bid?|pg||
nt|scarpia:  X of 3D |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|jcmax: OK, dbl. will south bid 4@C over that? I must admit, if I had the S hand I would pass.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 1nt is showing 10-14 (i think)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcmax: IN is a GF relay|pg||
nt|chorush: which is what makes it so dubious. At the 3 level doubles get left in with some frequency|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: ok, let's go with that :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy chatting to Marc about some hand from first match|pg||
mb|p|nt|scarpia:  So you lose 470 on accasion for 8 Imps out|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|scarpia:  It is slow attrition to lose 6 IMPS by being too cautious with shortness|pg||
nt|jcmax: As I said, I don't necessarily disagree with you. I just thought it was a dificult problem :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|scarpia:  A multitude of ways to set this one|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pef: they are in 6d at the other table, so very likely a nice gain for aker to make the margin even larger|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|2S|nt|santyclz: This may get out of hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2c  GF  could be balanced|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|pef: goren seems to have made a slight underbid of 2h on that hand, discounting his "quacks" and three little (almost) hearts|pg||
nt|pef: chris willenken made a very aggressive double|pg||
nt|psyck: not quite the suit i would like to come in with 1@s unfav |pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 2@d now to show good raise|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@s will not hurt EW much as NS make some partial, but stopping at 3@s would have been better|pg||
nt|psyck: a loser in each suit for -1 likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: indeed they did gain 10 imps on the last hand so the margin is up to 46 imps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this action does not get my seal of approval- whatever our side can make will be less than partner will bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I agree with you, although he seems to have been fortunate as 3d is likely to make|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am wrong as usual - maybe double has been devalued in the recession|pg||
nt|pef: I mean "see" the results|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why I hate the double is not because I fear we cant make anything but because I fear that partner will expect much more and will carry us too high|pg||
nt|pef: especially if partner has spades, although while lacking in hcp, if partner has four good spades and a club card, far fewer than 26hcp may be needed to game|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the Open room s found the @da lead which ended things quickly.|pg||

nt|mr murray: takes a lot of intestinal fortiyute not to bid 4 spades on norths hand|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Hmm I wonder why N didn't try for a penalty. Maybe he suspected somebody had a very long club suit anyway?|pg||
nt|chorush: close decision to raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|scarpia:  Same with 2C after a 1C opening - frequency of weak majors far outweigh the benefit of the 2 Minor raise|pg||

nt|odysseus69: just noticed the slam swing when they were pushed into 6D in C losed Room|pg||
nt|santyclz: In the open room they played a prosaic 4@s on bd 1 to lose 4 imps.|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is good decision|pg||
nt|pelu: for I dont like that X with 3-3 i major - why not 1Nt (as Welland in OR??|pg||
nt|mr murray: if he chose n/t he would not like it|pg||
nt|mr murray: this is going to work out better|pg||
nt|santyclz: A genuine "Bramley" x.  4333 with 4 cards in the x'd suit.|pg||
nt|mr murray: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: well they weren't exactly pushed, they never had a chance to stop below slam, but on their auction they might have gotten there anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs makes by leaning to the East side|pg||
nt|psyck: deal 2 was the opposite of prosaic though|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: what is the problem with 1NT? if N can penalty D then 2@C by EW is a nice contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: an unexpected misdefense from Jacobs allowed 4@h to come in|pg||
nt|santyclz: Y, north chose the unfortunate lead of the @da.  Still, that wasn't enough by itself.|pg||

nt|mr murray: those guys get mostly good results from their off-shape dble. Finally coming to all the bridge world . Look what the Italians did to the bridge community in the 50-60's|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mr murray: Yhey had everyone talking to themselves|pg||
nt|pelu: at that time they were better bidders and better card-players|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pef: strong club opening, 2c response showing a positive response in diamonds, and now the south hands becomes huge (on the 6d slam hand)|pg||
