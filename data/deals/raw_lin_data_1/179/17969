nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Debbie Hyatt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My co-commentators are Michael Askgaard and Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and welcome back to Mike Kamil|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Hi all ready to go again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, the BBO boss here. We'd better behave|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fred Gitelman|pg||
nt|mikam1: For this segment it will be Moss-Gitelman vs. Deutsch-Larsen|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Bit of a misfit to start|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect 1N by Deutsch and 3@C by Larsen now|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|askgaard: Yes that would be my bidding too.|pg||
nt|mikam1: quickly passed by Deutsch|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Thinking here is an overbid...bidding 3N is just too much|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mikam1: However....all finesses are on so it just might make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|mikam1: In fact it will make - undeserved perhaps, but I don't think they'll give the imps back :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|askgaard: I can see nothing for the defense to do about this, pretty lucky 3N|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|nt|mikam1: Perhaps Deutsch thought 3@C forcing?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|askgaard: I just think he took his chances with a probable diamond lead looking nice|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe so|pg||
nt|askgaard: But it's just a guess...|pg||
nt|mikam1: One thing about overbidding vs. Moss-Gitelman...they will make you pay when you're wrong - not afraid to double|pg||

nt|bessi2: but not sure I understand why he didn't start with a dbl|pg||

pc|c3|nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|passell: looks like deutch had his rose colored glasses on here|pg||
nt|gulyas: really, a simple double followed by a cue sould have been enough|pg||
nt|gulyas: or at least pass the 4@S|pg||
nt|passell: might have defended 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|bessi2: unfortunately we didn't get to see Larsen's decision over 2@h dbl|pg||
nt|gulyas: its only 500|pg||
nt|bessi2: I prefer pass,  but it is by no means automatic in my view|pg||
nt|passell: against 450 or 420|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: no special reason to open in third, with strength everywhere|pg||
nt|mikam1: Will Gitelman open in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: make the @CK the @SK and he might open 1@S|pg||
nt|mikam1: No...bad suit, no values|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would balance 1nt but then i always say that :)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfe: told 4th best and std|pg||
nt|athene: good to be a passed hand, it means you can use double of 1nt to show some hand you might not otherwise be able to|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: re told 4th best and upside down|pg||
nt|athene: of course game is the worst vulnerability to be taking risks but i still would really not want to pass out 1nt|pg||
nt|mikam1: Might have pushed them up a bit had he balanced|pg||
nt|athene: *game all is the worst...|pg||
nt|askgaard: I might open third seat 1@s|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm a big chicken vul, so I wouldn't balance...besides, only one spot above a 6 would really scare me :)|pg||
nt|athene: true, south isn't exactly Intermediates R Us|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the noise outside of the door is so loud|pg||
nt|athene: that wouldn't stop me balancing, but it would make me feel guilty and ashamed of myself|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mikam1: I would think declarer would win and bang out diamonds here...seems simplest|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|askgaard: I would not have balanced. For me it is 1@s third seat or pass 1N.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer would really prefer to double finesse diamonds here but dummy entries are a problem|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he'll try a club to the ten|pg||
nt|mikam1: Didn't see...short of entries to dummy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: if you try attacking diamonds head-on you lose two and opps can get both majors going...doesn't look good|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: playing on clubs gives you more chance of setting up some tricks fast|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|mikam1: spade back would have been best, but tough defense to find|pg||
nt|athene: oh well, he has gone for diamonds|pg||
nt|askgaard: Yes, very tough to find a spade shift.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s4|pc|s8|mc|7|nt|askgaard: Declarer could have survived a spade shift only if he then goes for clubs (and guesses them)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: unlucky 4 spades both finesses off  heart ace and diamond king|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S goes down here|pg||
nt|frankaus: Red V green preempts are rare tho W has 7 @S|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chessmaste: Welcome to all 8 spectators!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We'll be live soon|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mark and Sigurbj√∂rn|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You'll get more, don't worry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This was the last table up because the operator opened an invisible one by mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's why we don't have a result on board 1 entered|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and no names yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Susan will catch up, eventually, please be patient|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Sometimes best if no one knows your name|pg||
nt|bessi2: 2@s will be no picnic for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now names|pg||
nt|bessi2: at least -3 it seems|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Except Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All good now, thanks Susan|pg||
nt|passell: with a club lead and dia return east has to find the heart shift|pg||
nt|roswolf: a filthy opening even 3rd in hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: 2/1 for N-S, Precision for E-W|pg||
nt|bessi2: good decision by Diamond to pass 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 13-15|pg||
nt|puncher99: choice of lebensol or neg x here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sommer: more ketchup?|pg||
nt|puncher99: may be playing better minor lebensol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: missing a pass operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: making |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: thx|pg||
nt|gulyas: weird lead|pg||
nt|passell: yes  very aggressive against this bidding|pg||
nt|bessi2: I like it.. his prospects with jx in @s aren't very exciting|pg||
nt|bessi2: but I would probably have lead a @c myself... a @h is out of the question in my view|pg||
nt|passell: I also like a club|pg||
nt|passell: diamond in a way makes the defense fool proof|pg||
nt|roswolf: going for the throat|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 76 e/w in the other room bid and made 3nt for a 7 imp pickup|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i fancy defence here|pg||
nt|puncher99: low diam off table south should play king|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome back to Pekka Viitasalo|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ben Thompson|pg||
nt|benjent: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day ben|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry -- we had some difficulties setting up but should be good to go now -- welcome all|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi|pg||
nt|puncher99: south is wondering who has spade k|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: yes, cannot go wrong now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|puncher99: or how to untangle suit if pard has it|pg||
nt|bagman: S should play the Q in most cases (except when the lead is singleton)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|frankaus: very fine bid by Hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: about to have some with my dinner|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gulyas: on a @C lead, a @D return looks natural, and E has to find the @H switch|pg||
nt|passell: after a club lead west should return a trump to make things easier for partner later in the hand|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 16 they did pass 2@Hx, collecting the mentioned 500|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the @S may easily block but declarer runs out of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He just needs to see what developes after that|pg||
nt|puncher99: now is the key play|pg||
nt|bagman: N can duck also, I think, if S plays low|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|passell: the contract on the 1st hand was indeed 2hearts dbld|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 12 to Diamond, taking the lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes playing on diamonds brings home the bacon|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|puncher99: its easier to cover the j then to play the king with low one led|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: N cashes the spade and switches according to S's suit preference|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bagman: If heart, declarer wins that, plays the @DA and and later pushes the @CQ thru south|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a series of avoidance type plays|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much for Diamond to play, but the cards are very friendly and he' s very likely to make the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very quiet bd in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen:  "Everything is working - running out of finesses"|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: agree pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: When S starts thinking, Diamonds hopes get up|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he only needs the @DK to drop :) (so that he can get back to dummy to cash his namesakes)|pg||
nt|puncher99: hand much harder to  play if diam K was played at trk3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent: Faith in his partner - expecting a chunky hand at vul vs not|pg||
pc|dK|mc|9|nt|bagman: Making an overtrick in the endgame|pg||
nt|roswolf: is west really thinking?|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Of course, what do I know?|pg||
nt|athene: east would want to do more than just 2nt over a reverse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: i mean if 2nt was natural and non-forcing it wouldn't be enough with that east hand over 2@D|pg||
nt|mikam1: true enough|pg||
nt|athene: but of course many play it as artificial anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, many ways to play after reverses|pg||
nt|askgaard: Maybe east's passed hand status influenced west's rebid (2N)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|askgaard: Now slam is less likely and 6c spades less likely|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he's less likely to have a hand that will jump to 4@S or look  for slam|pg||
nt|athene: since he didn't open 2@S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: also there is much less chance you have a diamond or club slam on|pg||
nt|athene: when partner is a passed hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: which 2@D reverse might make easier to find sometimes |pg||

nt|athene: hoping for a major suit squeeze|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|mikam1: now Larsen has chance for a squeeze so no need to concede it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: I have seen ppl open 4@H on such a hand in this vul:)|pg||
nt|passell: yes  young and bold ones|pg||
nt|passell: or old and desperate ones|pg||
nt|bessi2: west's hand is pretty vulnerable.. I would simply raise to 4@h giving up on slam|pg||
nt|benjent: Tough position for NS in the auction, and they'll be worried about the double-game swing out|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead changes hands again|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|passell: yes if you think what partner needs for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: Greco had 7 losers  - i would expect 6 |pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: disaster struck again on bd17|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|sommer: friday night dinner with ketchup?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW got into the auction, but played their worst suit, going for 500 in 4@Dx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 11H IS CONTRO;S?OR A TRANSFER?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|bagman: EW likely to end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|puncher99: shows spades|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that 1@H was positive balanced|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: iam told 8-11, no 5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: a trump lead seems safe from west's point of view|pg||
nt|passell: yes when they had a make in 4clubs|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bessi2: it could be disastrous of course but not on this deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chessmaste: Least dangerous perhaps - and I would rather underlead one of my aces than try a diamond|pg||
nt|bessi2: @d 7 is also a very normal lead imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: normal contract|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|chessmaste: Read more|pg||
pc|s3|nt|passell: there is merit on that hand in bidding 4clubs  as partner can still convert to 4diamonds if he is 5-4 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe E should have bid a scrambling 3NT, not sure if they have that available in that situation tho:)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|benjent: killing the @h trick, hoping for a promotion|pg||
nt|benjent: In practice, Wolpert can now pick up the trumps, although he may not|pg||
nt|benjent: The cross-ruff is going to be a lot more appealing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|bessi2: I totally agree with there being merit in bidding 4@c on that last hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: more than just merit even|pg||
pc|c8|nt|passell: the modern way of thing bidding diamonds over clubs at any level is conversion  not extra values|pg||
nt|roswolf: must lose the 2 black aces|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|mikam1: A touch and go game here for EW|pg||

nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|askgaard: This may be a good start - going for the slow club ruff|pg||
nt|athene: he might want to try to play an intra-finesse in trumps|pg||
nt|athene: lead small from dummy playing south for @HK10 or @HQ10|pg||
nt|athene: that's the best way to bring in hearts for only one loser|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are other issues|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't mind losing two hearts and @DA if he can keep control of everything|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mikam1: Club lead threatens a ruff...|pg||
nt|athene: if trumps break 3-2 you are very unlikely to go down so his only (or his main) concern should be 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|askgaard: He need to guess extremely well to make this now, if G plays a club|pg||
nt|mikam1: On a club return now I believe he would only make playing double dummy|pg||
nt|mikam1: Leave trumps alone and run spades - or possibly send a trump through Moss first|pg||
nt|athene: on a club return he would have to run the spades?|pg||
nt|mikam1: If clubs are actually 5-2 though, this might be indicated|pg||
nt|askgaard: yes|pg||
nt|athene: threaten to get the club away from dummy|pg||
nt|mikam1: as Fred opened 1@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: then north can't make a trump trick AND a small trump from a club ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now 4 rounds of spades only hope|pg||
nt|mikam1: If he believes the clubs are 5-2|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he knows south has the @DA as an entry|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think it's really double-dummy|pg||
nt|askgaard: I wonder if he would have run the 8 if Moss had not covered|pg||
nt|athene: looks reasonable enough line to find|pg||
nt|mikam1: That's the question!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|athene: running the @H8 would be a big play - might lose to south and suffer an immediate ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|mc|9|nt|mikam1: He didn't believe the clubs were 5-2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|1D|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably reach 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: Two hearts and a diamond to lose in 4 @S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
nt|puncher99: mite b goin to 4hrts|pg||
nt|puncher99: if they find 44|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing a good raise|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: they might but imo should not|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart game more tricky|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
mb|4H|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||
nt|gulyas: x probably just showing minimum|pg||
nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm 4@H needs care|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|chessmaste: Well I don't think much of the second double, but E/W should emerge with a plus|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Now the @DA and a low back|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bessi2: I must confess that I would have blackwooded in a heartbeat|pg||
nt|passell: good 6nt on the bidding|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gulyas: he can play low, he is in 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: if you paly that the cuebid promises 3 spades the west should bid 3@S over 3@H to suggest a poor quality @H suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: same auction in other room|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can see two probable heart losers; he cannot afford not to finesse|pg||
nt|puncher99: 3n was cold|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: marked @C possition 3 @S 5@C 3@D 1@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed... seems to be by far the safest line|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @HA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|passell: good sing 10 of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: wb Mike|pg||
pc|hK|nt|passell: making 6 is easier in 5  than in 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day mike|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: Covering was a mistake I fear|pg||
nt|bessi2: yes,  and in a spot where playing low was pretty standard|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: indeed|pg||
nt|bagman: S probably holds at least one of the high hearts|pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: sneaky|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|bessi2: I can't get over the bidding.. let alone west's second dbl which is bad imo, but east sitting in the dbl is beyond my understanding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: I think that the low heart was an illusory safety play|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|puncher99: run the spades now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: the contract is cold|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Now declarer needs all three spades and a club to live|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|nt|psyck: some invert the meanings of pass & double in forcing pass situations|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chessmaste: He can overruff and claim after drawing the trump|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bagman: Now three spades and then more spades|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|cK|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That type of result is bad for morale|pg||
nt|bessi2: I still can hardly believe that just happened|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|nt|bagman: standard end game position; N is helpless|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: Moss tells his partner good play|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes, but I'm not sure he was right about that|pg||
nt|athene: a lot might depend on NS's standard lead from three small|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: but i think a doubleton is much more likely|pg||
nt|askgaard: Since declarer didn't think clubs were 5-2, it seems he would likely have run the @h8 as a safety play|pg||
nt|askgaard: So Moss was right to split|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: if clubs really are 5-2 then it's pretty likely north has 3 spades so you can survive that layout|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: north would appear to be 3-4-4-2 then wouldn't he|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Moss asks Deutsch GF?  Larsen has 6 hearts?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Larsen has nothing, Deutsch has nothing, but the contract will make|pg||
nt|mikam1: leads are 3rd and 5th according to system summary...so declarer probably should have gone right|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Deutsch answers no and yes|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: 3 clubs and 1 diamond to lose|pg||
nt|athene: you don't need much when you have some aces and an 8-card suit|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||

nt|benjent: Goodness me. The dealing machine is still set on "goulash" :)|pg||
nt|passell: hi all|pg||
nt|sommer: a-live:)|pg||
nt|sommer: live!|pg||
nt|roswolf: good always good to see some real bridge|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: just more random quiet hands here|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be uncomfortable|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3nt looks likely here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl seems natural|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfj: was not doubvled need to correct|pg||
nt|benjent: NS are going to have to tread carefully here|pg||
nt|bagman: A bit untypical weak two with void, 4 controls and just a so-so suit; in strong club context 1@H could be considered|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|passell: yes 3nt very likely|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was GF, but Kranyak will still feel he has plenty in reserve|pg||
nt|passell: very difficult for Kran to pass here|pg||
nt|benjent: Yeah, easy 4@c bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: Oh well|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed pekka|pg||
pc|h4|nt|passell: maybe he will pass 4nt  very difficult|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|benjent: I like 4@h ... if Wolpert gets the message. His intention is clearly to say "excellent @c's, @h control, bit worried about them there @d's"|pg||
nt|passell: no more plus score available dont see a 10th trick in nt|pg||
nt|benjent: But without explicit suit agreement, this is the kind of auction that can descend into a series of cue-or-signoffs very quickly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bessi2: 2@h will make easily enough|pg||
nt|passell: with the normal dia lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|benjent: They'll be lucky to escape a X now|pg||
nt|passell: the dbl is about to begin|pg||
nt|passell: I predict 6nt dbl down 2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Hamson will X 6@C|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's cheapest action now is the impossible pass :)|pg||
nt|passell: or 6nt|pg||
nt|passell: dont like forcing to slam  too likely partner has a stiff club|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: The 5-1 trump break will annoy declarer, but the contract is in no danger |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|passell: would bid this way with the Q of clubs |pg||
nt|frankaus: no X  :)|pg||
nt|benjent: And with the Red preempt, likely that @c aren't breaking kindly|pg||
nt|passell: yes |pg||
nt|passell: he may be thinking of 6nt to protect ruffs and the dia Q|pg||
nt|passell: seems like he should  now the dbl will come|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|passell: oops|pg||
nt|passell: dbl for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 2 spades, diamond and 4 hearts going one down against a careful defense|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 likely now|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3-1-1-1 tricks, cannot see anything else|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is likely to come up short|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: The problem with 6NT is that you may actually be exposing the @dQ rather than protecting it. The red pre-empter could easily have @dK given your @h strength (and partner's @h ...|pg||
nt|benjent: stopper to boot)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|passell: maybe down 1 hampson may not be greedy if they play dia at trick 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: will try a @S now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|passell: double dummy can duck a club and squeeze north|pg||
nt|passell: yes  true  but protecting the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence are now in control|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bessi2: north must force dummy with the king of @c to hold declarer to 9 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: ty Mr GIB:)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|passell: easier seeing all the hands|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|benjent: 2 off? Kranyak's just going to pump @c's and accept a certain fate I would think|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|7|nt|roswolf: a few back to deutsch|pg||
nt|bagman: Did the players go for a break?|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have only played 5 boards|pg||
pg||
qx|o81|st||md|3ST92HT854DAKT5CK7,SK64HK73D92CAJ953,S73HAQJD8643CQT84,SAQJ85H962DQJ7C62|sv|o|nt|athene: not sure leading the king was right with this suit? best bet for two losers is just doubleton ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|askgaard: K also handles QJ dub|pg||
mb|1D|nt|askgaard: But still...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes lead king is a safety play when you are only bothered by a 4-1 break|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Diamond-Platnick were allowed to score a light game on 77 to basically tie the match again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: you can lead small first time and then still decide to play king next time if you decide someone has QJ tight|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right William, but that was not the case here|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mikam1: this will just come home with all finesses on|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: here we see it's not just a question of hcp for a third seat opener|pg||
nt|athene: south has 10 hcp here, same as on the earlier board|pg||
nt|athene: but here his strength is much more concentrated in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so he thinks it's worth the opener|pg||
nt|mikam1: Diamond played well to make game in the 4-4 heart fit on 79...another 10 to his squad|pg||
nt|athene: yes, he ended up having to run the spades much as larsen should have done in this room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|athene: but not because of the threat of a club ruff - just because opps attacked diamonds and left him short of trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|askgaard: In that 4@h declarer could have reasoned that Moss would not have led from 3+ small clubs over 3+ small diamonds, so clubs were looking to be 2-5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer certainly won't want to rely on the double diamond finesse here|pg||
nt|mikam1: Moss has to figure out which finesses to play for|pg||
nt|askgaard: (Because Gitelman opened 1@d)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: his problem is that even if he decided to go for @HK and @CJ onside, he lacks three entries to dummy to finesse hearts twice and clubs once|pg||
nt|mikam1: He "knows" that Deutsch is unlikely to have the club ace (didn't open), but outside of that...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|athene: ok, larsen coming down to only two hearts will make life easier for declarer - if he reads it|pg||
nt|athene: i thin larsen should be throwing clubs and not hearts|pg||
nt|athene: he doesn't need to run the whole club suit to beat 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: and that's his main concern|pg||
pc|c9|nt|askgaard: Larsen has a singaling problem: If partner has @cQ he wants a club shift, if partner has @hQ he wants a heart shift|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|mikam1: agreed, we probably wanted to make sure Deutsch played a heart from the queen if he had it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|askgaard: He partner has neither|pg||
nt|athene: yes, if partner turns up with @CQ10x, then keeping the clubs will work better, but you mainly just want to make sure the contract goes down|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mikam1: he|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|mikam1: He had a tought problem signalling as you say Michael|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: yes, that's why i like signals to say what you have rather than tell partner what to do|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|d5|nt|athene: simply because it's much easier to see what you have :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: you can tell partner that|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: but what you want him to do might depend on what he has|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps he should pitch diamonds on this hand...saying to partner, play whichever other suit you have an honor in|pg||
pg||
qx|c81|st||md|3ST92HT854DAKT5CK7,SK64HK73D92CAJ953,S73HAQJD8643CQT84,SAQJ85H962DQJ7C62|sv|o|nt|chessmaste: We think only +140|pg||
nt|gulyas: still down by 15|pg||
nt|frankaus: another interesting lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: break|pg||
nt|roswolf: good result for diamond in the other room|pg||
nt|bagman: A partscore hand which probably belongs to NS. EW can take 6 tricks in NT in defense|pg||
nt|bagman: The nice lie of the red suits gives declarer 3 hearts and 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bessi2: I am not a big fan of south's pass here|pg||
nt|bagman: The club J is also onside so declarer can make 2 club tricks and come to 7 with 3 hearts, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: really 1@D by east!?|pg||
nt|bagman: The latter line probably needs some entry help from the defense|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah more understandable|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the defense can take 6 tricks: 3 hearts 2 diamonds and a club to beat |pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
nt|puncher99: trump lead beats it 2 trks|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
nt|bagman: This requires the heart switch in trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: that may be difficult to find|pg||
nt|bagman: otherwise E might be able to discard a heart and ruff a heart in dummy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
nt|roswolf: acccurate wd|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chessmaste: Good play by declarer, avoiding 3 down|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: N is now in position to cash 5 first and see what happens then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: Best to continue clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chessmaste: Now he may well go 3 down|pg||
nt|benjent: Might need the @d finesse too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bagman: Once declarer sees the dummy he wishes he's in 6NT but no problem here as hearts behave|pg||
nt|sommer: 68% minus the very bad shapes is ok to me|pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: really!?|pg||
pg||
qx|o82|st||md|4SKHK2DQJT65CAJT86,SAT872HAQT3D42C97,SJ6H654DAK973CK52,SQ9543HJ987D8CQ43|sv|n|nt|athene: yeah the problem with pitching too many diamonds is that might tell declarer to take the double diamond finesse :)|pg||
nt|athene: basically defending 1nt is just a nightmare|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: True, but he knows he has a set if partner switches from his queen|pg||
nt|askgaard: Bridge is tough :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mikam1: If it's in clubs or hearts anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4S|nt|mikam1: Interesting competitive decision coming here for South|pg||
nt|mikam1: When in doubt....|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
nt|athene: 55 normally enough shape to bid 5 here, but the @SK does slow the hand down a bit|pg||
nt|mikam1: Fred's heard of that one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Good decision...both games could make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Now Seymon's turn....didn't guess right (depending on the play in the club suit of course)|pg||
nt|athene: yes he certainly can't lose many imps here and might gain a lot|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect declarer will get this right once East shows with 1 diamond|pg||
nt|mikam1: Although the heart distribution will be unknown|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|askgaard: The diamond distribution is only a small clue|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: yes, easy to swap the @HQ and @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding would have been the same, very likely|pg||
nt|mikam1: sure|pg||
nt|athene: one thing you might go on is|pg||
nt|athene: if west has nothing in clubs here he is more likely to try and cash @HAK, in case the clubs are running|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but with @CQ he would not do because he knows there's more of a chance the hearts aren't going away?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mikam1: True...so maybe this defense will lead declarer astray|pg||
nt|athene: not sure that is so much of a factor - and it would make gitelman go wrong here if he followed it|pg||

nt|mikam1: ok thanks|pg||
nt|askgaard: There might be a 4 imps scoring error in the other room on board 81, so Diamond probably has 4 imps less than shown|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D a lucky make|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to find the @CQ in 5@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: should be routine , i think, but you never know|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs 5 club tricks to pitch 2 hearts; he cannot make if W has Q9xx so should guess the clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah now that makes it certain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: easier now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping to put partner in for a heart thru|pg||

nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
pc|d4|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
mc|12|nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: 3N for n-s.. and at this time I don't see any reason for declarer to misguess @d|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss did|pg||
nt|roswolf: well maybe e/w are going overboard?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, he did|pg||
nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..the minorsqueeze against N|pg||
nt|roswolf: west fell in love with his 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT is the obvious call |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: connection problem :(|pg||
nt|bagman: Did West really pass?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|sommer: ..3?|pg||
nt|roswolf: it appears so pekka|pg||
nt|bagman: I admit that W holds a bad hand and they are vulnerable but still he's holding a reasonable spade suit and doubleton heart|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: Unfortunately, we got dropped out at an interesting point in the play on the last, but I assume Greco managed it smoothly|pg||

nt|bagman: Lead problem|pg||
nt|sommer: 4 keycards, actually|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|bessi2: i wonder if Larsen will try to sneak a @h to the king right away|pg||

nt|mikam1: right - probably because of 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|askgaard: Agreed|pg||
nt|athene: (that's one factor that might make the 1nt overcall a bit safer - if west has a borderline double he might not make it, fearing his partner is light in third)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||

nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing diamonds i suppose and if so 4@D MUST BE A SLAM TRY|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok so is 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW SLAM IS EASY PEASEY|pg||
nt|bagman: Not even trying to guess what's going on here biddingwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 6@D|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: It must have been delightful for Deutsc to see that 3@d bid :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think a grand is possible|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H could be kickback but could also be something else|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
nt|roswolf: NICELY BID|pg||
nt|bagman: The play is no problem|pg||
nt|puncher99: cashout time|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||
nt|sommer: 5n?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt may get north bidding 7@D|pg||
nt|bagman: I'd like to be in 6@S where I can draw trumps and then pass the @ST :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
pc|s2|nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|puncher99: cranes law|pg||
nt|bagman: Good lead; it scared Diamond|pg||
nt|puncher99: lead aces vrs all slams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: no info - sorry|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|swanson: Now, by the time spades are led the situation will be clear to the defenders.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|athene: you have to play ace and a club i think|pg||
nt|athene: can't really fiddle around trying to finesse clubs - you might get cut off from dummy altogether|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When they started today Diamond was 2 up; nothing much has changed since then although they have exchanged lots of IMPs|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mikam1: It's possible to go down from here if declarer does play on clubs....diamond return, finesse heart queen, then spade return forcing a guess by declarer|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mikam1: A guess as to which finesse to take that is|pg||
nt|askgaard: Right, and that seems very likely to happen|pg||
nt|athene: Diamond just bashed into slam over 2@C opener on the previous board|pg||
nt|athene: (2@C limited with long clubs from east)|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure he really know exactly what his partner had but he just took the less pessimistic view|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
nt|mikam1: Perhaps Deutsch will play a heart to the ten...then he's got no issues|pg||
nt|mikam1: However, all of this dependent on a diamond return by Moss now|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer would have loved to try a spade finesse first|pg||
nt|athene: because that would protect the @DK9|pg||
nt|athene: but he could never get to dummy to do that|pg||
nt|askgaard: If G had @sKQ then a spade shift would be the thing to do|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: yes but if declarer had had such weak spades he would probably not have held up in diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: did deutsch play a heart to the @H10?|pg||

nt|athene: the defence should get seven tricks here - four clubs, @DK, @HAK - but it might be slightly hard to cash the hearts|pg||

mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|athene: change that @HA to something like @HKQJ and you have no chance in 3nt on a club lead|pg||

nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|athene: :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Alas, they've landed in their worst fit...as would I|pg||
nt|athene: most will raise a major response with 3-card supoprt and a side singleton if 5431|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: but when you have a good 6-card suit it's a bit more of a dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: your hand will often be so much better in the long suit|pg||
nt|askgaard: My style is also 2@h with Moss' hand|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he feels with aces and not the middle diamonds, it will be ok played in hearts|pg||
nt|mikam1: I like North's bid though...if you bid 2D though you could miss game when partner holds say, KTxx KQxxx xx xx or somesuch|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|mikam1: that's true, perhaps a poor example...maybe 10 counts with 5 hearts and singleton diamond are the risk|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|athene: low in dummy would have picked up the suit if the lead was from J8 or 108, so better than trying the 9 which only gains against the actual J10|pg||

nt|mikam1: I believe Diamond has picked up 3 more imps if my calculations are correct...thru board 88|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The thing is that the tables are not linked after the crash|pg||
nt|athene: gitelman quite happy to lose a trick to east because he is very likely to attack hearts|pg||

pc|h7|nt|athene: but maybe east can work out that declarer must have five hearts? since west would surely lead a heart if he had five himself|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mikam1: Nickell has pulled to within 24 in their match|pg||
nt|mikam1: Aker is 13 behind Wolfson and Welland is up big vs. Jacobs|pg||
nt|athene: if west attacks clubs declarer can make his @CJ and never lose the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: if west cashes the @HK declarer never loses a club|pg||
nt|athene: so it's 120 either way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to all spectators for watching. Do join us again after the break. This rates to be a thrilling last 30 boards for a spot in tomorrow's semi-finals|pg||
nt|athene: club shift would of course have been better for the defence but that singleton in dummy was very enticing|pg||
