nt|Vugraphzfj: 4c was key card i think|pg||
nt|passell: maybe steaming a little after going for numbers on 1st 2 hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: Well this is fun - the dealing machine is spitting out some nifty shapes!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|chessmaste: Another dull looking deal|pg||
nt|benjent: Several ways to approach the East hand. I like Hampson's choice (and I'm sure he'll be relieved to hear that :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D i expect from Hamson - traffic lights are green|pg||
nt|benjent: I don't - he's made his choice with 3@h. I expect he'll hope he's done the damage already|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: 5+h's gf|pg||
nt|benjent: It looks to me like Wolpert wants to make a bit of a slam try. I think that's optimistic.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: wow|pg||
nt|bessi2: I really hate this 4@s bid I must say|pg||
nt|gulyas: I was trying to be nice:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: but it will do its job.. Diamond will probably just drive to slam|pg||
nt|passell: it may work well  after he shows up with the spade ace he may play north for the dia king and go down in slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: are we live now?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gulyas: slam is makeable, agree, but its hard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|passell: they play this says he wants to bid|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak is going to overcall 3NT with worse hands than this. 3NT could easily be the last making spot|pg||
mb|d|nt|bessi2: I prefer rdbl with north hand.. never learned to raise pd with only 2card support|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E doubles and folds his cards:)|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on Hampson - once Wolpert moves over 3NT, the payoff structure changes a lot for Hampson. Now it's attractive to get his 2nd suit on the table ... and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: this is there way of showing the biggest 5 heart bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: W obv inviting slam with this sequence|pg||
nt|psyck: W shows his slam interest by passing & pulling the x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: x was alerted, can't read it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: The open room is playing board 65 so we'll be live soon|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: I just had a nice tenderloin with new potatoes..no ketchup:)|pg||
mc|7|nt|bessi2: did that actually happen ?|pg||

nt|bessi2: not sure east would have accepted with @dk instead of @c Q so this was a very good decision by diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: The system of Cohen-Smith was not available on the USBF web site; anybody know what they play?|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 2/1|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bessi2: it has its advantages surely.. but definately not my style|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would open - 2@S weak, or 2@D Multi,or 2@S spades and a minor|pg||
nt|frankaus: did wolpert bid @H opp?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: will it end in 4@H?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bessi2: I  like upgrading this south hand to a 2N opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am a big fan of rebidding 1NT with unbal hands that are short in pd's major, but it backfires when you cannot bid 2M with a mangy 5c suit, frearing a singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|psyck: good point, that is my style too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So 3@H is stronger than 4 as 2@H was GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems a fair slam|pg||
mb|5D|an|1 or 4|mb|p|nt|bagman: The heart slam requires the trumps to behave|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith actually held up 1 finger for 5@d, guess it's clear from the auction he doesn't have 4 keycards :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they have thankfully missed the 4-4 @Cfit|pg||
nt|bagman: NT slam has extra chances in clubs|pg||
nt|sommer:  There's a short version here...maybe ...   http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=711&pid=278|pg||
mb|6H|nt|bessi2: looks like -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: has a chance but need to get it all right|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Looks like a simple two down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 10 tricks, coffee break:)|pg||
nt|passell: good 3nt by larsen   even if partner had 3 spades he might get beat in trumps  he has so much on the outside|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I never see the point in leading a singleton in an unbid suit against notrump|pg||
nt|roswolf: not too much to the play|pg||
nt|sommer: this is a great contract|pg||
nt|bagman: The club slam is the worst requiring the clubs to be 3-2 with Q onside (or Q singleton)|pg||
nt|sommer: no..it's easy..and will be copied most places|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it needs trumps 3-2 which is not really great|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: But declarer must attack the side suit first|pg||
nt|bessi2: if Deutch had opened 2@s, Diamond might overcall 2N which would not have been a pleasant contract to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: not that it matters here|pg||
nt|benjent: Kranyak's got a plausible X, but I think it has a bit to do with how his set is going as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: X ruff from here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|sommer: this is around 55%|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: n-s not on the same wavelength here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: tough but makeable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes the layout is fairly kind to declarer|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: he will get the @h right, cannot lose to E twice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: knew that moved but wasnt sure about the river part|pg||
nt|sommer: @DQ 3rd or 4th makes it for Fred|pg||
nt|sommer: ..in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like declarer needs all the diamonds. He can get them but entries are short and this might require quite accurate play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: he should start hearts |pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, that takes care of it|pg||
nt|benjent: Taken with the @c overcall, Greco will think that's a short @h lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Left to his own devices, he would like to work on the minors before drawing trumps, but that's not where he is|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bagman: Now one more entry to dummy helps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman: "leads are?" Smith "4th best"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: now he only needs 1 extra trick|pg||
nt|benjent: A mid-range alternative is to draw two rounds of trumps then try @d's|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Now declarer runs the @DT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|passell: oops |pg||
nt|gulyas: with 3221 for sure|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect Greco will not assay the @D position after this lead|pg||
nt|passell: interesting not to lead a high club  worked well as declarer placed his partner with 1 of the top honors|pg||
nt|benjent: Drawing all the trumps then playing @d's is risky - if you get them wrong, they can play on @c's, force out West's last trump and be ready to pounce with a @d and @c trick later|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: wil lose just 2@D and @C|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco's still going to be in the position where he can't draw all the trumps ... so I reckon he will draw 2, and then play the @dK, hating it all the way|pg||
nt|sommer: no:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bagman: Smith covered in the hope that Cohen had the 9|pg||
nt|roswolf: nae bother as a scottish friend of mine would say|pg||
nt|sommer: he will just take the @D's and play a small @H now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bagman: Gitelman cannot be sure that the spades really are 4-2; the lead might have been false|pg||
nt|bagman: 4-3|pg||
nt|roswolf: not very likely though|pg||
nt|sommer: so?..does a @H finesse help then?|pg||
nt|bagman: Heart finesse does not help then, that's true|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is the 9th trick:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: @Ss will be cleared|pg||
nt|passell: he will now have to guess well|pg||
nt|gulyas: cash @DAK and then finesse in @Hs? has to give up a @H trick first|pg||
nt|passell: likely as long as he doesnt run clubs first|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chessmaste: A strange misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sommer: so is the small:)..and no @C suit opened|pg||
nt|bagman: If spades are 5-2 and heart finesse works, declarer can afford to play @HQ|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: if he does, he will see W started with 4-4 in the blacks|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|bagman: and if the @HK is with south with original 5 spades, the contract is going down anyway|pg||
mc|9|nt|gulyas: making him less likely to hold @H length, hence getting the finesse right|pg||
nt|psyck: as Mike pointed out, starting on @h would have given him more chances, if he could knock out the entry to the long @s hand|pg||
nt|passell: 10 of clubs a misprint|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably played a low @C|pg||

mb|p|nt|bessi2: 3N for n-s.. and at this time I don't see any reason for declarer to misguess @d|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss did|pg||

nt|sommer: yes, he did|pg||
nt|bagman: If 4NT is the right bid, 4@S was wrong (or vice versa)|pg||
nt|sommer: only chance in 5@S is a squeeze|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Although with all the running around I did to try to get this computer on the internet and not lose any other table, I certainly could miss a pass or two here and there :)|pg||

nt|sommer: 2 @H NS looks best|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfj: 0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I play 2@s there pretty sound aswell but this east hand is too powerful for a 2@s bid there imo|pg||
nt|psyck: I may have tried a higher number of @h|pg||
nt|passell: the preemptive 1heart|pg||
nt|benjent: Indeed, don't make things worse. The wind will shift in their direction sometime. Need to make sure you haven't blown the match already when that happens.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: The real score is probably 4-3 to Deutsch|pg||

nt|benjent: 1@h for me too. Tell partner where you live|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: makes it very difficult for the opponents to get to 3nt  on many hands when it is cold|pg||
nt|sommer: calm down now...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bessi2: Larsen has to cash his 5 winners, otherwise he will wind up with only 4 it seems|pg||
nt|sommer: 9 tricks possible|pg||
nt|bagman: N cannot pass as 2@H is limited only by the inability to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chimera of the vul game bonus tempts north|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asks Cohen if he had another way to raise 2@h to 3@h and Cohen says no|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|benjent: 9 tricks here ... but 6 losers first|pg||
nt|passell: 5 needed imps for deutsch|pg||

nt|sommer: sure sure..N has to raise to 3|pg||

pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: With clubs 4-1 he would need to find East with @D K10 doubleton|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: this is am exciting lot |pg||
mb|1H|nt|benjent: Hampson will be wondering if slam is on. The @d overcall is good news, really|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Both holding good looking two suiters|pg||
nt|roswolf: but which slam?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chessmaste: I would not pass the South hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting pass from Deutsch here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Board 4 corrected|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is possiblr here|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No way is Hampson going to sit for that|pg||
nt|frankaus: no entry to  8 tricks :(|pg||
nt|sommer: 6@D, 6NT..or maybe even 7@D?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon they will know about the misfit|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bessi2: a bidding challenge for n-s here.. to avoid the tempting 3N for the 11 trick gamecontract|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 2@D looks like a limited 3 suiter|pg||
nt|bessi2: indeed,  one of my two favorite opening bid conventions|pg||
nt|chessmaste: With N/S cold for 5@D this is not par so far|pg||
nt|bessi2: it is easy watching all 4 hands. but imo Larsen should protect here,  |pg||
nt|bessi2: could be disastrous, but you lose to many partscore swings by passing I think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps, and certainly if South is allowed to pass with this type of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: 3NT was bad news for Hampson (wasted @d card in his partner's limited hand) and he's sensibly focussing on game|pg||
nt|bagman: But they have lots of cards and a reasonable diamond fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fortune will favor the brave here|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: 5@D the only making game|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: I am not saying I would bid, I am somewhat of a chicken in these spots, I am saying one should|pg||
nt|passell: they are there|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D save? |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: South could have staretd with either minor, or used a gadget - say 2@H a three suiter always with hearts   |pg||
nt|frankaus: green V gren saves not real value|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D looks like a good contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: @D is the trump suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sommer: guess 3@S would be 4th suit, so N saved it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: It must have been delightful for Deutsc to see that 3@d bid :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think a grand is possible|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chessmaste: He is relieved|pg||
nt|chessmaste: or even reprieved|pg||
nt|gulyas: well done|pg||
nt|benjent: How to get back to hand? A @d ruff is not 100% safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: to be bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Gitelman writing questions to Cohen, but I can't quite make it out - sorry|pg||
nt|bagman: Grand is possible but on a trump lead it might be a bit tricky to play|pg||
nt|sommer: S doesn't know about the @Cvoid, so he may go for the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: good lead|pg||
nt|swanson: Hampson did well to avoid a spade lead - that would put a lot of pressure on West to find the overtake and club shift.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||
nt|sommer: 5n?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt may get north bidding 7@D|pg||
nt|bagman: I'd like to be in 6@S where I can draw trumps and then pass the @ST :)|pg||
nt|bagman: 6@D|pg||
nt|bagman: Or pass the @ST and then draw trumps |pg||
mb|7D|nt|passell: hard to mis guess diamonds as only 1 4 -1 break is useful|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|passell: club now|pg||
nt|benjent: As it happens, he can't go wrong on the 2nd round of @d's, since the @h10 is short onside|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert may ruff the 2nd @c ... maybe a bit of uppercutting, chance to try a @d to promote partner's @h's|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Now, by the time spades are led the situation will be clear to the defenders.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|passell: a tricky 3 rounds of hearts is the only chance|pg||
nt|sommer: S has a lot of trick potential..6@D looks a little puss..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and 7 it was|pg||
nt|roswolf: OK SOUTH JUST BID IT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen " I've got some holes" Smith: "you've got some too?"|pg||
nt|bagman: THis might take some time|pg||
nt|sommer: N has to take a few deep breaths...but the lucky lie of the cards may help him through|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinks so too - he's gone for coffee :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well we can see both ordinary finesses work|pg||
nt|bagman: There are 11 tricks with one ruff|pg||
nt|sommer: remember..S has no entry after @Hfinesse!|pg||
nt|roswolf: and i dont see how he can avoid taking at least 1|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might win this in dummy and then take the ordinary spade finesse and hope to ruff down the king|pg||
nt|sommer: .. he MUST run @S10 for sure|pg||
nt|sommer: exactly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that looks the more practical line |pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: If the @SK does not come down, he has some chances left in hearts|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sommer: only makeable, even..I think|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|benjent: Bit of mostly harmless stewing|pg||

nt|roswolf: but he must aim to set up dummy|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|swanson: East can be endplay now.  This was an unusual 3-suit squeeze.  Declarer still has the guess the situation, of course if West rises and leads a club.  It wouldn't be fun to lose the ...|pg||

pc|hK|nt|benjent: Not everyone responds with Kranyak's hand, but on average it's the right action|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|benjent: Greco could almost bid 1NT without looking at his hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Not much in play here; declarer loses two hearts and the spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen played very quickly from dummy and Moss said "too fast" - so Cohen waited a moment and then played and Moss said "still too fast" Cohen: "sorry"|pg||
nt|sommer: a practical 4@S from N..and he's awarded with 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sommer: quite lucky, but ok|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much N can do; he either makes this or not (losing to 4-1 spades or uppercut/overruf)|pg||
nt|sommer: it's only around 33% but 4@S is "the bid"|pg||
nt|bagman: If E cashes a heart and plays a club; N might wonder weather to play @SK from hand or go to dummy and play a spade to pick up A singleton onside and risk diamond ruff|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: Smith: "no blue" (the RDBL bidding card is blue :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and the vampires gather for the feast|pg||
nt|sommer: -2 or.MAYBE only -1..so not too expensive|pg||
nt|sommer: crossruff!..and @Dfinesse gives a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S scores 3 trump tricks and N the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: Cohen probably disapointed after the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in the other room i doubt e/w will be in game|pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @S to !K|pg||
nt|sommer: @SA + 3 @Htricks is the strange outcome of best play|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bessi2: @d J,  @c to the jack and queen,  east better play another @d there otherwise easy 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Then if N ducks, diamond finesse and another spade|pg||

nt|bagman: W eloping with the small trumps; he knows the hearts are likely to be 5-0|pg||
nt|roswolf: re|pg||
nt|sommer: The Italian waiter struck again!!|pg||
nt|bagman: The club ruff was too early as S can discard a diamond on the next club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Sorry, slightly flakey internet connection too - you'd think with 4 choices I could find one that was solid :)|pg||
nt|sommer: right..thats why it's -2 now|pg||
nt|sommer: you havent been a waiter in Italy, do you, Susan?:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N needs to take this and play a club for a diamond discard; if W wins this, he should take his two diamond tricks as long as he can|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Actually, this is Jan - I switched with Susan when we couldn't get Susan's computer on the internet; haven't been a waiter any place|pg||
nt|roswolf: natural to win i think|pg||
nt|sommer: ok:)|pg||
nt|bagman: S can hold @SK and QJT98 of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: We're at trick 5 now - did something not get through (still worrying about connection :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room the grand is being played in 4@H!!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: FROZEN AT TRICK 3|pg||
nt|sommer: "The Italian waiter" is a BBO "thing"...from a vue-graff in Italy some years ago, where a waiter fell over the pc cables and turned all off |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss deciding whether to take the diamond finesse - if he hadn't been doubled, of course he'd need it for 4 (losing 2 hearts and a spade) but doubled, he knows hearts aren't ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: breaking|pg||
nt|bagman: Diamond lucky in the grand hand because 4@H does not lose much more than 6@D would lose|pg||
nt|roswolf: jan what happened at t3 did north win @SA?|pg||
nt|bagman: That also shows why on IMPs dubious grands should not be bid; the opps might end up in game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: I'll keep playing out the hand and then if it doesn't get through to you, I'll have to close and start again and hope I can do better. But spade to A, Club Q on which S pitched a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: diamond & W ruffed, diamond J winning, |pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: North has a weak two in diamonds - great thinks South - but it could have been worse - he might have opened 3@D |pg||
nt|bessi2: I think Deutsch had better left this one alone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: It was -2|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: South's bidding is wildly optimistic|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfj: At least that's what was claimed and I double checked - declarer pitched a spade on the diamond A as S ruffed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfj: ruffed a spade to get to dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: hope we're okay now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: N failed to cover the @DJ so there was a diamond winner to take care of the spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: I will say it one more time - a void in partner's suit is not an asset |pg||
nt|bessi2: e-w let him off the hook which is surprising... west has an easy penalty dbl there imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 1 heart =8-11 artificial -5 sp|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: Agreed - the bridge has been moderate so far|pg||
pc|h7|nt|benjent: Can nearly make this now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: once more a fatuous overcall attracts a poor lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|benjent: Without the @c lead, declarer has to fall back on the @d finesse when @c's don't break. With this lead, he can actually pick up the @c's|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d7|nt|benjent: If he's got the moxy for it. Bit risky, so here comes the @d finesse|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: Wolpert's going to have to find the @s shift|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h6 pitch should help|pg||
nt|bagman: N had a natural diamond lead without the overcall|pg||
pc|cA|nt|benjent: NS play upside down signals, with suit preference tendencies "if we think partner will be able to work it out"|pg||
nt|benjent: So Kranyak has been busy suit preferencing for @s's, hoping that partner will be able to work it out|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert will be thinking - if declarer has @hA, he'l have 9 tricks, so I'll have to hope the @s's cash|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfj: very good run here for the Deutsch team|pg||

nt|roswolf: with one of my pards an overcall opposite a passed pard ALWAYS promised a good wuality suit - great for mps!|pg||
nt|roswolf: quality|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Moss asked who had the @d K|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|benjent: Flat board, but there was more on the line here than at the other table. I like Diamond's minus better than Deutsch's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: EW play precision, but their 1NT is a little stronger than usual - 14-16|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: softly softly e/w|pg||
nt|bagman: Even the overcall loses a trick from time to time it's still probably winning bridge to overcall aggressively with dubious suits|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bagman: Sometimes KQ bare is not as good support as xxxx|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt ps tempting|pg||
nt|bagman: Here W hopes for 3NT where high diamonds help|pg||
nt|roswolf: is|pg||
nt|bagman: E, on the other hand, might think that 5 @D might be good|pg||
mb|3S|nt|benjent: Excuse me, 1NT is 15-17 in 3rd/4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: not sure I would have protected there but I like it nonetheless|pg||
nt|roswolf: temporising|pg||
nt|bagman: Making a probe|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bessi2: pretty good 6@c contract here but seems doomed to fail as the cards lie|pg||
nt|benjent: Even so, that's a keen 3NT not vul|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass the buck bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this is rightsided|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: and gains the 8th trick|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..and will probably make!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9th|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen asks for a review of the auction|pg||
nt|sommer: with @DJ falling thats 9|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not X 3@S because he expected a spade lead on the auction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|benjent: Is it playable? Sure, but he'll need to pull off some magic in the @c suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Curiously, Hampson probably had to unblock the @s's at trick to be able to make on the layout (so that he could force a 2nd entry to table)|pg||
nt|benjent: at trick 1, that is|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bessi2: tricky hand to defend.. I predict 110|pg||
nt|bessi2: it actually seems that this contract is unbeatable|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bagman: and often it's a bad idea to X probes giving away bidding space|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: I reckon Hampson now expects the @cK to be with North ... South has shown a lot of cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|benjent: But with only only clear entry to the board, he's playing for @cJ to be with South|pg||
nt|roswolf: serves him right - always make things easy for your ox opposite!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bagman: There's not much left for Moss to try: he needs now diamonds running |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen thinking, we didn't lose connection again :)|pg||
nt|sommer: the @Cplay was an extra chance to the @D's ..hoping @C are 3-3, if @D dont work|pg||
nt|roswolf: no time pressure is there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen: "sorry" - he's been moving the spade 2, spade 7 and club 10 into playing position |pg||
nt|bagman: This is KO and they are two boards ahead of the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Of course they don't know about the other table, but I'm pretty sure there isn't any time problem (each table is screened off so we can't see the clocks in the middle of the room ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: but could move the curtains aside and look if wanted to|pg||
nt|roswolf: best chance for south is to switch to@S isnt it?|pg||
nt|bagman: DD, yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Director just announced 20 minutes, so definitely no time problems|pg||
nt|bagman: But S might think that W holds the Q and N better hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably shoots back a low club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Wonder if S can tell that the @h Q at trick 1 was a falsecard (in the sense that he must have had either ten or nine) so know that W didn't want a shift?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Cohen has now moved a diamond to the end of his hand - considering going passive?|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point but i cnat see how a club or a diamond could lead to 4 more reicks for defence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: almost played the @s 7|pg||
nt|roswolf: tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: He might hope for 8 or less for declarer instead of getting 5 or more for the defense :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it is likely that diamonds are favorable for declarer so he must generate tricks elsewhere|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|benjent: Good @h return - I reckon that was tough after the @s lead|pg||
nt|benjent: Wolpert's been playing along quite nicely in this set|pg||
nt|benjent: This is probably going to sail 2 or 3 off now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|benjent: Kranyak should clear the @h's, Hampson will take the @c finesse as his best shot at 9 tricks, and the roof will cave in shortly afterwards|pg||
