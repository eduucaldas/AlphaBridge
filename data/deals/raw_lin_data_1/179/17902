mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Looks like a fairly easy 3N hand|pg||
mb|2H!|an|2 controls|mb|p|nt|iceking: yes 11-12tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chorush: 2 controls is 1 ace or 2 kings|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|iceking: with 3 @D entries to dummy should get 12 on @H lead|pg||
nt|mikam1: 2N is no doubt a game force after the two-control response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|chorush: Which tells Welland that if South is balanced, slam cannot be better than a finesse|pg||
nt|iceking: start with high @D then low to H then H overtake with H last entry low to 6|pg||
nt|chorush: 13 I think. He is being given the heart finesse and can take 2 spade finesses and a club finesse himself.|pg||
nt|iceking: so will make 7 ofcourse |pg||
nt|iceking: 3-2-4-4 |pg||

pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: He had no reason to do that and would have cost a trick had diamonds been 4-1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|mikam1: First boarditis|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|iceking: not going to matter obvious this time as @D break 3-2|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mikam1: Very common difficulty...concentrating hard on the first and last board of a segment|pg||
nt|mikam1: I know I've got it myself :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|iceking: indeed and often you lose imps on first 1-2 hands and last 2-3 hands becouse of that|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|mikam1: two tens and two nines...a powerhouse!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|iceking: ew might rn into problems here though|pg||
mb|d|nt|mikam1: 1C could be 2, transfer responses |pg||
nt|iceking: how much is 1@H dbled|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: wildavsky starting his scorecard on board 13 because the scorecard doesn't list 61-75|pg||
nt|mikam1: Not sure if Rdbl = transfer here the way they play|pg||
nt|iceking: 500 i think maximum, and as often def slipps so could be less |pg||
mb|p!|mb|1H|nt|iceking: if rdbl is transfer, then pass dbl probably def|pg||
nt|mikam1: Yes, must be so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|iceking: so this will probably end here in 1@H dbled|pg||
nt|iceking: down 500 most likelly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: can't read roy's note upside down|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chorush: I don't think it will. Dbl is their way of showing that he had a redbl|pg||
nt|mikam1: I'm not sure if it means PASS partner or not|pg||
nt|mikam1: Right - can't have everything |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bramley writes "rdbl would have been @D"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Anyway, 3N will go faster than 1H doubled :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iceking: 10 tricks |pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 11 tricks. The diamond position and the club positions are both friendly|pg||
nt|iceking: been asked private what i think about W dbl on 1@C, i think its rather standard|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|chorush: 10. sorry. I am having first board problems myself:)|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|mikam1: A bit more risk doubling with partner a passed hand, but can't argue too much|pg||
nt|iceking: carefull play from Bramley |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mikam1: And being off-shape in the minors not as relevant vs. short club opening|pg||
nt|iceking: passing also riskes missing the part score battle, so its not always save to pass |pg||
nt|chorush: Bramley is a great technician as declarer|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||

mb|4S|nt|iceking: thats little bid off opening values imo|pg||
nt|iceking: and i thought i opened light|pg||

nt|chorush: All those bridge books written in the 1950's and 1960's that proclaimed one needed 26 points for game would be surprised at how the game is played today|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|iceking: game is very agressive today compare to 30 years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so is this a 4@H bid for Bramley|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: welland/willenken now passing notes|pg||

nt|mikam1: I believe I'm the only one left on the planet|pg||
nt|chorush: no, I'm still here:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: fans them on the table, sweeps dummy with his eyes, picks up his hand again|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes Ira...forgot :)|pg||
nt|mikam1: Welland did pick up a game swing on 63|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: looks at me and then the chandelier|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mikam1: Possible to misguess clubs after spades break 4-1, but still will probably get it right|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe duck @S was little better|pg||
nt|iceking: not sure its going to matter though much|pg||
nt|chorush: If he misguesses after he see the spade break he will be looking at down 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asks for adam's card, asks about carding again|pg||
nt|iceking: indeed so would be little better have some control of the @S suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: asks about agreements for 2@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "usually a decent 6card suit"|pg||
nt|mikam1: true Ira...that's why no doubt Magnus was right - should have ducked a spade first|pg||
nt|iceking: duck the lead was probably ok also|pg||
nt|mikam1: yes|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe W has stiff @C and would try for ruff |pg||

nt|copeyj: aggressive opening from Bramley next door got the job done|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me S has an opening hand. If I dont act early, I can be outbidden´like now|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@D a multi - weak 2M or 20+ HCP any 4441|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bd 63|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: outlawed in many events isn't it?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ralfwil: I dont´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: it could have been staymanic too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||

nt|copeyj: who was going to penalise that?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: there is always an option|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: most americans play sound weak 2s and therefore  i think declarer will play for the outside strength to be with east who did rdbl|pg||

nt|copeyj: South will (I guess) bid 2@S showing a fit now?|pg||
nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
mb|r|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: an extension of support doubles -interesting idea|pg||

nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: "3-3 1@C 4-4 1@D"|pg||

nt|jcmax: You really like holding that N hand at the prevailing vulnerability, when the opponents get involved in the bidding. Now you are just hoping partner won't bid before you double!|pg||
nt|mikam1: Which he might|pg||
nt|chorush: Bramley likely to let him off with 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@S is about 10-13 for N/S|pg||

mb|d|nt|iceking: i like 2@C|pg||
nt|iceking: take it from there|pg||
nt|mikam1: Everything is going their way...in fact the only hand they lost imps on was actually a reasonable result here|pg||
nt|mikam1: 2@C also|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mikam1: Good bid by Wildavsky|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: welland looks pointedly at wildavsky prompting him to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: i would like rdbl more with east hand then 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Maybe not what they play though|pg||
nt|jcmax: Quite a light negative double facing a possible light opening. But maybe better to do something now than whe partner maybe reopens with a double?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|mikam1: Yes, I wouldn't have made a negative double...but then I'm conservative|pg||

pc|s3|nt|iceking: maybe north should lead trump here |pg||
nt|chorush: ducking has the same effect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: welland asked wildavsky how many hearts he held.  "1.  2.  they were very small ones"|pg||
nt|mikam1: The negative double might give Bramley enough info to duck this|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: bramley crosses his arms and studies dummy, begins to fan his cards but folds them again|pg||
nt|mikam1: Without that it would be very much harder|pg||
nt|jcmax: No doubt South is trying to figure out now, what points partner possibly could have|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he knows what he holds.  on the earlier 4@S hand he had @S8K3 on one side of his hand and @SJQ4 on the other|pg||
nt|mikam1: Must have either the diamond ace or heart ace, no?|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|an|!D stopper and 11-13|nt|jcmax: I believe there are two ways now for S to give partner a choice between 3N and 4H. One where he can pass with 3 cards in @H and one where he has to correct with 3 cards in@H|pg||

nt|iceking: yes agree would be silly bid 4@D imo|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: welland has this habit of widening his eyes and looking around suddenly|pg||
nt|mikam1: Agreed...and after all, it's not much of a save|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: bramley has his arms crossed, sitting back in his seat, trying to work it out|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
