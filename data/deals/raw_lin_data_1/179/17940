nt|ralfwil: goo9d evening everyone|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: wolfson stayed out of the auction...a very good move|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is a pretty decent spot, but not necessarily as these cards lie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d on a finess on NS|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome to round 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3N is better|pg||
nt|bobh1: on this layout|pg||
nt|othered1: with the opponents quiet, they're unlikely to be able to find it.  |pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder what E is thinking about?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: don't know but she is thinking|pg||
nt|bobh1: not slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but bid it?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi Cheri -- welcome specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the 2nd of 8 15-bd segments for this quarter final match|pg||
nt|cherilou: Wolfson has started strong but there are still 90 boards to play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 105 to play|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: apparently yes she is thinking of slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two philosophies about transfers over 1@c - show a 4-card major first in a weakish hand, or show the long minor first|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry -- lost my connection but we didn't miss anything.  Garner thinking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: Is that kickback (RKC in @H?)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobh1: doesnt seem like her partner can have 3 kcs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: why not -- isn't she unlimited?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west, I mean|pg||
nt|bobh1: oh i guess you're right forgot that E reversed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfc: obviously she expected more from 3@H (not 4@H)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfc: did well to find 3N in other room|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|paulg:  A quiet start to this segment|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: 4@H by west over 2@H, "fast arrival," I guess would require east to always have either 4@H or 3@S.  Is that absolute in their style?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfc: garner:  "don't think too hard"|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|cherilou: welcome Paul|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: and yet, in a way, it's good for your team to have an opponent spend mental energy needlessly - so why tell him the hand is a pianola? |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: finding 3N wasn't all that tough after south overcalled 1@H in CR.|pg||
mc|8|nt|bobh1: senseless overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: good point|pg||
nt|bobh1: reminds of the hand that won the Cavendish for Stewart-Woolsey|pg||
nt|bobh1: Stewart's  opponent opened 4@H and he was inspired to pass a hand than many would overcall 4@S with|pg||
nt|othered1: This was going to be a big swing to Wolfson, now merely bigger maybe 16 instead of 12.|pg||
nt|bobh1: His reward was that the opponents played in 4@S|pg||

nt|swanson: West might bid 3NT out of frustration later in the auction and then find he has no way to go set.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|swanson: Pertaining to getiing into the auction on the previous hand?|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: A 1NT opening is ubiquitous these days.  Seems to work well out of proportion to what I think it should.|pg||
nt|henryb:  bad choice: if W removes to 5@c, that is also cold|pg||
pc|d9|nt|swanson: North heard himself open 1NT and thought that meat he had something.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the cards ain;t worth a dime, if you don;t lay 'em down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT (and sometimes with real clubs, of course)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi Cheri|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  Interesting to see that both these pairs are playing a short 1@c with transfer responses ... more common in Europe than the USA in my experience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: both pairs here open 1@C with any balanced hand out of range for NT and play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|<3 spades|mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: some would overcall 1S with N hand too|pg||
nt|paulg:  What a position for East .. having to bid his better minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: nightmare for E to respond to that double|pg||
nt|cherilou: N's pass alerted to show less than 3@S. Common treatment in the US.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that I can just type faster than Joe *when* he is also entering the bidding|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least it's @C|pg||
mb|2S|an|negtive response (and how!)|nt|glen: risk/reward of 1@S overcall is not good opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  When he is given the chance Richter should put about 5 Pass cards on the tray|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: can W find the killing @d lead?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the NS responses to 1@c (at the 1-level, anyway) seem remarkably like what I play with one of my partners  |pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@C will make but E is never going to cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and the torture continues|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: looks like 3N isn't natural|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spades are frozen so 4C is a making sve on a squeeze i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: same bid in both rooms -- better than 4@H -- shows what they open|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wasn´t 1@s from N alerted as S didn´t support with a 4-card suit?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cherilou: 3NT also because can't get to dummy to finesse @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cherilou: gasping pass here|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 3NT could be "non-serious" slam interest, in case responder now wants to cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: transfer responses to 1@c very popular in England now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but should be alerted|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: one spade denied a 4-cd major (I was catching up and didn't get the alert in and it's too late once the auction ends)|pg||
nt|paulg:  and now he gets to play it :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: auction inother room also interesting|pg||
nt|cherilou: this will go quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: a heartfelt "thank you partner"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: ok|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: john swanson remarks that 3N as a minimum slam try is VERY minimum|pg||
nt|swanson: It's about as non-serious as one can get.|pg||
nt|bobh1: personally i like to be able to play 3N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably alerted - 4+@D, if the last deal is anything to go by|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: transfer response to 1@C for both pairs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and NS open pretty much any 11 count (not sure about EW)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must finess in @d now and I can only see 8 tricks|pg||

mb|1D|nt|swanson: I expect East to open 1@D - not suitable for a preempt.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6D|an|W says 1 + void|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: A lot of partnerships are using 'one over' for key card ask after minor suit agreement, so 4@H would be key card for them.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  well judged not to bid 7|pg||
nt|swanson: We have aslo seen a number of key card accidents in top level competition recently.  Old fashioned 4NT is still a sound idea.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Some also play that 4@d over 2@d would be keycard|pg||

mb|1D|nt|glen: nope|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|othered1: In a match this close, 1 imp lost (had @D split 2-2) could be critical.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d is natural but promises an unbalanced hand ... seems appropriate|pg||
nt|cherilou: transfer responses to 1@D also it looks like|pg||
nt|paulg:  I expect 1NT is a game-forcing relay .. and then we'll be guessing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|diamonds|nt|cherilou: Howard's wondering........|pg||
nt|paulg:  I play similar methods myself, but there are many different ways of doing the relay responses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1@D is unbalanced hand, usually 5 diamonds unless 4 X 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|usually balanced|nt|swanson: 4@S is a good save here except N-S can't make 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|an|min hand|mb|p|mb|2S|an|relay|nt|bobh1: i have a different definition of a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: Give south credit for putting it to them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wolfson thought pass was forcing |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: good thing he did or he would lose 5 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual treatment, 2@H there showing spade support|pg||
nt|cherilou: seems all is natural now|pg||
mb|3C|an|shortness|nt|mdgraham: what would he do with x  KJ109xx QJx xxx I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: wish he played differently I'd guess :)|pg||
nt|cherilou: oops--not now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe they play weak jump shifts. That can impact many other sequences|pg||
mb|4H|an|Key Card I think|mb|d|nt|paulg:  i guess 3@c showed shortage, will Richter try to show the void now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherilou: responses to this type of KC vary by partnership when a X occurs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it looks like Richter is concerned about a heart lead and is hoping to hear a confirmatory redouble showing first-round control?|pg||
nt|cherilou: often pass shows 0--but not by their methods|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|glen: personally, on these hands where the high card points are split, say 18-22, long term forcing passes will not be a net plus|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  well done|pg||
nt|cherilou: at least ended up in right spot |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I could not see what the late round auction shows|pg||
nt|cherilou: play will be fast again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Aker thought no Key Cards, but it was "no heart control" by agreement -- that's what they said after the auction but why 5@H if not KC?|pg||

mb|2D|mb|d|an|T/O|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohen told Donn his DBL was takeout and Donn now asking about shape and Cohen sort of shrugs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If S plays @sJ, I´m convinced that N will have a @s trick on the @sQ|pg||
mb|1C|nt|paulg:  5@h is the bid of a man who does not trust his memory|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|an|hearts|nt|cherilou: yes, if no KC then missing @S A and @D K--only 5@D should be bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is a hand where transfer responses are very useful|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|othered1: very pushy auction in CR by south (assuming north's preference didn't show any real values beyond response)|pg||
nt|swanson: The bidding in the other room was a bit exuberant.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bobh1: still...larry's pass only doable playing strong @c|pg||
nt|swanson: 4-5-2-2 hands are not pleasant to bid without Mr. Flannery's convention.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this one is kinda good for Mr F|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  as Richter can continue with a constructive 2@s having shown his values|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: but larry doesn't play the larry-david big @C anymore|pg||
nt|othered1: Not unreasonable toupgrade south's hand a bit relative to the rebid, but there then should be a way to bail below game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no, they play pretty basic 2 over 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  and heart length|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|bobh1: then i'm really surprised larry passed|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes and also a hand where not opening 1NT with S hand gives EW bidding room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|bobh1: anyway, S is too strong for flannery isnt he?|pg||
nt|othered1: Their system sheet does say south is rather aggressive, more so than north.  That may have affected north's decision on responding.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|paulg:  the flipside being that you prevent the opponents getting into trouble, as happened at the other table|pg||
pc|sT|nt|swanson: Usually played as 11-15.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|glen: btw. Jill Meyers is one of the few top bridge players in the internet movie database: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0583564/|pg||
nt|swanson: But a 2@S rebid after partner's forcing 1NT is unattractive.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes you need some kind of gazzilli to really show the S hand|pg||
nt|glen: and sadly the italians have that patent|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice escape.  Not going to make, but not doubled.  Still a minus on top of the -200 in CR will give Wofson a handy lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: The 2011 USBC will select USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: (Fleisher-Kamil, Levin-Weinstein, Martel-Stansby). |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not the best defence. I think W should play @dQ on @dA. N cannot have a 5-card @d, so It cannot be dangerous|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can make now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: work OK to play the queen when partner has the jack, but might cause underlead otherwise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always difficult to know what to play from Qx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cherilou: but NS will go plus here so it all worked out fine. Look at that open room result|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|bobh1: opening 1N is another option|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  although the auctions look similar, there is a huge difference as it was a Precision 1@c in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  so East was not tempted to bid ...|pg||
nt|cherilou: both tables opened 1@C --difference was E's action|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|othered1: That's sick|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|glen: i think Roland would prefer the F word|pg||
nt|paulg:  here 1@c could be a weak notrump, so the West 1@s overcall is wide-ranging and East has to bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|swanson: Strange to me that North didn't double 1NT after his partner and West decided 1@S was not going to work for E-W.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: Maybe, but Es double tells a lot. W has @cQ and E not the other top honours, so how defeat?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: E-W use 'good-bad' 2NT, so with a weaker hand West would bid 2NT as a relay to 3@C.|pg||
nt|othered1: right, but even if they play it west without @H might shy away from it.|pg||
nt|bobh1: kind of surprising if W likes her hand that she bid her suits out of order|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: defense can prevail if they can get it right|pg||
nt|bobh1: win the @H K and play a low @C but maybe she's thought too long for that to work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that is what she did|pg||
nt|swanson: The only hope for declarer is 3 heart tricks.  The defense could err because East did not make a negative double and will expect only a three card heart holding.|pg||
nt|glen: doesn't that work (low @C from dummy trick 2) if you guess the @C position next round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: doesn't the @H8 give the count?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i would think @h play is att with the T|pg||
nt|glen: another plan is wait for larry to fall asleep|pg||
nt|swanson: Levin has to win the @HK and lead a low club to give herself any chance I believe.  But South is going to shift to a diamond, which is a killer.|pg||
nt|glen: so everybody likes the @C Q at trick 2?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: why not 1@c in third hand?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you were faster Mike!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: maybe because 1@C is any balanced hand, so may not have clubs so the adv a standard pair would have by opening 1@c IN 3rd is reduced|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: certainly would have been different is either E had opened 1@C in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe, after the double, 3@D should be natural  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they were unsure; Weinstein said "if this comes up again we should play our 2@C defense" presumably what they play when regular Stayman is doubled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now...what do EW lead from (1) four small (2) three small |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and does South have Q10 or Q10x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Richter is thinking, so he is apparently not sure that W has 4 clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: would he play the ten from QTx?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: <scotty> points out that S might have Q10x, wanting E to cash the king and cut himself off from West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: @HQ led in other room after a similar auction (with different bids :))|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3@d is probably a 5-card suit, so count the tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important for South to maintain a passive demeanour here |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: without the double S would bid 3@D on any hand without a good 5-cd major -- this situation is undiscussed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I know some Souths who would be berating their partners as soon as dummy went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down now and Richter asking Weinstein questions|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if S has 3343 - shouldn´t he pass on 3@c dbl?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: they had not discussed how the double changes things (if at all) in this auction|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: That South hand doesn't look like a preemptive raise to me.  I would bid 2@H, planning to bid again at the 3-level given a chance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Cohen: "you think you guys are entitled to bid a game?" |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: last hand. well done Joe |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks to the commentators and to the specs -- we'll start the next segment soon |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW have missed a couple of chances this set, but the deficit is manageable still|pg||
mb|1H|nt|paulg:  good luck with the rest of the day, my bed will be calling before you restart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: board is backward on the table -- so east is west and south is north, etc, and my job is very had for this one :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|swanson: In the Cohen version of Jacoby 2NT, 4@H shows a minimum, but no singleton.  I suppose South though his lack of high cards was compensation for the singleton.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cherilou: We give special applause to BBO for putting on this great show--Roland for all his organization and of course to all the spectators!|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: 10 min left the director annouces|pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  you have my permission to give North a good slap for misplacing the board on the table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@H was mixed raise|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  4@s is a big bid from Aker opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: from Richter, actually|pg||
nt|cherilou: I like it--don't want to defend 4@H when we have 9 @S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is going to be another swing for aker, to make the match quite close|pg||
nt|cherilou: EW will gain 9 on this board and close the margin to 10 with 90 boards to go.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|ralfwil: last board! Thanks all and bye!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Ralf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this is the first of 8 15-bd segments for this match:  60 boards today and 60 tomorrow|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|swanson: Board 117 where E-W went for 300 was a loss.  N-S were evidently minus 100 at the other table.|pg||
nt|cherilou: N can get 2 @C ruffs.....|pg||
nt|paulg:  Garner, who actually holds the North hand, must feel a little uncomfortable to let two passed hands play in 4@s undoubled |pg||
pc|s4|nt|swanson: Congratualtions to the Wolfson team.  The heavy underdog Silverstein team put up a great battle for the first 7 sessions.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg:  playing for the club ruffs is very dangerous, as partner may have the @cK and you let the contract make|pg||
nt|cherilou: but his partner pre-empted and he has 2 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i'm sure he is uncomfortable defendingk, but not clear he think he can beat 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: ouch - don't think he can make it now|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cherilou: for sure---S has VERY heavy pre-empt|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was described as a mixed raise, so 4 trumps plus a card outside|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry I missed that|pg||
mc|9|nt|paulg:  thanks all, have fun later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sorry I missed some of the play -- it is surprisingly disorienting (at least for me) for the play to go counterclockwise relative to what I have on the screen.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thanks again all -  back in a little over an hour|pg||
nt|cherilou: thanks again--come on back and join us in 80 minutes. Bye.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: result on that last board was -2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bye|pg||
