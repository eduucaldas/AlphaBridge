nt|sybarra: hi Markku and all |pg||
nt|runnerup: hi|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play a 5M system, with 1@C 11-13 balanced or 17+ any, 1@D may have longer clubs and ususally unbalanced. After 1@C their responses are in canapè. 1NT = 14-16 ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: (perfect range, imho :))|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gluckenval: The italians a nat. system with 1@D 4+ cards, and strong (15-17) NT. They also play the new version of 2@D = 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzrm: nera|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: l am a fan of leading his own suit except....|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Garvey-Carroll play also in the national Ireland team|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: dbl probably 3 card support |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrm: It seems like N wants something more than 3Nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: a 9 counter to open but still 4 @s makes with good guess -not bidden ofcause but 10 available tricks |pg||
pc|c7|nt|kemperg: thats a 50% game, :( @HK offside|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Well that is antural with 17 points and partners 1NT opening|pg||
pc|c6|nt|runnerup: ew uses support double here x= 3 hearts -so this didnt end in 1 @s like other table |pg||
pc|cA|nt|gluckenval: 6@C makable... but... honestly... really hard to find it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: natural*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: YEs very hard to find indeed|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 6NT makable with @SJ ?|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead*|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: i think with diamond J|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: he can make if he guesses right|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: well not sure about lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm:  but 6Nt is doable|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he can make this,  even with some favorable sits for a few cards |pg||
nt|runnerup: no -seems like -2 but 1 imp won |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: WOW|pg||
nt|gluckenval: at double dummy it is very easy... :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: seems like 3D was a singleton or void in S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gluckenval: in the meantime, at board 2  the @Ss were not found in OR too|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes and thats a shame actually|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vbman: can make tons of tricks with an endplay|pg||
nt|vbman: if an opp leads from three u can place the honours to his pard|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: match would have become more interesting|pg||
pc|d7|nt|runnerup: perhaps only -1 |pg||
pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sybarra: the discards on clubs will be a bit painful for n/s |pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|runnerup: now north can handle this +1 even if west has 4 clubs -because he is squezed in minors ,but wrong guess and =|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|kemperg: endplay on E now, wd:)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzrm: Looks like a slam for EW pair|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: but its very hard to bid it and also very hard to make it|pg||
nt|sybarra: you were right |pg||
nt|sybarra: need bigger swings than these, as you said |pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 5 @d makes here -perhaps a swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: atleast they are not loosing more|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Justas :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Hello Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: N might bid 3 @H preemptive|pg||
mb|1H|nt|runnerup: hi all ew had money to collect from 2 @c -but took other ideas -no luck|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vbman: it must be difficult to play against the ns|pg||
mb|2C|an|FG|nt|gluckenval: 1@C = strong in this case, and 3@D = Non invite (6+)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: 3D was natural 8-11 points|pg||
nt|gluckenval: oh, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: players at table also wanted to know what 3D mean|pg||
nt|sybarra: will W dbl again?  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrm: Well 3NT is definetely harder to play than 4H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vbman: 2cl and 2dia must be art.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @D makes because clubs are 3/3  and a spade gets pitched |pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: seems they will get couple more imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: souths opening was not everyones bid so -they missed it but will win 2 imps still|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||

nt|vbman: playing for the q to be on|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vbman: some say he sd win with ace and play dia|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kemperg: nor sure about that, S has to play @SA before trying the @Cs|pg||
nt|runnerup: weak 1nt looses 200 here -so a little pick up for ns perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzrm: Looks like S doesnt want to take spades|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kemperg: S has to decide the whereabouts of @DA|pg||
nt|kemperg: E is placed with @SHJ, perhaps had bid 2@S over 1NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: with @DA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easiest is to take the 9 tricks and the 10th will come|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vbman: now cash out|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|jacksond: well clubs 3/3 makes it better than finesse as opponents may allow you to combine chances|pg||

nt|gluckenval: 1 imp instead of 13... not the same|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Yes it would have flipped everything around|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Valerio thought a lead from @C10962 by North but if this is the spot why West plays @C... |pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: well NS pair said leads are 4th best or something like that|pg||
nt|runnerup: in board 8 both tables were in 3 nt inspite off 5-3 in @s -but other east didnt find @c out and 11 won/lost|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: Last 2 deals of this segment|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: only 1 imp because he wanted to try spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: can hardly blame E with puny 6 count but he should fly ace?    what do you think Markku?  try for clubs 3/3?|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|vugraphzrm: or lost|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzrm: well it was only 4 imps lost|pg||
nt|runnerup: to get 11 -you can squeeze south -if he has 4 @c and k of @s -so that is one possibility -5 @d would be a brave bid but 6 @d a good Q and ace -in teams ok|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vbman: my friend larry cohen wd never sell out to three sp here|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
