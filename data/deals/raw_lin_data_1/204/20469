nt|rnmalik: Hello everyone.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||

pc|h4|nt|penseur9: bonjour|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|penseur9: playing low spades to try and prevent declarer to go to dummy|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||

nt|tomi2: playing back the 8 would alloe helgemo to duck this, but maybe this will be hard to read for partner later|pg||
nt|tomi2: playing the 10 riscs to block the hearts. but I think the 2 is not the right card here|pg||
nt|pelu: @H2 for me indica a 4 card suit by E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hej Peter!|pg||
nt|tomi2: best for EW wd be to break up spades since kqt are offside|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: As I play 3@d shows 2 good suits and not only points, so I prefer 2@d as N |pg||

nt|sfoxa:  EW had good sacrifice here|pg||
nt|paulg:  Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: different countries, different sins|pg||
nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||

mb|1S|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Herve|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: ah ok|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bill|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Zmud99: There's 2 session in this Patton - Session A (afternoon) and Session B ( tonight ) - Each session play 4 matches of 8 boards - Session A and B best teams will qualify for tomorrow |pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Roland welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 HCP both sides and likely NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  W has to find @d switch now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if they take it|pg||

nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cards are nicely placed for the contract.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||
nt|kjadams: close game here.   Spade lead should scuttle it.|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi CK and John-wlc|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks ara|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I guess H and another, or H + minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Hervé|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I don't count|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2 in NS....and 1 is operating :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: Fantoni can tell from the bidding that they have a fit problem|pg||
nt|penseur9: if you don't Roland... where do I stand :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Zmud99: Standings after Round 8/9 : 1) Gladysh 140  2) Zimmermann 138  3) White House 138  4) Ventin 122  5) Marill 120  6)  Vainikonis E  117  7) De Botton 114  8) Welland  112  9)  ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Vainikonis  110  10 ) Zaleski  88    First 2 will play a final of 3X16 tomorrow |pg||
nt|runnerup: west has already shown 1 ace -so time to give ruff -wd|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni can also see the @sAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator is?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|psyck: most lines work here...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Nathalie Frey is operating :)  Venice cup winner in Estoril :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: fantastic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sex change operation? it reads Frederic in his/her profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts and 4+ in a minor|pg||

nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-13, unbalanced|pg||

nt|stoffers: bad splits here, but will bring home 10 tricks easy|pg||
nt|gluckenval: obviously, in 3rd seat and not Vul they are undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should North take control of the bidding here?|pg||
nt|kjadams: Spades will make 3 or 4 here.   Club suit frozen, but tough to arrange a pitch.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|hantveit: still, they should be able to find it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the previous hand ... North has all the wrong cards|pg||

nt|runnerup: looks to go -1 ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead something and claim, please! 13 more boards to come|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ybob: only @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|runnerup: North saved -and no @d lead -so winner|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think West has to balance at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ybob: for that was better bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 7H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people who play 2/1 reserve a 3@h rebid on this auction for a solid suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner holds xxx in dia, it is still a 52% chance to make. dia 2-2 or dia q drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Tez :) welcome|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can double 3@D, partner did not have to be this strong|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hantveit: might bid 6d on the way|pg||
nt|hantveit: wereas Multon will be given the honor to bid 7H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  not without risk of course|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hantveit: north might be afraid a pas on 6D...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|stoffers: Well judged by Gromov to double the third time (pass forcing), if he had passed i am sure dubinin had bid once more. That said 5@d or 5@h is very unlucky not to make|pg||
nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, this is 2 off|pg||
nt|stoffers: Needed club-club lead and ricing with A@s to get it three down, tough to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree ... too tight at imps|pg||
nt|kjadams: The term "frozen" means neither side can lead the suit without sacrificing a trick.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|stoffers: -3 now i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: Short of trumps, good defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think East was in a more difficult position, tough to overcall 2NT with the source of tricks destroyed|pg||
nt|hedyg: as they say cinquanta il pezzo|pg||
nt|ady: caash out job|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well done.|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction 3NT clearly stands no chance|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good result for NS in the CR.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  i don't think I've ever said that|pg||
nt|hedyg: never played against Italians?|pg||
nt|paulg:  they know my limitations|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d4|nt|mathat: thinking to retern @d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as it's turned out, probably very difficult for the defence to find the way to beat this three tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Basically West at some point had to cash the 3 major suit tops, and get out with @CJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|gluckenval: now @H|pg||
nt|paulg:  but on a less descriptive auction you'd prefer to be in 3NT than 5@d|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|tomi2: in MP or BAM Helgemo would probably have doubled 2@S w-r for 200. have not played much patton to judge the best strategy there but in imps he has an easy pass|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|tomi2: thats "danish" and not "swiss" and has nothing to do with patton|pg||

nt|hantveit: a better feeling now for NS, but can they really believe 7H is not a wash?|pg||
nt|penseur9: this may cost a few IMPs here|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very |pg||
nt|rnmalik: positive no @C and 9 tricks only.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: a hand that only Roland would find interesting here|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: i agree -4 @d -for lead ,but can you think about lead against 4nt in that |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9: oups... same at other table :(|pg||
nt|kjadams: the other table shifted to clubs vs game which gave up the extra trick.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kjadams: 5 imps for stopping low on board 2.|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Duplication error on board 3 - we will go to board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|hantveit: anoth biggy here|pg||
nt|hantveit: but as noone is holding a longer suit, it is harder to bid it.|pg||
nt|paulg:  i have more confidence in them reaching 3NT this time|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: it should not be bid either I think... what do you guys mean?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing she had made a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 1@s|pg||
nt|kjadams: Could have led clubs once, but not twice, if lead Q.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
nt|tez: if they play 1@c 1@d 1NT(May have 4 card major) ...they could stop in 3 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  2, the CR in 2@H +2 for 7 IMPs Las Girafes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: seven is only on if no club lead, trumphs breaking 3-2 and heart 3-3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry was checking why 3NT was -3 last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 1@s is diamonds or 3 controls?|pg||
nt|kjadams: interesting 3S call here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: quite strong and with a side 4 card major.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|caruga: un numerone|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kjadams: 2S here looks like a transfer to clubs, with 2N showing an accept of a club game invite.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, that was the only swingy hand with the slams & games on other boards being fairly strightforward|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks for the taking with the club Q dropping.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand this one ... 5@C is the spot, NOT 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: *les...|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C unlucky for e/w   spade ruff|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
nt|hedyg: unfortunately we have no system card or CC for EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so no game makes ... VERY tough hand :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Tomorrow we will start broadcasting at 14.03|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about 4@S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 4@S is hopeless.  Everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their best chance is probably to get to 5@C and hope that the defence mis-steps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  can in fact make    diamonds can be ruffed out  king an extra discard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it can ... there aren't enough entries.  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: likel make now with no @H ruff.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely|pg||
nt|kjadams: The zimmerman team has been one of the top teams in the world in the last couple years.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
nt|kjadams: The are a threat to win any event they have entered.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, i spoke too soon|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 11 top tricks. |pg||
nt|hantveit: that is a 0,25X0,68x0,53 % (plus stiff spade j)|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 5 in spades, 4 i dia, 2 in H and one in C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|runnerup: no science -so that even if 2 @s are off -who guesses to lead that|pg||
nt|paulg:  they could have played in 3NT anyhow ... 3@d with @dxxx was not a great description of the hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe there are ... I'll take that back|pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9: fortunatly 3NT is a south lead, might have a chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, they've reached a reasonable contract, but of course Nunes was not going to lead a spade into a bid and raised suit|pg||
nt|ady: take 8 tricks cheapest|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|gluckenval: here we are...|pg||
nt|stoffers: very important trick coming up..|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ofcause in good day you can meke this |pg||
nt|penseur9: with a @S return might promote a 9th... I'm a born optimist :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, I need more caffeine!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  I'm tempting to approach the table and see Dubinin'd eyes|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c2|nt|stoffers: Told you :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: wd|pg||
nt|stoffers: Wd|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh. yes!|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|paulg:  my kibitzers are certain that 1@s is conventional, even if they cannot agree on the specific meaning|pg||
nt|penseur9: are we seing the right bidding here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are, they overbid a little|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Yes...|pg||
nt|penseur9: this contract a a slight chance but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would not make either|pg||
nt|penseur9: will Fantoni lead trump here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done by Angelini to make 5@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then easier, spade lead much better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North did not overcall in the other room, a bit strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much does one need to overcall I wonder|pg||
nt|penseur9: I suppose that both rooms bidding can qualify as surprising... possibly strange :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is  1 in the world, that also applies to (lack of) pace :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: he might opt for a @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Nathalie fell asleep|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's past midnight in Monaco|pg||
nt|penseur9: right and I beleive one more round to play afterwards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ybob: with 2/2 trump = 100 % make|pg||
nt|hantveit: here, I jused made new coffee :)|pg||
nt|tez: i said for number 3|pg||
nt|penseur9: maybe enjoying a little pastis|pg||

nt|Vugraphzsc: or a coffee|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|nt|hedyg: and they are surely right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol  it took him 8½ minutes to find the only lead that gives the contract|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: naither 5 minutes now Roland? :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: another*|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although there is still scope for declarer to go wrong of course|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hedyg: you both are LOL|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  we have four more boards to investigate the system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who would lead a trump from Qx?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: agree Paul:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this hand I would be wary of overcalling 1@s with no length in clubs and not great values|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: 200|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: diamond switch tricks 2 could have been more   but thats asking too much|pg||
nt|kjadams: several players on the zimmerman team have relocated to Monaco so we should expect that after a few years they will be representing Monaco formally in WBF events.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|5D|nt|ralfwil: because I don´t beleive Helgemo blocking his trump|pg||

nt|psyck: when NS themselves are close to making 3N|pg||
nt|runnerup: ew in some trouble now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  dbl = points (penalty), pass = points as well (ready to play 1nt dbld)|pg||

mb|4S|nt|santyclz: Fit jump?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Elle avait caché un As !!!|pg||
nt|hantveit: they lead a club at the other table, but Stabile must have picked wrong card in trick 11 and 1 imp out|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow 14 IMPs for Angelini team|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Fit showing jump?|pg||
nt|penseur9: can he mange the @Hs Roland?|pg||

mb|d|nt|gluckenval: 1@S = 0-11 without 4 cards @S|pg||
nt|ady: 6th diamond becomes good after 3 ruffs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, he doesn't even need a club trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: that is interesting now|pg||
nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is (super) gazzilli for F-N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  agree. 2@d would have been better for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but will W pass?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, he did|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 with @c or 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: but also unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay, 2@H= @H+@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  fantoni-nunes play more 8- and 9-card major fits in 3NT than any other expert pairs I've seen|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: the pass asked for the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: Twisted Swine type runouts after NT doubled maybe|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 times trumph, but what if south covers the second trumph?|pg||
nt|paulg:  less advisable here of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Fantoni has shown minimum for his 1@H opening 5@H 4@s and refused the invite by Nunes|pg||
nt|penseur9: this one will play better... time for coffee|pg||
nt|ady: trying a@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The one thing he better not do is draw two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes will "know" @HA is not cashing ... no Blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: why lead an ace then   could have been club void?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 5@H and 4@c of course! sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see, no way to game now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he had to lead something.  And neither of the singletons is at all attractive|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  looks like one down with this lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but defence has to cash its tricks now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks fairly easy for the defence to let 4@s make|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  with @c return, declarer will have his work easier|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: NT Runouts: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c could have been @c & @d here if they play that style|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: maybe just play dia now, and give away that ruff|pg||
nt|mathat: if duk the @d meda 4|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT looks a lot better than 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|tez: 4th  seat 2@h..intermediate i think|pg||
nt|kjadams: This double looks like zimmermann felt the vulnerable game bid created a forcing pass.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: it is not an obligation to play in a suit contract just because you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he might have drawn the conclusion that the @CA was more likely to cash, otherwise, East might have fished around for a grand slam or maybe used Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  seems better for defence now|pg||
nt|runnerup: west was active this time -ew has only 19 points and he was willing to double ns on 2-levelcan be costly |pg||
pc|h5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|gluckenval: all in trsf for them, 1@C -> 1@D/@H = 4@H/@S, so 1@S = no 4M|pg||
nt|hantveit: going down now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hantveit: 2 club losers and 2H|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|runnerup: this can be a little swing -because ew can make 9 tricks in @s -with good guesses -which looks normal declareplay|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Short an entry to make use of the @ds.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Rashed, do you have link to web site for the running scores?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|psyck: I suppose it is quite normal for NS to get to this game , with or w/o interferance|pg||
nt|psyck: It has its chances, especially with W marked with high cards & potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|psyck: Dec larer is planning to strip W of muinors 1st|pg||

nt|hantveit: or let the dia run to the ace and play another dia... |pg||
nt|paulg:  looks like NS should stop in 3@s here, but often someone bids one more|pg||
nt|penseur9: well done|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C or 1@D from E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: good 4@S here|pg||
nt|kjadams: others think that if NV opponents ever bid over your vul game that you have to double, but here you see the result.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|paulg:  i guess the 2@d opener is multi 2@d, showing a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d was multi showing a weak hand with a long major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = 10-13 with diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Maybe Operator should change E's name to Zia :)|pg||
nt|gluckenval: board 4 was more difficolut for Multon in other Room.... the overbid was 1@D (not dbl) and the final dbl was from South....|pg||
nt|paulg:  in this case both sides might|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: sry Paul :(|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  makes as they lay    fortunate contract|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi Joe|pg||
mb|p|nt|gluckenval: 1D = 4+/4+ same rank|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after strong club opening, NS may use their methods to pre-empt|pg||
nt|runnerup: well you cant do this in every board -otherwise youll have heart attact very soon-down 1 by uppercup|pg||
nt|paulg:  i did presume that West might show some support!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  at least they have ones|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyway, a big lead now for Zimmermann after only 5 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least we agree!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  I wonder what the x was, majors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 imps per hand in average|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  looks like, but what about points?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double by West is pass or correct|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C strong but west whit 4 points could lead to problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: some east migth open here -althougth east has a 3-suiter not suitable fos muidenberg |pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  i think I might have tried to bid my clubs|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with West hand?pass?2@h 3@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: hmm, operator updated 4@s to -1|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe Zia did not cover 3rd @d or something|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was: pass if your suit is @H , else bid your suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: they really likes to bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Again e has done a lot of bidding on 2 hcp.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makeable with @c lead and guessing @h right|pg||
nt|penseur9: their are no on line results available on line unfortunatly|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: perhaps Nunes had his moment for 2 @d -now more difficult |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  natural one down now|pg||
nt|kjadams: aggressive 2N will pay off here.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Optomistic bid by n.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: this seems to be a couple down after @d finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass if i had no other bidding cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Tez, welcome|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz2:  E-w gained 3 imps on bd four to shoot into the lead!|pg||
nt|runnerup: but like you see -no mistakes -very good lead|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it would go 1@h (1@s) 3@h (3@s) all pass|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: with likely 3 minor suit losers  needs spade finesse   and luck with hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  will West underlead his clubs to get a spade ruff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|hedyg: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is dummy, he can see it is his only chance |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hantveit: not finish in closed yet|pg||
nt|hantveit: should we stall this table a bit maybe?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, that 6@C was too much for my pc :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is turning into a rout.|pg||
nt|kjadams: In theory, that finesse not safe, but declarer's assumption that they can't cash 3 spades here is right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: If east started with A63 of spades, this would now go down.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  Fantoni will be considering three hearts to pitch his club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: 28 IMP swing, that's all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Now is not the time to get busy on defense.  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they all are accustomed to struggle till the last trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are lucky to see one more @c and @hJ by S - not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so he paused|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Well, he needs the @Sqj doubleton, he knows the @D distribution, what does that say about the rounded suits?|pg||
nt|mathat: @c disc|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes disc|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|mathat: cut the communication|pg||
nt|paulg:  a scissors coup|pg||

nt|paulg:  i can understand not opening, with side 4-card major and a void, and as Fantoni has shown declarer did not need much help|pg||
nt|hedyg: want to swap?|pg||
nt|paulg:  have you seen my bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..no|pg||
nt|paulg:  another challenge for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I'm in favor  of their moving right along.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S not bid in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually cold grand slam now|pg||
nt|ady: with the spade diamond 2 suiter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wstuart: Easy 4@H game here|pg||
nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: playing 3 rounds of @c on lead sure helped|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not open 2s in south. Too strong hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Let's follow their methods. Bill will explain|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
nt|hantveit: partner dos not need much before 4s is on|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  west forced to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks pal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Happy to be of service|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how we would cope without you|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  is that a weak two or a constructive two bid? Looks far too good for a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a vulnerable 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When we explain our version of Fantunes to our opps, we generally say: "our system is more natural than yours"|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S or pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems like a book vulnerable weak 2 to me.  The 6/4 adds to the value but still...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But now the difficult part, cuebids, Turbo, whatever|pg||
nt|ady: so far seems very natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H here has 2 spades and a club to lose.   Needs kx of hearts onside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator agrees with you.  12.55 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ak10972+42+7+10652|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c probably a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s seems to be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards very unfrienly here -so many down ,but normal try|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  click on the board you wish to review, and click âNextâ to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  âOther Tableâ, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As you predicted...|pg||
nt|mathat: dbl promises @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: punishing his pd for overcalling?|pg||
nt|paulg:  east seems to have the same understanding of double to me|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C gives up any chance of a plus score.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H is -1 and so is 5@C for NS, their best spot.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is possible that East would have bid 4@h over a simple raise, but this has no real play on this layout|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: i can hear Tamburelli swearing into his beard all the way here!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lack of @c cue is obvious now|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Fulvio could find it.... |pg||
nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: The questionable bid here is 3@d, i suggest 2nt with all those soft cards. Queens and Jacks plays good in NT |pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni take the Q @c and play 3 R @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2: wow|pg||

pc|d2|nt|hantveit: give partner one more spade, and 4S is on. with only 8 points. and partner might have much better cards withouth investigating for 4|pg||

pc|d5|nt|sfoxa:  16 boards in this segment. Last one segment|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: i must admit 4@H was unexpected for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pls explain 7@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My guess is this|pg||
nt|ritong: last time fantoni did that, he got ruffed on the lead  perhaps he will make a remark about that displaying the dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 4@C confirmed 5-5 shape, and North's 4@H was as cue bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South cued 4@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9: 3@D should make but possibly 3@H by E/W might have also|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp to Levini|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North showede even key-cards with 4NT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kjadams: down 1 in 5C is not a disaster, but 7 IMP loss for "insurance" is kind of expensive.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mathat: now -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South knew that all the key cards were there, so cued 5@D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|psyck: apparently: 3@C min, 3@D extras & no short (that u admit), 3@H low single, 3@S middle, and 3nt high is common in Sweden.|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|hantveit: 13 tricks in 4S at the other table. Spade J lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have passed the redouble ... it does not show a desire to play in 1@H-XX for me|pg||
nt|penseur9: very hard to predict final score yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Roland you beat me to it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because I am 6 hrs ahead of you|pg||
nt|penseur9: I beleive they will restart tomorrow at 2pm local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill's comments even faster as he is a further 9 hours ahead|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW will gain an imp here - important for them|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hard to believe the @s6 becomes a 2nd stopper.|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 top tricks here.  Needs to establish one more, which can be done in clubs with a good guess.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A small @c to  the 9 looks good here.|pg||
nt|kjadams: he must guess that spades are not running.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stoffers: nice splits here, and 110 or 140 incoming|pg||
nt|ritong: i try to procced more discreetly usually:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A couple of alert specs tell me that 6@C can make on a spade lead also. Complete cross-ruff and score last trump en passant. Well spotted|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: we play penalty dbl after rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt make the 2@c bid look any hotter to me|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: What's the Saturday weather like, Bill? And the lottery numbers please|pg||
nt|santyclz: N couldn't afford to duck the @s for fear of a @h switch.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  looks like it is going one down, which it a little close for comfort|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes and -1 makes sometimes...|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Paul|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|tomi2: sry guys, get some uniformed information "no" but I asked for someone who knows the EW agreements and not his own ones ;)|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 7 of spades is gonna win defence a trick soon..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Played by w, @c lead.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|wstuart: Here are a couple of sites that people refered for the tourney:|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass= you pick a suit pd, i can take any|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stoffers: No, sry :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: Stabile played spade K when east played low spade from table? very strange|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's pleasant day, about 20C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|wstuart: http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/News/News/Monaco-Welcomes-the-International-Bridge-Elite|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps a penalty card?|pg||
nt|hantveit: a little break here now, so closed can speed ut ahead|pg||
nt|santyclz: The closed room seems to have disappeared.|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe, but then it must have been dropped at the table...|pg||
nt|kjadams: the ace play blocks suit.   |pg||
nt|kjadams: ducking allows unblock.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz2:  Friendly hand. Declarer could easily lose control if things weren't breaking so well.|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the last deal of this match|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 more matches in this session|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: cashing side winners now to prepare xruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: all it takes is a tiny glitch|pg||

nt|penseur9: thank you to all our fine spectators for their comments and questions... hope to se you all tomorrow|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The stock market is going down|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|paulg:  this time last year I was playing with a Scotsman who has lived in France for the last 30 years ... it became clear to me that we lived in different universes when it came to bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What else would you like to know?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: 9 @C and duck equally good.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tomi2: this pair plays 3NT as a solid MAJOR opening. many players play as solid minor some as solid "any suit"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: lottery numbers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 12, 16, 23, 27, 36 and 40|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
nt|penseur9: I can give you the loosing numbers Roland :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done|pg||

mc|10|nt|rnmalik: Thanks all entertaining match.|pg||
nt|mathat: if J @c is !E ?|pg||
nt|mathat: never x to the 9|pg||
nt|kjadams: Light opener in other room stole the board!|pg||
nt|santyclz: Then they are 3-2 and anything works or e has made a strange play from kj10x and nothing works.|pg||
nt|mathat: safety play x @d to the N and x @c from dummy|pg||
nt|mathat: nows S were is the 7 @s|pg||
nt|mathat: N|pg||

nt|tomi2: in Germany the rules forbid you to open too light in 3rd seat (all seats). there is some discussion about this because players did not know about this but directors started to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: enforce this rule in the past tournaments|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|h9|pc|s5|pg||
mc|7|nt|ralfwil: thx all and bye|pg||
nt|pelu: that rule is not bridge|pg||
nt|tomi2: this rule would cause that alle results by Helness - Helgemo in thsi set would be adjusted to -3 imps|pg||
nt|pelu: as kibs say: that a rule for beginners :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: because it seems they play a HUM system where a 1@S opener shows that light values|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsb: See you in a few - bye all|pg||
nt|tomi2: it happens even in German Open chamionships|pg||
