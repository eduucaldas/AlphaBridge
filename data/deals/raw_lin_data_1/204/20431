mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
mb|p|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
pc|h6|nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||

nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||

nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||

nt|imp_jan: another slam|pg||
nt|imp_jan: missed in the OR|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@H by *west* is very good.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ritong: they might get to it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 6 n|pg||
nt|wstuart: by east is pretty decent|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: depends on romanski's decision over 1@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ritong: or the equivalent|pg||
nt|stoffers: he shows interest, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, if NS doesn't go high next door, board  13 is a coffee-board )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  here Fantoni did his best to avoid @s guessing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  experts show themselves in pecularities|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|wstuart: How many @H will he bid?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, good chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This will likely propel west into bidding some more.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: to be honest, i wld have bid 4@h as well as east ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 4@H - it should show a good distr hand but not particularly strong in HCP (wihch would have started with 2@S).|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly|pg||
mb|4S|nt|imp_jan: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has everything to try that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4n, whatever that is (RKC?, general slam try?)|pg||
nt|ritong: especially @c KQx|pg||
nt|wstuart: Likely RKC for @H.|pg||
nt|wstuart: East will think his @S void is useful, so will make a response above 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: he has three keys, otoh|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: I don't know what their methods are - typical is 5NT is 2 and 6m is 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: with a void in that suit, but there are many variations which are both reasonable partnership specific.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazing 5@S by north btw|pg||
nt|stoffers: Slam makes here, but hard to bid and quite lucky|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|wstuart: This fits with DOPI - Double = 0,  Pass = 1, 5NT = 2, 6@C = 3, which is what he has.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Would they bid the same way if dubinin had QTxx in @H?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: Many pairs choose to play DEPO at 5 of their suit and beyond (D = Even, Pass = Odd)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wd ew, especially by apolinary kowalski|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wstuart: Suppose south lead a low @D - would you play low or put up the @DK as declarer?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  that wouldn't be the easiest match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: nothing good can happen  they are definitely too high|pg||
nt|wstuart: A little too high.  They were getting 6:5 IMP odds on the game, but it requires a good deal more than just a finesse, so it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
