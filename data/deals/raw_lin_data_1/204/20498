nt|sybarra: we will sort this out |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Jean and Andy|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: we will start getting comparisons now|pg||
nt|psridhar: where East had Void |pg||
nt|rodal f: And then we have compaions|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|andyv:  Hi Roland, Jean and everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: hello all|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hi Li, our operator|pg||
nt|andyv:  a healthy 3@d call by N will put S to the test|pg||
nt|baldjean: 5@d makes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know how to pronounce the player names, but at least I can spell them :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North is Fu Zhong I am told|pg||
nt|baldjean: @h split well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a world class player who used to play with Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|andyv:  and @d suit behaves|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 tricks, S should just bid 5@ds|pg||
nt|andyv:  the @c suit should be the pusher|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope we are not stuck|pg||
nt|twcho: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|psridhar: +depressing to start a 12 Bd segment with consequtive slams going down|pg||
mb|2C|an|MAY NOT HAVE MEJ.|nt|twcho: a grand to start|pg||
nt|rodal f: Seems as EW got a max at OR. The NT can be heldt by 6 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  precicion 2@c and 2@s not forcing|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's a little surprise that the play-off for 3rd place is shown rather than the final.  The truth is the final is briadcasted on the local net "Our Game"|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: This is second half of the quarter.  Of the 4 quarter final matches, this has the widest margin.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: N gave thought to making another move.... E thinks and passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I can't see why 3S instead of 4H.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|rodal f: Any reason to lead from a color u don't have?|pg||
nt|rodal f: This time not that bad.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gracelin: of QF match only has 1 imp difference, the other 3 imps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 2@H explained as @H + m|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psridhar: Rana had an opportunity to collect 300 or so in 2@H.....now in an uncertain 2@s |pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: both pairs here play Precision.  2D is GF staymen, 3C showed 5-card clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is the 2nd half of one of the semi final matches.  The other match is alomost decided.  Shenzhen led Shanghai by 58 imps in 1st half.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Can't argue with success.|pg||
nt|twcho: they bid the grand in quite an unexpected fashion|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: National team lost the SF bacause opponents bid a 50% slam and made.  Now their opponents bis a 54% grand  and will also make.  Bad lucks.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS use Rusinow lead, lower of touching honors.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the prizes for the top 4 finishers are S$19,000 for winner, 12,500 for 2nd place, 9,000 for 3rd and 6,000 for 4th.|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats a misexpln -may invit diro|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Mine would have been a @S. There I have 4 cards.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|gracelin: EW for the National Team is the only pair that play a natural system in the team.  Other 2 pairs are Precisioners.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and they bid effectively to the excellent grand slam with their own "Lian's natural system"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: no screens|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|gracelin: south would need to shift to H to save the overtrick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: 7NT also makes with hearts breaking, but of course, 7C is the right contract|pg||
nt|psridhar: basically 4-3-3-3 and 8 count facing strong NT opener -a passed hand oppo has balanced 2@H .....why not defend ?|pg||

nt|andyv:  re everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|twcho: Do you expect CR EW to bid the grand too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: declarer missed an overtrick there?|pg||
nt|psridhar: s|pg||
nt|psridhar: but Rana missed more in auction :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: with his hand he can visualise an entryless dummy for rajmohan|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: the standings may change, as i think there is still an appeal pending|pg||
nt|rodal f: A nice max bidded at OR|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|twcho: west is a bit aggressive to bid to a thin game at bd 1 and went down inevitably |pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: probably not.  more scientific exploration will find out trump Q is missing.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gracelin: it's always not easy to bid very strong 4441 hand.  Lian and Shi overcame that huddle.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Qualifiers... 1. Priyas 4 (152)   2. Bimal Sicka (151) 3. Team Secure (151) 4. Aristos (146)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: N gave thought to making another move.... E thinks and passes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzrp: Facing Connectivity issues|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: and they didn't. 11 imps to Pudong|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  borderline invitational but the K@d is a big asset|pg||
nt|twcho: south 1@s is not everyone's choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: E thinking|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: NS is playing precision judging from bd 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 3NT but tough to bid after opponents' strong 1C opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south might bid 3NT here, if he is brave.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c suit behaving, 12 tricks in NT are there for the taking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: So the National Team, as expected, stay out of the not so cold grand but lose 11 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: he wanted to bid 2S in other Vul. but dare not do so at this Vul.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, lucks are there in this game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: Precision is probably the prevailing system in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: north didn't preempt 3D but bid 2D then 3D.  In addition to seven good D, I will expect 1-2 useful card outside, which will make 3NT good.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5N looks like pick a slam bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: S calls the director... i guess bcoz of E's long pause and double|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: director asks to continue the bidding and play.. will adjust score if there is damage|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: 3 @C was precarious  for sure |pg||
nt|sybarra: and 3 @S not easy either |pg||
nt|sybarra: leading a @D might have worked better but may be time if ht played too early |pg||
nt|sybarra: as stated,  maybe @D works better for the ruff,  but no way to tell that given the bidding |pg||
nt|sybarra: we may be stuck again|pg||
nt|sybarra: operator more problems?|pg||
nt|andyv:  unfortunately for EW, the wrong party is on lead...N has an easy @h lead and should be able to signal for a @c switch|pg||
nt|rodal f: Party time and no more to say.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|psridhar: noone noticed Raj had no Mm hand at table last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: noone discussed it at least|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  or more|pg||
nt|gracelin: and NS couldn't even beat 3S|pg||
nt|twcho: a possible 6@d here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: both tables found the good sacrifice.  NS can make 7C but hard to be confident on the Grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if he plays to make contract, it will be down 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  not vul, the penalty is not as severe if W tries to make this |pg||
nt|andyv:  something went a miss....rarely do you want to play a slam in your 4-3 fit.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|twcho: the @c position is the most favorable possible for declarer|pg||
nt|twcho: but declarer doesn't know about it|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6D is ok looking at EW hands, but the 4-1 trumps plus 6-1 spades will make it tough to make. |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  fortunately for NS, 12 tricks are still there|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|twcho: and he guesses the trump|pg||
nt|gracelin: north already knows they have a cold 3NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: meantime the Swiss teams are going on.  Winner there will also get a US$8,000 prize.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Gi Li Motor is now leading the Swiss field.|pg||
nt|twcho: it is makeable but need accurate card location|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  so now, 9 tricks for the defense unless S feels obligated to part with a @c on the run of @hs|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, essentially to finesse north for DJ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gracelin: This match is from group C.  Beijing Xinyuan is leading the group and Shi Ji Chang Da still has chance to qualify.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|twcho: but of course they are now at one level lower|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: in view of the vulnerability, north may well consider to pass out the board or choose to open 2@h.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now declarer can draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|gracelin: ruff next spade with DA and fnesse north for DJ.|pg||
nt|twcho: and would have different plan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|twcho: is it wise to ruff the loser by north|pg||
nt|psridhar: he can claim the rest i thk|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzrp: director summoned again|pg||
nt|rodal f: A lucky 500 by NS hard bid. Was in for 800 but let's see....|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: this might shut out EW from entering the bidding|pg||

nt|gracelin: this s Patrick Huang from Taipei.|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Patrick |pg||
nt|gracelin: Defenders lose their HA|pg||
nt|andyv:  down 2 and 11 imps to National Team as 4@h was bid and made by EW in the CR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: NS discussing.. N suggestinga 2@D bid to S to show a good raise|pg||
nt|rodal f: It realy happend the vug operator told me:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gracelin: Today starts this RMB460,000 tournament,  winner will ake 150,000, almost US$35,000.|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s is a good sacrifice over 4@h here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: S points out 4@S doesnt make on @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: there aren't any screens.. so pauses are visible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|gracelin: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW has an easy 4H but NS can sacrifice 5C for a small profit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north may just bid it|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 4H on the trump finesse.|pg||
nt|psridhar: good result for Aristo from other tbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice prize money |pg||
nt|baldjean: operator is apparently trying to catch up|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 2N bid turned out to be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will have to control so he doesn't go overboard|pg||
nt|twcho: Let's see where they'll finish|pg||
nt|gracelin: unless the defenders find the D shift and overruff|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, didn't realize it|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ni hao: ´ó¼ÒºÃ£¬Èç¹ûÓÐ¹ÛÖÚÔ¸ÒâÔÚ¿ªÊÒ×÷ÖÐÎÄ½âËµ£¬¿É·¢Ë½ÁÄÐÅÏ¢¸øÎÒ|pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the 5th match of the round robin.  The 32 teams field are divided into 4 groups.  The top teams from each group will qualify for the finals.|pg||
nt|twcho: a possible grand|pg||
nt|twcho: and a very good small slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d probably one major|pg||
nt|andyv:  over a dbl, 1@d may show better values (5-7 or so)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A push to come?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|andyv:  catching up on boards...on 2, EW took their obvious 4 tricks and then E probably ruffed a @c with his stiff K@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: north chose to defend but I can'd see where four tricks are coming from.|pg||
nt|gracelin: No, he hasn't given up yet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: doubt EW will reach that high.  NS may win the hand at 3S|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@h is a good raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: top 2 teams|pg||
nt|gracelin: if 5C now, why nor earlier.  In fact I might bid 3NT over 3C and run if get doubled.|pg||
nt|twcho: of @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: let's see where they'll finish|pg||
nt|twcho: minor slam is more difficult to bid because of the space constraints|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East 3NT is everybody's bid but he bought a poor dummy here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H is still an easy make.  In fact even 6H can make on good spade guess.|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is considering 5D, but guess he will pass.|pg||
nt|gracelin: because partner can pass 5C as forcing if he wanted to encourage west to compete.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@s perhaps is preemptive reraise|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|twcho: South has a minimum but very good supporting hand for his partner|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi all.|pg||
nt|gracelin: China national team has won the grand slam swing.  Other able stopped in 6C only|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: N should have doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Director rules 5@H-x = on 14|pg||
nt|cicus: at least to avoid the @H lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Welcome Gabor|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: 3 @H usually a good spade raise |pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole field of 32 teams are divided into 4 groups.  This match is from group A, what is called the VIP group.|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting on board 2, EW got very active and bid to 4@s making|pg||
nt|andyv:  a decent slam missed in either minor and NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's bids are not making the W hand any better|pg||
nt|gracelin: table|pg||
nt|gracelin: you distinguish the bad raise and good raise, but also give opponent to show H while direct 2S wouldn't|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W will convert|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Göran Sperber|pg||
nt|gracelin: north needs to overtake this and shift to D to beat it.|pg||
nt|twcho: price you have to pay. |pg||
nt|twcho: Can Li find the defense?|pg||
nt|gracelin: I will be disappointed if Li doesn't do that.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  this should make with 5@s, 1@h and 3@c|pg||
nt|psridhar: poor strategy to pass 1N with 6 card suit - if he had directly trfed to 3c oppo have a tougher bal situation|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: 3NT is fast arrival, showing a very weak opening but good D stoppers.|pg||
nt|gracelin: CA and D|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender will take their 5 top tricks for -3.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  difficult to believe, looking at all 4 hands, that the contract is only 2@s by N|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW can easily make 3@d and probably 4|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, 3H is a genuine invitation while a raise to 3S is defined as a Courtesy raise.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|twcho: ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: N thinking.. no quick entry to hand if he plays @Cs now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: The total prize money for this invitational event is around US$68,000.  Winner alone will get about US$20,000|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gsper:  Is everybody playing Precision here?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: just a bit unlucky here |pg||
nt|gracelin: I like south's 3C opening.  Everything goes at this Vul.|pg||
nt|cicus: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Manoj thinking|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: north didn't manage to find out the information he wants but he gamble that there will be good chance to produce the 13 tricks he needs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gracelin: This tournament is sponsored solely by Nan Gang Done Li , a power company in Guandong.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Goran and Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: rana played @CQ prev trick.. i wont undo|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|gracelin: NS made 4H in closed room which is a great result for Shi Ji CHang Da.|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW are ...don't know about NS yet|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Xi in East is the only veteran in the team.  He played for China in the last two Bermuda Bowls.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|gracelin: declarer play D himself and is giving defenders a 2nd chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is too greedy for the overtrick.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  now @h back and @s exit will hold W to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  here, W is simply going to cash out|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: The boss, SH Chen, is playing in the closed room.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|twcho: and he is lucky to find east with @dK|pg||
nt|twcho: so 11 imps to NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: DQ and D can't be wrong.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|gracelin: looks like -2 but still a gain of 6 imps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: waiting for boards from OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: the score displayed is wrong.. NS started with a carryover of 3VPs, not 3 IMPs|pg||

mc|10|nt|twcho: very careless play by declarer|pg||

nt|gracelin: south found a good lead, if he led his partner's suit, H, 4S might make.|pg||
nt|baldjean: with 5/5 in majors I can understand they became active. East's hand is upgraded a lot if there isd a fit and even more so if there is a double fit|pg||
nt|gracelin: now|pg||
nt|twcho: National Team has quite a handsome lead into this last segment|pg||
nt|twcho: losing only 2@d and 1@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: a huge lead for Priya's IV|pg||
nt|psridhar: we do not know what will happen on those two slam hands yet...but barring those low scoring affair so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|gsper:  This board does not promise much drama either.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ni hao: welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|psridhar: i guess one of those 2 will swing|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|twcho: the trailing team need some big swings to overturn the deficit|pg||
nt|twcho: so two -ve turns into a +ve|pg||
nt|twcho: for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction may die at 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks like precision auction |pg||
nt|twcho: east can bid 3@h (must be forcing) or 3N here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|gracelin: Yes, Shirley, they are competing with Mr. Yeh.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and poor E has virtually nothing |pg||
nt|gracelin: You will see lot of Precision actions in this tournament, I guess more than 60% of Chinese players play Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I recall from other vugraphs  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I must say I play with many chinese players on bbo,  and they play an excellent 2/1 game also!|pg||
nt|sybarra: (since I do not play precision) |pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, you need to know natural system well to also play well with Precision.|pg||
nt|sybarra: S hates to balance and find the next bid to be 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: but he knows pard has some point given the E bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: *points|pg||
nt|gracelin: this East hand worth a 2S raise in the way I play, but no harm is done.|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you mostly play precision, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  N believes Qx of @s is a stopper|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S is touch and go.  A club opening lead will beat it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: NS playing prec based system|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Patrick Huang|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick:)|pg||
nt|twcho: good morning everyone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gracelin: Ths is the 2nd match of the RR from group C.  Both teams have won their first match.|pg||
nt|gsper:  N had no quite satisfactory bid.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 1NT overcall does lead to an easy 3NT bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  o tricks with the @s and just playing for overtricks...these are the times partners get upset if you go down:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  9 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: This is the 1st segment of the quarter final|pg||
nt|twcho: losing team will go into the Swiss Teams event while the winner will advance to the semi|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Tommy, NS has a close 4H.  South may need to lead a club for a spade shift to bea it.|pg||
nt|twcho: both pairs in this table play precision which is very popular in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: only because south is still awake.|pg||
nt|cicus: E had a dubious double|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East may bid 3NT now and make on a spade lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: or East 3H, West 3S, East 3NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: this doesnt look like a make... E thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  dbl limited S hand to 5-7 probably|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d is relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Jiang in south here play for China Open team last year at the PABF in New Zealand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: nice lead, now another club lead from East when he gets in will beat 4S.|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's vital that defenders have both C9 and C8 in their hands.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will N try to might make a IMP by a small @D from the Q?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gracelin: Mr. Gua, sitting north here, is the boss of the automibile company.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW, Sun and Kang are member of China open team many years ago.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Sun made his name known in the semi-final match against Italy in the 2004 Olympiad.  Sun and Kang also reached semi-final in the 2011 Vanderbilt in the Spring NABC.|pg||
nt|baldjean: 6nt actually make here, but they won't be bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  that doesn't look right|pg||
nt|gracelin: He and Zhang play natural, including 16-18 1NT.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2C seems to be part of the 2-way check back.  2C for invitational hand and 2D for GF.|pg||
nt|twcho: with @h breaking, declarer can enter dummy with the 3rd @H|pg||
nt|gracelin: or just NMF|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: north has no reason to go on.|pg||
nt|twcho: guess 4@h shows a min|pg||
nt|gracelin: as I said, need a club lead to beat this.|pg||
nt|twcho: with no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: will need a @D switch when E wins a @C though.. may not be easy to find|pg||
nt|psridhar: this game shd make easily|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: Winner of main event will get 120,000 RMB prize money. The winner of the Swiss Teams also gets 50,000 RMB|pg||
nt|twcho: Liu finds the fatal lead|pg||
nt|gracelin: south duly finds it.  North is sure to shift to spade after winning CK.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after south takes 2 spade tricks, need a D shift to take away the entry for long clubs.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, need accurate defense to beat this contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|twcho: NS are current China national team members and they will soon go to Eindhoven of Netherlands to compete in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|twcho: their CC can be found here: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/China/li-liu.pdf|pg||
nt|twcho: same meaning but different wordings. :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not get that chance as at OR|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: remember, his 1NT rebid could be as many as 15 CP|pg||
nt|gracelin: HCP|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s lead will create a lot of problems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: this is one of the semi final matches.  The other is Shanghai playing another team from Shenzhen.|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 3, E probably did not take the best line of play and went down 2 in 3N...13 imps to the National Team|pg||
nt|gracelin: I see.  The national team must a favorite to win this match.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north leads S10, south shud not overtake and try to give north a ruff.  |pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  probably best to duck here|pg||
nt|twcho: and make certain of his contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  lack of entries to dummy wll make this a difficult hand to play esp. after a @s lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  free finesse time|pg||
nt|gracelin: and an entry for D finesse.|pg||
nt|andyv:  now N has 2 entries to dummy to hook the @ds|pg||
nt|gracelin: the other table is in 3H doubled for at least 500.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: unable to pass 1N-x now :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: declarer should have taken the first trick with CA to confuse opponents.  Now it's clear he has CA.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|gracelin: because declarer can discard D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: good, south is asking for a D shift.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: the lead is helpful.  declarer may only lose 2S + 2D for his contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he needs to handle well and guess everything.|pg||
nt|gracelin: running the D7 will be a good start.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N can now float the 8 of @ds|pg||
nt|twcho: So far, Liu hasn't made any error. :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the contract is now doomed|pg||
nt|twcho: Liu Jing is the youngest National Team member|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is a better contract than 5C and may be reached in other table for 12 imps.|pg||
nt|twcho: he has acquired his master degree in Qinghua University|pg||
nt|gracelin: even if declarer takes DA and guesses, there is at least one H loser to go with S and D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: guesses trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see how 2@S could be better than defend|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|psridhar: i have sympathy for slam on Bd no 35 but none for 36|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|twcho: this is probably not the best line|pg||
nt|gracelin: now low spade back|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|andyv:  nice play pitching K@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a problem...leading any of his suits may be useless since he has no entry if he leads @ds and @c suit is very weak|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|twcho: Li Jie, besides being a full time bridge prof, he also acts as a role of bridge reporter|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: on 35, E took 5@C as asking in @C, W took 5@D as cue|pg||
nt|psridhar: final cont was reasonable|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: low spade also works well|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes indeed.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  taking A@s and E must find the Q of @c|pg||
nt|twcho: but South has dicarded too many @s |pg||
nt|twcho: how can a trump return be correct?|pg||
nt|twcho: given the threatening @c suit in dummy|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, I don't understand it either.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzrp: W is upset with @S continuation.. E says u dont open :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: How could East raise his passed hand partner to game is a little surprising.  He also has wasted honors in club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, lot of information on his blog.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: Sun obviously has length in Heart so East seems to have an unsuitable hand for partner.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in this case, not a problem|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|twcho: so probably not enough winner to set declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: East is not sure who has C8, but if he has a count in D, cub return is his only chance now.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  but if S had Qxx of @cs and 2 spades, then not ducking would have produced effects EW don't want to think about.|pg||
nt|baldjean: I don't believe this. did declarer miscount?|pg||
nt|gracelin: now Club to A amd C10 pitches a spade is the safest way|pg||
nt|psridhar: but on 36 the signals were up -EW ignored them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|gracelin: West did not shift to club gives an indication that he holds CQ.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: Heart shift will be 800|pg||
nt|twcho: and it seems to me that north hasn't given a hard thought on it|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe West should double 2S to show an honor there.  |pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|gracelin: he did think for a while, though.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, the declarer takes the safest route|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|andyv:  W will be endplayed to give up the 10th trick|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||

nt|twcho: his blog http://blog.sina.com.cn/modelbridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: yes... N agrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: will they bid this one too? and guess @Hs right?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Here W made a slam try after E said no interest for anymore by his 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Lucky that @DA was onside.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: rehi.  Yes, shirley. I do lay Precision with my current partner.|pg||
nt|gsper:  3NT was a funny contract on these hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: This is the 4th match (today's last) of the RR from group C.  Only two teams from each group will qualify for the finals|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW will outbid NS in spades here.|pg||
mb|1C|an|STRONG|nt|gracelin: North can bid 4H right away or show his club to involve south in hiogh level decision.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a H lead, dummy H10 wins, a D was taken by north DK, but he led back a H instead of spades.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2@d will help guess @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Shanghai Pudong is 5th in the C group and HK 8th.  Both teams need good win in this and remaining matches to have any chance.|pg||
nt|psridhar: if at all they bid to slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|twcho: 1N=8-13 or 16+ bal; can be 4441|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, so both table slip in defense|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is making by EW, will West bid it ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Though 4@H won't be much fun with 4-1 trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: really East should overcall 2D last round.|pg||
nt|twcho: west does have a great fitting hand|pg||
nt|twcho: he knows @d must be running|pg||
nt|twcho: and partner likely to hold 6 cards at least|pg||
nt|twcho: but still only 7 tricks in view|pg||
nt|andyv:  the CR bid this hand to 3NT...a bit optomistic with only the @c suit to run.|pg||
mb|3D!|an|4 CARD FIT 18-19|nt|twcho: good gamble|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW can make 2S or 3H.|pg||
nt|andyv:  both games very marginal|pg||
nt|gsper:  So well stopped.|pg||
nt|twcho: supportive double?|pg||
nt|andyv:  E should pass this invite|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: I understand you played it as it was being developed |pg||
nt|sybarra: so you must have known cc wei |pg||
nt|gracelin: welcome back.  North chose the direct route and was duly outbid by EW.|pg||
nt|gracelin: great recovery.  |pg||
nt|twcho: 3@d seems too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, that was Mr. CC Wei's time, more than 40 years ago.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E's 1@h call may help S in playing this hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: at where the should be :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Even 2@H could be down with a little misguessing.|pg||
nt|twcho: although @s doesn't break, declarer should still likely be able to gather 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW should make 3@d |pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: a tad aggro 4@H?|pg||
nt|psridhar: 3rd time lucky?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south's initial pass is below 5 so north is jyst competing for a partial.|pg||
nt|twcho: with this flattish hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@C strong it was at OR as well I precume.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and you were just a child :) |pg||
nt|gracelin: a club lead will soon this 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: which south duly found.|pg||
nt|twcho: declarer has to guess the @d to make this contract|pg||
nt|twcho: the lead didn't trouble him|pg||
nt|twcho: probably an overtrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: the double is trying to scare opponents away the right contract.  I saw this happen many times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no double no troubles.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A heltyer contract for a push.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: sorry|pg||
nt|twcho: 9 tricks probably|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s, 2@c, 2@h and 1@d|pg||
nt|twcho: What does the final double mean?|pg||
nt|twcho: really difficult for either N or S to double|pg||
nt|psridhar: 5@c may be 1 key; Raj will find trump queen is missing and sign off in 5h|pg||
pc|h7|nt|twcho: may get an overtrick in the end play|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's making without the club lead.|pg||
nt|twcho: lead some other suit rather than @s?|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, at imps.  If this is MP, he may get a double.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: a @S switch now?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: sure, whenever NS thought that they are being robbed of their partial|pg||
nt|cicus: 6NT from the S hand is the proper contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: with @CA known, i guess S will eventually bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: agree|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psridhar: if he was going to bid slam anyway why ask for trump queen?|pg||
nt|psridhar: changed his mind midstream |pg||
nt|rodal f: @C and a small? Right hand in for decl|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  re|pg||
nt|gracelin: can understand why south didn't double 2H to show 3-card S.  He opened on 10 counts and has good hearts.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S basically was one and done|pg||
nt|gsper:  Patrick, a few days ago there was a discussion about when the Precision 2@D was...|pg||
nt|gsper:  extended to distributions like 3415. Do you know?|pg||
nt|gracelin: north probably has seen partner open light, or he might double 2H to compete in any of the other 3 suits.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know the method but not the discussion|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: he was our captain many times, once in Bermuda Bowl and twice in Team lympiad.|pg||
nt|gracelin: As to when it was enhenced my guess is around the 70"s by American experts.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should cash 2@hs and then play @c to board and pitch a @s on @h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: good spots in the E hand |pg||
nt|gracelin: I guess it simply for penalty and din't say " Don't lead spades.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: So the X was for shure not any good gambeling?:) |pg||
nt|cicus: for this very  reason: now at least one major K has to be onside, which is not the case in 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: yes.. can count 12 tricks in nt|pg||
nt|cicus: of course declarer might go up with ace and try to discard onclubs but that has its own risks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|twcho: with @dKx chance vanishing, his only hope is @d breaking 33|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|gracelin: Declarer still need to guess well to escape for -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  N could have underlead @s for a 2nd ruff but that would be with his natural trump trick|pg||

nt|sybarra: now a spade up |pg||

nt|gracelin: Hi Jeanine|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are either up very early or staying up very late |pg||
nt|baldjean: born and grew up in the USA though|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no entries and such a weak suit, W would have been better off to lead partner's known 5 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so only a 2 imp loss although we don't know how the play went here|pg||
nt|gracelin: north could beat by return a trump when get in with his H7|pg||
nt|gracelin: i fact west has better not to lead HJ, but a small H if north split an honor, it's more likely he has both.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Thanks Gabor|pg||
nt|rodal f: B10 to come up by some fun?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|baldjean: +1 only? so declarer too kno chances in @h, despite East's bid|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|baldjean: took no chances*|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|psridhar: absolutely no logic to finesse for trump queen ...except for that foolish 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: the latter|pg||
nt|gracelin: from each 8-team group, only the top two will aualify for the finals.  |pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|twcho: so the score became closer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Quite an hard bid by S ar OR after showing @S and @H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: EW is probably playing precision too|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N by E failed in CR|pg||
nt|andyv:  like board 5, the key is to stay low as no game makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: a boring 3NT, probably.|pg||
nt|gracelin: qualify|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S was doubled in other room and made 3 overtricks on D lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: thie is one of the quarter final matches. 32 boards in 2 segments.|pg||
nt|twcho: Fanhua is not without chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: match is getting closer.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E may bid 3@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I think we have to guess at some of these, Jean|pg||
nt|gracelin: This HK team is the same that represent HK in the PABF in KL.|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: which strategy will you choose with North hand, bid @c or bid @h only, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: the slam in closed room is doomed.  6C has better chance but will also fail when the spade K is wrong.|pg||
nt|rodal f: No more mercie here by S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I don't think EW will be that ambitious here|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c shows a 6th club and no 4 card major|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may be slam minded after a raise.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N took S's double seriously|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: CR north responds 1@s to partner's opening 1@d, quite an interesting choice|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess so.  Wang in West is the sponsor of the Fanhua (Pan China) team.|pg||
nt|twcho: not sure why the 1@s bid is being alerted. Probably it is forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  this will be an easy make as the lead will give E three tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 3H bid gives declarer lot of information in the play.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ths is the last match of the RR from group B.  Both teams are unlikely to qualify for the finals starting tomorrow.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now the penalty will get almost as much as the Vul. slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: more so when East found a cue bid with his sub-mnmum|pg||
nt|andyv:  a third club would be useful for that endeavor|pg||
nt|vugraphzqz: 1s=bal|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gracelin: 4H would be a lucky make but I can agree East's pass|pg||
nt|twcho: and here south chose to rebid 2@d rather than showing his pointless @s suit|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 1@s is forcing|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT=0-4|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: N thinking... finally chooses to pass|pg||
nt|rodal f: But this time for a payout|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: China's national team is in group D, Hongkong's national team is in group C.  They lost to Ji Li last match.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may easily get S off to wrong lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gracelin: but with bad breaks in H and C, don't see how declarer can come to 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 32 teams in the 4 groups will play RR within the group.  Top two teams from each group will quaify for the 8 team fina in the two last days.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N must have paid his insurance policy to be able to bid 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 2S but south bid spade first.|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't like 3C on a defensive balanced hand.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c=5+@s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: defender is trying to set up cross-ruff opportunity.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Tommy Cho|pg||
nt|twcho: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello to you, Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Tommy and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and all specs|pg||
nt|twcho: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: North likes 2D more .|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2@dX is not too risky too|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead may hold declarer to 3D and 2 Aces for -3|pg||
nt|twcho: even making will lose 180|pg||
nt|gracelin: and north knows it's won't|pg||
nt|twcho: :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: defenders can win another 2H, 1S and 1C, so the contract will probably be made.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he will learn to be more cautious next time after he saw partner's 3S here.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is easier to make than 2S.|pg||
nt|twcho: but they can't stop at 1N I suppose|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may lose 4 club tricks if defenders play trumps whenever they get in.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: on the other hand, declarer can eatablish 2S, 3C and 2D for 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Well - it worked. Especially if he had got a @S lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 5H is ok even on spade lead.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: turning a likely plus score to a minus one.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice inference taken by declarer in @c suit|pg||
nt|twcho: some will open with east hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|gsper:  Right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East may also take the finesse incase south has two Duaminds only and two trumps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's unlucky for declarer that both SA and CK are in wrong places|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: Group A is the VIP group including sponsors and other VIP's.   |pg||
nt|twcho: This is an invitational event held in Shenzhen|pg||
nt|gracelin: South is better not to cover, but he doesn't know declarer has 5H|pg||
nt|twcho: 32 teams competing|pg||
nt|twcho: divided into 4 groups|pg||
nt|twcho: but passing is normal|pg||
nt|gracelin: they are Precisioners.  Maybe they need 4D to open 1D on 1st/2nd seat.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|twcho: welcome back|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer will try spade firs|pg||
nt|gracelin: first|pg||
nt|andyv:  can declarer partially strip hand down and lead @s to 10?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: top 2 teams of each group enter into the KO stage|pg||
nt|twcho: impossible to go down|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: Sun and Kang's misfortune on board 4 (800 in 4S X) gave away 12 imps.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: Patrick said earlier the main sponsor is playing at the other table |pg||
nt|gracelin: In this way the VIP's are assred of two berths in the final. |pg||
nt|gracelin: I came late but the Open Team has a useful lead.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, could be|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzgs: N very glad to X that contract :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: guess it's -1|pg||
nt|gracelin: the H finesse is risky and unnecessary, can go down if south has singleton D and 2 little H.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't think he has enough entry to do that.  Good idea|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: if declarer overtake S10 and draw south's trump|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mr. Chen |pg||
nt|gracelin: now club finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|gracelin: yes, Mr. SH Chen, a fine player himself.|pg||
nt|baldjean: tomorrow, or rather today meanwhile, is a holiday in Germany (reunification day), so I can sta up late|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender's 4th H trick is blocked, but declarer has only 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psridhar: may be there is a dbl dummy line for making 2@d but i expect it to go down and Aristos shd register a small swing here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|baldjean: stay*|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: declarer is playing for trump to break 4-2 so the long clubs can be enjoyed|pg||
nt|gracelin: the successful line if to play H to dummy to lead club, |pg||
nt|andyv:  the damage already done.  E will make 3@s and more imps for|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: now declarer will play his winners for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: then play East for Honor third|pg||

nt|twcho: we will see score correction soon|pg||
nt|gracelin: East's takeout to 5H is also questionable.  Partner's double of 4S indicated he held balanced hand rather than long minor.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|twcho: OK, corrected|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
nt|twcho: I doubt whether west shd correct to 2@d|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lagging team will need some more swing hands to have a chance.|pg||
nt|twcho: a potential slam hand here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Rana asks about 2@D, N explains that it can be 5431|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3C is the limit for NS here.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: guess it's 3.|pg||
nt|twcho: of course it is a poor slam but it will make with perfect guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, but always difficult to bis a slam after opponents open the bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW didn't enter the bidding last board after south opened 1NT.  So EW actuat\lly won 7 imps by missing the 4H game.|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d is probably multi|pg||
nt|gsper:  That is the drawback of having shown nothing about your distribution before the 5 level.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was here I told that E might are endplayed|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|gracelin: I meant at other table.|pg||
nt|twcho: showing either M|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin:  thought last hand a routine 3NT, but Shanxi reached 5C there to give the host team 10 imps.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fanhua has a chance to get a revenge here.|pg||
nt|twcho: Here, 1@d promise 3+|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d=@h suit (you can moue over the bid to see the explanation)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|twcho: 2NT is game try|pg||
nt|twcho: and asking|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h showing @s presumably|pg||
nt|gracelin: here East is definitely slam minded, but when West shows club rather than spade, he may settle down in game only.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3S and 4S may end the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: guess North will XX|pg||
nt|twcho: SOS|pg||
nt|twcho: mouse|pg||
nt|psridhar: can 5c make? i thk no|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N didn't quite get the auction he was hoping for|pg||
nt|twcho: they can find 43 fit now|pg||
nt|twcho: interesting for south to bid 1@h instead of 1@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS have 7-card in both majors, and breaking 3-3 n both.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS maybe playing Precision.  The 1H opening is limited to 15 HCP, so he can jump to 3C which is not forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: EW can make 3D|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will surely bid game with his maximum.  just a choice of game and I guess N will pick 4S|pg||
nt|twcho: 3NT has no chance|pg||
nt|twcho: with no entry and a void, North will probably retreat to 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: north can see that he has no entry for the long spade unless south has SA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 7H by dropping south H10, but 6H is a sound contract anyway.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW are young players based in Shenzhen while NS are veteran partners based in Beijing|pg||
nt|andyv:  his hand totally useless to S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not the best feeling at E by the lead now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|twcho: 3N will be making for EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 3NT so even -2 or -3 is not disaster.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but considering the status of the match, EW should really push harder when the opportunity comes.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if West is willing to compete to the 3-level, why not a Michael 2H over 1NT to tell his whole story.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: the bad news too soon :)\|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4h can make |pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: in reality, however, south maybe pushed to 4C if East bid a prompt 3D.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baldjean: probably 1 OT because of @h lead|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is 13-15 I suppose|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3C will play less well.|pg||
nt|rodal f: B12 where N ended 4@S-6 here. OR are at 4@DE|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @C to come?|pg||
nt|rodal f: So after B12 we got a new leader. 10IMP and Secure two in front.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: Shanxi Qinlian is from the province Shanxi.  The world ladies champion HL Wang used to play in this team.  Wang is from SHanxi. |pg||
nt|twcho: a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|twcho: east holding @sJ so there is no risk of going down here|pg||
nt|andyv:  if W plays the hand straight up, 10 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: Club ruff will beat this.  Very nice lead |pg||
nt|gsper:  It seems that NS do not play Precision.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't blame south for jumping to game.  He is entitled to play partner for at least one useful card.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  in CR, N did not bid immediately and came in with 2@d bid over S's dbl of 1NT |pg||
nt|gracelin: South was to bid after XX but tried 1H first to see if  it can escape a double.  |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gracelin: to bid 1S|pg||
nt|gracelin: the hand West went down in 3NT playing H honors to split, was made in closed room for 10 imps to Shenzhen.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldjean: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: might make 4 on D lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: I agree with that.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...give N just the Q@s instead of the @d and game is a high percentage|pg||
nt|gracelin: likely result is -3.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|psridhar: on @d lead 4h has chances but not 5c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: when the weak NT get doublem a durect suit bid at 2-level shows the suit plus a higher one, so 2H showed H+S.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|twcho: all the points are marked|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: north has @sQ so south must have all the remaining 10 HCP|pg||
nt|twcho: or 11|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gracelin: Precision handles these situation better :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: the hand will be siftly -1.  Credit must go to Lian for his brave action.|pg||

nt|rodal f: NS need to take away Es @C before a @S |pg||

nt|twcho: EW playing precision|pg||
nt|twcho: north hand is too strong to pass probably|pg||
nt|gracelin: not sure if NS can reach 3NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  on last 10 count hand, S simply bid 2 non forcing @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d partial for EW|pg||
nt|andyv:  @s partial for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Zhejiang Jinfan used to be one of the 3 leading bridge clubs in China.  However, their anchor pair Lian-Shi is playing on China Open Team this time.|pg||
nt|andyv:  same bid...so they don't see this as an invite hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: this 2S is NF so it's up to north to move on|pg||
nt|gracelin: on the other hand, if south bid 2D followed by a spade bid, it's forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may simply bid 3@c here|pg||
nt|twcho: aren't sure 1NT=15-17 or 16-18|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: W enquires of S their methods over opp NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: As specs might have seen W opened 4@H at OR and a push to come.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||
nt|twcho: which is very popular system in China|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT seems to be some sort of a D raise.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finding 5@C is rather impressive.|pg||
nt|gracelin: The China National team is going to Netherland for Bermuda Bowl in mid Oct.  This is their last tournament before the world championships.|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c probably a constructive to limit raise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: EW is cold for 4H but NS can sacrifice in 4S for -2 and a small profit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe West had played DA on the D lead and operaor made it DK.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|twcho: 2@c = both M or S+C|pg||
nt|gracelin: they just completed a 10 days training before this.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, in Shenyang|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure West will balance with 3S|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's my memory, too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will compete with 2@s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: will 2NT bury any possible M fit?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, especially comparing to this table.|pg||
nt|gracelin: now north clarify he has the blacks, but does south know which is longer?  seems not.|pg||
nt|twcho: judging from the 3@c bid, they don't|pg||
nt|andyv:  a pretty frigid 3NT missed|pg||
nt|twcho: anyway, west will make a game try|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: he would also bid it with singleton spade and an average hand.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: maybe north should find a bid over 1C at non-Vul.|pg||
nt|twcho: but his venture will not be successful|pg||
nt|gracelin: so south cannot move on either|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: possible, but he is facing a strong 1C opening so game is not in his planning.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if it's uncertain then I would rather be in 2S, at least it's one level lower.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: declarer will take 3S + 2H + 1D + 3C while defenders can only have 2H + 2C.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: CA takes, and 3 round of spade will follow|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably need a D lead to beat this and East found it.|pg||
nt|twcho: and I could tell you, all the spectators. Jacobs team didn't do silly things in the final segment|pg||
nt|twcho: So everything can happen in bridge|pg||
nt|gracelin: though declarer can still make it by winning DA, CA pitches D then SQ to force a cover, now S10 and home.|pg||
nt|twcho: he is not making a game try, but GF bid instead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: E needed to be reminded that he is dummy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: EW can make 3NT so if declarer can hold this to -3, the damage is not too big.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S looked like he overbid initially in CR in order to get to 5@c|pg||
nt|twcho: more hands you want to assign to your bidding, the more ambiguous it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  this lead may take all the guess work out of how to play the @d suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|twcho: a good lead again|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 1@d may be mean to be just some noise over the strong @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqz: 1nt=16-18|pg||
nt|twcho: tks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  some work to be done on this contract|pg||
nt|twcho: Rusinow lead by south|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: Q promise K|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gracelin: defender better knock out the HK now|pg||
mc|10|nt|gracelin: south can get his club ruff later but can't beat 3S still.|pg||
nt|twcho: this play is a bit strange|pg||
nt|twcho: a @c play seems more logical|pg||
nt|twcho: maybe we have missed something|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW should get to the 4@h game|pg||
nt|twcho: really don't know what is going on|pg||
nt|gsper:  Right.|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: yes; I would have used K@d too|pg||
nt|twcho: and the declarer line is incomprehensible for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless N found the great lead of the J from J9x of trump and S ducked with Ax:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 2 singleton K offside in this board|pg||
nt|gsper:  I am happy not to be S now.|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@c michaels?|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|mathat: 6 @s with @s lead 7 any other|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: An easy 4S here.  Even if south insist on playing Heart, 4H is also ok.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: it seems he has a guess of East holding J9 or 98.  But West may not cover SQ with K8x in case declarer has AJ10xxxx.|pg||
nt|rodal f: EW can hold this 2@S for = and a IMP. Let's see what happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: N/S open 4-card majors?|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, just a 3rd hand variation.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he Hongkong team is the team that represented at the last PABF and almost won a berth for the ermuda Bowl.|pg||
nt|gracelin: They are Sam Wan, Derek Zen, Dicky Lai and KF Mok.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play 16-18 1NT, So north might 1D here, unless he upgrade the hand to 16 HCP.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Heng Yuan Xiang crrent;y lying 5th in the group and 11 VP behind 2nd place.  They would have an outside chance to qualify with a big win here.|pg||
nt|gsper:  NS can sac in @D, but are not likely to find it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  N may be frozen out with the J10x of @cs|pg||
nt|andyv:  for all those who think 7@s is cold, close your eyes and don't look at the A of @ds in the W hand:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: yes, he did for his 4 honor tricks.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so he plays West to start with KJx rather than K8x.|pg||
nt|twcho: and CR east find the killing low @h lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: there will be a 15-20 mins. break before we start broadcast of R2|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: lets try again now |pg||
nt|gracelin: rehi|pg||
nt|baldjean: 7@s on a finesse here|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS might make 4H unless West finds a club opening lead.|pg||
nt|twcho: and the defense finds the perfect defense to set 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H by East should end the aucyion|pg||
mb|2D|nt|gracelin: guess it;s north that bid 1NT|pg||
nt|twcho: NS can make 4M if guessing the @s while EW can make 4@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: many would open 1NT with the East hand.  If it goes 1NT  3NT, south will lead a diamond for an easy make.|pg||
nt|andyv:  or on the E hand for that matter...a @s lead will set 7|pg||
nt|psridhar: that enterprising 1@h shd help |pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  looks like several slams make here|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS is conducting a typical Precision sequence.|pg||
nt|rodal f: The next board harder for some at OR|pg||
mb|3D|nt|twcho: of course, east is not done yet|pg||
nt|andyv:  W should lead a trump|pg||
nt|gsper:  Can S get rid of all 6 @Ds on the @Hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  he does have the entries |pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south wanted to bid 2.5 H|pg||
nt|twcho: i will bid 3@h with south hand|pg||
nt|twcho: with such powerful hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is an easy make|pg||
nt|gracelin: nice underlead but declarer can see no advantage not covering|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: West may just find the club lead under the bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: @s lead is quite aggressive|pg||
nt|twcho: but other lead is not appealing too|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, with as little as West has, they are cold for 10 tricks in D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but guess north's 4C will buy the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: NS aren't using kickback|pg||
nt|twcho: so 4N is a normal keycard Blackwood|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: unless north venture  2NT over 2H, possible at this Vul.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the impressive play by Li on last hand won his team 10 imps.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i guess not:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer should be aware that south has CA when club is not continued.|pg||
nt|twcho: 5@h denies the trump Q so N settle for the small slam|pg||
nt|twcho: he has two non-contradicting line to choose from: 1) setting up the @c; 2) cross-ruff|pg||
nt|gsper:  W seems to have taken the double as Lightner.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: with the partial fit in @s and strong trump holding|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, closer to 3H than 2H, with the spade fit.|pg||
nt|twcho: west initial pass and then double may show a better hand than a direct double|pg||
nt|twcho: over strong @c|pg||
nt|twcho: seems that 4@s is cold as there is no entry to dummy for @s finesse|pg||
nt|twcho: while if in 4@h, declarer has a losing option|pg||
nt|psridhar: Manna masterminding with @s support ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: As a spec told. Card lay well for NS at 4@H but hard to bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|baldjean: won't be bid though. probably 6@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: because the alternatives are not appealing either.|pg||
nt|andyv:  good lead to hold it to 4|pg||
nt|gracelin: Need to be more aggressive at fav. Vul. in order not to miss sacrifice opportunity with big fit.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|twcho: with both lines, you have to make sure your small trump ruff isn't being overruffed|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. EW I mean|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gracelin: we think the same  but you types faster.:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: seems West cannot double 2S as t/o, though he has denied to have spade with his 1NT resp.|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will regret|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  5N= pick a slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: West makes sure he gets his 3rd trick instead of trying to establish a 4th.|pg||
nt|gracelin: seem to lose 1S and 2C only.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|gracelin: don;t think declarer dare to take double finesse in trumps to risk a club ruff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  on @c lead, W could make 5|pg||
nt|gsper:  Asking for lead of dummy's suit.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 21HP but on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|baldjean: S does not even know about the @d slam lol|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: claim time|pg||
nt|andyv:  remember everyone that you are looking at all 4 hands predicting how 7 can be made...that part is easy....not so easy playing the hand|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|twcho: good prediction|pg||
nt|twcho: he has better to ruff the @s first|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: What message does @c6 convey|pg||
nt|twcho: west has some difficulty now|pg||
nt|twcho: with NS only bidding one suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzrp: last board coming up.. we restart in about 15 mins|pg||
nt|psridhar: silly not supporting @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: last board of the match.. 4 more rounds tomorrow|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: in my view, north is timid not to compete to 4C.  The Qx of D are bad, but if he had Qx in Heart, he should try for game after 3C.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|twcho: or else east can discard his @s|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: 3D is still makingm though.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer intends to take one more H, 2C and 2 trumps.  When CQ drops, declarer will make 4.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  quick claim|pg||
nt|twcho: he finds the solution. Maybe the @c6 helps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: of course declarer has more to think about.  He doesn't know CJ is on side.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|twcho: the @d discard has deprived declarer of one trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: His line is not witout risks, he plays the short club hand to be long in trumps, reasonable.|pg||
nt|twcho: he can discard a @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: Closed room EW overbid to 4H when East opened a Vul. Vs. none 2H with 4 pts.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: he must be from the school : Vulnerability is for children.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: yes, I think it's not wise.|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can't answer u all specs:) But nice with the comments. U make me at the alert.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gracelin: NS may end up in an unmakeable 3NT here.|pg||
nt|twcho: a great result for EW in CR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: why unmakeable|pg||
nt|twcho: seems cold|pg||
nt|twcho: 6 imps back|pg||
nt|gracelin: but only 7 boards left|pg||
nt|twcho: as CR NS buy the contract in 4@c|pg||
nt|twcho: double first or?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Another likely flat board, though the hands are not flat|pg||
nt|andyv:  good example of hand where doubling to increase the penalty is probably not the best policy if it misdirects the defense.|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: 1S  X  4S  5C will see south raise to 6C|pg||
nt|gracelin: or even 1S  X  3S  4C.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h which may be a problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems difficult for NS to lose 5 tricks in a @h contract|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS have lot of winners except the 4 Aces.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, definitely too strong for 4H|pg||
nt|gracelin: 6S for NS on D finesse.  probably not biddable.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: yes, with Heart 7-2.  I am just looking at the NS hands. :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: In the old days, one will cue 2D as a GF weapon.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 10 tricks with his won hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|twcho: sorry, own hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1H showed spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: score as of now is 34-31 in favour of Pal's... the winners will be decided after 7 rounds of RR, scores will be converted to VP scale|pg||
mb|4H|nt|gracelin: 3NT is reasonable but I will cue 4S with the south hand, and raise whatever minor suit north bids to slam.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand worth more than a 1@s bid over pd's double|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: will see another Precision action.  Don't thk they could stop in 3C afer the intervention.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: there are 4 natural losers and maybe another from a club overruff.|pg||
nt|twcho: not a hand EW want to see|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, wasted one board.|pg||
nt|twcho: time is running out|pg||
nt|gsper:  I would have expected E to break the transfer with that hand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  you want to double slam contracts for specific leads or because you are on lead in 7 with the Ace of trump |pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: west has no entry after declarer ducks one round|pg||
nt|twcho: and 3NT will make comfortably|pg||
nt|gracelin: The SF will start right after this match, or 80 minutes from now.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac , X or pass?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Never any X after the bidding so a sac or pass left|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgs: wow... |pg||
nt|gracelin: mabe 4C, still ok|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi Ji Chang Da gained 7 imps by competing to 4D in cloosed room on the hand West made 3S here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: opening lead problem|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: That pass made 5IMP for Secure and 31-19 it seems.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: West may shiftnow, which makes the hand an open bok.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is probably also playing precision|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would have overcalled 1S with the north hand though his tactic works.|pg||
nt|twcho: isn't that double of 2@h should promise black suits|pg||
pc|h7|nt|twcho: don't know what he will do if partner bids 3@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, north is probably prepared to correct 3C to 3D.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is tough one |pg||
nt|twcho: The ladies are more aggressive. CR NS are ladies|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is making.  Defenders can only take 3S, 2H and either a D or club.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't understand why East didn't simply raise 2S (too good?) but choose double to get his side to 3-level.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|twcho: 2@s likely make for EW|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: even thinking gives declarer useful info.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 6@Ds on as cards are? @D10 falling|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: guess this must be 12 imps to Shou Chuang.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer need to use SA as entry to finesse DK immediaely to dispose the H loserm and establish a liong one for spade discard.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the question or point made by specs is that the dbl may show @cs or some other card combination.  I agree and still think the E hand is worth a 2@s bid unless E is just trying to bail out|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  anyway NS won't have to worry about playing 3@h here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I would always take the low road when partner is a 3rd hand opening.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|twcho: 4 aces to lose|pg||
nt|gracelin: it's never a good idea to be pushed to game after a balancing action.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|gracelin: both have played for China Ladies team before.  In fact, Yen in closed room south, was a Venice Cup Champion in 2009.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: 3 imps to EW|pg||
nt|gracelin: though I have sympathy with north.  All he needs is Axxxx of trumps.  Maybe he could raise 2S to 3S earlier.|pg||
nt|twcho: but 4@s probably not a high expectation. only require to find partner with Axxxx in @s and it will be a nice contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|psridhar: trump lead = 6@d down 1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: the lead directing double backfires unexpectedly for North|pg||
nt|twcho: south is thinking that they have great fit in @s|pg||
nt|gsper:  Support double?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: After 2 rounds.. 1. Aristos(45) 2/3 Bimal Sicka and Priya's IV (44)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: bye.. c u tomorrow|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: yes then can pitch the ht |pg||
pc|dT|nt|twcho: better to overtake when @c10 appears|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: since he will lose 3 trump tricks with the 4-1 break, though declarer doesn't know yet.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: There where a lead that would have given a uppercut but would u specs have founded it? @CA an @C@C|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|h2|nt|twcho: and with his shapely hand, 4@s will be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|twcho: west has upgraded his hand a little bit with all his good intermediate spot cards|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|twcho: he can have one more entry to dummy then|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzqz: rest time|pg||
nt|vugraphzqz: break|pg||
nt|twcho: he will make 1NT if taking the lower route by rebidding 1N only|pg||
nt|twcho: so this is quite a considerable loss for their team|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|gracelin: well done indeed, maybe north should play DK on second Diamondplay.|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow |pg||

nt|twcho: The standard of female bridge players in China is very high because they always compete with the top male competitors in various events|pg||
mc|10|nt|gracelin: the speed of the D return dictates whether East has a singleton or doubleton, though West should not make use of that.|pg||

nt|baldjean: why throw away a @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: another partial battle|pg||
nt|gsper:  Typically yes, but there are a number of variants around.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in closed room West ovecalled 1H and was passed back to south who should regret his decision to reopen and get double for 800 at te end.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Welcome from Jaipur Club, Jaipur|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Current Standings(Scores in VPs) - 1. Team Secure (28) 2. Aristos(27) 3. Priya's IV(21) 4. Bimal Sicca (19)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: 2 nt minors |pg||
nt|gracelin: u to now Pudong has only won the grand slam hand on first board.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|5C|nt|gracelin: 5C is there, but does N knows south is so distributional|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H depends on the D guess.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: if south bids again, north will raise to game|pg||
nt|twcho: it has become rare to play 16-18 NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW needs to stop as low as possible.  Cards are not lying well for them.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, but they also open sound.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: D lead will help solve the issue|pg||
nt|twcho: but bd 9 is a potential pick up for them|pg||
nt|twcho: as 6@h is makeable|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer took club finesse ?|pg||
nt|twcho: no, only if he ruff @s before @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: the alert seems to indicate the opening is a multi, i.e. S + minor.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  looks polish|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: for teams not able to qualify for the KO, they will play Swiss Teams and the round robin result will be carry to the next stage for them|pg||
nt|gsper:  Multi? That kind of bid has a lot of names around the world.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if they do allow 5-4 for the opening, then maybe south should just pass 2S.|pg||
nt|gsper:  The W hand is a little problematic in a natural system. Not really strong enough for GF.|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the vanderbilt this year, both teams got to 7@d off the Ace of @d...in one room the holder of the Ace of @d doubled because he would be on lead if they ran to 7NT...in the other room, 7@d was not doubled because the doubler couldn't be sure |pg||
nt|andyv:  his partner might be on lead against 7NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: It was that balance by full speed and an ok result. But EW at least have 140 so not that bad.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|twcho: 40% actually will be carried forward to the Swiss|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer play SA to be on side, then he can discard dummy's 3rd D on good clubs.|pg||
nt|twcho: still he has to guess to finesse in @d or @s|pg||
nt|twcho: suppose S will return a @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: with all lower honors in defender hands and no spade lead, it's likely that north is holding SA, though not certain.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: we have 7 rounds x 12 boards each to decide the winner|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play advancer's change of suit forcing (1S here), thus the 2D continuation.|pg||
nt|twcho: I wonder whether 2@d should promise more than a bare minimum overcall|pg||
nt|gracelin: East took the wrong moment to create a swing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: 160 out as the min is a 4IMPer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: no, a non-reverse new suit just shows hand pattern and not promising more.|pg||
nt|twcho: he is not listening to you. :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but I agree with his decision. Ddown 40 with 6 boards to go, must do smething.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no matter how declarer struggles, he is not going to make this one.  though it could go -3, -2 is my guess.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|twcho: OK, tks|pg||
nt|twcho: EW has reached the normal 3NT|pg||
nt|twcho: only 6 top tricks in sight|pg||
nt|gracelin: I meant East|pg||
nt|andyv:  polish 2@s= 5@s and 4+ of other, not @hs|pg||
nt|gsper:  Muiderberg in Holland.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, this is a good hints|pg||
nt|gracelin: here south is sure to return a Diamond, but he doesn't want to play it too fast. |pg||
nt|twcho: does the tempo of playing back a @d creates UI|pg||
nt|twcho: he will then be able to establish his @c and not being overruffed|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 5. Indian Mavericks (15) 6. Pala(12) 7. CV Rao|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  W gave full values to all his kings|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rehi.|pg||
nt|andyv:  re|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gracelin: snce he is likely to have a natural trump trick, hw could also be genuinely consider foa a club shift.  All break-in-tempo maybe subject to UI.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: 3NT is the best contract here.  |pg||
nt|andyv:  Unknown in the US:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: declarer is hoping for 1S + 3D + 3C, but will be disapponted when club breaks 4-1|pg||
nt|twcho: Running score can be found at http://ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourResultText.aspx?tourid=1323|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders are ahead for 2S, 2H, 2D and 1C|pg||
nt|gracelin: but on first trick, it's allowed more time to think over the whole hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: the failing to return a D may make declarer believe south has DQ.|pg||
nt|twcho: but the leader to the next trick should not be so tempo sensitive as he is considering which suit to attack. This does not apply to the 2nd hand or 3rd hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: ruffing D didn't give opponent chance to pitch spade, so why the difference ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 8. KOSMOS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Lucas or Tartan 2 in UK|pg||

nt|andyv:  on board 9, the excellent @s slam was not reached in the CR|pg||
nt|andyv:  here 4@s seems pretty routine|pg||
nt|baldjean: unless E/W have ambitions. after W sgows @s fit E may get ideas|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after taking DA declarer should cash his winner before exit with HJ.  He still make if D is 6-2, but go down only 1 if D are 5-3|pg||
nt|twcho: so instead of one down, now he is 3 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Qualifiers... 1. Priyas 4 (152)   2. Bimal Sicka (151) 3. Team Secure (151) 4. Aristos (146)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: EW having along discussion after the disastroius start|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 1. Aristos (45) 2. Bimal Siccas (44)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr specs. I was a bit blind|pg||
mb|1D|nt|twcho: the result shows that declarer makes his contract|pg||
nt|rodal f: What will happen here? Quite a hard hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: Hi Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Patrick|pg||
nt|baldjean: shows*|pg||
nt|twcho: 1NT is perhaps the most complicated contract with both sides of about equal strength|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a routine 3NT for NS.  H lead will be threatening but declarer will prevail.|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so he must guess correctly at the end|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might a bit hard by N to go for a michaels que bid|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: our first slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: once West shows long spade, East cannot be stopped in game.|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4NT and one key-card will do the work.|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, that's the best line catering for making chance and only going one down at most|pg||
nt|gracelin: East has a lot of defense for his 4C bid.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go and thanks all.  See you guys tomorrow at the finals.|pg||
nt|twcho: a pedestrian 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: NS play prec. EW play std|pg||
mb|3C|nt|twcho: but it is just impossible for the defense to gather enough setting tricks as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|twcho: with @c 33 and defenders @h 44, nothing can hurt declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1NT is easy so national team will take over the lead after this board.|pg||
nt|rodal f: And here we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 3D prbably show a maximum weak 2S|pg||
nt|twcho: north opening is somewhat not complying iwth their CC|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: there will be four 16 boards matches today and 3 tomorrow to complete the 8 team RR in every group.|pg||
nt|twcho: @sQ lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: 3. Priya's IV (44) 4. Team Secure (35) 5. CV Rao (31) 6. Indian Mavs (27)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  E has a monster hand opposite the multi|pg||
nt|gracelin: while 3S shows a minimum 2S|pg||
nt|gracelin: likely|pg||
nt|twcho: OK, they don't play such lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6S is also a practical bid.|pg||
nt|gsper:  6@H is a reasonable contract, but both trumps an @Cs misbehave.|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will be happy to see both the Q@h and K@c are off|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: but 4@s probably make|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4S maybe making with the help of the 4C bid so 5C is a cheap save.|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, just threatening.|pg||
nt|twcho: CC states 5+ or 4414|pg||
nt|twcho: normally, Q ask for unblock of J or count if partner doesn't have it|pg||
nt|rodal f: No X from Arun?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: Guess north will not follow S10 if he doesn't have H10 together with the K.|pg||
nt|twcho: here @s7 must be an attitude signal|pg||
nt|gracelin: this pair use rusinow leads normally, or  Q from KQ combination.  K lead shows a very strong suit like this.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: 2@c is artificial|pg||
pc|d6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|twcho: does not promise @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: 3 round of D wll hold the contract to 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  reverse W's minor suit holdings and 6 would be in the picture|pg||
nt|baldjean: see?|pg||
nt|gracelin: South need to lead D originally to save the SK entry for a D ruff.|pg||
nt|twcho: 3NT would be easy here with the favorable lie of cards|pg||
nt|twcho: and CR EW has made the same contract comfortably|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  does this have any play?|pg||
nt|twcho: but this is a dull bd with 9 tricks, no more and no less|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: yes, but still need the trump Q to drop.|pg||
nt|gracelin: SQ ruff, of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  it will if you aren't in 6 and won't if you are|pg||
nt|andyv:  S could have made it easier on partner by playing the 8 of @d|pg||
nt|twcho: good manouvre by north to unblock the 9|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: Welcome Sridhar|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will be nice to see what OR do at this board. I'll try to look it up|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gracelin: 4 board to go for this round and the next match will start in exactly 2 hours from now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrp: a hopeless contract.. S will be worried about 4-2 trump break as well|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andyv:  E may take the hook now|pg||
nt|twcho: the @h shift has denied declarer chance to try @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: now even if clubs were not 3-3, West can be endplayed if he is the one long in club.|pg||
nt|twcho: EW is now playing in NS best fit suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: Thank You everybody for joining us today in the final Match of this Tournament....  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzgs: Goodbye All... Cikiciew! : : |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgs: :):):):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if @hs were 3-3 with K on side, this would be a cold slam|pg||
nt|twcho: in case south has AKJ7 instead of AKJ6, they will be able to enjoy 4 @h tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: but now defender still has an entry in H for the D ruff.  Declare need to duck HA.|pg||
nt|twcho: south correctly deduced that north is unlikely to hold @h10|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|gracelin: When north now lead back a small H, south should know north still has H10, or declarer will not play HQ earlier.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baldjean: not with K10xx @h in S|pg||
nt|andyv:  right....they had to be 3-3|pg||
nt|twcho: the other room NS has scored 10 tricks in @s contract|pg||
