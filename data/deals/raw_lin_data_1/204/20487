mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  I think 3@d = @d shortage and not a complete minimum|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  4@c and 4@h are control cue bids|pg||

mb|6S|nt|yorkbeach:  South is not really planning to bid a grand - he just bids 5NT to announce that the partner has all they key cards in case North can then count 13 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznd: north giving some serious thought|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6@s is not a great spot but it appears to be makeable as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  North has shown his hand very well and so has no reason to disturb 6@s|pg||
