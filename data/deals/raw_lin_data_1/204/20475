mc|8|nt|yorkbeach:  the reason why we do not have any comparitive scores|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is that scoring is against all the other results (not just one table)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North has real @d this time|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  even as a passed hand, a 4@c splinter would be a bit much on the West hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT = 4-card @s raise|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  South knows North is very short in @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but his red honours look defensive and he has no ruffing value|pg||
nt|othered1: A good tactic against limited ambiguous opening bids is to attack  them aggressively.  I find it more profitable than getting pushy over a strong @C.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|yorkbeach:  as they are playing with screens, North might not know that South hesitated over 4@s|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  @s finesse fails|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if (as he does) East has the @dA-J and a doubleton @c, declarer may be able to discard a @c on a @d|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|othered1: West has lots of values -- an opening bid by some standards -- but the 1N rebid seems forced by the misfit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  might raise to 3@d in case East has extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  but follows th policy of staying low on a misfit|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: opposite a sound opener, west may be worth another bid, perhaps a simple raise to 3@D.  But west knows the partnership style . . .|pg||
