nt|gluckenval: 5M too, and the openings bid at level 2 are in the range 10-13|pg||

nt|paulg:  with Roland and Bill|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Both methods have  plusses and minuses.|pg||
nt|paulg:  which, with all due respect, is not as intimidating as doing it with Larry Cohen|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|hantveit: probably 1nt-p-2kl-p-2h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Zmud99: of course Piekarek didn't open 3@D|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|stoffers: good lead, down now as declearer played 'safe' |pg||
nt|santyclz: That seemed more likely until the continuations.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjr à tous|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|psyck: we seem to be missing the auction other room, but it cannot have been as good as here anyway|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|runnerup: shortage of entryes made this +1 and it looks very normal|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hantveit: anyones guess|pg||
nt|santyclz: It looks as if we're in for some imaginative bidding this round.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ace to prevent the overtrick.|pg||
nt|hantveit: well, the good thing is that this gives us action already from the start. they stopped in a normal 1N in closed|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: it is about a 30.5% slam|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe 2H was a kind of TO ? but I have to emit, i have never heard about such a thing before|pg||

nt|penseur9: great defense|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|2H|an|h and minor|nt|hantveit: 6h is on withouth club lead|pg||
nt|hantveit: 20-10 points, so should stop|pg||
nt|penseur9: 4@H N/S seems the max here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|stoffers: Nunes had to have exactly doubleton for playing the ace to be wrong, + 0-3@h ofcource. Unlucky by Gromov!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: about the lead of the italians, they have a 3 pages of supplementary sheets for their slavinsky leads... i.e. with 83 the lead is rev. (small from 2 cards)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but not in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  awkward hand for North .. 2NT?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Jacobs|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||

nt|penseur9: hi David|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|paulg:  my request to be flown out to the warmer climes of Monaco has been refused, but still a pleasure to see some world-class players|pg||

mb|p|nt|psyck: @d for no loser was about 62% & of course need @s fin...|pg||
nt|psyck: for 1 loser i meant|pg||
nt|stoffers: declearer will have some pressure on 5 rounds of spades, and need to find the Q@c to make this|pg||
nt|hantveit: but if we look on lousers, there is 12 tricks. (24-8-4=12 tricks)|pg||
nt|hantveit: losers|pg||
nt|santyclz: 12 tricks in @hs, unfortunately e-w have 2 first.|pg||
nt|paulg:  hi Herve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: ah ok|pg||
nt|ady: hi Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: There's 2 session in this Patton - Session A (afternoon) and Session B ( tonight ) - Each session play 4 matches of 8 boards - Session A and B best teams will qualify for tomorrow |pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Roland welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|psyck: hi|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess 2@h is constructive here, so EW probably play weak jump shifts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hello|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hearts and another, Bill?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  W has to find @d switch now|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if they take it|pg||

pc|d3|nt|hedyg: the last CC we have for NS is : http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  5@c is a little precipitous|pg||
nt|hedyg: they have made some changes since..|pg||
nt|hedyg: no CC for EW|pg||
nt|paulg:  welcome back Hedy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: they are from Genova, Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Paul :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 3NT would probably have been the choice of most, second choice 3@s|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|runnerup: some chancce for -2 now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the match is very close, so each and every imp counts|pg||
nt|hantveit: a wash, and next|pg||
nt|kjadams: close game here.   Spade lead should scuttle it.|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi CK and John-wlc|pg||
nt|kjadams: Thanks ara|pg||
nt|kjadams: 1 imp for Bonori on 1st when declarer opted for a heart finesse rather than a double squeeze.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Both lines look close to even money|pg||
nt|paulg:  Nunes also senses problems for them|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Hi Roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But I guess H and another, or H + minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  i wonder if double was not penalty, as South looks too strong for 3@s opposite a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hervé!|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Hervé|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 3 world champions at table|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|psyck: work on minors or ruff @h?...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand, I can't see any line to avoid a loser in each suit, so down 1 will be best case, and down 2 seems possible.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not the best lead on this hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|gluckenval: cut & paste from their leads... i.e.: K6532 = 2; K653 = 6; 9832 = 2; 983 = 9; 92 = 2;|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I don't count|pg||
nt|Zmud99: 2 in NS....and 1 is operating :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: Fantoni can tell from the bidding that they have a fit problem|pg||
nt|penseur9: if you don't Roland... where do I stand :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Zmud99: Standings after Round 8/9 : 1) Gladysh 140  2) Zimmermann 138  3) White House 138  4) Ventin 122  5) Marill 120  6)  Vainikonis E  117  7) De Botton 114  8) Welland  112  9)  ...|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Vainikonis  110  10 ) Zaleski  88    First 2 will play a final of 3X16 tomorrow |pg||
nt|runnerup: west has already shown 1 ace -so time to give ruff -wd|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni can also see the @sAK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator is?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: most lines work here...|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sex change operation? it reads Frederic in his/her profile|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 hearts and 4+ in a minor|pg||

nt|paulg:  tough start for East-West|pg||

mb|1D|nt|runnerup: how many @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in these short matches of only 8 bds when you lose 800 the match is practically over|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  how many @s rather :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: i mean west bid -5 @d is even possible -some do |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  your bets? 4@d vs 4@s? higher stakes?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I'm a 4 bidder both ways...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even 5@d with indicated @s lead look quite fine|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they play real bridge, not double dummy|pg||
mb|d|nt|hantveit: a cold seven as we can see, they stopped in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mathat: 2 @c and 2 @s -3|pg||
nt|ady: who ever plays goes down|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ybob: sry @C ruff|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @h -is 2 down -@d ruffs -3nt ns |pg||
nt|stoffers: 3 or 4@s Nunes?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2H is a bit weak for my taste|pg||
nt|santyclz: 16 top tricks.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ybob: @D ruff|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6 losers only, strong suit, and a H in partners suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: kalispera Manos :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H relay, at least invitational|pg||
nt|penseur9: slam possible here I'd think|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Remember that the 1@s bid by Nunes shows a good hand.  Lessor hands are opened 2@S.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ybob: hard to plat 3NT when opps bid 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 10-13, unbalanced|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ybob: play|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: 4 @d is a winner -but you cant bid it anymore|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 10-13 (good 9) 5+.|pg||
nt|stoffers: bad splits here, but will bring home 10 tricks easy|pg||
nt|gluckenval: obviously, in 3rd seat and not Vul they are undisciplined :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: should North take control of the bidding here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hantveit: still, they should be able to find it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is like the previous hand ... North has all the wrong cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And this will go down a large number of 50's ... should East have hit it?|pg||
nt|penseur9: the dealer must be as tired as the players at this hour :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H might have made|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  Some pairs rebid 1NT with the West hand, but never in France |pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: the moment of truth|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Drum-roll, please...|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks to go -1 ok|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lead something and claim, please! 13 more boards to come|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5S|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ybob: only @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|runnerup: North saved -and no @d lead -so winner|pg||
nt|hantveit: 6C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think West has to balance at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ybob: for that was better bid 4@D over 3NT|pg||
nt|hantveit: 7H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Many people who play 2/1 reserve a 3@h rebid on this auction for a solid suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner holds xxx in dia, it is still a 52% chance to make. dia 2-2 or dia q drop|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Tez :) welcome|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: I don't think he can double 3@D, partner did not have to be this strong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hantveit: might bid 6d on the way|pg||
nt|hantveit: wereas Multon will be given the honor to bid 7H|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  not without risk of course|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hantveit: north might be afraid a pas on 6D...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|stoffers: Well judged by Gromov to double the third time (pass forcing), if he had passed i am sure dubinin had bid once more. That said 5@d or 5@h is very unlucky not to make|pg||
nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||
nt|stoffers: well, this is 2 off|pg||
nt|stoffers: Needed club-club lead and ricing with A@s to get it three down, tough to do that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, I agree ... too tight at imps|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|stoffers: -3 now i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: Short of trumps, good defence|pg||

nt|hedyg: as they say cinquanta il pezzo|pg||

pc|c5|nt|santyclz: Well done.|pg||

nt|mathat: thinking to retern @d?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And as it's turned out, probably very difficult for the defence to find the way to beat this three tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Basically West at some point had to cash the 3 major suit tops, and get out with @CJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||

mb|1C|nt|psyck: a hand that only Roland would find interesting here|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hantveit: it should not be bid either I think... what do you guys mean?|pg||
nt|hedyg: N wishing she had made a bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 1@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
nt|tez: if they play 1@c 1@d 1NT(May have 4 card major) ...they could stop in 3 NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: on  2, the CR in 2@H +2 for 7 IMPs Las Girafes|pg||
mb|2S|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: seven is only on if no club lead, trumphs breaking 3-2 and heart 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry was checking why 3NT was -3 last hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if 1@s is diamonds or 3 controls?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|caruga: un numerone|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 2S here looks like a transfer to clubs, with 2N showing an accept of a club game invite.|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed, that was the only swingy hand with the slams & games on other boards being fairly strightforward|pg||
nt|kjadams: 10 tricks for the taking with the club Q dropping.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand this one ... 5@C is the spot, NOT 3NT|pg||
nt|penseur9: *les...|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C unlucky for e/w   spade ruff|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
nt|hedyg: unfortunately we have no system card or CC for EW|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, so no game makes ... VERY tough hand :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Tomorrow we will start broadcasting at 14.03|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How about 4@S?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No 4@S is hopeless.  Everything is hopeless|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Their best chance is probably to get to 5@C and hope that the defence mis-steps|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  can in fact make    diamonds can be ruffed out  king an extra discard|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think it can ... there aren't enough entries.  |pg||
mb|3N|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
nt|psyck: hmmm, i spoke too soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||
nt|santyclz: Only 11 top tricks. |pg||
nt|hantveit: that is a 0,25X0,68x0,53 % (plus stiff spade j)|pg||
nt|hantveit: I think 5 in spades, 4 i dia, 2 in H and one in C|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: no science -so that even if 2 @s are off -who guesses to lead that|pg||
nt|paulg:  they could have played in 3NT anyhow ... 3@d with @dxxx was not a great description of the hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, maybe there are ... I'll take that back|pg||
pc|h6|nt|penseur9: fortunatly 3NT is a south lead, might have a chance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, they've reached a reasonable contract, but of course Nunes was not going to lead a spade into a bid and raised suit|pg||
nt|ady: take 8 tricks cheapest|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|gluckenval: here we are...|pg||
nt|stoffers: very important trick coming up..|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes ofcause in good day you can meke this |pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|paulg:  my kibitzers are certain that 1@s is conventional, even if they cannot agree on the specific meaning|pg||
nt|penseur9: are we seing the right bidding here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are, they overbid a little|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: Yes...|pg||
nt|penseur9: this contract a a slight chance but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would not make either|pg||
nt|penseur9: will Fantoni lead trump here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done by Angelini to make 5@D|pg||
nt|penseur9: yes very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he got a heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then easier, spade lead much better for the defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North did not overcall in the other room, a bit strange|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How much does one need to overcall I wonder|pg||
nt|penseur9: I suppose that both rooms bidding can qualify as surprising... possibly strange :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni is  1 in the world, that also applies to (lack of) pace :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: he might opt for a @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=103  Fulvio Fantoni|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Nathalie fell asleep|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's past midnight in Monaco|pg||

nt|santyclz: To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c is (super) gazzilli for F-N?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  agree. 2@d would have been better for NS|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  but will W pass?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, he did|pg||
nt|santyclz: click on the board you wish to review, and click Next to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|santyclz: Other Table, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 14-17 with @c or 17+ any|pg||
nt|hedyg: but also unbalanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay, 2@H= @H+@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  fantoni-nunes play more 8- and 9-card major fits in 3NT than any other expert pairs I've seen|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|psyck: the pass asked for the redouble|pg||
nt|psyck: Twisted Swine type runouts after NT doubled maybe|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 times trumph, but what if south covers the second trumph?|pg||
nt|paulg:  less advisable here of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: so Fantoni has shown minimum for his 1@H opening 5@H 4@s and refused the invite by Nunes|pg||
nt|penseur9: this one will play better... time for coffee|pg||
nt|ady: trying a@H?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The one thing he better not do is draw two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nunes will "know" @HA is not cashing ... no Blackwood|pg||
nt|ady: why lead an ace then   could have been club void?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: 5@H and 4@c of course! sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: as we can see, no way to game now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he had to lead something.  And neither of the singletons is at all attractive|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  looks like one down with this lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but defence has to cash its tricks now|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks fairly easy for the defence to let 4@s make|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @c return, declarer will have his work easier|pg||
pc|dA|nt|psyck: NT Runouts: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/SwineTwisted.html|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c could have been @c & @d here if they play that style|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hantveit: maybe just play dia now, and give away that ruff|pg||
nt|mathat: if duk the @d meda 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 3NT looks a lot better than 4@H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: 4th  seat 2@h..intermediate i think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: it is not an obligation to play in a suit contract just because you have a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And he might have drawn the conclusion that the @CA was more likely to cash, otherwise, East might have fished around for a grand slam or maybe used Exclusion Blackwood|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sfoxa:  seems better for defence now|pg||
nt|runnerup: west was active this time -ew has only 19 points and he was willing to double ns on 2-levelcan be costly |pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|gluckenval: all in trsf for them, 1@C -> 1@D/@H = 4@H/@S, so 1@S = no 4M|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|hantveit: 2 club losers and 2H|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|runnerup: this can be a little swing -because ew can make 9 tricks in @s -with good guesses -which looks normal declareplay|pg||

nt|runnerup: well you cant do this in every board -otherwise youll have heart attact very soon-down 1 by uppercup|pg||
nt|paulg:  i did presume that West might show some support!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  at least they have ones|pg||
nt|hantveit: anyway, a big lead now for Zimmermann after only 5 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least we agree!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
mb|4H|nt|santyclz2:  I wonder what the x was, majors?|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 imps per hand in average|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks like, but what about points?|pg||
nt|paulg:  double by West is pass or correct|pg||
nt|penseur9: 1@C strong but west whit 4 points could lead to problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: some east migth open here -althougth east has a 3-suiter not suitable fos muidenberg |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think I might have tried to bid my clubs|pg||
nt|tez: what do you bid with West hand?pass?2@h 3@h?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|psyck: hmm, operator updated 4@s to -1|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe Zia did not cover 3rd @d or something|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was: pass if your suit is @H , else bid your suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: they really likes to bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Again e has done a lot of bidding on 2 hcp.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makeable with @c lead and guessing @h right|pg||
nt|penseur9: their are no on line results available on line unfortunatly|pg||
nt|tez: hi all:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: perhaps Nunes had his moment for 2 @d -now more difficult |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  natural one down now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: this seems to be a couple down after @d finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would pass if i had no other bidding cards|pg||
nt|penseur9: hi Tez, welcome|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz2:  E-w gained 3 imps on bd four to shoot into the lead!|pg||
nt|runnerup: but like you see -no mistakes -very good lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulg:  i thought it would go 1@h (1@s) 3@h (3@s) all pass|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: with likely 3 minor suit losers  needs spade finesse   and luck with hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  will West underlead his clubs to get a spade ruff?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!|pg||
nt|hedyg: what else can he do?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S is dummy, he can see it is his only chance |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hantveit: not finish in closed yet|pg||
nt|hantveit: should we stall this table a bit maybe?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, that 6@C was too much for my pc :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fantoni will be considering three hearts to pitch his club|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: 28 IMP swing, that's all|pg||
pc|hK|nt|penseur9: ha ha ha|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz2:  Now is not the time to get busy on defense.  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  though, they all are accustomed to struggle till the last trick|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are lucky to see one more @c and @hJ by S - not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so he paused|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Well, he needs the @Sqj doubleton, he knows the @D distribution, what does that say about the rounded suits?|pg||
nt|mathat: @c disc|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes disc|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mathat: cut the communication|pg||
nt|paulg:  a scissors coup|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the CR Angelini in E didnt open and EW gave declarer a bit of help in his 3@d contract|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|mathat: thinking  the dpl finesse @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, next board|pg||

nt|paulg:  i can understand not opening, with side 4-card major and a void, and as Fantoni has shown declarer did not need much help|pg||
nt|hedyg: want to swap?|pg||
nt|paulg:  have you seen my bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..no|pg||
nt|paulg:  another challenge for EW|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: I'm in favor  of their moving right along.|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S not bid in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Virtually cold grand slam now|pg||
nt|ady: with the spade diamond 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Easy 4@H game here|pg||
nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
nt|hedyg: playing 3 rounds of @c on lead sure helped|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
nt|hantveit: I would not open 2s in south. Too strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Let's follow their methods. Bill will explain|pg||
mb|3C|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
nt|hantveit: partner dos not need much before 4s is on|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
nt|paulg:  west forced to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 1@S = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@D = natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C = natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks pal|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Happy to be of service|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how we would cope without you|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  is that a weak two or a constructive two bid? Looks far too good for a weak 2@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is a vulnerable 2nd seat weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When we explain our version of Fantunes to our opps, we generally say: "our system is more natural than yours"|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3S or pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|santyclz: Seems like a book vulnerable weak 2 to me.  The 6/4 adds to the value but still...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But now the difficult part, cuebids, Turbo, whatever|pg||
nt|ady: so far seems very natural|pg||
mb|4H|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|santyclz: The Kaplan and Rubens hand evaluator agrees with you.  12.55 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=ak10972+42+7+10652|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c probably a min balanced hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s seems to be forcing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Vs slam you dont lead the king, because partner is to overtake it...Have to lead small from Kx|pg||
nt|stoffers: Thats a free tip actually :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  To see how a board was played at the other table with the download version, click "Movie", then "(other) Room",|pg||
nt|runnerup: cards very unfrienly here -so many down ,but normal try|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  click on the board you wish to review, and click âNextâ to step through the play. With the Browser version click |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may well be repeated next door|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  âOther Tableâ, click on the board and use the single arrow in the bottom right to step through.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As you predicted...|pg||
nt|mathat: dbl promises @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: punishing his pd for overcalling?|pg||
nt|paulg:  east seems to have the same understanding of double to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: this is not the bestlooking for west -but good guess @d saves the day -and luck +guess in @c also|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is possible that East would have bid 4@h over a simple raise, but this has no real play on this layout|pg||
mb|4N|nt|hedyg: i can hear Tamburelli swearing into his beard all the way here!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: I dont think north would overcall with j6th only red so Bakkeren should get this one right|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sfoxa:  lack of @c cue is obvious now|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Fulvio could find it.... |pg||
nt|stoffers: They found out the @c problem in the quebidseries, but so did Fantoni i guess|pg||
nt|stoffers: The questionable bid here is 3@d, i suggest 2nt with all those soft cards. Queens and Jacks plays good in NT |pg||
nt|mathat: fantoni take the Q @c and play 3 R @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are we in Turbo-land now?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sorry, I only explain the natural bids|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|penseur9: bonsoir henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi hi|pg||
mb|7C|nt|hantveit: give partner one more spade, and 4S is on. with only 8 points. and partner might have much better cards withouth investigating for 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he REALLY didnt like the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  16 boards in this segment. Last one segment|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i must admit 4@H was unexpected for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pls explain 7@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsc: bonsoir Henri|pg||
nt|bjacobs: My guess is this|pg||
nt|ritong: last time fantoni did that, he got ruffed on the lead  perhaps he will make a remark about that displaying the dummy|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's 4@C confirmed 5-5 shape, and North's 4@H was as cue bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South cued 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|penseur9: 3@D should make but possibly 3@H by E/W might have also|pg||
nt|tez: 9 imp to Levini|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North showede even key-cards with 4NT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mathat: now -2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And South knew that all the key cards were there, so cued 5@D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|psyck: apparently: 3@C min, 3@D extras & no short (that u admit), 3@H low single, 3@S middle, and 3nt high is common in Sweden.|pg||
nt|ady: 7NT better    some chances if if South did not have J@C   or if if clubs 5-0 with the present holding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ritong: oops|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think west overbid, but EW were under more pressure with Nunes' 3@d call |pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the other room 2@d made it easier, although South may not have been certain of real diamonds opposite|pg||
nt|penseur9: wow, only one IMP difference for last board|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And 7NT is NOT better from North's perspective, because he doesn't know about @SJ|pg||
nt|penseur9: last of the day here...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or @SQ for that matter ... so he went for the suit play|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 4@H game is easy here|pg||

nt|ady: 7@C  may have had problems without Queen and jack of spades|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|psyck: interesting convention, helps hide declarers cards if getting to 3N i suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: 1NT or 2@s on Gromow now?|pg||

pc|h9|nt|psyck: as of now at least|pg||
nt|pfbr: hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c dbl was not for penalty|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: corrected to down 3 ok|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:) Ty Hedy:)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wstuart: duck a @C and hope 2@D cash - high xruff after that|pg||
nt|wstuart: If the def leads trumps to prevent that, life could get interesting.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, trump leads best|pg||
nt|stoffers: But, partner had 5-4 and not 5332 so no problem this time|pg||
nt|hedyg: X over 1NT= same strength|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sfoxa:  your appearance should be marked :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: a safe contract as the card lie|pg||
nt|hantveit: gave a trick at the lead so 11 now it seems|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wow, they really overplayed it in the closed room!|pg||
nt|tez: neck n neck now:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: double by N showed strength|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw you all like 2@c by W???|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  i would say it is an aggressive double of 1NT ... we tend to want a point or two more in the UK|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|hantveit: 13 tricks in 4S at the other table. Spade J lead?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would have passed the redouble ... it does not show a desire to play in 1@H-XX for me|pg||
nt|penseur9: very hard to predict final score yet|pg||
nt|penseur9: thanks Roland you beat me to it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because I am 6 hrs ahead of you|pg||
nt|penseur9: I beleive they will restart tomorrow at 2pm local time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill's comments even faster as he is a further 9 hours ahead|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  EW will gain an imp here - important for them|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stoffers: nice splits here, and 110 or 140 incoming|pg||
nt|ritong: i try to procced more discreetly usually:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A couple of alert specs tell me that 6@C can make on a spade lead also. Complete cross-ruff and score last trump en passant. Well spotted|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tez: we play penalty dbl after rdbl|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt make the 2@c bid look any hotter to me|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: What's the Saturday weather like, Bill? And the lottery numbers please|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  looks like it is going one down, which it a little close for comfort|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|tomi2: sry guys, get some uniformed information "no" but I asked for someone who knows the EW agreements and not his own ones ;)|pg||
nt|stoffers: that 7 of spades is gonna win defence a trick soon..|pg||
nt|santyclz: Played by w, @c lead.|pg||

nt|stoffers: No, sry :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes|pg||
nt|hantveit: Stabile played spade K when east played low spade from table? very strange|pg||

pc|dA|nt|wstuart: http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/News/News/Monaco-Welcomes-the-International-Bridge-Elite|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps a penalty card?|pg||
nt|hantveit: a little break here now, so closed can speed ut ahead|pg||
nt|santyclz: The closed room seems to have disappeared.|pg||
nt|hantveit: maybe, but then it must have been dropped at the table...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz2:  Friendly hand. Declarer could easily lose control if things weren't breaking so well.|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the last deal of this match|pg||
nt|psyck: 2 more matches in this session|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: cashing side winners now to prepare xruff|pg||

pc|d4|nt|paulg:  this time last year I was playing with a Scotsman who has lived in France for the last 30 years ... it became clear to me that we lived in different universes when it came to bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What else would you like to know?|pg||
