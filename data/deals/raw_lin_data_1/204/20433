nt|tomi2: hi|pg||
nt|stoffers: I think EW did well not to double this, it will make due to lack of entries in dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzsb: Hi Chris|pg||
nt|stoffers: One way of defeating it is if declearer plays a @h ut to the queen, and Helness duck! |pg||
nt|tomi2: I thnik none of them had any reason to double|pg||
nt|stoffers: That will give him a price of some sort i bet. Another option is @H J at trick 2 ofcource|pg||

nt|othered1: How would you possibly coverafter south opened 1@S?  do they play canape?|pg||
nt|tomi2: win in dummy and play the queen (hope east coveres kx) or win in hand and lead towards dummy (hoping west jumps in with hx)?|pg||
nt|tomi2: it sometimes can be right to jump in even with ax to avoid an endplay later|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Neither would work here?|pg||

nt|gluckenval: def. borderline... I really don't like so much when I'm going 3 off... I think a good sacrifice bid should be for 1-2 off, no more|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|ybob: of course not|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|psyck: for 2 reasons...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|stoffers: 4@s was one off if Dubinin played @h at an early stage, 5@c is makable because K@c is always single :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  strong @c in action - E is entitled to bid knowing partner has 17+|pg||
nt|runnerup: now west will overbid -yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|gluckenval: 5@C makable only playing @CK stiff.... hard to find laso after the dbl |pg||
nt|gluckenval: also|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no miracle happens here, I suppose|pg||
nt|stoffers: The lead indicates sout to have AKQ there...|pg||
nt|stoffers: i bet he gets it right|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nunes should have played the A@s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer realized 4@s is one off, but how it helps him with guessing @c right?|pg||
nt|stoffers: WQell, he doesnt know its off, because @h could be 4-2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, void in @c makes 4@s palyable, too|pg||
nt|stoffers: But he has a strong indication to play North for the exact hand now, he needs those highcardpoints to have a t/o double|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: i think this was a good guess |pg||
nt|gluckenval: if South has really AKQ, North sould have the others hcp ... North vul. doesn't bid dbl with 10 hcp, better wait dbl from p |pg||
pc|hK|nt|gluckenval: should|pg||
nt|runnerup: east was very active (aggressive-if you want .bidding 2 @s)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I should admit, @s position appeared very unlucky for declarer - both honours offside|pg||
pc|h7|nt|psyck: 1...as it is his fav 20-20....2nd) as it can occasion his unfav 'f' conv by north|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  dbl = points (penalty), pass = points as well (ready to play 1nt dbld)|pg||

nt|ybob: EW can win 12 trick in @D |pg||
mb|1C|nt|sfoxa:  wondering about the reason|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|psyck: it can often be difficult for operator to get all the cards right, when they play fast or cards not seen clearly, play may have been slightly different in the 4@s -1 than shown|pg||
nt|wstuart: EW might get active and will regret finding their otherwise good @S save.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seems EW play that 3M shows 5 card in the other majors to have the strong hand playing the suit contract in case there is fit|pg||
nt|ybob: probably 3@S shows 5@H GF ( not alert )|pg||
nt|tomi2: north could not bid 2@C, this would have shown both majors in their methods|pg||
nt|stoffers: 3NT here, nothing much to it really- Danger is getting to high in @d|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@S is a fit - jump, I think, however, West generally will have a 4th @D for this.|pg||
nt|stoffers: That 3@d bid might lead them offtrack|pg||
nt|stoffers: and it did..|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|psyck: few play FJ with 3 card supp, or may have stretched to hinder strong @c bidding|pg||
nt|tomi2: souths 1@C could be 2 cards on many weak nt hands or 0+ but then he must have 18+, thats unlikely|pg||
nt|stoffers: vs 5@d Fantoni needs to lead K@c tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: I'm pretty insistent in my partnerships of having at least 4 of thee anchor suit (partner's suit) for a fit jump.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@s = 0-11, no 4 cards in @s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wstuart: It make s avery bid difference in these competitive auctions to know what the caliber of your fit(s) are.|pg||

nt|imp_jan: another slam|pg||
nt|imp_jan: missed in the OR|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@H by *west* is very good.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: they might get to it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 6 n|pg||
nt|wstuart: by east is pretty decent|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now 4 and 3...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: depends on romanski's decision over 1@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ritong: or the equivalent|pg||
nt|stoffers: he shows interest, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, if NS doesn't go high next door, board  13 is a coffee-board )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  here Fantoni did his best to avoid @s guessing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  experts show themselves in pecularities|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|wstuart: How many @H will he bid?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, good chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This will likely propel west into bidding some more.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: to be honest, i wld have bid 4@h as well as east ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 4@H - it should show a good distr hand but not particularly strong in HCP (wihch would have started with 2@S).|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly|pg||
mb|2S|nt|imp_jan: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has everything to try that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4n, whatever that is (RKC?, general slam try?)|pg||
nt|ritong: especially @c KQx|pg||
nt|wstuart: Likely RKC for @H.|pg||
nt|wstuart: East will think his @S void is useful, so will make a response above 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: he has three keys, otoh|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|wstuart: I don't know what their methods are - typical is 5NT is 2 and 6m is 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: with a void in that suit, but there are many variations which are both reasonable partnership specific.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazing 5@S by north btw|pg||
nt|stoffers: Slam makes here, but hard to bid and quite lucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has some play but ,,|pg||
nt|hedyg: precision 2@c= 10-15 5+@c +4M or 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This fits with DOPI - Double = 0,  Pass = 1, 5NT = 2, 6@C = 3, which is what he has.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Would they bid the same way if dubinin had QTxx in @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Many pairs choose to play DEPO at 5 of their suit and beyond (D = Even, Pass = Odd)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wd ew, especially by apolinary kowalski|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Kras ... found an amazing lead against 4@S in the other room, small club!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: Suppose south lead a low @D - would you play low or put up the @DK as declarer?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Optomistic invite with all those soft values.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|runnerup: if this makes leader chances again|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree Joe, those red queens dont look good opposite a hand with the black suits|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  Nunes did well!|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Souith has shown the good hand -- 18+ with @S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|sverjohn: another support on Qx?|pg||
nt|othered1: double should prevent NS from having a slam misadventure|pg||
nt|othered1: Here, north may eventually support @S or bid 3N. But it's a different situation from the earlie QX support game bids earlier.|pg||
nt|hantveit: 5C, 4S and 3N is on. The X on 3D is taking away their slam chances, but also offeres an increased chance to stop below slam|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 5club will go down with 3 times dia I think|pg||
nt|othered1: south seems to have an obvious 3@H bid, so perhaps it would have meant something else.  Anyway, doesn't 3@DXX have a play?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 4H-4S finish?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|hantveit: 5 club is the danger spot, what is 4C?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: NS know their system.  I might read south's hand as having @D control, not that north would necessarily bid slam directly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 times dia and south must guess to trumph with 9 or jack.?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Final consists of 3 segments 16 boards each, so 2 last boards of the session|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: let s see if paulissen is aggressive here too|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ritong: possible overrtricks, here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, possible imp in bargain|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 2@H must be something wihch includes an invitational @D raise.|pg||
nt|wstuart: !@C raise I mean|pg||
nt|ritong: impS|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|don_kapu: :)|pg||
nt|stoffers: Multon-Zimmerman not having the best set in OR, Gladysh lead wuite big now|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  but they have quite a way to go and Helgemo-Helness already apperared in playing area|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1 IMP could be worth 10,000 euro|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  2 boards, 2 imps - a real nail-biter.|pg||
nt|runnerup: needs @d lead and wrong guess in @s for = -otherwise +|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  that wouldn't be the easiest match|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  winners 20,000  runners-up  10,000|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: nothing good can happen  they are definitely too high|pg||
nt|wstuart: A little too high.  They were getting 6:5 IMP odds on the game, but it requires a good deal more than just a finesse, so it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: it is obvious that ew lack a spade control which explains the lead by noth|pg||
mb|p|nt|Zmud99: Marill 's team take 3rd place here  - they defeated White House team by 17 points|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead decided, how many overtricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: oyyyy|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -i was waiting for that -put it to my bankacount|pg||
nt|ritong: out of price lead!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  so, predicted as new leader again|pg||
pc|d9|nt|wstuart: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now it might be a tie?|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Going out not with a whimper but a bang!|pg||

nt|runnerup: 7  @c /south |pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This is likely to be a push|pg||
nt|ritong: they might try 3NT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yes ns will be game|pg||
nt|imp_jan: bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|wstuart: They may go only -1, but surely not a bbig swing here.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: @s lead, and we have to play some cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no S cannot play 7@s|pg||
nt|runnerup: also 7 @s by south -can they --just kidding|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|hedyg: 2@c relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: jan!:)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: there is only 6 teams in consolation - Team White House and Marill play a 3rd/4th match |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  10 tricks indeed, will be corrected|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  So 1 IMP could indeed be worth 10,000 euro|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Our operator is Nathalie Frey :)|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Good luck Nathalie|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t want to jinx them, but if fulvio decides to play in @ss because it scores more...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  assuming, boards 13 and 14 may bring swing, let's wait the outcome|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ritong: jan is also jansma's first name|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d showed @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= @c|pg||
nt|ritong: and dubinin doubles because of his void plus the ace in case of run to Nts..|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H= odd nr of keycards ( in @c) incl @H control|pg||
nt|ritong: turbo stuff|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Henri|pg||
mb|7S|nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: Shall we just write JanJan?|pg||
nt|ritong: he did not like @d xxx, pity|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may me a squeenze vs west now|pg||
nt|imp_jan: black suits|pg||
nt|wstuart: Like Henri said, it will be interesting now.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  8 teams in consolation have to play 5 matches x 10 boards, after first one De Botton has 20 VP, Welland - 19 VP, long way to go as well|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Gromov needs to find the lead still|pg||
mb|d|nt|sverjohn: Nå er Fan-Nun i 7 sparx |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: that dhould not be difficult here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i was talking about 3NT, but works also in 4@h, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3500 specs holding their breaths|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it ok to hesitate so long before  lightner X?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|imp_jan: leading away from a queen for sure gives jansma a clue|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: problems arise when you huddle and pass|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s8|nt|wstuart: West had an awful hand to lead from.  QT9x into a strong NT opening wouldn't be anyone's first choice, but look at his other options.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and jansma will realize that|pg||
nt|wstuart: This will give south some information later in the hand when he's trying to guess the ending.|pg||
