nt|psridhar: that 2N was possibly the good bad variety -the reason behind Tewari's 3@c|pg||
nt|psridhar: maybe Satya meant his 2nt to be natural|pg||
nt|psridhar: and tewari took it to be artificial|pg||
nt|rodal f: Like better the 2NT bid then the 3@D bid at OR|pg||

nt|psridhar: unnaturally|pg||
nt|rodal f: What is unnatural by a 3@H bid?|pg||
nt|psridhar: tewari probably thought his 3@s only showed a 5 carder and pd can choose between 3nt and 4s|pg||
