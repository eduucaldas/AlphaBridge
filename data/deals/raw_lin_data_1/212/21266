nt|kareno: Oops private intended|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|kareno: I watched some sparkling bridge by Boyd Robinson in their first match.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|sybarra: and hello to Joe Stokes our operator |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Joe :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hi all -- sry for only having 1 table -- VuGraph operators did not show up|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Both the east and south hands would have been passes years ago but now they are automatic to enter the auction at once.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: We'll just all have to crowd into this one tiny room, Joe :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||

nt|sybarra: chunky raise,  typical also these days |pg||
mb|3H|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: 3 @H  2 places to play |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure 3@H = @S & minor|pg||

nt|kareno: Al :)  Ed :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Boyd considering 4nt for minors I'm sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Boyd 4N will be 2-places to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: quite a PASS from Pollack|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Might that pass be forcing?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i can't imagine anyone playing Pollack's PASS as forcing  -- no game force, favorable vul,  and 4@H could have been a flyer|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would need to do something other than 4@H to create force -- ex: 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno: Most seem to feel that the pass is forcing but I think that without a strong bid of 4@h (say 3@s) it is not|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|kareno: gmta Al|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree relative to the 4@H bid, but don't think the vulnerability should be a criterion.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland posted CC for NS - a 30+ year partnership   but  we don't have any info about EW :(|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely not - even with unfavorable I would not treat it as forcing (but I am perhaps in a minority in that opinion)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: EW are playing a complex version of Precisioin|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: no big club, no 14-16 NT   bizarre indeed|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|5 clubs - usually not 4D (then 2NT)|nt|kareno: too good for 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but to me if too good for 1N then open 1@C|pg||
nt|kareno: And I don't know what their 1@c requirement is|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe it's not exactly Precision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i suppose some relayers will restrict 1N opener shapes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Joe (our operator)  said  EW are playing a complex version of Precisioin|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: at least EW seem to be on same page|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I know that because this version is new to Pollack (who has played other versioins of Precision for years) and he has been busy studying very lengthy notes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: NS  3rd/5th leads   upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this hand will be more interesting at the end of the tournament when the big team game is Reisinger BAM  [board-a-match]|pg||
nt|kareno: Certainly I take your side of that bet, Richie.  |pg||
nt|reisig: BAM is a TOUGH game!|pg||
nt|kareno: The toughest, frankly|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm proud of my two tenth-place finishes in the Reisinger.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she won't remember, but i met Karen during that 1st Reisinger in 1980? when she played with Lynn Deas|pg||
nt|kareno: I certainly remember that event.  We took six out of six against the Aces in the finals forcing them into a tiebreaker.|pg||
nt|kareno: But that was actually my SECOND tenth place finish :)|pg||
nt|kareno: First was with the Portugals and Meyer Schleifer|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS play  1@C-1@D//1@H  as 2/3@H, weak NT but DENIES 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 1@H covers other hands  Roland :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: screen down and Feldman asking questions|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure why that would encourage Robinson, but at least makes more sense than after non-force |pg||
