pc|c4|nt|panosk: looks like the right contract anyway|pg||
nt|yke:  the name Tarzan precisicion is because it is named after the guy who played tarzan Weismuller, which is almost their names|pg||

nt|ahollan1: yes   Muller treating @C suit as 4-cards|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|ahollan1: so sorry  he did bid 2@H   showing 5+@C, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: preempt 3@C over the limited 1@S opener was very effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: he must cash out now|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sice the fourth @d and @c give N 2 discards|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yke:  it is still early :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now deWijs wants his @D back|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now it's made|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: if east has @dKxx he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 3325   4@D=EndSignal  forces 4@H so west next bid = signoff|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|panosk: *10@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: running scores: http://merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|yke:  that's some real multitasking, finessing, claiming and asking at the same time!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play weak NT when favorable  [non-vul vs vul]|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: since now its a low scoring sesion|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Sementa in 5@D undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: how many hearts does 2@c promise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at lower levels  Muller non-@H bids would deny 2+fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: west is not sure about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe slamtry + @h fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without looking at east hand --  me either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural seems more likely for a couple of reasons   a) 1@D limited to 15 HCP  b)  deWijs could have only 8 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: 4@c is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  looks like 2@S will make here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H retransfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@c shows 4@s,right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what 3@C says but certain it shows 4-fit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yke:  West passed because they can;t bid 1NT which would be a GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: there is an deeper agreement about 4NT last board|pg||
nt|yke:  1@S is 11-15|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: but South did not know it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: best lead but can it beat it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed     that wasn't an option in the other room when Drijver jumped to 4@S over a 3@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: we had this sequence yesterday|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: seems 8 tricks are there|pg||
nt|yke:  yes, EW get two heart tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it could show @C or clarify strength of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and there it showed just 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: youn finess in spades?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb only 1@S 1@H 2@D and 1@c|pg||
nt|xenya: with the help of @SJ finesse|pg||
nt|panosk: *you mean finess in spades |pg||
nt|yke:  just duck the @SK|pg||
nt|panosk: or just small spade from hand towards the 10@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi congratulated De Wijs for this dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: 3@c=just clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: South takes a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C looks like shortness but maybe it shows 4@D   who knows :(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|panosk: either way it will be fun to watch|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzng: may be very weak|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 3@C just said 4@S  then likely 4@C shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from Bermuda Bowl online for both teams -- but they won't cover the details|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|yke:  @SA and a small spade now|pg||
nt|panosk: or !A and small @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if he ducks @SK after trumps are out then @HQ entry for @SQ and made|pg||
nt|yke:  no thats not good, N plays @SK and you need to duck and then you will be thrown in on the next spade|pg||
nt|yke:  ah yes|pg||
nt|yke:  so it always makes?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so if not duck then @S finesse J and home|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y imo|pg||
nt|xenya: seems so|pg||
nt|xenya: for 4 imps to Allegra|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5  17 most likely|pg||
nt|panosk: gd point from a fellow spec "the only way to beat the contract was after taking cl return h to take away the entry to dummy"|pg||
nt|yke:  so switch to a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: but then you can finesse the @hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y|pg||
nt|xenya: well,  W did remove a @C entry to dummy -- but he cant't remove both|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and now 3@S showing 3-fit with  16-18 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2@s=6+@s less than 9 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@s=invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: N only has 5@s though|pg||
nt|joest: for the reason that RHO often has them both|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: nice to see West alert the forcing pass|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps double has some meaning I don't understand here|pg||
nt|joest: i mean the prior one|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess they switched the meanings of X and pass here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  even with @D finesse, I don't think 3nt will make... I'm often wrong :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi often declares like he has 1 more trump then we can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: so it was a penalty pass|pg||
nt|joest: why would North remove 4@h doubled?|pg||
nt|joest: he has shown his distributional hand and has a highly valuable @HK for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will put Dutch back into lead |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: E is out of spades, so declarer can set up @Ds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: my teacher said: never underlead aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: all are laughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was stuck  2@D artificial showing stronger hand  2@H needs another @H  2@S needs another @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North: 2@s=4-7 points, -56@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 5-6@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'm told 2@S 0-1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 4@H  with @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: achhh    4@S    @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be hand where you try to score as many trump as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North takes a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sementa got to score 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D ruff  then  @SJ in end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller having violated Bocchi's teacher's rule about underleading aces ... that won't happen here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|xenya: and it appears to be the only chance|pg||
nt|xenya: 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  small garanties 8 trcks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe the Madala original PASS affected Bocchi decision|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|joest: i was thinking that al|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: but that @HK really does cry defense, doesn't it|pg||
nt|joest: but just because you can't foresee beating 4@h does not mean that 4@s will be cheap|pg||
nt|joest: at the end of the day partner is looking right at his cards; you are not|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: this might have been only a 4-4 fit!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|xenya: declarer is trying to find lines that would cater for possible danger, but he is destined to make i think  |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Madala DBL similar to way EW play   shows desire to bid again [where PASS shows defensive values]|pg||
nt|joest: having said all that, there might be intricacies of their particular system that might change things|pg||
nt|joest: I can understand not showing spades on five small over the double but on this board life would have been much easier if the auction had started that way|pg||

nt|yke:  double would be takeout. Im pretty sure|pg||
nt|jbennet: not a plus board of course.|pg||
nt|xenya: so a high price to pay|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the 2 level agree with x as take out.|pg||
nt|joest: they obviously read it differently :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|xenya: but i have a feeling the other room will do the same|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite possibly|pg||
nt|yke:  also on the 3 level|pg||
nt|jbennet: yet EW escaped from an x.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the 3 level. an x should be more a suggestion to penalize opponents. |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: anyway note the exact same bidding in both rooms|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: during recent World Championships  on live vugraph  Zia listed Madala as one of top 3 declarers in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ HCP|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|xenya: and another 4@H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I beleive 3@C is 8 to 10 points with 4 card support|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so who are we to argue:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP, BAL, 1+control  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jbennet: its so rare that both sides can make a 3 level contract. |pg||
mb|p|nt|yke:  nowadays, you hardly see any penalty doubles at the highest level|pg||
nt|yke:  on partscores|pg||
nt|panosk: i think noone here wudnt venture the same bid at the table after weak 1nt openning |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: this 3nt doomed after @HA x@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=doubleton|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: 3@C= suppoprt in @H or (9)10-11 or 15+|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N=4@H 5+@D, 0/1@S|pg||
nt|joest: you're doing well Al.  Keep going|pg||
mb|3C|an|alerted|nt|jaapfr vg: like this as well|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: provided @DK is found|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: any @H wud do even the 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other 2 were   Meckstroth and Helgemo|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East just asked|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ahollan1: Duboin 3N west|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: deWijs just Relaying for more infor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=1453|pg||
nt|ahollan1: none of this is encouraging to deWijs|pg||
nt|joest: when does he find out whether his partner has a good hand or not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: making 6@s is quite lucky|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Muller could have relayed to learn West's exact shape    2N shows minimum balanced hand that doesn't want to take control|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S mild slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  tks Anna|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now he knows   Muller doesn't like his hand in context|pg||
nt|joest: so east could bid over 4@s?|pg||
nt|baldjean: Neither would I.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joest: for example if he also held the @hK a small slamwould be great. |pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaapfr vg: @H9 to show @D I suppose|pg||
nt|jbennet: no not now, but sometimes in the future, there will be a pair that will use x in situations like this as  more penalty orientd on the 3 level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like @sQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3Nt=minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: higher bids=Cuebids|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: and he had better cash them|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to play @h3|pg||
nt|baldjean: He seems to be the kind of player where the fingers do some pre-thinking.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: he is sorting his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and the first one is the one he intends to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence would fiddle with the cards   first time I kibitzed him it didn't take long to realize he was moving cards according to differnt lines of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: as a adefender or as declarer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: his alternative move is @cK|pg||
nt|baldjean: My partner puts cards in random order. She says she has no problem sorting them out in her mind, and with random order the place where the card is drawn from does not tell ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: anything.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: let see which card he picks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 3@D, deWijs had options to:   ask for controls [A=2 K=1], make weak ask, force signoff or the natural mild try with 4@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: this is/was an impressive set for the italians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: this is the last board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of 3rd set     final 12 boards starts at top of hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: we will have another the last session in 53 minutes|pg||
nt|baldjean: I can't befriend myself with mini NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzng: i hope you all enjoyed!|pg||
nt|penseur9:  wow...on  45 the OR in only 3@H for a 13 IMPs swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: tomorrow at 11 CET, the first session of the finals start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jean -- no imagination :)|pg||
nt|joest: 12-15 i think|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Majors|nt|vugraphzng: 2@c=GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-15  [only 3rd seat vul]|pg||
nt|joest: I've only played miniNT a few times|pg||
nt|baldjean: On the contrary - too much imagination. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we had system where 1N opening 6-9    ACBL said that was ok, but we couldn't use any conventions in response :)|pg||
nt|joest: is 2@c for the majors too imaginative for you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Brink also got in with a 2@c bid|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzng: last board of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala is a bit tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG  a) BAL  b) @C  c) @D    [Follow-up from 2010 Euro]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 45, the German EW failed to get to 4@H -- moreover, they sold out to 3@Smaking. 13 imps to Allegra |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that last part   it is not for me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: 2 clubs might among other things contain 118-20 NT?|pg||
nt|joest: I played 8-10 NTs for a while|pg||
nt|joest: when I was young|pg||
nt|joest: on Friday nights|pg||
nt|joest: if you know what I mean|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|penseur9:  yes thank you Anna (merci beaucoup), great job you did|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Anna :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Jack=normal lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact  maybe you knew the creators of the system Jack  since this was at University of Illinois|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East asked|pg||
nt|baldjean: Yes, perhaps after the tenth beer. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: double finesse in @s for 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 5@c 2@h 2@s?|pg||
nt|joest: that would work, yes|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: 2@S= 5@D 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is NOTE for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N must complete  4252 shape   and might clarify strength or honor location in doubletons|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is South worried about @h or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is 4@s a good contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well they've definitely wrong-sided NT  and deWijs has natural @H lead|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|jbennet: so diffenrece 2 IMPs  after this one??|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  thanks also to my fellow co-commentator Vladimir...|pg||
nt|xenya: A thanks Andre|pg||
nt|yke:  2@D is probably hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north showed 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 3sp showing excatly 4 h?|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D cant be made either here i think |pg||
nt|jbennet: unless panicing out an ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: down 1 after non @h lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too early in morning for me to figure out if 4@S makes :(|pg||
nt|baldjean: Lools like it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 4@s is off due to @d ruff 2@h and @sA|pg||
nt|jbennet: here its late afternoon.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs @SAxxx is very powerful against 4@S|pg||
nt|joest: I am told that at the other table, north INSERTED THE NINE on the first spade play|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jbennet: both 3NT and 5d hangs on the lead.|pg||
nt|yke:  push|pg||
nt|yke:  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess 2@d was 4@h and 3@s was a trf to 3N|pg||
nt|joest: oops|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: my guess all contracts go down after wrong-side NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is why it is possible to say that 4sp have no chance after 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|penseur9:  don't miss the finals tomorrow, it should be a great show for all|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: 3N has been wrongsided, in a sense, as the killking club lead is much easier for W|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|yke:  maybe he can try to stal a spade tick and then squeeze W|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm having hard time ignoring knowing full hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems endplay South is option beyond finding @S9   [hope that hasn't already been mentioned]|pg||
nt|joest: of course he doesn't know that south is 44 originally|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbennet: yet it is vital that EW have adequate signalling methods.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Johan!   just in time for last board :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so deWijs might play @CQ then @S or @S now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yke:  but he can always thrwo all of his spades|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes west should know that he can discard 2sp+2hearts. but......|pg||
nt|panosk: now @d |pg||
nt|yke:  East needs to keep at least 2 clubs for an entry to cash the @S|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 rounds of diamonds now.|pg||
nt|yke:  its not that obvious, but I think they will prevail|pg||
nt|joest: this is on the road|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jbennet:  situations like this are common. declarer reeling of a long suit. |pg||
nt|clinch: At other table, opening lead was wrongly ducked, but @h continued and 9@s played on first round|pg||
nt|joest: sometimes north will duck with queen empty|pg||
nt|joest: so the ten lead has something else going before besides both the q and 9 onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East cann't affford to duck the @h return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good insight   those psychological situations elude me :(|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzng: North claims for low to @hK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: i think EW's performance over the last few boards has been quite impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we also must thank our great specs who showed great interest and knowledge, we appreciate your comments always|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes EW most impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  to be expected of these 2 players|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing spectacular -- they just bid every game that came their way|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes very interesting for all of us...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while the final outcome seems determined, could you keep the table open Anna until the last board results are known from the other room :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  confirmed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 boards remain in the match   restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: cu|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: back in 15 minutes|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbennet: many 3NT contracts have been slipped thorough due to errors from defence.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @CQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: moment of truth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: force NS to discard |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joest: at this point he seems pretty much committed I would think|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzng: NS discussing 33|pg||
nt|jbennet: easy disacrd|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|joest: very well done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good play|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzng: so thanks all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we were ptiviledged to watch great bridge as shown from our super operator...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  try privilidged even :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks again Vlad...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I suppose we should congratulate the Allegra team for a great commeback and victory|pg||
nt|penseur9:  the BSC team also performed well trueout|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: i am sry, but i have to go... ich hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart 45 minutes   thanks everyone|pg||
nt|joest: so thanks all.  back in about 30 minutes I think|pg||
nt|joest: ok 45|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: back in 42 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top of the hour|pg||
pg||
