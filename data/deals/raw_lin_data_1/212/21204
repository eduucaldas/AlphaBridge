mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|brolucius: A negative double does not usually work well on 5-5.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|dburn: may be forced, because of negative free bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh dear. Do they play that? |pg||
nt|brolucius: Roland Wald and I were agreeing yesterday what a sad scheme that is. Cost the Bulgarians a slam swing at the Euro Champions Cup. |pg||
nt|dburn: don't know - but West would probably have bid 3@h if that were forcing|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this will work OK if the defenders can get 500|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: X described as 4@H's or the ability to control the auction|pg||

nt|odysseus69: good afternoon from London for the start of the 2011 Lederer|pg||
nt|ady: this Might be 1@D passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Clinch|pg||
nt|clinch: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EW strong NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good morning and welcome to London|pg||
nt|desinka: Skorchev - Trendavilov playing Precision club|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: Hello Steve|pg||
nt|clinch: Hi Dessy - we have as many commentators as other spectators I think!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: hi Voctor|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Reverse attitude and standard count for both pairs|pg||
nt|clinch: Hi Steve|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ady: Victor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all, welcome to London|pg||
nt|desinka: :):)|pg||
nt|desinka: good point :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|desinka: Hello Mike|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clinch: Hanlon-McGann a tough Irish pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|odysseus69: Scotland are here by virtue of their win in the Commonwealth Championship. |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: notin the modern game 1D Passed out :)|pg||
nt|ady: no North decided to respond|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 2NT any game force with 4@S, 3@c any minimum|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|djneill:  other room used direct Drury raise by north to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: might find K@S switch|pg||
nt|clinch: Scoltock a man who generally likes science; Myers an excellent player who has recently being playing a lot of bridge after a few years of not doing so|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: EW strong club, 14-16 NT, 5cM, weak twos in the majors, 2@d=11-16, 4414 or 4405|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphztg: The scoring is a mixture of BAM (10 doesn't count) and IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: then a heart switch would set this 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 36 VP for the IMPs and 2 per board BAM|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|djneill:  spades do set up but entries to them not so great if ruff a club first|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: on this scoreing overtricks or undertricks can be important|pg||
nt|odysseus69: E-W are both Derek - so I will remember to use surnames- good start by defence|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|clinch: The BAM component here means that S must cash the spade ace now to hold declarer to 9|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Not being able to duck the diamond has improved the chances no endd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: diamonds don't run now (E can't get back to hand) but he still has nine with the 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Also though, if S doesn't cash SA, he can afford teh C finesse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|clinch: This tournament has a very complicated scoring system, combining IMPs and point-a-board (board-a-match)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ady: now east will get end played|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|ady: so only down 1|pg||
pc|dA|nt|djneill:  if West has @dA, entries are there, that is the hope now|pg||
nt|athene: it was a good play from east to force dummy with a club after winning the spade|pg||
nt|athene: othewise declarer could simply cash @HAK and run spades and dummy would still have a trump|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to get trumps right|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|odysseus69: spade 8 asking for a heart but West safely ignores|pg||
nt|clinch: An Hanlon, by misguessing the heart, is not so well-placed in the BAM component this board|pg||
nt|clinch: Will nevertheless make his game|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes, 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw making 24 available|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: And 36 available as VPs from the IMP scoring|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Guy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So the match scored out of 60|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|djneill:  West has shown @sK, @hQ, @cKQ, it looks bad for @dA onside|pg||
pc|dT|nt|odysseus69: but not safely -cost a trick|pg||
nt|clinch: Can claim now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: never the less North might have done better to pass 1@D|pg||

Even if you do like negative free bids, it doesn't seem a good idea to play them at the 3@H level. |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: South doubled 3@S at the other table and then 4@H was doubled too.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you put your cursor over the Closed Room result (top left) you can see the bidding at the other table.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that E/W do not play negative free bids, so West could have elected to bid 3@H forcing on the previous board.|pg||

nt|athene: if you are going to lead a diamond to the king you might as well keep the spade winner in dummy, go for the make|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: threw the HT to speed it up :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|clinch: There were only two left anyway|pg||
mb|3H|nt|clinch: Spade partscore for EW |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: these matches are based on a 60-point vp scale. 36 vp available for the imp score, and 24 for the two-points-a-board aspect (0-10=1 point, 20+=2)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|athene: 7@H is not so bad here; just needs trumps to come in |pg||
nt|djneill:  1@c strong, 1N 4 controls maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess they will reach six|pg||
nt|clinch: Though may end in 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: short @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  4@c cue with superfit @h|pg||
nt|ady: south decides to pass balanced 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: for the record the President's team is the octogenarians - Priday -Teltscher the Scots Coyle Matheson and the English Waterlow-Panto|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: quite right imo - filthy hand|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do ok in hearts|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|clinch: Diamond not best lead for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E has said that W now won't have 4@s....|pg||
nt|clinch: Possibly a straight 4@h (if natural) would have avoided this double|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: this not so good|pg||
nt|clinch: Oops|pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  West must know about 4th trump else slam might not be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Or 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: (as a consequence)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: which may confuse the defence somewhat|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 3@H F1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|ady: south will duck 2 rounds of hearts|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|athene: @HA would be unfortunate|pg||
nt|athene: you can't then get the spades away before south ruffs in and cashes @SK|pg||
nt|ady: n/s playing udca|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky - not much to go on, i guess|pg||
pc|s8|nt|djneill:  good lead, same at other table, just played @h starting low to @hK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|ady: should be a trick short here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: 2@S defined as 4-10, so this was a minimum |pg||
pc|h6|pc|s9|nt|djneill:  West will try to hope South has 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Sandra ducking well|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good play that C!) I think|pg||
nt|clinch: Some brave souls would overcall 2@s with 2NT on the south hand|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|c8|nt|vugraphztg: @C10|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, the defence has dropped a few tricks here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|clinch: And may have cause for some redress|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: They seem unconcerned|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: declarer needs south to have the fourth diamond|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|nt|clinch: and meet a sticky end if W could keep quiet|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|vugraphztg: showd S that she had led from 3|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: West will make his seven trumps and the @cA, and that will be that  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: goodish result for n/s   unless had Penfold opened they could scramble 2 spades  or 1NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Spirited auction in the other room!|pg||
nt|dburn: odd bidding at the other table|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h wa weak with hearts and a minor, but I don't understand 3@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: David Muller, our excellent VG operator, is keeping a count of royal flushes. He says that North's spade holding makes it 2 so far.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 4@S is a fair effort in the 3rd seat but it will not end luckily.|pg||
nt|brolucius: On lead against 3NT, North looked no further than his royal flush at the other table.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: Hanlon won't mind this result - two or three down not vulnerable with the opponents cold for slam in either minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but he may blink a little when he finds he has lost 8 or 9 IMPs on the board|pg||

nt|athene: let's hope the previous board did not put EW off slams :)|pg||
nt|athene: clearly 7@H makes here but i would expect them to reach six|pg||
nt|djneill:  North might throw in italian 1@s overcall but that would be very aggressive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: scoring in the Lederer is a little unusual - effectively a combination of teams and pairs with the emphasis on the teams aspect|pg||
mb|2H|nt|clinch: Excellent|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|must bid3D - many meanings|nt|clinch: Another horid preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@h hearts/minor?|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: 2 points are available for the winning result on each board to which is added the convereted imps difference|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, does South have to bid 3@d after the double?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  ok 1N weak|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@d = ART @h slamtry|pg||
nt|athene: west has a good hand for a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: for play in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: with the trick source in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks down 1     4@H a possible make though for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   not found their heart fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, whether he has to or not, he has done|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: SJ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|desinka: stragedy pass :)|pg||
nt|clinch: 5@c or 5@d seem to make comfortably for EW; ... but not 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: No - I forgot Bulgarians lead 2nd highest a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, come on, North - fourth highest please :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: rather than 4th|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|djneill:  4@c cue, denies @s cue|pg||
nt|djneill:  4@d shows @s cue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: well judged by West (as they didn't x)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the club king is the key for 4 spades- taking the save at these colours looked a mistake but surprisingly no double|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: perhaps|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h7|nt|djneill:  West obliged to bid more now|pg||
nt|desinka: 2@H open is weak in @H .. 3@C is relay ask|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: tricky board    5@D  undoubled may be good for e/w    good go either way|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@s will make easily enough... Play  of the spade suit will determine how many tricks, though a straight finesse of queen seems likely|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|djneill:  5@d ask Queen if 5@c was 0/3 keycards, West making sure it cannot be zero|pg||
nt|desinka: 3@D is min hand 5332|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|clinch: No particular reason to think W has Kx|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|djneill:  5@s = yes Queen|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this will not be a result to gladden the EW hearts |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: what happened to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: well depends if Nev guesses clubs|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  West would like @dQ not @sQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare for the limited hand (1nt opener) to take control like this|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|6|nt|clinch: -300 becoming a familiar sight on the Irish card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it may have been a horrid pre-empt, but when you get results like that it will not exactly discourage NS from making them|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3NT has chances without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: They stopped in 3@C at the other table. There are 8 top tricks in 3NT (since you can overtake in clubs), so you would have to hope for one 'in the wash'. |pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|djneill:  1@d may contain strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  wow 5@d other room|pg||
nt|djneill:  East forced to game over the strong NT with 7 no Aces|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@D a little unambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@s is very delicate, 4 good trumps yes?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   true   unlickely then 4@S will go down that way|pg||
mb|2H|nt|desinka: precision |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes 2@S as well|pg||
nt|athene: delicate is one way of putting it|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C might get the job done i suppose|pg||
mb|2N|nt|desinka: 2@S F, 2nt asking abt the shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course west doesn't think his partner has a singleton spade|pg||
nt|desinka: 3@C now|pg||
nt|desinka: min hand 64|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|athene: so maybe only-2@S worked quite well|pg||
nt|djneill:  South may balance West into game|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S west might have been more inclined to take a shot at 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: has a very good hand for a single raise|pg||
nt|djneill:  or E-W can just double 3@s|pg||
nt|athene: so should probably move over 3@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South may pass this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but after 2nt, she expects her partner to have spade wastage|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the whole key to the hand is the singleton spade facing no ace, king or queen|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for EW|pg||
nt|desinka: yes|pg||
nt|desinka: if he was hear 3@S (max hand and 3415) will not pass :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|desinka: check tthe shape|pg||
nt|clinch: 3NT on a spade lead could have made|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: what now for North?- went quietly - cant really fault that|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|desinka: it is a good desition anyway , because he knows p is min and dont have 3 cards in @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you sort of suspect that NS will bid 3NT at the other table|pg||
nt|clinch: Doomed on a diamond lead, though|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: But if played by S?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: a diamond is not so obvious a lead perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may well make if played by South|pg||
nt|desinka: here will be by S|pg||
nt|desinka: so.. :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, exactly ... spade lead likely with his 5 card suit concealed in the bidding|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|athene: but east should do more than just 2@D first time for sure|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 in each suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill:  West will try to steal a @h before @c run, since can pitch only 2 cards on the clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|djneill:  he did not steal mariani's heart (nor taglias on this auction)|pg||

nt|rmb1: What is the approved rebid over a 2@D response?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you choose to open the minor on major-minor 4/4 hands, then there is a much bigger chance that partner has a 5-card suit when he opens 1@H and especially 1@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT GF.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It depends on what NT ranges you use. |pg||
nt|brolucius: It is attractive for North to lead spades because West's 1NT denied four spades and she might well hold four cards in either or both of the minors.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|athene: well, more delicacy from east :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: I decided against it, since quite an effort to travel to London and back from deepest Hampshire.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|brolucius: East is no doubt Nevena Senior, rather than her husband Brian. She is a regular partner of Sandra Penfold.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: Hanlon's 2nd double is for take-out, of course, contesting the part-score further.|pg||
nt|dburn: part score?|pg||
nt|dburn: East-West can make a game with a good view in clubs|pg||
nt|brolucius: I regard 2@S as the best initial response on the West cards, even if playing 4-card majors. It is true that not EVERYONE agrees with me.|pg||
nt|brolucius: To some extent it is a double fit for both sides.|pg||
nt|dburn: if South could makea  responsive double he would, but it ought to be for penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: South thinking|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W would have a better chance of reaching their playable spade game if West had followed my (learned) advice and raised the spades.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she might have bid three spades over two|pg||
nt|dburn: still, she might now bid four over three and get doubled|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wouldn't prefer to take that route with so many losers.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to bid 2@S at the first chance, surely.|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, 2@s is OK, but 1NT is OK also|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: South ready to bu but North away from table|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now North is entitled to think there is a trump stack, since West has never raised.|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: two surely SQ/J - he knows that S has SK|pg||

nt|brolucius: I met Tony Priday at the Lords v Commons match. I was astonished when he said he was 90. Still looking very smart and fit.|pg||

mb|1D|nt|brolucius: This year the Lederer clashes with the Euro Champions Cup in Germany. That is why there is no voice commentary for the Lederer. Roland chose the Euro event, which lasts for 4 days ...|pg||
