nt|kareno: Martin :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|kareno: Yes, it is cold out there - I spent the day with friends in East Seattle.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: EW play a form of Precision    NS sound initial actions |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzfc: larsen team manager just dropped off some goodies for her team. drinks and chocolate it looks like|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: winter nationals should be held in florida, phoenix or las vegas, summer nationals in the great northwest|pg||
nt|kareno: Hey, those of us from the southwest like some cold weather some of the time :)  And RAIN, YESSS!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds nice -- but that's when hotels are full and most expensive|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kareno: 6@c won't work now that the heart lead is coming|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my mother loved change of seasons     in summer couldn't wait for it to be winter, in winter couldn't wait for summer|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That's like cats - a cat is a creature who when on either side of a closed door wants to be on the other side :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many will agree   North doesn't really seem to fit description of "sound" opener|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|kareno: Ed :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: chambers making a weird face|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Could 4@C have been for key cards in @C, north showing one?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: hi all|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|copeyj: Hello all|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: good afternoon, can we get player names please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS must be Schermer-Chambers|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: no way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not an opener for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwnm/display.cgi?pid=docs_PL1CrossTable.htm&sessid=410492940777193&wd=1&club=eburesultspages |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Larsen in the other room and Pollack-Feldman play a strong @C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  looks like a reasonable C slam....on all but the known heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|rkc for clubs|nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if only playing semi-forcing 1nt i would use one of the bergen raises to show a 3 card limit raise|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  a little high now|pg||
nt|alchilds: lets see|pg||
nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|chip: Seems N did not take 4D as RKC since he showed 2+ the Q.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  welcome to Chip and Al|pg||
nt|chip: So may be on their way to 7.|pg||
nt|alchilds: canthey stop in5 nt|pg||
nt|USBF: If it was RKC for diamonds, then he has 2 + Q|pg||
mb|5N|nt|fabsayc: in fact NS can make 4 with some good guessing|pg||
nt|chip: not sure what 5S is.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the team names are reversed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry folks, had to restart to reset the score, fell a bit behind|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi all :)|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the real rarget for team hinden is to win the match by 14+ imps so as to win the event|pg||
nt|copeyj: big ask but 20 boards to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: something is wrong  EW pair play Larsen|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  welcome epsen|pg||
nt|chip: Now up to W to decide to lead his partner's suit or not|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|atlantajon:  push|pg||
nt|grebrof: same contract as open room - I think mainly S should have been looking for a cuebid in @hs from N to bid slam, but ok - weve all been there|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|copeyj: This looks like a fairly normal result|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|copeyj: Can't imagine N/S not getting to the 3 level in @C after W bids 2@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chip: Note that if N has Qxx of spades (so a 12 count) would be able to pitch a D and make 6.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfd: Boyd is asking Pollack about a carding agreement..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: this table needs to close and restart or we will have chaos|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table is visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen also opened 1@D  but that's nothing new for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @HJ could be key to grand slam here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I don't remember what she led against heart slams - perhaps trumps :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: extra strength so  2@D then delayed @S raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|an|artificial|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but over 4th suit force  does he just bid 3@S or jumpt to 4??|pg||
nt|kareno: This slam will fetch.  Spades at any level (hearts or notrumps also.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S probably doesn't guarantee 3-fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now the extra strength message not so easy to deliver|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends if they play fast arrival or not I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's part of why i asked about 4@S Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fast arrival doesn't really make sense     if weak hand with 3@S then raise to 2@S instead of bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fast arrival should not apply in many cases, this one included|pg||
nt|othered1: south, I guess, is biding his time, as it doesn't seem he's shown more than a possible minimum so far|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'm guessing they prefer to have four trumps for the immediate raise.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: quarterly results visible at  http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2011/03/seniorko/|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no karen QJ9 was good enough on prior set|pg||
nt|othered1: funny how many "standard" 4th suit auctions lose all science and wind up with the usual control asking bids.|pg||
nt|kareno: North knows enough to bid seven now.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he really know  @SAxx??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if south has promised three trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can try 7NT however|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C-1 was a push|pg||
nt|kareno: With the ace of clubs, he could have bid notrumps without three spades, you know.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  right  after showing all 4 Aces then 3@S must be 3-fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point is 7NT better than bidding 7@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice inference|pg||
mb|7N|nt|kareno: I agree, 7nt better.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gerardmc: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: This will be claimed at about trick 3|pg||
nt|kareno: Gerry :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good auction    quick claim|pg||
nt|gerardmc: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: chambers puts down the dummy before a card is led|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Casen-Krekorian got there with 1 less round of bidding|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzfc: schermer sees dummy and says "that should be enough"|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: he just claimed|pg||
nt|othered1: can nnow be claimed at trick 1|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c34|st||md|4SA76HAJ532DA876CA,SJ4H84DJ952CJT853,SKQT95HKQDKT3CKQ6,S832HT976DQ4C9742|sv|n|nt|roswolf: this may be competitive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: queen could not gain|pg||
nt|chip: ?? play AK then go to dummy in clubs to take a pitch.|pg||
nt|grebrof: other than that, I dont know what agreements NS have, but 3@c is a bit of a stretch in my mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: yes, having opened that N hand I'd be eager to put a green card out over 2H.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|atlantajon:  leaping micheals for anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@S froM Allerton and X from Forrester|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C and 2@D openings for EW are Intermediate, but not sure about shape requirements|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  are they playing canape openers?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|copeyj: Choice for Gold now but 2@H likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total trick followers need more than all fingers and toes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think it is the strong hand - or can be|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, the pitch discussion was assuming partner had the two aces he showed.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not the time for passing the double out|pg||
nt|copeyj: and that will end things|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think Gold was even close to passing|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  perhaps rose thought the hand was TOO good for leaping micheals.....for the intermediate player.  leaping micheals is explained here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaping_Michaels|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kyle thought about dbling before passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mark asked about 3spades, Kyle wrote something about asking...|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c all the bal minimums - also including @ds|pg||
mb|4C|an|gerber 1430|nt|roswolf: certainly not with ARF as his pard:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: schermer took the high road with 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, interesting treatment|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  goingto be hard for him to bid 6h...after the 4d call.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not that it helps much on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|grebrof: I saw the movie in last segment and they had some similar auction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: it started with 1@d anyway...|pg||
nt|chip: Did he really open 1D here?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  we were just talking about that|pg||
mb|7N|nt|atlantajon:  well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i think auction has derailed now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  Also, if west bids there, he's likely to get that suit lead which is probably bad here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low club need declarer will have to play diamonds immediately to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: misclick sorry folks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 1h|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in retrospect....leaping micheals would have made it harder to get there....|pg||
mc|13|nt|copeyj: Yes I don't think you can introduce @D - you have enough that it is likely to be a part score hand so no prospect of really "stealing"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome John|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess they know what they are doing|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: a 7nt seem to be making everyone happy. smiles all around for a while. even bates.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Here's another slam, children.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Picture Bid   all values in @S & @H, worthless 22 in minors|pg||
nt|othered1: They clearly don't play fast arrival here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i agree with fast arrival if 2@H game forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: I actually play 31h stronger than 4@h in this one auction on the assumption that 1@s - 2@h forces to game if you are going to raise hearts.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but i play specifically denies this number of key cards|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kareno: They seem to know what they are doing.|pg||
nt|gerardmc: strategywise, E/W has to weather the storm and give as little as possible, hoping that teammates pull great plays at the other table|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Casen-Krekorian going the route of  1@S-2@H//3@H-non-serious 3N|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: There is really no storm, Gerry.  They have good teammates also and can assume these are pushes.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: the cormorant is safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't O'Rourke defending champion?|pg||
nt|kareno: And they are entitled to think that beating 6@c was a big pickup|pg||
nt|gerardmc: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room still trying for 7@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but stop in 6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a 10 minute play hand|pg||
nt|kareno: This or the previous hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7N was a quick push|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you cant ruff everything so have to risk an early diamond towards the queen|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: And if the spade is ruffed, that gives you extra trumps to ruff minors in dummy.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  pull trump with South hand and ruff @S in north|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would not expect spades to break after the suit led|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Bates shows out on 2nd @S  it is easy, isn't it|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: other room visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N FG raise I am guessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Osborne can now show @H shortage and extras|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: doesn;t fit well with Jeffrey;s hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but a lot of gharp values|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  This won't encourage Allerton.|pg||
mb|3N|an|non serious|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Voice Commentary  [in both rooms]|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h normally being better than 4 - and S doesnt have a bad hand|pg||
nt|chip: 3N presumably some type of slam try. Not sure how they play it.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Is that a serious 3nt bid....|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  OK|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that came up just as I typed it|pg||
nt|grebrof: with a bad trumpsuit and a stiff @s, a nonserious slamtry seems like a good evatulation of Ns hand|pg||
nt|chip: No serious seems an underbid, particularly if 3H suggests an OK hand (though many sensibly do not play the 3H bid that way).|pg||
nt|grebrof: evaluation - spelling in the dark here|pg||
mb|4S|an|not rkc|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
nt|chip: I think 3 key cards and another king is too much for non serious, particularly as a 4C Q-bid makes things smoother.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
nt|copeyj: a normal auction once Osborne had showed shortage - always a conundrum with singleton A|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Perhaps Osbourne should have showed the hand as strong balanced, but that's not ideal either.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed chip....after a 3h call from south|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chip: 4S is maybe RKC? or just a Q-bid?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  not 4h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D  2-way checkback  game force|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess old blackwood could be used - S cuebidding @s - equal to bidding 5@h which some kibs suggest - I think this is better|pg||
mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: so 3@D = 5@D, not 3@H|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure if N or S is bidding RKC.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: tough contract|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kjadams: well done on auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: the play will be a form of Morton's fork.   If Robinson wins the diamond ace, that establishes two pitchs for spades, and if not,  e/w do not get a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads are always Rusinow  [2nd of touching honors]|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@h would be more: "bid 6 if you have good trumps p" - for me that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: thats funny Chip - bridge you never have what you bid anymore|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  lol|pg||
nt|chip: Note that if South's minors reversed 7H would be a decent contract. Here bad splits make even 6 a little iffy|pg||
nt|grebrof: luckily the @d K is rght|pg||
pc|s3|nt|grebrof: good lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: the @s Q would be terrible here - that would let it make easily|pg||
nt|chip: A trump is a reasonable alternative lead.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: defense prevails now clearing the clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|copeyj: good hand for being able to bid naturally really after 2N, although I like what they play generally|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chip: after finding out the spades don't break, seems natural to lead up to D Q, which will give 12 tricks.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|alchilds: only plauis dia|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: on the 7@C hand  the other room played 5@S -1|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2N|an|H+C|nt|ahollan1: Casen finally won @SAce and immediately ruffed @S|pg||
nt|othered1: west knows of the big rounded suti fit.  South know less at t his point.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: What is everyone's thinking on unusual nt/michaels hands?  I play they are never normal opening bids, rather either weak hands with good suits or very strong hands.|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is an interesting call with scattered strength and two mediocre suits.  East judges preemption is worth the minuses.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when opponent makes bid showing 2 specific suits -- that gives responder 4 ways to bid the other 2  |pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer to play all the defensive 2-suited bids as weak only (thus non-forcing)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the natural bids usually just competitive  and the lo/hi cue bids for stronger hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2nt on any five-five seems the popular view, those of us who disagree are showing our age|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kareno: Well, I AM now eligible for the Super Senior events :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me south hand more interesting, should chambers have introduced the spades|pg||
nt|gerardmc: in 2nd seat, right, it is supposed to be weak (10 or less points) or strong (15+). In 3rd and 4th suit, it it supposed to be intermediate or better hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I would have, via 3@h.  I treat 3@s in this one auction as strong and forcing.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: second chance to show your jack neil|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: bravo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what "supposed"?    it is purely partnership agreement   some say  - show the 2 suits and we'll worry about strength later   others do the weak or strong in one shot and try to bid ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: out with middle|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly, Al.  You need to have understandings with YOUR partner about these auctions.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  anyone for 4c...on the way to 4h?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 4@H now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H greedy|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, the prior hand was questionable, but Wold did bid 2N and found a great hand opposite.|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Forrester had TXX@C which indicated Gold playing it|pg||
nt|kjadams: ouch.  Magic 4S for  Larsen.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and wrong again|pg||
nt|kjadams: and losing 110 will not be good compensation.|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: and now tony showing a very good hand for @H|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: this dbl I have no words for it - probably just showing good hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: passing th ebuck back to Gold after all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ARF may be tired|pg||

nt|ahollan1: since limited as passed hand 2@D seems very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus can't have @HK else 1N opener|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if @C7 is the way to show 3 cards -- or if it was just automatic cover|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kjadams: NS can make 3S, but going plus may win as stopping might be difficult should they get into the bidding.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that matter  would be nice to know agreement of @C2 lead|pg||
nt|grebrof: hoping for some endplay here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: they have not beaten 1nt yet|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a boring hand|pg||
nt|kjadams: true :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: defense can count the 6 tricks, and work out what to play for, but they do not always do that.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: well defense needed to switch to spades to have a chance, i would have played the most discouraging card from south trick one|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|kjadams: play to set, or play to minimize overtricks.   On the auction, might be tough to work out that N/S have the rest.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Schermer agonizing over his play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is kind of hand where their "need to know signal" philosphy does not work well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: schermer thinks declarer has heart queen or king, but then there is probably no defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: should be easy at this form of scoring...ducking is the 7th trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|kareno: I played a lot of double deck pinochle in my younger days|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yet another nebulous Precision 1@D   (10)11-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@S will get clarification about min/max and 3 vs 4 fit|pg||

mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: chambers should have ditched two diamonds, much clearer then|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: auto raise to game by east|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  how many clubs by north?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2N|an|limit raise 4 hearts|nt|fabsayc: 1nt not double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: inviting what?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best choice   not alot of HCP, but 8th @C can't be ignored!!|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  looks like he took the low road|pg||
nt|jgc: 4@C for me, but i'm old|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by S to bid. Otherwise NS might buy the hand for 2S. Now EW might stop, but likely to get to 4H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H=?|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, I meant E to bid (though S also did well to open, they passed in the other room).|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: A PUPPET?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4333 hands dont belong in 43 fits, should be easy rule to remember|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: doesn't know how many partner has...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand a good test of methods.   Over a support X, what is 2D in your system?  I like non-forcing.|pg||
nt|chip: 2N is presumably a 4 trump limit raise type hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for me need two top honours to invite|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  going to be hard not to bid 4hearts at imps|pg||
nt|chip: NV, not really much difference between imps and matchpoints. I think should let partner out when he had so much room to make a counter try.|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Frances Hinden says this is either to play in 2@S or 3 suited short in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@H = to play 2@S or shortage in @S (according to Hinden/Allerton card)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this is a diamond slam try then they may well bid the slam - ouch|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The way he's bid it, he's showed WHICH 5 card minor.|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think they would reach a slam - a lack of @C control would be revealed at some point I would have thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   you need transportation of much better hand to accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bill says coward as he passes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mugsmate:  Having an extra round of bidding can't help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but no matter what you cant pass 3nt with north hand lacking either top honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 2nt limitraise is more and more popular when holding 4 trumps|pg||
nt|chip: After club, club, ruff, declarer will still have to guess trumps to make 3.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mugsmate:  then Hedy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree with you about 2@D|pg||
nt|kjadams: the principle is that partner forced me to bid by doubling and I can Q with a good hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: other options  1@D-2@C game force [ugh]   or 1@D-1N [natural, non force  OY]|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are behind in a match with 10 bds only to go - logic often therefore goes by the wall|pg||
nt|roswolf: still no adventures today|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a sllight variation here but another push|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is fine, is not going all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Science of Bidding Mediocre 8 Card Suits     won't be on your bookstand anytime soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   what does   1@D-3@C//3N-4@C   show/ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably the north hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of 3@C=invitational [ so non-forcing]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice from high above  commenting on how Jacobus very capable of @HJ false card |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kjadams: neither diamonds nor hearts a happy contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Robinson would prefer a much faster pace|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: too deep  but would be interesting if Jacobus duck @DQ|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rmb1: More IMPs to Allfrey on board 6, 3Dx-4 by NS when EW here were in 5@C-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Gold-Forrester going to get coffee|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd6 e/w in the other room got caught badly and went fpr -800 nv|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is fizzling out - Allfrey will win the match and the event and will play in the Camrose etc - well done|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  given the spade holding is it is guess.  north has to have 6 queens to respond to the opener.   unless he did it on Kd and Qs only.....but that means south opened with a 10 count.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  3 queens|pg||
pc|dA|nt|atlantajon:  not 6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kjadams: He could be playing against Feldman.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: the duck was a legitimate possibility but jacobus probably did not expect a singleton given the ace opening lead|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jgc: This contract is not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  now ...on this auction....north rates to hold the Qs......so it is either the end play in diamonds...or slam down the AK of spades.....whats your choice John?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kjadams: the steady stream of imps continues for the Kasle team.|pg||
nt|jgc: Well, if Rose finds out the precise distribution, which she should...?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chip: That is a weird play. Why allow this promotion type play? Looks clearly wrong. Guess playing for 5 days has worn the players down.|pg||
pc|s7|mc|8|nt|atlantajon:  north started with 8 clubs....and wil have 2 heeats|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and 1 diamond...therefore 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: a swiss raise?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes!!|pg||
nt|kjadams: 3S would be shortness somewhere.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11   Meltzer opened the south hand 1N!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Larsen might just blast 5@C now|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a skinny game in spades that figures to go down|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  Well they get a chance to try again - thyey have the trump ace as an entry.|pg||
nt|chip: Seniors in ACBL events start at 55 (which is really much too young), though I think all the players here are 60+ .|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jgc: Contrast Marc's 4@S bid here with his 2@C bid on the previous hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: @S lead I should think|pg||
nt|roswolf: no scope for a hinden swing imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would expect that atypical 1N from Jacobus more than any other of our 8 players|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: well they might make a game which can be beaten Geoffrey|pg||
nt|copeyj: so that is scope for a swing|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  North may have a guess after taking the heart.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think i would pass over 3nt with south hand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chip: To be fair, also some great bridge last night. Feldman made a slam towards the end the commentators said couldn't be made.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: when Gold is in with @HA doesn;t he have to find @C switch?|pg||
nt|roswolf: nope dont think so:(|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  He can play his partner for the dK or the cA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|nt|mugsmate:  He'll probably duck one heart to get a signal.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mugsmate:  He has.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|chip: NS need to lead spades to take out dummy's entry. Not easy (and not being done).|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that was interesting|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chip: Declarer has a guess here since S could have Jxxxx instead of Axxxx (W knows S has the AW of clubs). Good guess.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|copeyj: well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: simples|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mugsmate:  Good technique from Gold.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what bids were available -- but O'Rourke PASS seems very deep here|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|grebrof: another low @h will still keep communications|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chip: Kib notes S didn't have to show the club Q, so probably should get the hearts right.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: (3@S)-3N range is HUGE   so very real chance of missing slam with her collection|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: voice commentator just reminded his audience that Mark Feldman is father of Jason Feldman - a key player in the great web site  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kjadams: Invite with east hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doomed IF  transfer :)|pg||
nt|jgc: Hooray|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  red...I like 1s|pg||
nt|jgc: Me too - at any vul|pg||
nt|chip: They bid 3S over 1D at the other table.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: tempting|pg||
nt|jjsb: health ? family ? work? all ok?|pg||
nt|grebrof: even I wouldnt have bid 3@s - even thou your P might have some aces and will lift, where does all those @cs go|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jjsb: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S looks fairly easy but on heart lead there are complications|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4d alerted by Pollack, not by Feldman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: when the opponents are bidding, you can play closer to double dummy and bid lighter games.|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one maybe a hair too light, but lucky lie of cards...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can certainly make 3|pg||
nt|chip: I think XX was like a NT bid (values, but only 2 spades).|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|grebrof: 2@cs - 1@h - 1ruff - hmmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|jgc: 4@S is a maginal vulnerable contract here but they won't reach it|pg||
nt|grebrof: isnt it always 9|pg||
nt|chip: On a D or spade lead the club ruff goes away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  3S non forcing with both opponents bidding is a perfectly normal treatment|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  And indeed is what they play.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west hasnt shown his 2 suiter - i would have bid 4@H instead of double|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 8, 4@h made by EW.  Apparently North lead @SA and south played K from Kx (?)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  should be 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chip: So this will tie the match, or put Larsen back in the lead.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  after the C rebid...not going to find the ruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@S-P-P-??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 2nd 8-bagger of the set  for those who keep track of such trivia|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes we can expect this to be a swing board, nothing clear|pg||
nt|jgc: This should be a routine 4@S|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  exactly|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  really close match now|pg||
nt|grebrof: I get some messages about N might be QTxx in @s - thats the reason I would vote for the cut in @s - only when S has the Q alone or Qx were N made some strange nt-bid that would ...|pg||
nt|grebrof: been wrong|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfd: Most of the delay was Boyd's|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  1d..1s...1nt...newminor...then game|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: well - he was only in 2@s, so I guess he didnt see the danger or didnt think long enough|pg||
mb|2H|an|some invite bid, |nt|roswolf: 5@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if pollack ends up on lead might even underlead spades|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  or 1nt|pg||
nt|grebrof: opposed to the other table I still agree with those that taking the cut in @s was the percentage play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: not sure what I was saying there, but - I get votes for not thinking long enough :)|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  2h is some sort of D raise I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: another part score swing possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'd still like to see what north bids after 4@S-P-P|pg||
nt|grebrof: weak in @s or @d-raise?|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: ok|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|grebrof: the inv minor bid at the other table might have been easier for EW to end in 3nt, but we will see|pg||
nt|chip: Not sure about their structure, but seems E might bid 2N with a spade stop and decent opening bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, he  didnt bid 2nt last times, is 3nt then right this time?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  right.....now east as to guess about a source of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: E/W ARE COASTING ON EMPTY -NO SPARK AT ALL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12   where O'Rourke passed (3@S)-3N    Meltzer took slightly different view    JUMPED to 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: aha - proved wrong once again|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  he hates it if west has KQxx of D and AQ of clubs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: ugh|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  KQxxx that is|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: 3@S seems dangerous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: my misclick|pg||
nt|chip: 1D was precision, so 3D showed a real D suit.  To be fair, 3N is not exactly laydown (if spades were 5-3 would go down).|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, there are many layouts where 3nt wouldnt be right - maybe thats why he should have bid 2nt first|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, best to describe your hand and leave to partner.|pg||
nt|chip: Though inviting with the W hand a bit conservative too. Not sure how light they open (if light, then E should accept I think).|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kjadams: Q asks for attitude on the Jack.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that happens often|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  LOL|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think you should play transfers over 3nt overcall, so there is something in between pass and 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: especially to me|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|mugsmate:  3D is a normal contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with 3rd round of @S?   right|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: those nebulous 1@D openings just keep-a-comin|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is a weak no trump opening nebulous Al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no it is known balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well about 8/10 1D openings are balanced in precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nebulous because  minor shape too mysterious    ex  2@D 5@C opens 1@D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3nt is the right bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: wold is pondering|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club back still down|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  45  Pollack stops in 2@S  where our table 3@S-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was Wold's 3@S overcall with 6115 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: chambers fingering different cards in turn|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players taking a break atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they just returned |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the 6 imp lead really belongs to O'Rourke|pg||

nt|chip: So the lead flips again.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yepp|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: that's why we say  keep your seatbelt on until play comes to complete stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  one of the specs...asked me why run from 3nt.  I was explaining that this is not BAM...or match points....therefore an 8 card major fit is a safer.....most of the time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: but now you can see match effectively over as no way for kasle to gain on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a great comeback for Larsen team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O'Rourke wins the other semi-final|pg||
nt|jgc: Hmm - I don't get 1@S|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Marc is getting bold here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D drury?!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/2 must be forcing|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   other room has finished play|pg||
nt|chip: O'rourke beat Morse in last year's final.|pg||
nt|grebrof: like when they dont play the last session?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/2 means  2-over-2    i.e. new suit after 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jgc: 12 HCP outside @C and at least 3 card-support for any othe rsuit - I'm a doubler|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  got off the hook....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla:  K & R 22: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A543+AK83+A6+AQ4 |pg||
nt|kjadams: He had 2N available as 4 card raise with shortness.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  might be making with that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: All I can say is WOW!|pg||
nt|grebrof: there was this german pair that argued so much, they had to stop playing a session already started (which they normally never do)|pg||
nt|chip: After being conservative last hand, see if they can stay low here when it is right.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator Dan (excellent work)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  where Feldman didn't bid    Krekorian did transfer with @SKQJ @HJxxxx @Dxx @CT9x   but they stopped in 2@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|kjadams: the singleton diamond would not have gotten them to game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to all the spectators for their comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks always fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think their 2@D opener rules out many of the hands that give Pollack good shot at game|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  this will bring it close again....as they tried 3nt in other room|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: note the distortion needed with 2 way stayman, 2@H equivalent of 2@D in regular Drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O"Rourke 129 ,Lall 95|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some play all new suits forcing after an overcall, but i agree with kaplan rule only 2/2 forcing|pg||
nt|chip: and they do.. I think a D shift now might beat 2H.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|mugsmate:  I was having a sidebet with Hedy over whether he'd cue opposite a passed hand.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D sign-off in 4@H |pg||
nt|mugsmate:  She won.|pg||
nt|chip: North is hoping for Ax of spades in partner I guess.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way drury i mean :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|mugsmate:  He doesn't want to pick up any possible trump queen in his partner's hand or lead away from a King into a very strong hand.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|mugsmate:  Allerton may have deduced the spade King was more likely to be with south because of that club lead.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kjadams: true, though finding the 4-4 heart fit not often needed given the 5-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|grebrof: a @c lead is often good - cause sometimes P cant bid them when he has them |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jgc: As I said before Jake is a GREAT pro|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mugsmate:  With no spade King, perhaps south would have prefered to lead spades.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
