nt|ahollan1: yes   Muller treating @C suit as 4-cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry  he did bid 2@H   showing 5+@C, not 4+@H/@S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: again  operator just catching up by entering final contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: preempt 3@C over the limited 1@S opener was very effective|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: he must cash out now|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sice the fourth @d and @c give N 2 discards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi decision very tough|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: cashout=!AK and @s ruff|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|yke:  it is still early :)|pg||
nt|xenya: but he needs 4 @D tricks -- so it looks like a guess|pg||
nt|panosk: position is @D is one of the most contemplated positions in play with lots of opinions pertainning not only play but false carding attempts by defence |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: now deWijs wants his @D back|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now it's made|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|panosk: like since he raised with @DK does he have 1-@D or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: if east has @dKxx he can be squeezed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 3325   4@D=EndSignal  forces 4@H so west next bid = signoff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|panosk: *10@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if East 3@D 5@S then    4@C and deWijs 8??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  north overtake here and return @D|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: I had connection problems again|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the venue has had many connection problems this week :(|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: i expect a psuh but let's see if sementa has anything more to say|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: (it's not necessarily drijver thinking, i'm on the south-west side of the screen)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H X   brings in 500    sometimes best rather than speculative removal|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: well drijver went to get some water so i know who's thinking...|pg||
nt|ady: bidding same in CR|pg||

nt|penseur9:  difficult decision for Sementa here|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: all pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: 5-5 in @s and minor 5-10|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzng: running scores: http://merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|yke:  that's some real multitasking, finessing, claiming and asking at the same time!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H, 8+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play weak NT when favorable  [non-vul vs vul]|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: since now its a low scoring sesion|pg||
nt|andyv:  problem for W to pass|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5@D C:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great pressure bid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like 4@h too :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think the pressure is now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 40  3@D made in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  Muller should pass but he has a great hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Sementa in 5@D undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: how many hearts does 2@c promise?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at lower levels  Muller non-@H bids would deny 2+fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: west is not sure about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe slamtry + @h fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without looking at east hand --  me either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural seems more likely for a couple of reasons   a) 1@D limited to 15 HCP  b)  deWijs could have only 8 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: 4@c is natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|penseur9:  looks like 2@S will make here|pg||
nt|andyv:  everything works for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  except for the @d ruff:)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 3@H retransfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@c shows 4@s,right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure what 3@C says but certain it shows 4-fit|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yke:  West passed because they can;t bid 1NT which would be a GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: there is an deeper agreement about 4NT last board|pg||
nt|yke:  1@S is 11-15|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: but South did not know it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like 4@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: best lead but can it beat it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed     that wasn't an option in the other room when Drijver jumped to 4@S over a 3@H bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: we had this sequence yesterday|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: seems 8 tricks are there|pg||
nt|yke:  yes, EW get two heart tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: it could show @C or clarify strength of hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and there it showed just 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D ruff would be helpful!|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|panosk: youn finess in spades?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: mb only 1@S 1@H 2@D and 1@c|pg||
nt|xenya: with the help of @SJ finesse|pg||
nt|panosk: *you mean finess in spades |pg||
nt|yke:  just duck the @SK|pg||
nt|panosk: or just small spade from hand towards the 10@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi congratulated De Wijs for this dummy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|vugraphzng: 3@c=just clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: South takes a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C looks like shortness but maybe it shows 4@D   who knows :(|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panosk: either way it will be fun to watch|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: may be very weak|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: since 3@C just said 4@S  then likely 4@C shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards from Bermuda Bowl online for both teams -- but they won't cover the details|pg||
nt|andyv:  good technique to unblock|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: all noemal lines 10 tricks I rhink|pg||
nt|andyv:  over now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yke:  @SA and a small spade now|pg||
nt|panosk: or !A and small @D|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if he ducks @SK after trumps are out then @HQ entry for @SQ and made|pg||
nt|yke:  no thats not good, N plays @SK and you need to duck and then you will be thrown in on the next spade|pg||
nt|yke:  ah yes|pg||
nt|yke:  so it always makes?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so if not duck then @S finesse J and home|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y imo|pg||
nt|xenya: seems so|pg||
nt|xenya: for 4 imps to Allegra|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5  17 most likely|pg||
nt|panosk: gd point from a fellow spec "the only way to beat the contract was after taking cl return h to take away the entry to dummy"|pg||
nt|yke:  so switch to a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: but then you can finesse the @hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y|pg||
nt|xenya: well,  W did remove a @C entry to dummy -- but he cant't remove both|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: so ikt was unbeatable DD on this layout|pg||
nt|yke:  any spectator has GIB? what does he say?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|jaapfr vg: extra chance with @C89|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North claimed for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|panosk: so many of you indicated that N still has @CA in dummy as entry, that is also true|pg||
nt|yke:  GIB says it always makes|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|10|nt|andyv:  Madala appeared to ask for @h back on his @d play|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: what does the other room play in 41?|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: they are extremly fast in changing the board|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not vul  NS play opening 2@D = 4@S and 5+@C/@D   a curious treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs can SHOW [transfer]  or ASK [2@C relay]|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzng: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|panosk: another nice hand |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: still many kibs believe it was down if @H in trick 2 but i believe our operator that it then also does make±'|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: winning 2 IMPs by going down only once|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: so that explains 3@d I guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink 2@D opening shows @D    very retro|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should end at 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|penseur9:  1@D=@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: no, 1@D are @Ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'll take little consolation in those 2 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2@h=@s raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H better raise than immediate 2@S|pg||
nt|joest: not sure what Bocchi could do here other than pass.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=a) 2-fit  b) 3-fit < very max|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6@S unbeatable and unbiddable:)?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzng: 1@s=2 or 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: usually 3@s, but may be 2 with no @d stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H  8-10 HCP  vs  2@S  6-9   and both  3-fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi feared 4@D would push EW to game?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C natural game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: great qualifier Jaap|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest: what's the point?  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: maybe if it all goes pass it could work well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: might also add  terrible slam that just happens to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  how much better is it if W had 10@s?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: standard honor leads vs NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should take no time at all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panosk: Sementa bid 6@D in open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or just knew neither contract making :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr vg: an honorable kib told me that he udes GIB and 2@D was always made on any lead and defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use a lot of DBL to just say  "i have extra vaules"|pg||
nt|joest: but 5@d looks too expensive|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|yke:  very undisciplined of drijver to save unilateral in the open room |pg||
nt|panosk: ok but GIB plays double dummy doesnt it?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: oh i have to adjust ± was not GIB but deep finesse|pg||
nt|yke:  very unlike Drijver|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: not sure if that is the case here, but it does seem to fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: now a 20% slam does not sound   terrible:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|yke:  I think after a preemt, double means I want to save|pg||

nt|yke:  not sure though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  @D switch just gives declarer discard on @D instead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry missed 5422 shape|pg||
nt|joest: Bocchi has an unbelievably good hand in that context|pg||

nt|joest: oh i see|pg||
nt|joest: then there is still some sorting out to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i just mentioned 5422 because that doesn't qualify for 2@D opener which would be strong BAL|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West consulting the NS convention card|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: now this looks like an easy (?) make|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes I agree|pg||

nt|joest: so he just parks it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@d=interest in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2N was specifically @C & @D  [reasonable to use as any 2 suiter]  then 3@C/3@D as cues to show @H/@S very likely|pg||
nt|joest: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@s=mz suit is @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: higher=cuebids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 2@D=to play   and he would RDBL with 4432|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jack -- do you have recommendation about when to bid/pass over DBL y |pg||
nt|ahollan1: when holding BOTH majors?|pg||
nt|joest: I think it depends on your system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: darn --  i KNEW there wasn't going to be easy answer :)|pg||
nt|joest: with 1@d unbalanced it increases the chances partner fits one of the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N 16-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  yes possibly but unlickly I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: is 5@H unbeatable?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: played by S|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: it looks like|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the vul is right for EW|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 2@S  i think maximum of 7 HCP|pg||
nt|joest: now some people play that jumps to two of a major show BOTH and either weak or invitational|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h = weak 2@s = strong|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East took west serious|pg||
nt|joest: Erick Rodwell calls that UMJOODO  Unusual major jumps over one diamond opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sementa starts with 2@D=18-19 BAL  so playing 2N|pg||
nt|andyv:  that probably not as good:)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|jbennet: north had the chance over 3 sp.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that is without RHO DBL|pg||
nt|joest: that is true|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jbennet: this should be -1 though.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: other table in 5@SX|pg||
nt|yke:  gtreat switch!|pg||
nt|jbennet: other table did north came in with a X over 3sp?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to play @sA|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: pass W in OR|pg||
nt|yke:  I don't like pass at all, if you have a shapely hand, you should not waste a bidding round by passong|pg||
nt|joest: over double I don't know of any common conventional way to show both majors at once|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: rest of audience may know the convention as Reverse Flannery|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which declarer loses most 50 per?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|xenya: @SA and another spade seems as good as anything, providing N ducks 2nd @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now 3@S showing 3-fit with  16-18 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2@s=6+@s less than 9 points|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@s=invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5 tricks |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|baldjean: N only has 5@s though|pg||
nt|joest: for the reason that RHO often has them both|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzng: nice to see West alert the forcing pass|pg||
nt|joest: perhaps double has some meaning I don't understand here|pg||
nt|joest: i mean the prior one|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess they switched the meanings of X and pass here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|penseur9:  even with @D finesse, I don't think 3nt will make... I'm often wrong :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bocchi often declares like he has 1 more trump then we can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: so it was a penalty pass|pg||
nt|joest: why would North remove 4@h doubled?|pg||
nt|joest: he has shown his distributional hand and has a highly valuable @HK for defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this will put Dutch back into lead |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|andyv:  but if NS don't break @ds, 4 may be max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems right   can force a @D trick if not given one by opp|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will be squeezng N and E on the @s continuations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: !3 as odd card is encouraging in @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to play @d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @d2|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|nt|xenya: E is out of spades, so declarer can set up @Ds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: my teacher said: never underlead aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: all are laughing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was stuck  2@D artificial showing stronger hand  2@H needs another @H  2@S needs another @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North: 2@s=4-7 points, -56@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 5-6@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i'm told 2@S 0-1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 4@H  with @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: achhh    4@S    @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be hand where you try to score as many trump as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North takes a break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sementa got to score 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D ruff  then  @SJ in end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller having violated Bocchi's teacher's rule about underleading aces ... that won't happen here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  odd/even discards    odd= i like this suit   even=suit pref among other suits|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: and it appears to be the only chance|pg||
nt|xenya: 3-3 @D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  small garanties 8 trcks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: maybe the Madala original PASS affected Bocchi decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 2nd @D discard, Madal may try to go passive   but how does he do that?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|joest: i was thinking that al|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: but that @HK really does cry defense, doesn't it|pg||
nt|joest: but just because you can't foresee beating 4@h does not mean that 4@s will be cheap|pg||
nt|joest: at the end of the day partner is looking right at his cards; you are not|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: this might have been only a 4-4 fit!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is trying to find lines that would cater for possible danger, but he is destined to make i think  |pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: that works too -- he had a bunch of winning choices as cards lie|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: perhaps Madala DBL similar to way EW play   shows desire to bid again [where PASS shows defensive values]|pg||
nt|joest: having said all that, there might be intricacies of their particular system that might change things|pg||
nt|joest: I can understand not showing spades on five small over the double but on this board life would have been much easier if the auction had started that way|pg||

nt|ahollan1: go agressive!|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 card suits tend to do that to you, Al:)|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = relay ask for shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: west showed short @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=0/1@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  now they have to find a spot to play in...either 5@c or 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  yes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jaapfr vg: after this awful 3@C very tight again:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: so they avoid hopeless 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: my feeling also|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  these 2 teams deserve to be in final, but unfortunatly...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play a weak NT when favorable  [non-vul vs vul]|pg||
mb|p|nt|baldjean: Interesting variation.|pg||
nt|andyv:  to land into the equally hopeless 5@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in favor of the hopeless 5@C|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: same result only because @H 5-4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: now, EW did well to arrive at 4@H here|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to find 4@s and I don't know what 4@s would have been for EW in this auction (over 4@c)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jbennet: when given an opprtunity, one should take some risks when the odds are favour of doing so.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h3|nt|panosk: is like playing 3nt :)|pg||
nt|yke:  the 6-6 hand is also a matter of style. In Italy, they like to preemt with pure hands (ie no 2 suiter) but in holland, they like action and most would not think of pass|pg||

nt|ahollan1: then what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I prefer low to @dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does he need favorable @H position?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: he keeps @c2 :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||

nt|joest: so east could bid over 4@s?|pg||
nt|baldjean: Neither would I.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|joest: for example if he also held the @hK a small slamwould be great. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaapfr vg: @H9 to show @D I suppose|pg||
nt|jbennet: no not now, but sometimes in the future, there will be a pair that will use x in situations like this as  more penalty orientd on the 3 level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like @sQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzng: 3Nt=minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: higher bids=Cuebids|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: and he had better cash them|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to play @h3|pg||
nt|baldjean: He seems to be the kind of player where the fingers do some pre-thinking.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: he is sorting his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and the first one is the one he intends to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence would fiddle with the cards   first time I kibitzed him it didn't take long to realize he was moving cards according to differnt lines of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: as a adefender or as declarer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: his alternative move is @cK|pg||
nt|baldjean: My partner puts cards in random order. She says she has no problem sorting them out in her mind, and with random order the place where the card is drawn from does not tell ...|pg||
nt|baldjean: anything.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: let see which card he picks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 3@D, deWijs had options to:   ask for controls [A=2 K=1], make weak ask, force signoff or the natural mild try with 4@S|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzng: running scores: http://merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2 choices here maybe... @S ace and @S or low @D first I think|pg||
nt|penseur9:  low@S sorry*|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jbennet: this pair will then collect huge amounts of IMP:s. |pg||
nt|yke:  although it cost some imps, I llke madala's 2NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: it is so hard to ignore seeing all 4 hands    but so much better to try to imagine what Madala is thinking only seeing his hand and dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 1@c can be 15 points and balanced|pg||
nt|joest: ic thx|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbennet: other pairs will observe this.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ok -3|pg||
nt|panosk: me too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead in other room where West is declarer   @D  so  Duboin has 3@D tricks set up but @S not established yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala asked|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: right   15 can be upgraded|pg||

nt|penseur9:  yes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14 imps   2 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Duboin in 2@D West|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: Brink playing  1N South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 bagger, 2nd seat unfavorable   perfect situation for uncertainty|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jaapfr vg: a razorblade slam here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East wants to bet with South for beers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW may push this one to 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  the hand looks more like a 2@d bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 1@d does cause a problem for N here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think  DBL=4+@H|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|vugraphzng: 1@s=4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: exactly 4@h dney 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=exactly 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW need decent 12 to open balanced hand|pg||
nt|joest: sold to the highest bidder|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I beleive it's the last two boards which will decide the final outcome|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6@D defeats automatic|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: as 6@S due to lack of entries|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both NS pairs in our match play a weak NT  at favorable  but Brink-Drijver mini|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the last 2 boards were good for Allegra -- but 2 more boards to go|pg||
nt|penseur9:  can 4@S make here EW?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzng: 1@s=unbal., but natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Tobias|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S probably denies 3@H but i'm not sure if he can have 2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbennet: as it happens slam makes. |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: how?|pg||
nt|panosk: is E hand too strong for bicolour?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but only on misdefence.|pg||
nt|yke:  6@D does not make|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala estimated the IMP scores on some boards on his score paper |pg||
nt|panosk: can you see his sum Tobias ? |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: can you read these")?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but EW might play 4 sp (East bids 4 sp now, and west perhaps passes that.)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 24 will be the last board of session 2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|jbennet: east should know there is dead meat on west,s hand.|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: no, I can not read them any longer|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd of 4 sets scheduled to begin at top of hour|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north is interested in the card east led|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leads 3rd/low|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzng: Madala asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: answer presumbly 6-5|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: for the scores|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: so  NS play   1@C-(1@D)-DBL=5+@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will be under a lot of pressure here.|pg||
nt|andyv:  S should be able to make 1N|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: in a variety of ways i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jbennet: 6-2 or 7-2 in D; D contract is favourite  to produce at least 1 more trick than  a spade contract.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|nt|penseur9:  I think you're right Vlad|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  only problem will be that S will be cashing the 4th @s from hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: and EW take 7 before declarer??|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|andyv:  so down 1 it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, N needed to have the 4th @s for a squeeze to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which translates to IMP push   [remember next week Reising BAM where 10 points is HUGE difference]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reisinger|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: this is the penultimate board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: BAM = board-a-match   aks  point-a-board|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzng: i hope you all enjoyed!|pg||
nt|penseur9:  wow...on  45 the OR in only 3@H for a 13 IMPs swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: tomorrow at 11 CET, the first session of the finals start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jean -- no imagination :)|pg||
nt|joest: 12-15 i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: 2@c=GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-15  [only 3rd seat vul]|pg||
nt|joest: I've only played miniNT a few times|pg||
nt|baldjean: On the contrary - too much imagination. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we had system where 1N opening 6-9    ACBL said that was ok, but we couldn't use any conventions in response :)|pg||
nt|joest: is 2@c for the majors too imaginative for you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Brink also got in with a 2@c bid|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzng: last board of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala is a bit tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG  a) BAL  b) @C  c) @D    [Follow-up from 2010 Euro]|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bermuda Bowl...makes more money in long run:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2@H=good @s raise|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|xenya: on 45, the German EW failed to get to 4@H -- moreover, they sold out to 3@Smaking. 13 imps to Allegra |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that last part   it is not for me :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a very good hand to raise to 3@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 3-fit   9-11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their replacement for not playing Drury|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jbennet: 2 clubs might among other things contain 118-20 NT?|pg||
nt|joest: I played 8-10 NTs for a while|pg||
nt|joest: when I was young|pg||
nt|joest: on Friday nights|pg||
nt|joest: if you know what I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  yes thank you Anna (merci beaucoup), great job you did|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Anna :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 18-19|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Jack=normal lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in fact  maybe you knew the creators of the system Jack  since this was at University of Illinois|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East asked|pg||
nt|baldjean: Yes, perhaps after the tenth beer. :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: double finesse in @s for 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 5@c 2@h 2@s?|pg||
nt|joest: that would work, yes|pg||
nt|jbennet: italia will get a plus score here (100 or 140); |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S= 5@D 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is NOTE for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N must complete  4252 shape   and might clarify strength or honor location in doubletons|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is South worried about @h or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is 4@s a good contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well they've definitely wrong-sided NT  and deWijs has natural @H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|jbennet: so diffenrece 2 IMPs  after this one??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: passed hand 2@C would be  a) any (mild) INV  b) weak @D|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbennet: 140 or 170 it is).|pg||
pc|s7|nt|penseur9:  thanks also to my fellow co-commentator Vladimir...|pg||
nt|xenya: A thanks Andre|pg||
nt|yke:  2@D is probably hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north showed 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 3sp showing excatly 4 h?|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D cant be made either here i think |pg||
nt|jbennet: unless panicing out an ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: down 1 after non @h lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too early in morning for me to figure out if 4@S makes :(|pg||
nt|baldjean: Lools like it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 4@s is off due to @d ruff 2@h and @sA|pg||
nt|jbennet: here its late afternoon.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs @SAxxx is very powerful against 4@S|pg||
nt|joest: I am told that at the other table, north INSERTED THE NINE on the first spade play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbennet: both 3NT and 5d hangs on the lead.|pg||
nt|yke:  push|pg||
nt|yke:  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess 2@d was 4@h and 3@s was a trf to 3N|pg||
nt|joest: oops|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess all contracts go down after wrong-side NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is why it is possible to say that 4sp have no chance after 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting the different attitudes in the 2 rooms of this hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|penseur9:  don't miss the finals tomorrow, it should be a great show for all|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Al for letting me join you... ty Tobias for a great job and ty to all the specs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: 3N has been wrongsided, in a sense, as the killking club lead is much easier for W|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: as if i could stop you :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|yke:  maybe he can try to stal a spade tick and then squeeze W|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i'm having hard time ignoring knowing full hand :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems endplay South is option beyond finding @S9   [hope that hasn't already been mentioned]|pg||
nt|joest: of course he doesn't know that south is 44 originally|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbennet: yet it is vital that EW have adequate signalling methods.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Johan!   just in time for last board :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so deWijs might play @CQ then @S or @S now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yke:  but he can always thrwo all of his spades|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes west should know that he can discard 2sp+2hearts. but......|pg||
nt|panosk: now @d |pg||
nt|yke:  East needs to keep at least 2 clubs for an entry to cash the @S|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 rounds of diamonds now.|pg||
nt|yke:  its not that obvious, but I think they will prevail|pg||
nt|joest: this is on the road|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbennet:  situations like this are common. declarer reeling of a long suit. |pg||
nt|clinch: At other table, opening lead was wrongly ducked, but @h continued and 9@s played on first round|pg||
nt|joest: sometimes north will duck with queen empty|pg||
nt|joest: so the ten lead has something else going before besides both the q and 9 onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East cann't affford to duck the @h return|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good insight   those psychological situations elude me :(|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North claims for low to @hK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: i think EW's performance over the last few boards has been quite impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we also must thank our great specs who showed great interest and knowledge, we appreciate your comments always|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes EW most impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  to be expected of these 2 players|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing spectacular -- they just bid every game that came their way|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes very interesting for all of us...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while the final outcome seems determined, could you keep the table open Anna until the last board results are known from the other room :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  confirmed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 boards remain in the match   restart in about 15 minutes|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: back in 15 minutes|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|jbennet: many 3NT contracts have been slipped thorough due to errors from defence.|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: moment of truth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: force NS to discard |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
