mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: Perhaps someone could again give us the web-address for the current scores?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Game is there, on the lie of the cards, but not clear that East should bid again. We will see.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|jbennet: good game missed.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: A good fit, with the doubleton heart opposite @HA-x-x.|pg||

nt|jbennet: and the damage due to inferiour methods.|pg||
mc|13|nt|brolucius: Also, you have some chance of ditching hearts on the diamonds. If there is a trump loser.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: +260 is normally a score that you write into your scorecard with very small writing. Just in case anyone happens to see it and starts laughing.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: 2@H suggests diamond support, since South did not open with a weak two-bid.|pg||
nt|jbennet: the price for not narrowing down the range for a single raise was -7 IMP this time|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: this may not work all that well|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|dburn: since if East bids 4@s now, West won't know there is a diamond control|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jbennet: intersesting|pg||
nt|dburn: he still doesn't, of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: Alternative was 4@H from West, a splinter in hearts altering East to possible lack of diamond control.|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: http://www.ycbc.co.uk/lederer2011.htm for the scores|pg||
nt|jbennet: why west didnt bid 4 h is beyond me.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|5D|mb|d|nt|brolucius: East has judged well to bid on. Yes, he has some good cards opposite West's strong bidding.|pg||
nt|jbennet: east saved the day. |pg||
mb|5H|nt|dburn: well, maybe|pg||
nt|jbennet: D-even; pass=odd ??|pg||
nt|dburn: that double shows the wrong number of key cards|pg||
nt|dburn: so we have no idea where this will end up|pg||
nt|brolucius: Forrester bids 5@D in the hope that E/W will not understand how to show controls over the intervention (!)|pg||
nt|dburn: any number of spade from five to seven is possible|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can now guess that West has a singleton heart, after N/S go to 5@H.|pg||
nt|jbennet: D probably showed even number of aces.|pg||
nt|dburn: double actually showed 0 or 3 key cards according to the system|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: That's what E said|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W did well after their previous possibly poor board.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jbennet: but perhaps trump queen counts as a key card in this situation??|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe it does|pg||
