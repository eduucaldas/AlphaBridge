mb|1D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi all|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Hello all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: good afternoon, can we get player names please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS must be Schermer-Chambers|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: no way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not an opener for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwnm/display.cgi?pid=docs_PL1CrossTable.htm&sessid=410492940777193&wd=1&club=eburesultspages |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Larsen in the other room and Pollack-Feldman play a strong @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  looks like a reasonable C slam....on all but the known heart lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||
nt|chip: EW have a good 5C save, but never got in the bidding.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: if only playing semi-forcing 1nt i would use one of the bergen raises to show a 3 card limit raise|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
nt|chip: Same auction at the other table.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|atlantajon:  a little high now|pg||
nt|alchilds: lets see|pg||
nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|chip: Seems N did not take 4D as RKC since he showed 2+ the Q.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  agreed|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  welcome to Chip and Al|pg||
nt|chip: So may be on their way to 7.|pg||
nt|alchilds: canthey stop in5 nt|pg||
nt|USBF: If it was RKC for diamonds, then he has 2 + Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: in fact NS can make 4 with some good guessing|pg||
nt|chip: not sure what 5S is.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the team names are reversed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sorry folks, had to restart to reset the score, fell a bit behind|pg||
nt|grebrof: hi all :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|roswolf: the real rarget for team hinden is to win the match by 14+ imps so as to win the event|pg||
nt|copeyj: big ask but 20 boards to go|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: something is wrong  EW pair play Larsen|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  welcome epsen|pg||
nt|chip: Now up to W to decide to lead his partner's suit or not|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|atlantajon:  push|pg||
nt|grebrof: same contract as open room - I think mainly S should have been looking for a cuebid in @hs from N to bid slam, but ok - weve all been there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|copeyj: This looks like a fairly normal result|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|copeyj: Can't imagine N/S not getting to the 3 level in @C after W bids 2@H|pg||
mc|10|nt|chip: Note that if N has Qxx of spades (so a 12 count) would be able to pitch a D and make 6.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: queen could not gain|pg||
nt|chip: ?? play AK then go to dummy in clubs to take a pitch.|pg||
nt|grebrof: other than that, I dont know what agreements NS have, but 3@c is a bit of a stretch in my mind|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: yes, having opened that N hand I'd be eager to put a green card out over 2H.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|atlantajon:  leaping micheals for anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 1@S froM Allerton and X from Forrester|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@C and 2@D openings for EW are Intermediate, but not sure about shape requirements|pg||
mb|1S|nt|atlantajon:  are they playing canape openers?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|copeyj: Choice for Gold now but 2@H likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total trick followers need more than all fingers and toes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think it is the strong hand - or can be|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, the pitch discussion was assuming partner had the two aces he showed.  |pg||
nt|arunbapat: shall try after some time|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: not the time for passing the double out|pg||
nt|copeyj: and that will end things|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think Gold was even close to passing|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  perhaps rose thought the hand was TOO good for leaping micheals.....for the intermediate player.  leaping micheals is explained here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaping_Michaels|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kyle thought about dbling before passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mark asked about 3spades, Kyle wrote something about asking...|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 1@c all the bal minimums - also including @ds|pg||
nt|psyck: N debating bidding game or only inviting maybe|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: certainly not with ARF as his pard:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: schermer took the high road with 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, interesting treatment|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  goingto be hard for him to bid 6h...after the 4d call.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not that it helps much on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C was artificial|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks Mark|pg||
nt|grebrof: I saw the movie in last segment and they had some similar auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: it started with 1@d anyway...|pg||
nt|chip: Did he really open 1D here?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  we were just talking about that|pg||
nt|psyck: with 4333, poor trumps, & @s values, tries 3N instead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|atlantajon:  well done|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: i think auction has derailed now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Also, if west bids there, he's likely to get that suit lead which is probably bad here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low club need declarer will have to play diamonds immediately to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: misclick sorry folks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 1h|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  thanks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in retrospect....leaping micheals would have made it harder to get there....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|copeyj: Yes I don't think you can introduce @D - you have enough that it is likely to be a part score hand so no prospect of really "stealing"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome John|pg||
nt|grebrof: I guess they know what they are doing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kjadams: system too good here?  3N a likely make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers intended 4@C as non-forcing is my guess, sequence so rare that followups not clear|pg||
nt|chip: 3N not a good contract (particularly on a D lead), but with hearts so friendly always makes.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 trumps 2@C i think declarer can manage the rest though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|atlantajon:  unlesss rose bid 4s...over 4h|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: club return too tough i guess|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chip: J of spades lead shows the Q.|pg||
nt|psyck: this is comfortable with suits favorable (would have had to get @h right on say a @d lead)|pg||
nt|chip: There isn't a guess in hearts. Kx onside is the only thing that helps.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: Rusinov leads show the honor above the card lead|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|copeyj: hmm the defence can previal now I think.. |pg||
pc|h4|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: this was well judged auction by all   only way to do better would be slower paths that stopped in GAME|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: unless they give the @D ruff - i think that is letting it through again|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|chip: Declarer can safely play a club to the 9 next.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: ns are reminding their screenmates of the defense.|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, theirs is one of the really enduring partnerships in the game.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: so bates/wold are now referring to the defense notes|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2N=relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is this a min or max?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 3@S = MAX, @H|pg||
nt|kareno: Guess he likes it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H is  operator playing with us|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2 Aces but lousy suit   i waffled :(|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Rain, I think north bid 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: their responses are   3@C=@H, min  3@D=@S, min  and then flip-flop with MAX   3@H=@S  3@S=@H|pg||

nt|psyck: not everyones choice of a weak 2 1st seat with poor suit & outside Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N FG raise I am guessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Osborne can now show @H shortage and extras|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: doesn;t fit well with Jeffrey;s hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but a lot of gharp values|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  This won't encourage Allerton.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|chip: On the last deal they played 4H making 650 to tie the match.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Voice Commentary  [in both rooms]|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h normally being better than 4 - and S doesnt have a bad hand|pg||
nt|chip: 3N presumably some type of slam try. Not sure how they play it.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Is that a serious 3nt bid....|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  OK|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  that came up just as I typed it|pg||
nt|grebrof: with a bad trumpsuit and a stiff @s, a nonserious slamtry seems like a good evatulation of Ns hand|pg||
nt|chip: No serious seems an underbid, particularly if 3H suggests an OK hand (though many sensibly do not play the 3H bid that way).|pg||
nt|grebrof: evaluation - spelling in the dark here|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
nt|chip: I think 3 key cards and another king is too much for non serious, particularly as a 4C Q-bid makes things smoother.|pg||
nt|chip: 4H always cold. Takes a club lead to stop 5 (so 11 quick tricks now).|pg||
mc|11|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|nt|kareno: She must be a smart girl!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Pollack  2N East|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: how to turn a passout into a possible blood bath|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: knowing partner has exactly 3@H for his PASS of 1@H -- what do you think of choice of lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can i say it without being censored|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  assume  4-fit would raise   but that may be wrong with really non-opening hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: bates said it showed possibly the 9, nothing higher|pg||
nt|kareno: I like the lead frankly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if @H8 is 3rd from even or  attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dan  i didn't see your explanation|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: It sounds to me that e/w need to be passive so the heart lead is good.  Feels like the points are pretty well evenly divided around the table.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lead from Jxxx     how often is that  good way to go passive?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: well knowing partner has three makes it better than normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all depends on who has the 10   unless partner has 2 honors|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem is it leaves partner sort of in the dark as to your real strength|pg||
nt|kareno: I frankly would not double 1nt with that west hand.  Too many spaces.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I think he's trying to tell partner, when you get in, switch suits|pg||

nt|ahollan1: for actual running total -- you must imagine either flip-flopping the team names  or the scores|pg||
nt|grebrof: having Feldman (allthou he is not declearing now) at the table is always nice - you more or less know you be having a score to compare with :)|pg||
nt|chip: so far we have 3 slams, all pushes.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card Drury.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rooms were opened incorrectly  and decision is to NOT close/reopen the Open Room which controls the situation|pg||
nt|grebrof: dblfits everywhere|pg||
nt|grebrof: not sure that EW will figure out their good @c-fit, but we will see|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: game both ways|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@h probably 2,5@s bid|pg||
nt|chip: EW can beat 4S with a D ruff, but not so easy with S declaring (this would be a bad hand for transfers by responder).|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  either side will need to find thier minor ruff...to beat a game|pg||
nt|grebrof: some suggesting fit jump in @cs by W - the law says you should have 4, but here it wouldve been nice|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chip: W also would like a better club suit than QJxxx. Odd that E passed over 3H.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  commentating now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yes, the 2@d being a good lift in @hs and E has a full opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Precision players open most 11 & many 10 hcp hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: some interest to the play here|pg||
nt|kjadams: Robinson had available a short suit GT/ST or a long suit ST, chose not to reveal anything.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: after Schermer passed the first time, he put out 1D after Robinson bid :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|copeyj: Forrester has a horrible hand to lead from|pg||
nt|copeyj: nothing attractive|pg||
nt|chip: I think he should bid 4D to get the lead.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  sorry....was talking to a friend,..|pg||
nt|grebrof: hard to see the @d-lead coming|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2@h being some invitational hand|pg||
nt|grebrof: whats their nt-range anyway?|pg||
nt|chip: 2H is some invitational hand, now in NT, which I'm sure W will reject.  Notice the club spots give E a 4th round trick, but this does take the entry out of the dummy.|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  right.....hard to find|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: so  really O'Rourke +10|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|copeyj: as if it loses, the AQ@C take care of the @H losers|pg||
nt|chip: No chance now, could do it on A of hearts and a D shift.|pg||
nt|grebrof: E has an invitation vs a 14-16 clerly, but...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: sorry   Larsen +10|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: i flipped both :(|pg||
nt|psyck: if precision, 1@d is (10)11-15 higher end if unbalanced|pg||
nt|chip: But fortunately for EW, the spade ace is doubleton and D Q onside, so still can make.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like declarer will have to get @D right now|pg||
nt|copeyj: as he is losing 2@S and 1@H as far as I can see|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, lucky @s's not dead as A comes down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|copeyj: ah|pg||
nt|chip: Did the play really go this way? E threw away a club trick, then S gave it back?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @hs are well placed too|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: finesse is %|pg||
nt|fabsayc: because south may have AQ8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3rd quarter score in the other match O'Rourke 110, Lall 73|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess there are some layouts where you might get to discard all the diamonds on spades, so not totally on the hearts|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|copeyj: Allerton has found a better line - ruff a @H and throw a @D|pg||
nt|psyck: red suits also well placed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|grebrof: and since E passed, Im sure he never bid 4@d if anything + maybe that wouldnt have been right either|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I rather like 4d...over 3h....he didnt start with an X....so it cant be a slam try|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: if i stand on my head it still looks wrong|pg||

nt|ahollan1: BBO is setup so that running totals reflect   top team = NS   bottom team = EW|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  for the new players....he is looking to ruff the 4th C in dummy with the Q....if needed|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: @c play was strange indeed, maybe operator missed something|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sK|nt|mugsmate:  Nicely played|pg||

nt|grebrof: Feldman not declearer yet, so we are in front of the other table|pg||
mb|d|nt|mugsmate:  Another perfect fit hand - no diamond wastage, so E/W can manage 5C - unlikely to bid it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: North America the default treatment over 1m-(1@H)   DBL=4@S  1@S=5+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is NOT the norm in europe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores now include the result from 7@CX-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jacobus 2@S probably 4-fit  since most play this as Support DBL situation|pg||

mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: 1S ambiguous 4 or 5 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is 2@D?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  yes....sorry Rose.....she is she...for sure!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@C is either @C or 13+ bal or a good hand with @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2@D from Osborne is a bad hand or good hand with @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think passing is more pushy - only 1 @s trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|copeyj: 2@S shows the @S/@C type|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|copeyj: NF|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, i am not thrilled with this treatment, loses natural diamonds and preempts the club suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: some scribbling that we can't see|pg||
nt|chip: E did well not to pass. This is probably down, but has some chances.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mugsmate:  2D is 0-7 or good with clubs|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think NS are ok with stopping here - even if it makes 9 - they easily  be ending in 4@s, which is no fiesta|pg||
nt|chip: Even if 3N goes down, a good save against 2S.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yikes this is not a balancing auction|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|copeyj: this looks like a good result for Gold/Forrester|pg||
nt|kjadams: missing 2 key cards, would be really hungry to bid slam, but it does make.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, good bidding by Pollack|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mugsmate:  10 tricks probably - a lot of work to make 11 on diamond forces.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  in clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could roll the dice by asking for diamond queen but this is the normal approach|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chip: If Declarer wins this, goes to a club to take a D finesse, S can play the heart Q to force an entry to dummy (he will sort of know partner has Hxx of hearts).|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, force an entry to N.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|grebrof: well, maybe that makes too|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|chip: Of course looking at NS hands, much better to be in 4S which rates to make, than 2N which could easily go down.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|grebrof: yes, but has to be done - the J of @cs falling is some noise for S|pg||
nt|chip: If S doesn't make that play, declarer can make by guessing the clubs.  It is harder for S now since he doesn't know declarer has 4 clubs.|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, here he went for @dfinesse wrong|pg||

mb|5C|nt|grebrof: yeah, allthou you can make 10 with the J of @ds right|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: a weakness in strong club systems, but since the clubbers sitting the same way no swing likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: this will be ugly with trump lead or shift.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now this contract has a bit of life|pg||
nt|roswolf: it should be possible to read this lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: Should it?|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  How?|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Can't north have the dK?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well if you see the cards:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they can|pg||
nt|copeyj: it's possible to read the lead because we can see all the cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3/5 from Kxxxx is unlikely on this aiction|pg||
nt|roswolf: a trump lead would be expected|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't see why|pg||
nt|copeyj: I just think Graham is on a guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: leading the unbid suit is not too controversial|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: looks like a good save|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chip: We were right about the swing, wrong about the direction. On board 51 NS played 1N X -500 (they balanced after EW stopped in 1H).|pg||
nt|psyck: @d lead will lose a @d trick but get a @d ruff as compensation|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

nt|copeyj: N/S would be in trouble if south had opened probably|pg||
nt|chip: maybe two ruffs?|pg||
nt|grebrof: if he leads another one|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both rooms made 8 tricks as EW in that deal...|pg||
nt|psyck: 3 rounds of @h by dec pitching a @s would have worked better maybe|pg||
pc|sA|nt|007 joosth: but maybe diamond-T finesse|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: i fancy this is -1 or -2|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Best here is ruff - trump return, ruff the next heartand play a diamond.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  That keeps declarer out of the heart suit.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ev3ryone asleep!?|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  this is a good play lesson for the newer player.    when you have a choice between 2 finnese....take the one that gives you more benefit....the Diamond finesse....if it wins or loses...lets you "not have" to take the H finesse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4 4@S went down   so O'ROURKE now leads by 6   |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mugsmate:  Now these hearts will become "trump substitutes" - Osborne will ram them trhough Gold till he ruffs, then he'll draw trumps and get the hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: I think so Geoffrey - no reason to think on this easy play hand :)|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Had Gold ruffed the defense could have killed the heart suit and beaten this two|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  It's one off anyway|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mugsmate:  Now Forrester has ducked, they can still kill the hearts, but declarer has one trick in the bag, so it's one off.|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Same as taking and switching to spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm the time it is taking is amazing|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: 14-16|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: you know|pg||
nt|kjadams: 800 not the worst possible result there.  Loses only 5 vs 4H making.  Worse would be 500 with 4H down.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL or 1@H with 45 majors?|pg||
nt|chip: This is the second hand this set where a player could bid 2N over 1D to show H+C's (and neither did here).|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 4@C xfer to @H|pg||
nt|chip: I like 2N much more on the N hand with good quality in both suits.|pg||
nt|chip: On 53 2S ended the auction, so 11 back to Larsen as the lead flips yet again.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|copeyj: and now the double Forrester may well pass to allow Gold to play it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that discussion has been ongoing since 1930s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we expect absolute answer any day now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H unless suit topless|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: and Gold may XX to ask Forrester to play it after all :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough bid now for schermer|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  anyone for 4c...on the way to 4h?|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree - vul you dont have any crapsuits and N doesnt have here - the last time I am not so sure|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c some kind of Drury likely|pg||
nt|grebrof: overall, these last 2 days, Feldman has played very well - even his balancing turned out right that hand - whether S should have played the @H Q or not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: welcome back Martin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Michaels might get votes with weaker hand -- but this one too good to misrepresent the shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S or 4@H now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H greedy|pg||
nt|chip: I agree, the prior hand was questionable, but Wold did bid 2N and found a great hand opposite.|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Forrester had TXX@C which indicated Gold playing it|pg||
nt|kjadams: ouch.  Magic 4S for  Larsen.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and wrong again|pg||
nt|kjadams: and losing 110 will not be good compensation.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@s or 3@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|copeyj: but with bare @CA Gold disagrees|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and now tony showing a very good hand for @H|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 4@D|pg||
nt|chip: I guess 3D is a game try here by N. Wonder if S knows this.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: north had no reason to lead club king but that would have lead to down 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: stick with greedy Al :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some advantage to not telling anything, so i like 4@H|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  raise diamonds with south hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this dbl I have no words for it - probably just showing good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  Or 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: passing th ebuck back to Gold after all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ARF may be tired|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jacobus can't have @HK else 1N opener|pg||

nt|chip: 1S is 4+ and an have a long minor (though usually not this long).|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think 2@d is showing 3card @s and max for 1@d|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|copeyj: caSHING the @CA can only be because Forrester wanted a promotion in my view, but maybe Gold is considering if forrester had singleton @CA|pg||

nt|chip: Good decision by S to bid. Otherwise NS might buy the hand for 2S. Now EW might stop, but likely to get to 4H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@H=?|pg||
nt|chip: Sorry, I meant E to bid (though S also did well to open, they passed in the other room).|pg||
nt|grebrof: the other table, the 6 was lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: A PUPPET?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4333 hands dont belong in 43 fits, should be easy rule to remember|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: doesn't know how many partner has...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand a good test of methods.   Over a support X, what is 2D in your system?  I like non-forcing.|pg||
nt|chip: 2N is presumably a 4 trump limit raise type hand.|pg||
nt|psyck: with JT8 dropping|pg||
nt|grebrof: is same as leading 9 from 9xxx - your p tend to have JT alone|pg||
nt|grebrof: actually - P can have anything next to the JT except the 5|pg||
nt|grebrof: no|pg||
nt|grebrof: JT7 leaves the 8 in declearers hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: for me need two top honours to invite|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  going to be hard not to bid 4hearts at imps|pg||
nt|chip: NV, not really much difference between imps and matchpoints. I think should let partner out when he had so much room to make a counter try.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: Frances Hinden says this is either to play in 2@S or 3 suited short in @S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H = to play 2@S or shortage in @S (according to Hinden/Allerton card)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this is a diamond slam try then they may well bid the slam - ouch|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The way he's bid it, he's showed WHICH 5 card minor.|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think they would reach a slam - a lack of @C control would be revealed at some point I would have thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   you need transportation of much better hand to accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Bill says coward as he passes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mugsmate:  Having an extra round of bidding can't help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but no matter what you cant pass 3nt with north hand lacking either top honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 2nt limitraise is more and more popular when holding 4 trumps|pg||
nt|chip: After club, club, ruff, declarer will still have to guess trumps to make 3.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mugsmate:  then Hedy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree with you about 2@D|pg||
nt|kjadams: the principle is that partner forced me to bid by doubling and I can Q with a good hand.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: other options  1@D-2@C game force [ugh]   or 1@D-1N [natural, non force  OY]|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are behind in a match with 10 bds only to go - logic often therefore goes by the wall|pg||
nt|roswolf: still no adventures today|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a sllight variation here but another push|pg||
nt|psyck: needed @c7432  to defeat|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is fine, is not going all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Science of Bidding Mediocre 8 Card Suits     won't be on your bookstand anytime soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   what does   1@D-3@C//3N-4@C   show/ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably the north hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of 3@C=invitational [ so non-forcing]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice from high above  commenting on how Jacobus very capable of @HJ false card |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kjadams: neither diamonds nor hearts a happy contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Robinson would prefer a much faster pace|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: too deep  but would be interesting if Jacobus duck @DQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: More IMPs to Allfrey on board 6, 3Dx-4 by NS when EW here were in 5@C-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Gold-Forrester going to get coffee|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd6 e/w in the other room got caught badly and went fpr -800 nv|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is fizzling out - Allfrey will win the match and the event and will play in the Camrose etc - well done|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  given the spade holding is it is guess.  north has to have 6 queens to respond to the opener.   unless he did it on Kd and Qs only.....but that means south opened with a 10 count.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  3 queens|pg||
pc|d2|nt|atlantajon:  not 6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kjadams: He could be playing against Feldman.|pg||

nt|jgc: This contract is not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  now ...on this auction....north rates to hold the Qs......so it is either the end play in diamonds...or slam down the AK of spades.....whats your choice John?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kjadams: the steady stream of imps continues for the Kasle team.|pg||
nt|jgc: Well, if Rose finds out the precise distribution, which she should...?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: he can and maybe can still get the two heart tricks as well|pg||

nt|chip: Seniors in ACBL events start at 55 (which is really much too young), though I think all the players here are 60+ .|pg||

mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: tempting|pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S looks fairly easy but on heart lead there are complications|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4d alerted by Pollack, not by Feldman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: when the opponents are bidding, you can play closer to double dummy and bid lighter games.|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one maybe a hair too light, but lucky lie of cards...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can certainly make 3|pg||
nt|chip: I think XX was like a NT bid (values, but only 2 spades).|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|grebrof: 2@cs - 1@h - 1ruff - hmmm|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jgc: 4@S is a maginal vulnerable contract here but they won't reach it|pg||
nt|grebrof: isnt it always 9|pg||
nt|chip: On a D or spade lead the club ruff goes away.|pg||
nt|psyck: this will be ducked & that would take the contract a couple down|pg||
nt|psyck: could even be more down depending on declarers line...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mugsmate:  3S non forcing with both opponents bidding is a perfectly normal treatment|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  And indeed is what they play.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west hasnt shown his 2 suiter - i would have bid 4@H instead of double|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 8, 4@h made by EW.  Apparently North lead @SA and south played K from Kx (?)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: my misclick|pg||
nt|chip: 1D was precision, so 3D showed a real D suit.  To be fair, 3N is not exactly laydown (if spades were 5-3 would go down).|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, there are many layouts where 3nt wouldnt be right - maybe thats why he should have bid 2nt first|pg||

mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: i think you should play transfers over 3nt overcall, so there is something in between pass and 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: especially to me|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, they slam is not great|pg||
nt|chip: A lot of bidding for two hands without much.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mugsmate:  3D is a normal contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: well - I guess 2nt would show a decent opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i agree Martin   but they still might get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: which he has|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: gave E a chance to double several things, so easier for W to lead a D.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: a learned kib says 3@d asked & 3@h showed a balanced min|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|jgc: After the lead it is really routine|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: or some machinery to learn about flavor of the 3N bid|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|grebrof: balanced fitjump and minimum - thats new to me :)|pg||
nt|psyck: sry, rather, 3@d showed min, 3@h asked, & 3@s showed bal...|pg||
nt|grebrof: but ok - they landed in a good contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: ok another push|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kjadams: should be D2.  One of the kings will score.  |pg||

nt|kareno: It is a shoddy twelve count|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players taking a break atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they just returned |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the 6 imp lead really belongs to O'Rourke|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  back and forth|pg||
nt|chip: So the lead flips again.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@cs was as Krishna says, not a fitjump, but the sequence after found S with a balanced minumum - here more tricks in @s NS|pg||
mb|1C|nt|grebrof: yepp|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: that's why we say  keep your seatbelt on until play comes to complete stop|pg||
mb|1S|nt|atlantajon:  one of the specs...asked me why run from 3nt.  I was explaining that this is not BAM...or match points....therefore an 8 card major fit is a safer.....most of the time|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: but now you can see match effectively over as no way for kasle to gain on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a great comeback for Larsen team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O'Rourke wins the other semi-final|pg||
nt|jgc: Hmm - I don't get 1@S|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  Marc is getting bold here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 2@D drury?!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/2 must be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card drury|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes   other room has finished play|pg||
nt|chip: O'rourke beat Morse in last year's final.|pg||
nt|grebrof: like when they dont play the last session?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2/2 means  2-over-2    i.e. new suit after 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: and now "everyone" watching is probably right it was only 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jgc: 12 HCP outside @C and at least 3 card-support for any othe rsuit - I'm a doubler|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  got off the hook....|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  K & R 22: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A543+AK83+A6+AQ4 |pg||
nt|kjadams: He had 2N available as 4 card raise with shortness.|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I agree|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  might be making with that lead|pg||
nt|jgc: All I can say is WOW!|pg||
nt|grebrof: there was this german pair that argued so much, they had to stop playing a session already started (which they normally never do)|pg||
nt|chip: After being conservative last hand, see if they can stay low here when it is right.|pg||
nt|grebrof: there are long days for operators too - and remember this is not official|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: board 62 makes only 4 will correct shortly|pg||
nt|psyck: ok|pg||
nt|grebrof: how about the way they played it at 58?|pg||
nt|psyck: with the match so tight, every imp matters :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: I got some messages there too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator Dan (excellent work)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: on  13  where Feldman didn't bid    Krekorian did transfer with @SKQJ @HJxxxx @Dxx @CT9x   but they stopped in 2@H|pg||
nt|grebrof: yeah - its almost MPs now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kjadams: the singleton diamond would not have gotten them to game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to all the spectators for their comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks always fun|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think their 2@D opener rules out many of the hands that give Pollack good shot at game|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  this will bring it close again....as they tried 3nt in other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: note the distortion needed with 2 way stayman, 2@H equivalent of 2@D in regular Drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O"Rourke 129 ,Lall 95|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fabsayc: some play all new suits forcing after an overcall, but i agree with kaplan rule only 2/2 forcing|pg||
nt|chip: and they do.. I think a D shift now might beat 2H.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mugsmate:  I was having a sidebet with Hedy over whether he'd cue opposite a passed hand.|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@D sign-off in 4@H |pg||
nt|mugsmate:  She won.|pg||
nt|chip: North is hoping for Ax of spades in partner I guess.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: 2 way drury i mean :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mugsmate:  He doesn't want to pick up any possible trump queen in his partner's hand or lead away from a King into a very strong hand.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|grebrof: this late in the match, its dangerous to stay out of the games that makes - not that this is an obvious one to be in|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mugsmate:  Allerton may have deduced the spade King was more likely to be with south because of that club lead.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kjadams: true, though finding the 4-4 heart fit not often needed given the 5-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|grebrof: a @c lead is often good - cause sometimes P cant bid them when he has them |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|jgc: As I said before Jake is a GREAT pro|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  With no spade King, perhaps south would have prefered to lead spades.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that both Norths PASS over Precision 1@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: action is going too fast to follow. robinson is a speedy guy|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yes  like 6-card suit to overcall at 2-level  but 1@D-2@C has maximum preemptive value|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Dan Parish, good job|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: 3C is real here, never 3 card suit.  They have artificial means of forcing without 4 clubs.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: via 2@C forcing rebid|pg||
nt|kjadams: right.|pg||

mb|4C|nt|atlantajon:  2 hearts squeeked home in the other room....tight defense can beat this though|pg||
nt|chip: O'rourke likely to pick up 3 imps on the hand EW were -200 in 3N to make the match tighter.|pg||
nt|psyck: W bid his hand with 2@d, didnt think he would bid again|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kjadams: 4D would have been RKC.   4N I have to ask about later.|pg||
mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  Marc should pick up the whole S suit now|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like 2H can go down if declarer misguesses (either spades or D's).|pg||
nt|grebrof: I agree|pg||
nt|grebrof: @h bid at N didnt make his hand better either|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Finals tomorrow at 1:00 pm PST|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does rest of the panel support O'Rourke decision to PASS instead of negative dbl?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
pc|d4|nt|grebrof: his P could have had a better entry no matter if he passed the 2@h or not I guess|pg||
nt|psyck: anyway, didn't matter much, not too much difference beteween @d partial making or @c contract -1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: 4nt may be forward going but what does it ask for, not clear he only needs diamond control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: players commenting on the strength of robinson's dummy. "wow!"|pg||
nt|kjadams: if 4N forward going, not sure what Robinson was waiting for.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW were near perfect till this last board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for a change i am in the right time zone|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  I like winning the AH and cashing C then leading small Diamond.|pg||
nt|chip: If declarer guesses well can always make.|pg||
nt|grebrof: many think 2@h should be better than that, but I think you have to bid sometimes - I wouldnt call it an overbid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|grebrof: 2@c I meant|pg||
nt|psyck: After this deal is over, kibs can catch the finish in the open room with voice commentary.|pg||
