mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: good afternoon, can we get player names please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS must be Schermer-Chambers|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: no way|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Larsen in the other room and Pollack-Feldman play a strong @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: if only playing semi-forcing 1nt i would use one of the bergen raises to show a 3 card limit raise|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: in fact NS can make 4 with some good guessing|pg||

nt|fabsayc:  multi, can be 4441 20+ also|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: 2d is alerted. to explain the players ar epointing to the convention card |pg||
nt|roswolf: the multi wont help e/w either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chambers-Schermer play a true Multi 2@D   a) 6@H/@S, 5-11 HCP  b) 20+ HCP, any 4441 |pg||
nt|roswolf: yt for info al|pg||
nt|roswolf: i likw leaping michaels here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in ACBL  pairs that play any form of Multi  must provide written copy the 2 options found in ACBL Defense Database|pg||
mb|d|an|13-15 bal or any strong hand|nt|roswolf: 4@C shows @C + a major - hopefully not the openers!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND  the opponents are allowed to use the write-up during the auction|pg||
nt|dkkello:  bidding often go very ecsotic on hands like this |pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl may lead to a tortuous auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree kjell|pg||
nt|sybarra2: geoffrey,  would you prefer to bid 2 @H? |pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|dkkello:  vest having a hard time showing @H and @C now|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: RDBL  asks for the major|pg||
nt|roswolf: no i double planning to double again to show a good hand - std defence in UK the home of the multi|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: unless playing leaping michaels - the fact i had 6 hearts and only 5 clubs would not dissuade me|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should bid 6 now!?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schermer also had option to PASS saying   "i'm willing to play 2@DX"|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I think leaping michaels over multi.....hope you discussed it |pg||
nt|dkkello:  here E could easily have a huge @C fit , you will never know ..|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I must say,  I would pass with N hand  (willing to play 2 @D X)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  maybe time to give up 3@D natural over multi?|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  leaping michaels not part of standard defenses in part because you would not know which major the leaper had|pg||
nt|roswolf: well I HAVE - to show a big 2 suiter is a good use of an idle bid (4@C) IMO|pg||
nt|sybarra2: how about 3 @d?   is that natural? |pg||
nt|sybarra2: probably for most|pg||
nt|roswolf: we may be here some time - west will take his time|pg||
nt|sybarra2: :( sorry |pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf: yes 3@D = NAT OVERCALL  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ACBL approved defenses to multi   http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|roswolf: good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  sure All N have an "easy" "  pass with EK10xxx in @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: age hasnt affected west's judgment|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I am saying that maybe , just maybe , someone should find another defense against multi .. 2 @D  .... |pg||
nt|fabsayc:  there is some hint that club queen onside as a result of north redouble promising some points|pg||
nt|sybarra2: I do not think it is "finding"  it is making sure you and pard agree |pg||
nt|fabsayc:  still seems at best a 50-50 proposition|pg||
nt|sybarra2: what ever you play |pg||
pc|s6|nt|dkkello:  true one down !  ??|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||

nt|dkkello:  w vill be happy .always difficult against multi |pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room over a standard weak 2@S west used std michaels|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: wold/bates are comparing the written defense notes right now. wold wanted to highlight something to bates|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed kjeld|pg||

nt|fabsayc: queen could not gain|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|atlantajon:  leaping micheals for anyone?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|copeyj: 1@S froM Allerton and X from Forrester|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 2@C and 2@D openings for EW are Intermediate, but not sure about shape requirements|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|copeyj: Choice for Gold now but 2@H likely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: total trick followers need more than all fingers and toes|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: not the time for passing the double out|pg||
nt|copeyj: and that will end things|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't think Gold was even close to passing|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  perhaps rose thought the hand was TOO good for leaping micheals.....for the intermediate player.  leaping micheals is explained here.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaping_Michaels|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kyle thought about dbling before passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Mark asked about 3spades, Kyle wrote something about asking...|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: certainly not with ARF as his pard:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: schermer took the high road with 3nt rebid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha, interesting treatment|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  goingto be hard for him to bid 6h...after the 4d call.  |pg||
mb|6H|nt|fabsayc: not that it helps much on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C was artificial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|atlantajon:  well done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: i think auction has derailed now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mugsmate:  Also, if west bids there, he's likely to get that suit lead which is probably bad here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low club need declarer will have to play diamonds immediately to make|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  in retrospect....leaping micheals would have made it harder to get there....|pg||
pc|s6|nt|copeyj: Yes I don't think you can introduce @D - you have enough that it is likely to be a part score hand so no prospect of really "stealing"|pg||
nt|kjadams: Hi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome John|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kjadams: system too good here?  3N a likely make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers intended 4@C as non-forcing is my guess, sequence so rare that followups not clear|pg||
pc|sT|nt|copeyj: 3 trumps 2@C i think declarer can manage the rest though|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  unlesss rose bid 4s...over 4h|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: club return too tough i guess|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pc|h8|nt|copeyj: hmm the defence can previal now I think.. |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: this was well judged auction by all   only way to do better would be slower paths that stopped in GAME|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: unless they give the @D ruff - i think that is letting it through again|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N FG raise I am guessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Osborne can now show @H shortage and extras|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: doesn;t fit well with Jeffrey;s hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but a lot of gharp values|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  This won't encourage Allerton.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Voice Commentary  [in both rooms]|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
nt|copeyj: a normal auction once Osborne had showed shortage - always a conundrum with singleton A|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Perhaps Osbourne should have showed the hand as strong balanced, but that's not ideal either.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 2@D  2-way checkback  game force|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: so 3@D = 5@D, not 3@H|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: tough contract|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|kjadams: well done on auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kjadams: the play will be a form of Morton's fork.   If Robinson wins the diamond ace, that establishes two pitchs for spades, and if not,  e/w do not get a diamond.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: puts 3rd hand under a lot of pressure|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: common agreement is that new suit at 3 level needs EITHER  extra values  or extra shape  [5+ 2nd suit]\|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: chambers should have ditched two diamonds, much clearer then|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: auto raise to game by east|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 1nt not double|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 4333 hands dont belong in 43 fits, should be easy rule to remember|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: doesn't know how many partner has...|pg||
nt|kjadams: this hand a good test of methods.   Over a support X, what is 2D in your system?  I like non-forcing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for me need two top honours to invite|pg||
mb|4D|nt|copeyj: Frances Hinden says this is either to play in 2@S or 3 suited short in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 2@H = to play 2@S or shortage in @S (according to Hinden/Allerton card)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok ty|pg||
nt|roswolf: if this is a diamond slam try then they may well bid the slam - ouch|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  The way he's bid it, he's showed WHICH 5 card minor.|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think they would reach a slam - a lack of @C control would be revealed at some point I would have thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for me   you need transportation of much better hand to accept|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mugsmate:  Having an extra round of bidding can't help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but no matter what you cant pass 3nt with north hand lacking either top honour|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  then Hedy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree with you about 2@D|pg||
nt|kjadams: the principle is that partner forced me to bid by doubling and I can Q with a good hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other options  1@D-2@C game force [ugh]   or 1@D-1N [natural, non force  OY]|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: they are behind in a match with 10 bds only to go - logic often therefore goes by the wall|pg||
nt|roswolf: still no adventures today|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a sllight variation here but another push|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: 1nt is fine, is not going all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: The Science of Bidding Mediocre 8 Card Suits     won't be on your bookstand anytime soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   what does   1@D-3@C//3N-4@C   show/ask|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably the north hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of 3@C=invitational [ so non-forcing]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice from high above  commenting on how Jacobus very capable of @HJ false card |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kjadams: neither diamonds nor hearts a happy contract.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Robinson would prefer a much faster pace|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: too deep  but would be interesting if Jacobus duck @DQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: More IMPs to Allfrey on board 6, 3Dx-4 by NS when EW here were in 5@C-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpv: Gold-Forrester going to get coffee|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd6 e/w in the other room got caught badly and went fpr -800 nv|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is fizzling out - Allfrey will win the match and the event and will play in the Camrose etc - well done|pg||

nt|jgc: This contract is not exactly laydown|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  now ...on this auction....north rates to hold the Qs......so it is either the end play in diamonds...or slam down the AK of spades.....whats your choice John?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kjadams: the steady stream of imps continues for the Kasle team.|pg||
nt|jgc: Well, if Rose finds out the precise distribution, which she should...?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  north started with 8 clubs....and wil have 2 heeats|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  and 1 diamond...therefore 2 spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c9|nt|jgc: ...so the a priori play is @SQ with S|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: cannot read alert sorry. wold is the only one with nice handwriting|pg||
mb|2N|an|leb|nt|ahollan1: not suction which shows  either the next higher suit or the other 2-suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but never the suit that is bid :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: then enough already |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N lebensohl   expects Bates to bid 3@C|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc:  seems to me lebensohl unmodified does not apply after transfer overcalls|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: or might still apply and chambers telling his hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: why do you say that Martin?   especially if they can transfer to 4-card suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  the point is you have an extra bid of 2@S available so i would expect only weak lebensohl hands|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the 1 nt bid,   I think N will guess he can ruff with 9 |pg||

nt|sybarra: or only lose the 2 @H |pg||
nt|fabsayc:  heart ace now|pg||

nt|fabsayc: so down to a four board match|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mugsmate:  But I think David thought his low club after hA was suit preference.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 6@SX anyone!?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kjadams: Invite with east hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: tempting|pg||

mb|p|nt|jjsb: sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@S looks fairly easy but on heart lead there are complications|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 4d alerted by Pollack, not by Feldman|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kjadams: when the opponents are bidding, you can play closer to double dummy and bid lighter games.|pg||
nt|kjadams: this one maybe a hair too light, but lucky lie of cards...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can certainly make 3|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p!|mb|p|nt|jgc: 4@S is a maginal vulnerable contract here but they won't reach it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  3S non forcing with both opponents bidding is a perfectly normal treatment|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  And indeed is what they play.|pg||
nt|roswolf: west hasnt shown his 2 suiter - i would have bid 4@H instead of double|pg||
nt|rmb1: On board 8, 4@h made by EW.  Apparently North lead @SA and south played K from Kx (?)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe decide in favor of 1N because pinochle|pg||

nt|sybarra: only thing is not all of the kbbers are listening,  so sometimes we have to say what the voice commentary is talking about |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rose Meltzer also unexpectedly opened 1N last set with 5431 and stiff Ace|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: once again chambers is the only relaxed looking person of the four|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: yes that was my point,  some either listen OR read |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sybarra: many do not do both |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: right  some feedback i get is  they listen to voice and ignore written so they can focus just on the cards|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  12   where O'Rourke passed (3@S)-3N    Meltzer took slightly different view    JUMPED to 6@H|pg||
nt|jgc: aha - proved wrong once again|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ugh|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@S seems dangerous|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  that happens often|pg||
nt|atlantajon:  LOL|pg||

nt|ahollan1: now the 6 imp lead really belongs to O'Rourke|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|atlantajon:  one of the specs...asked me why run from 3nt.  I was explaining that this is not BAM...or match points....therefore an 8 card major fit is a safer.....most of the time|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: but now you can see match effectively over as no way for kasle to gain on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a great comeback for Larsen team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O'Rourke wins the other semi-final|pg||

nt|atlantajon:  Marc is getting bold here.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: 2@D drury?!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/2 must be forcing|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/2 means  2-over-2    i.e. new suit after 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jgc: 12 HCP outside @C and at least 3 card-support for any othe rsuit - I'm a doubler|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|mugsmate:  Allerton may have deduced the spade King was more likely to be with south because of that club lead.|pg||
