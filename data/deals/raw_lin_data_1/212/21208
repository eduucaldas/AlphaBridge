mb|p|nt|mdgraham: on this auction, @s9|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jallerton: 5-card suit or better major?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: One of the top American players - I think it is Kit Woolsey - advocates a 4cM lead rather than a 5cm|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jallerton: This is where the hybrid scoring makes things difficult. @s lead looks right if the objective is to cut down overtricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then you find out that partner had @cKQx.... |pg||
nt|jallerton: ...but if partner can't open the bidding, club suit looks to provide best route to 5 defensive tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: So for me: @s at matchpoints, @c at IMPs. ?? at Lederer scoring|pg||

nt|jallerton: Yes, accurate defence from the Scots|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unfortunately the failure to knock out the @cQ rather marks the heart king with North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so in all likelihood a flat board|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: NS UDCA|pg||

nt|athene: ruff diamond and if they break you can go @SAK and play a diamond throwing the @H5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  EW could have taken the first three tricks on an unlikely spade lead, but North not really in danger of going down with the friendly heart position|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphztg: if he plays low from dummy, Jones must play AQ I think or he may be strip squeezed|pg||

nt|jallerton: 2 trumps, 1 heart to lose. It's looks like declarer needs to guess @d to go one off. Can't go wrong in the @d suit here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|athene: north can double 2@H i guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphztg: Likely to get the clubs wrong here for -1 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe not totally clearcut, since the deal might be a misfit|pg||
nt|athene: and you are vul|pg||
nt|athene: east might just have a stack in both minors|pg||
nt|athene: passing 2@H worked out well, for sure|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i expect 2@h is constructive, so probably just looking for the better game|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT was a good descriptive bid:  extras + both minors locked up|pg||
nt|paulg:  unfortunately there is no good game|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: some would feel obliged to raise with that hand even though the soft minor-suit stuff is all wasted|pg||

mb|3D|nt|joest: that's all we can ask :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzps: °°@S@S This is the last board of the Championship. Let me thank our commentators:|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@H@H Dan Neill and William Frisby @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@d@d This show came from the cooperation of BBO with F.I.G.B. (Italian Fed). |pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@c@c So our super stars are @hFred Gitelman, @hUday Ivatury and @hRoland Wald from BBO's side and Gianluca Frola and @HFrancesco Natale from FIGB's side :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: a straightforward 4@s would seem in order here: unless you are worried you are too good|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT is often played as 'a good 4@s bid"|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may also be a splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is a splinter without intervention|pg||
nt|joest: I think we will see some NT call in NOrth's future: "pick a minor partner"  I doubt North will let 4@s rest|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|vugraphztg: Surely N was worth a bid , unkess he thought x showed just hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|joest: so a straightforward 4@c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: 6nt basically on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: played in 3 Nt closed room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: i wonder what 1nt showed? surely it might be less than that|pg||
nt|athene: so you might expect west to make another move over 3nt|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: and now 4NT showing shorter diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joest: the two 4-1 minor splits means some handling charges |pg||
nt|joest: Zia may well correct to 5@d|pg||
nt|joest: if for no other reason than maybe he can ruff out the clubs in diamonds.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d5|nt|vugraphztg: Zia checking carding methods...standard|pg||

nt|jallerton: to invent a new 2@d opening, you mean?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes, "we play the Diamond two diamond" ...|pg||
nt|jallerton: It depends on my partner, Mike. With most I play either a Multi or a weak 2 in @d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|d|mb|1N|nt|rmb1: I know Jeffrey doesn't play a benji 2@D.  I had a ruling/bidding problem for him during the week, and he denied being a typical benji bidder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: 1@d = natural or 11-13 bal|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h4|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with most of my partners, a weak two in diamonds, but with one we play it as 6-9, 4+@D and a five-card major - Ekren variant. Works surprisingly well |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rmb1: Even on a red suit lead, the defence only had 6 tricks.  So 1NT= and swing to Premier League|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|d|mb|2C|nt|joest: Now I do think there is a place for four card suit overcalls.|pg||
nt|joest: This hand does not qualify IMHO|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  and that place is a galaxy far far away?|pg||
nt|joest: no not at all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so 1@d is 11/13 balanced or natural unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: trumps look the best option, but from jx?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphztg: Brilliancy prize lead?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joest: since 1D was nebulous, Bell might be thinking of 3@d|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest: so Zia's activity has the effect of jostling east-west into a poor spot|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 2@d just a good @s raise|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  would be a more comfortable double if 1@d was natural|pg||
nt|joest: seeing four spades in dummy is a great disappointment I'm sure|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|vugraphztg: NS reverse carding|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|joest: the open room began with board 22 I believe|pg||
nt|joest: so we are just now beginning to have comparisons|pg||
nt|paulg:  the good news for Bell is that he has little choice in how to play this heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: the bad news is he has only one entry to play hearts and may choose it to hook clubs instea|pg||
nt|joest: instead|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the defence may lead clubs at some point|pg||
pc|dK|nt|joest: like now |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|joest: I'm trying to think why it might be important for Zia to play clubs now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphztg: this defence if looking a bit iffy now|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: If he plays a club N must go up and cash his heart quickly|pg||

nt|rmb1: @S now or declarer has two ruffs in hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: surprising North didn't play another trump himself|pg||
nt|mdgraham: eight tricks on a trump exit - nine if not|pg||
nt|jallerton: surely declarer would have played @hJ at trick 2 holding @hKQ|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: Thanks to The LMBA and theYoung Chelsea for running th event|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Last hand and Scotland not on the scoresheet yet!|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: I am told that declarer went down in the other room on 3 rounds of clubs, a diamond up then a 4th round|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|joest: 1@s really?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: yes, but bot by Zia :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: not|pg||
nt|joest: thx :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  interesting, i would not expect 1@s from Byrne to show spades ... but I don't know all the TriBal system|pg||
nt|joest: but paul it's not clear they do either! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: just kidding folks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: restart tomorrow at 1300 GMT 1400 ECT|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: Zia trying to look at dummy with the ace of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I'm not sure how good a spotthis is, but I doubt it will make with the cards as they are|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|joest: a more attractive lead if dummy has promised only four|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  so many people, especially Europeans, swap double and 1@s after a 1@d overcall|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I've been told that they don't do that|pg||
nt|joest: i play transfers there|pg||
nt|paulg:  i play transfers too|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|paulg:  This is the last hand for this match, they'll all be back in 30 minutes for match 3|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks to Guy Hart, our excellent operator and to Jack for his perceptive commentary|pg||
nt|joest: thanks Paul.   And thanks to our operator, Guy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Specially thanks to my TriBal support group and other kibitzers|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Thanks everyone for watching - back soon|pg||
nt|paulg:  they missed the 'easy' slam on board 20 in the other room|pg||
nt|paulg:  so a good win for the Gold Cup team|pg||
nt|joest: they might not have chose to open 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: indeed, 1@h opening|pg||
nt|paulg:  they bid 1@h-1@s-4@h, which is not a great sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 1@h-1@s-4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: :)|pg||
nt|joest: on a diamond switch, east would need to go up king|pg||
nt|joest: if he plays low, South would need to make the strong play of the jack to unwind the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at  least the SJ is doubleton, so you can take a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: north decides just to lead his partner's suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pc|dJ|nt|vugraphztg: no reason not to take this finesse -  a spae would have been better|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: but Waterlow a bit off the boil this match|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|vugraphztg: Though my neighbour just said that if he'd played the spade he would have been squeezed in the end |pg||
pc|s2|nt|joest: now Zia out with the diamond jack and that is that|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Thanks all - see you tomorrow|pg||
