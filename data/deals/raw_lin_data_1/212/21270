mb|p|nt|fabsayc: good afternoon, can we get player names please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS must be Schermer-Chambers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no way|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Meltzer-Larsen in the other room and Pollack-Feldman play a strong @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: if only playing semi-forcing 1nt i would use one of the bergen raises to show a 3 card limit raise|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: in fact NS can make 4 with some good guessing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: the team names are reversed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: the real rarget for team hinden is to win the match by 14+ imps so as to win the event|pg||
nt|copeyj: big ask but 20 boards to go|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: something is wrong  EW pair play Larsen|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: true simon|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|copeyj: This looks like a fairly normal result|pg||
pc|hK|nt|copeyj: Can't imagine N/S not getting to the 3 level in @C after W bids 2@H|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfd: Boyd is asking Pollack about a carding agreement..|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this table needs to close and restart or we will have chaos|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|sybarra: this looks like a slam |pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: EW are out for 500 in 7@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: the next set they pushed on and won it |pg||
nt|othered1: so buying the contract may be the best NS can do|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: or, as it's pointed out, 300 in 6@S, with friendly @S break|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: will Kyle bid again ? |pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so what?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sybarra: maybe he should have 5 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|othered1: Or as is counterpointed out, 6@S can go for 500 on @C ruffs with @D back|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: and a suggestion by another spec,  is 5 @C over 2 @C  exclusion |pg||
nt|sybarra: but is that exclusion??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: certainly would be exclusion, but they may not play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Certainly pass would be forcing here, after north's strong auction, wouldn' it?|pg||

nt|othered1: I'd open 1@D in a natural system and deal with rebid later.  Not the worst thing to overbid a bit to 2@H or 2N over 1@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N FG raise I am guessing|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2 way stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Osborne can now show @H shortage and extras|pg||
nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: which is what he has done|pg||
nt|copeyj: doesn;t fit well with Jeffrey;s hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but a lot of gharp values|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  This won't encourage Allerton.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to Voice Commentary  [in both rooms]|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
nt|copeyj: a normal auction once Osborne had showed shortage - always a conundrum with singleton A|pg||
nt|mugsmate:  Perhaps Osbourne should have showed the hand as strong balanced, but that's not ideal either.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D  2-way checkback  game force|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: so 3@D = 5@D, not 3@H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: tough contract|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done on auction|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kjadams: the play will be a form of Morton's fork.   If Robinson wins the diamond ace, that establishes two pitchs for spades, and if not,  e/w do not get a diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads are always Rusinow  [2nd of touching honors]|pg||

mb|d|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card Drury.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rooms were opened incorrectly  and decision is to NOT close/reopen the Open Room which controls the situation|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3S|nt|copeyj: some interest to the play here|pg||
nt|kjadams: Robinson had available a short suit GT/ST or a long suit ST, chose not to reveal anything.|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: Forrester has a horrible hand to lead from|pg||
nt|copeyj: nothing attractive|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: probably try finesse here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so  really O'Rourke +10|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i flipped both :(|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 3rd quarter score in the other match O'Rourke 110, Lall 73|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess there are some layouts where you might get to discard all the diamonds on spades, so not totally on the hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: Allerton has found a better line - ruff a @H and throw a @D|pg||

nt|dkkello:  always happend when i open 1 NT on a hand like this ..|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C might be a "bad" acceptance   |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: players taking a break atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: they just returned |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now the 6 imp lead really belongs to O'Rourke|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: but now you can see match effectively over as no way for kasle to gain on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a great comeback for Larsen team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O'Rourke wins the other semi-final|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D drury?!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/2 must be forcing|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kjadams: 2D is 4 card drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2/2 means  2-over-2    i.e. new suit after 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcwla:  K & R 22: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=A543+AK83+A6+AQ4 |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator Dan (excellent work)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on  13  where Feldman didn't bid    Krekorian did transfer with @SKQJ @HJxxxx @Dxx @CT9x   but they stopped in 2@H|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|kjadams: the singleton diamond would not have gotten them to game.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to all the spectators for their comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks always fun|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: note the distortion needed with 2 way stayman, 2@H equivalent of 2@D in regular Drury|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: O"Rourke 129 ,Lall 95|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: some play all new suits forcing after an overcall, but i agree with kaplan rule only 2/2 forcing|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|mugsmate:  I was having a sidebet with Hedy over whether he'd cue opposite a passed hand.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: 2 way drury i mean :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|mugsmate:  He doesn't want to pick up any possible trump queen in his partner's hand or lead away from a King into a very strong hand.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|mugsmate:  Allerton may have deduced the spade King was more likely to be with south because of that club lead.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kjadams: true, though finding the 4-4 heart fit not often needed given the 5-4 spade fit.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mugsmate:  With no spade King, perhaps south would have prefered to lead spades.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other room we started to discuss South  PASS vs DBL [showing 4@S]   we never considered  2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  @D  to 9, and A, @S to Q, @D to Q and now @H!! - if decl go up on A then a ruff with @HJ - hans to play small @H from !Q|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 4 @H hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you decide to DBL --- you have to include comment about what you bid when cross-hand-opponent does NOT have 4@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Punt?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: last board, thanks to our operator Dan Parish, good job|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kjadams: 3C is real here, never 3 card suit.  They have artificial means of forcing without 4 clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: via 2@C forcing rebid|pg||
nt|kjadams: right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: excellent club slam here.   tough for Boyd to visualize it.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kjadams: 4D would have been RKC.   4N I have to ask about later.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfd: Finals tomorrow at 1:00 pm PST|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does rest of the panel support O'Rourke decision to PASS instead of negative dbl?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: 4nt may be forward going but what does it ask for, not clear he only needs diamond control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: players commenting on the strength of robinson's dummy. "wow!"|pg||
nt|kjadams: if 4N forward going, not sure what Robinson was waiting for.|pg||
