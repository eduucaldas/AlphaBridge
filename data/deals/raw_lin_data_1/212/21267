mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes agree, Henry,  2 versions of defense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the version that is played by most North American pairs shouldn't really be called "multi"  since there is only one option   weak 2-major opening|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfc: attitude leads for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one thing we haven't mentioned about last hand   after the 2@C bid from West  the new suit from doubler doesn't need to be as strong as new suit with no interference|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for people who play checkback/new minor force   make sure you and partner are on same page if  opener holds BOTH  3-fit for your major AND 4 in other major|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  what is top priority     [also discuss if opener clarifies min/max]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is no standard approach so just agreeing to the name of the convention is insufficient|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i suspect the most common agreement of those you see on vugraph -- focus on support for responder's major|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if looking for Other Major -- you can still find out later|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and why bother giving opponents the extra info when responder was just looking for 53 fit|pg||
nt|kareno: South must get diamonds right.  |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: Henry just said on Voice -- he focuses on Hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a Grosvener.  He can duck now and make it easily|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he ducks this should we ask where the mirrors are? |pg||
nt|kareno: West led a low club.  No mirrors required really.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: KOZ asking about leads ag NT -- attitude|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: now S can cue |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this way   Kozlove has NOT shown primary support   [4-fit or Honor-3rd]|pg||
nt|kareno: In my case I want to outlive certain politicians (and don't ask me to name names :) )  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they might find @D this way   but no way over  1@S-2@H//3@H|pg||

nt|sybarra: true |pg||
nt|kareno: Not quite all, Al, but I'm not telling anyway.  I already outlived Richard Nixon, and that was a good start :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south seems to have described most of  his hand, though maybe !4D could only be a feature|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: was there any reason S should have cued clubs first?|pg||
nt|othered1: can south presume north's @H are good enough for slam opposite xxx?|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good bid -- now let Kasle guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@H guess would be better|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: No assumptions can be made about north's hearts - he hasn't made a move to slam yet, just forced to game.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfc: Kozlove:  I have no clue|pg||
nt|kareno: I think north eventually will need to go after the double finesse in hearts to make this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 3@D could be just a probe for best game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Kozlove was supposed to bid 5N instead of 6@D    since his 3@H might have been doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very few expert partnerships play  GSF [grand slam force] or Josephine -- most use jumps to 5N as  "pick-a-slam"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will we see this hand in some version of Challenge the Champs as a bidding problem?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|othered1: EW have the  high card edge,  but if south plays 1N, he'll make it|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I think he'll pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this set  12-5     last set there were only 1 or 2 pushes|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 1st to  1nt |pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and East likely to bid it now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it safe to say that PASS of 1@S shows 3-fit?   i.e.  even if [sub]min raise with 4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: that's another point for partnerships to discuss|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes. safe to say.  Never pass with two and perhaps raise with four.|pg||
nt|othered1: not safe, even if logical.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is no safety in logic    [see also  Congress]|pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Gerber -- haven't see THAT in a while|pg||
mb|4D|an|0-3|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: over DBL   frequent treatment is ROP1    RDBL=0  P=1    but  4@D??|pg||
nt|kareno: This may be RKC Gerber. |pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is easy on ruffing @S finesse and that's the odds-on play to take.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're on same wavelength  but   this is 3rd step  so  confusing to me|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kareno: 0/3, 1/4, 2 min, 2 max?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 5@D as lead directing raise of @H??|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: given S hand some might wish they were playing  wk nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H probably meant as HCP raise rather than shapely shot at game|pg||

nt|kareno: It's the Edgar Kaplan theory to be tested here.  12 opposite 12 - will it make 3nt?|pg||

nt|sybarra: word of advice for anyone needing ice on knee or elbow or something,  my friend brought me 2 bags of frozen peas  |pg||
nt|sybarra: works like a charm! |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|kareno: Oh, yes, used 'em when I had knee surgery.|pg||
nt|othered1: If declarer wants to play @C first, there was a real case to win the first trick with the K to preserve a dummy entry|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that works best -- if you keep them in the bag|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes in the bag!!  and light towel wrapped around the bag so no freezer burn on knee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW describe their signalling as  "philosophy is need to know"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so Chambers @H5 and @D3  guarantee ...  the  @H5 and @D3|pg||
