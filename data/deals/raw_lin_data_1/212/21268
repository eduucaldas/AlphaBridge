mb|p|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: via 2@C forcing rebid|pg||
nt|kjadams: right.|pg||
nt|kjadams: excellent club slam here.   tough for Boyd to visualize it.|pg||
mb|4N|an|forward going|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kjadams: 4D would have been RKC.   4N I have to ask about later.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: 4nt may be forward going but what does it ask for, not clear he only needs diamond control|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: players commenting on the strength of robinson's dummy. "wow!"|pg||
nt|kjadams: if 4N forward going, not sure what Robinson was waiting for.|pg||
