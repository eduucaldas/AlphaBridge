mb|p|nt|roswolf: Osborne- Allerton, play A fairly vanilla strong NT, 2/1 system with a semi-forcing NT and artificial rebids after 1M  1NT.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: that is a direct quote from frances hinden|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3@H on south hand as the pressure bid, pass not even an option|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|copeyj: N/S are 14-16 NT, 5cM, prepared 1@C opener with artificial response structure, multi and constructive 2s in the majors|pg||

nt|copeyj: I don't think Gold was even close to passing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: certainly not with ARF as his pard:)|pg||

mb|p|pc|s8|nt|mugsmate:  Also, if west bids there, he's likely to get that suit lead which is probably bad here.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a low club need declarer will have to play diamonds immediately to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: well that guarantees 3 trump tricks for the defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: Yes I don't think you can introduce @D - you have enough that it is likely to be a part score hand so no prospect of really "stealing"|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kjadams: system too good here?  3N a likely make.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: chambers intended 4@C as non-forcing is my guess, sequence so rare that followups not clear|pg||

mb|d|an|cards|nt|ahollan1: NS CC from 2009 Bermuda Bowl  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/woolsey-stewart.pdf|pg||
mb|2S|an|pass or correct|nt|grebrof: as some kibs say, S drew N to bidding 3@h - normally you have something better than than VUL vs nonvul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 2@D=Weak 2@H/@S [5/6 card], 1/3 fav usually 5M   side 4M fine|pg||
mb|3D|an|hearts|nt|ahollan1: so NS 2@D not really "multi" since only 1 hand type   should really be called Wagner|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: in Norway there is a convention called "Woodgroves multi" - they recorded 2000 hands with it and scored almost 57%|pg||
nt|grebrof: weak multi as NS are playing here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: everyone is reading notes on their defense to multi|pg||
mb|3H|nt|grebrof: just promise a 5card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thx  completely forgot about that|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|grebrof: here it is more and more common that you pass first with a normal opening hand - a dbl is 15-18nt and 2nt a strong 2-suited overcall|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|grebrof: or in Norway that is...|pg||
nt|grebrof: Im not there atm|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: Here we have to distribute standard defenses and the non-multi can read the defenses, pick which to use and discuss them.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

nt|roswolf: this might be exciting - slam zone hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: two chances.   diamond onside, or SQ onside.|pg||

nt|copeyj: with 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: he has a perfcto hand in a sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|mugsmate:  The heart King is actually working because a diamond can go away on it, but Allerton will downrate it and sign off|pg||
nt|kjadams: 6 more imps for Kasle on 34 where other table played 3C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|roswolf: and has|pg||
nt|copeyj: a normal auction once Osborne had showed shortage - always a conundrum with singleton A|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|kjadams: well done on auction|pg||

nt|kjadams: the play will be a form of Morton's fork.   If Robinson wins the diamond ace, that establishes two pitchs for spades, and if not,  e/w do not get a diamond.|pg||

nt|roswolf: passing this looks sensible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: a weakness in strong club systems, but since the clubbers sitting the same way no swing likely|pg||
