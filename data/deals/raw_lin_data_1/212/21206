nt|yke:  sorry 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: East just relayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West showed 6@d 4@h|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S weak relay, 3NT minimum|pg||
pc|h8|nt|panosk: looks like the right contract anyway|pg||
nt|yke:  the name Tarzan precisicion is because it is named after the guy who played tarzan Weismuller, which is almost their names|pg||
nt|panosk: nice one Yke he was Johhny Weismuller yes the 1st tarzan in movies|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to lead @hQ|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yke:  in many auctions, one person relays while the other one just tells what he has|pg||
nt|panosk: Madala has a hard choice for the lead |pg||
nt|yke:  it is always harder to lead against relay auctions, the closed hand is unknown|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yke:  East could have 3 spades or even 6 spades|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: East claiming|pg||
nt|panosk: *without sorry|pg||
nt|yke:  and the shape is determined by what you bid first|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: how many hearts does 2@c promise?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: at lower levels  Muller non-@H bids would deny 2+fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: west is not sure about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe slamtry + @h fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without looking at east hand --  me either :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural seems more likely for a couple of reasons   a) 1@D limited to 15 HCP  b)  deWijs could have only 8 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: 4@c is natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  looks like 2@S will make here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yke:  West passed because they can;t bid 1NT which would be a GF relay|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: I like 4@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: best lead but can it beat it?|pg||

nt|panosk: *you mean finess in spades |pg||
nt|yke:  just duck the @SK|pg||
nt|panosk: or just small spade from hand towards the 10@S|pg||

nt|yke:  ah yes|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: so if not duck then @S finesse J and home|pg||

nt|xenya: seems so|pg||
nt|xenya: for 4 imps to Allegra|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 5  17 most likely|pg||
nt|panosk: gd point from a fellow spec "the only way to beat the contract was after taking cl return h to take away the entry to dummy"|pg||
nt|yke:  so switch to a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: but then you can finesse the @hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: y|pg||
nt|xenya: well,  W did remove a @C entry to dummy -- but he cant't remove both|pg||

nt|ahollan1: he knows Bocchi has either Q or A -- if Madala held both  HE would claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i still think slight edge to actual holding by Madala's PASS over 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or for that matter  PASS of 4@H|pg||

nt|yke:  the 6-6 hand is also a matter of style. In Italy, they like to preemt with pure hands (ie no 2 suiter) but in holland, they like action and most would not think of pass|pg||

nt|yke:  but he can throw a club and two spades|pg||
nt|yke:  then duck a spade to south|pg||
nt|jbennet: 75% or so of all IMP:s are created in the bidding. This half is en exception. Large majority of  IMP:s has been created by play of the cards.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: during recent World Championships  on live vugraph  Zia listed Madala as one of top 3 declarers in the world|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=9-11 HCP, BAL, 1+control  [A=2 K=1]|pg||

mb|p|nt|yke:  nowadays, you hardly see any penalty doubles at the highest level|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: @H9 to show @D I suppose|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: and the first one is the one he intends to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence would fiddle with the cards   first time I kibitzed him it didn't take long to realize he was moving cards according to differnt lines of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: as a adefender or as declarer?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: his alternative move is @cK|pg||
nt|baldjean: My partner puts cards in random order. She says she has no problem sorting them out in her mind, and with random order the place where the card is drawn from does not tell ...|pg||

nt|yke:  victory or the 1@S opening ;)|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: this is/was an impressive set for the italians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver in 3N North|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: i hope you all enjoyed!|pg||
nt|penseur9:  wow...on  45 the OR in only 3@H for a 13 IMPs swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: tomorrow at 11 CET, the first session of the finals start|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzng: 2@c=GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: last board of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala is a bit tired|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG  a) BAL  b) @C  c) @D    [Follow-up from 2010 Euro]|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 45, the German EW failed to get to 4@H -- moreover, they sold out to 3@Smaking. 13 imps to Allegra |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about that last part   it is not for me :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jbennet: 2 clubs might among other things contain 118-20 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  yes thank you Anna (merci beaucoup), great job you did|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Anna :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 18-19|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S= 5@D 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is NOTE for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N must complete  4252 shape   and might clarify strength or honor location in doubletons|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is South worried about @h or @c?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Is 4@s a good contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well they've definitely wrong-sided NT  and deWijs has natural @H lead|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this won't make either|pg||
nt|jbennet: so diffenrece 2 IMPs  after this one??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks also to my fellow co-commentator Vladimir...|pg||
nt|xenya: A thanks Andre|pg||
nt|yke:  2@D is probably hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north showed 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 3sp showing excatly 4 h?|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D cant be made either here i think |pg||
nt|jbennet: unless panicing out an ace.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: down 1 after non @h lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too early in morning for me to figure out if 4@S makes :(|pg||
nt|baldjean: Lools like it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 4@s is off due to @d ruff 2@h and @sA|pg||
nt|jbennet: here its late afternoon.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs @SAxxx is very powerful against 4@S|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jbennet: both 3NT and 5d hangs on the lead.|pg||
nt|yke:  push|pg||
nt|yke:  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess 2@d was 4@h and 3@s was a trf to 3N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: my guess all contracts go down after wrong-side NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is why it is possible to say that 4sp have no chance after 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
pc|c9|nt|penseur9:  don't miss the finals tomorrow, it should be a great show for all|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N has been wrongsided, in a sense, as the killking club lead is much easier for W|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|yke:  maybe he can try to stal a spade tick and then squeeze W|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|jbennet: yet it is vital that EW have adequate signalling methods.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: Johan!   just in time for last board :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|yke:  but he can always thrwo all of his spades|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes west should know that he can discard 2sp+2hearts. but......|pg||
nt|panosk: now @d |pg||
nt|yke:  East needs to keep at least 2 clubs for an entry to cash the @S|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 rounds of diamonds now.|pg||
nt|yke:  its not that obvious, but I think they will prevail|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbennet:  situations like this are common. declarer reeling of a long suit. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzng: North claims for low to @hK|pg||
mc|10|nt|xenya: i think EW's performance over the last few boards has been quite impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we also must thank our great specs who showed great interest and knowledge, we appreciate your comments always|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes EW most impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  to be expected of these 2 players|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing spectacular -- they just bid every game that came their way|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes very interesting for all of us...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while the final outcome seems determined, could you keep the table open Anna until the last board results are known from the other room :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  confirmed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 boards remain in the match   restart in about 15 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: cu|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: back in 15 minutes|pg||
