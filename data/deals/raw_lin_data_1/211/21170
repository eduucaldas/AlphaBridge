mb|2S|nt|gluckenval: a different evaluation between Norby and Henrik Noberius in the CR at board 30... Norby didn't reopen. I agree (obviously) with Bocchi :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@D = retransfer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now deWijs will show exact shape|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: Nanev actually doubled 1NT then de Wijs showed the alert again and he took his bid away before the push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5+5+    3@S = exact 5305|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: I mean Gunev doubled 1NT sry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller discouraged by deWijs shape  but there may still be hands where still worth slam exploration|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his options include   ask controls [A=2 K=1], force signoff, weak slam try|pg||
