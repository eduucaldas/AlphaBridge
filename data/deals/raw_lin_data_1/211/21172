pc|h8|nt|paulg:  EW could have taken the first three tricks on an unlikely spade lead, but North not really in danger of going down with the friendly heart position|pg||

nt|yke:  2@H is probably 5@S + 4@H and about 6-9. It is a convention which is often played because you ae a bit stuck after 1@C 1@S 2@C because 2@H is forcing then|pg||

mb|1H|an|!S|nt|Vugraphzps: °°@S@S This is the last board of the Championship. Let me thank our commentators:|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@H@H Dan Neill and William Frisby @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@d@d This show came from the cooperation of BBO with F.I.G.B. (Italian Fed). |pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@c@c So our super stars are @hFred Gitelman, @hUday Ivatury and @hRoland Wald from BBO's side and Gianluca Frola and @HFrancesco Natale from FIGB's side :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|an|minimum with 4!s|nt|joest: a straightforward 4@s would seem in order here: unless you are worried you are too good|pg||
nt|joest: 3NT is often played as 'a good 4@s bid"|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may also be a splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is a splinter without intervention|pg||
nt|joest: I think we will see some NT call in NOrth's future: "pick a minor partner"  I doubt North will let 4@s rest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: Surely N was worth a bid , unkess he thought x showed just hearts|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: so a straightforward 4@c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: 6nt basically on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: played in 3 Nt closed room|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: i wonder what 1nt showed? surely it might be less than that|pg||
nt|athene: so you might expect west to make another move over 3nt|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|joest: and now 4NT showing shorter diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: the two 4-1 minor splits means some handling charges |pg||

nt|joest: if for no other reason than maybe he can ruff out the clubs in diamonds.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|paulg:  West knows that NS are in a 4-4 diamond fit and might just continue spades|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|joest: 4@s looks to be cold so anything 500 or cheaper is a profit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Zia checking carding methods...standard|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Personaaly I think that it is better to play 1S as the T/O x and x as hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: But it's a matter of choice|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d9|pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and usually suit preference when singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|joest: if partner known to have length, and a choice of cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  Bell trying to reconstruct Byrne's hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|paulg:  he must have a singleton club and hence the @hA|pg||
nt|joest: If Zia covers Byrne can still get a club ruff|pg||
nt|joest: using the heart ten as an entry|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|joest: if Zia ducks..|pg||
nt|joest: good play|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|joest: that turned 500 into 300|pg||
nt|joest: Zia's heart is good so he can just draw trumps and claim now|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|an|!S|nt|joest: Now I do think there is a place for four card suit overcalls.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|an|18-19|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  and that place is a galaxy far far away?|pg||
nt|joest: no not at all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so 1@d is 11/13 balanced or natural unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|joest: since 1D was nebulous, Bell might be thinking of 3@d|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: so Zia's activity has the effect of jostling east-west into a poor spot|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 2@d just a good @s raise|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|nt|joest: the open room began with board 22 I believe|pg||
nt|joest: so we are just now beginning to have comparisons|pg||
nt|paulg:  the good news for Bell is that he has little choice in how to play this heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: the bad news is he has only one entry to play hearts and may choose it to hook clubs instea|pg||
nt|joest: instead|pg||
