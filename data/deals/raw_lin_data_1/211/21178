nt|sybarra: wonder how they ended up in 1 nt,  after a X maybe |pg||
nt|athene: as some would|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf    Jacobs-Thompson plays this system in case you need it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *play|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx roland |pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north perhaps a bit worried his side is in trouble - if partner is light for the double, 1NT might be putting your head above the parapet a bit too much|pg||
nt|sybarra: both of these teams may actually go through to play offs |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: as I understand it the Jacobs team could ecercise their right to  because they won the Aust. championship this year |pg||
nt|athene: only three quick losers (@H, @C, @S) but not ten tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: if south had started with a club then there would have been the ruffing club finesse for ten tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: the only way the Morgan team wont play in the play offs is if the Jacobs team decides to use this line up (then they will need to recruit another local player...)|pg||
nt|athene: if north grabs his ace here that might seem to expose the king, but he can shift to a trump and declarer can't reach hand to ruff the @CK out|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: North thinking |pg||
nt|athene: north wondering whether to unblock the spade but it doesn't seem to matter much|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If not, 2@S 10-13  5+  unbalanced|pg||

nt|Walddk2: For a start, for many people a Namyats would show a suit with no more than one loser opposite a singleton|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: yes for 3 imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not see how Howe can put the k of clubs on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He does not have to|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe k of hts? |pg||
nt|athene: looks natural to want to stop spade ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If West has given honest count in hearts, declarer can't have @CA|pg||
nt|athene: sure, you can overruff, but isn't it better to draw trumps at the same time?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With 3 aces and AJxxxx in hearts Jacobs would have upgraded to 1@H, 14+|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|athene: he might be considering whether to invite in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: 3@D a transfer i assume - normally would be invitational or better|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|nt|athene: south obviously not on the same page|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D a retransfer I  suppose |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: this is real|pg||
nt|athene: blood will be spilled in 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: north just thinks his partner is showing both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and here we are again with strange results |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: blood will flow|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a quick "transfer lebensohl" discussion in the bar afterwards, guys|pg||

nt|athene: yes but you can hold the damage to three spades and @CA|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: you have a choice - can give west the @HK then throw two clubs on hearts, or alternatively ruff clubs and lose more trump tricks|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugrapha3: sorry..something happened|pg||
nt|athene: 11 tricks seems unlikely :) but i can believe he made it|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i will adjust the score at the end|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: it was me pressing wrong button|pg||
nt|sybarra: not like you Traian |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he is still playing|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so blame me ...|pg||
nt|athene: well just tell him he has to make two overtricks|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he made 9|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: yikes,  that means two hands missing?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C natural 5+ clubs unbalanced 10-13 HCP|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: just means some food time will go missing i assume :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: we will have lunch aftr the 2nd set|pg||
nt|athene: now west will surely double if it shows diamonds; not if it is takeout of clubs though|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: so we will restart in 10 mins |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if 2@D guarantees good values (as fantoni nunes play it) you probably want the double to be lead-directing|pg||
nt|sybarra: will they get to play last 2 bds?|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|athene: but if it might often be a light club raise there is a case for playing it as t/o of clubs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugrapha3: one to play|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugrapha3: after this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|athene: i am a bit surprised 3@C went down - even if west gets a heart ruff, surely you can then draw trumps and throw a spade from south on the fourth heart|pg||
nt|athene: so you only lose four tricks either way|pg||
nt|athene: either @DA, @HA, two spades or @DA, @HA, heart ruff but only one spade|pg||
