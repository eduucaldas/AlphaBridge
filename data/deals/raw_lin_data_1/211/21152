nt|odysseus69: good afternoon from London for the start of the 2011 Lederer|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: Victor|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Scotland are here by virtue of their win in the Commonwealth Championship. |pg||

nt|ady: no North decided to respond|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|djneill:  other room used direct Drury raise by north to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: might find K@S switch|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: The scoring is a mixture of BAM (10 doesn't count) and IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: then a heart switch would set this 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 36 VP for the IMPs and 2 per board BAM|pg||

nt|athene: it was a good play from east to force dummy with a club after winning the spade|pg||
nt|athene: othewise declarer could simply cash @HAK and run spades and dummy would still have a trump|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to get trumps right|pg||

nt|athene: let's hope the previous board did not put EW off slams :)|pg||
nt|athene: clearly 7@H makes here but i would expect them to reach six|pg||
nt|djneill:  North might throw in italian 1@s overcall but that would be very aggressive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: scoring in the Lederer is a little unusual - effectively a combination of teams and pairs with the emphasis on the teams aspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: 2 points are available for the winning result on each board to which is added the convereted imps difference|pg||

nt|djneill:  4@d shows @s cue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: well judged by West (as they didn't x)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the club king is the key for 4 spades- taking the save at these colours looked a mistake but surprisingly no double|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|djneill:  West obliged to bid more now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: tricky board    5@D  undoubled may be good for e/w    good go either way|pg||

nt|vugraphztg: well depends if Nev guesses clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|djneill:  West would like @dQ not @sQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare for the limited hand (1nt opener) to take control like this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west wants to show that 6@H-1 last board won't keep him down :)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten for sure by leading K@C   and later puting east on trick with Q@D    not far fetched|pg||
mc|10|nt|djneill:  it appears a finesse will be taken|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is show-up squeezed if needed, very uncomfortable for Mariani|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but west not on lead against 4S|pg||
pg||

nt|paulg:  hi everyone, not sure if I'm in the right place but I like watching the bulgarians|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|paulg:  certainly easier than playing them|pg||
nt|paulg:  Spears' 2@c will be 18-19 balanced, I believe|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: 2 points available for a winning result on each board plus the imps result converted to victory points|pg||
nt|paulg:  Tough decision for Spears on whether to finesse the diamond|pg||
nt|paulg:  the pre-empt suggests that diamonds may be breaking poorly|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|paulg:  of course he cannot make the contract even if he gets the diamonds right, but getting them wrong is a lot of vulnerable undertricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant say that I love Brian Spears treatment of the North hand- however the punishment is likely to be harsh|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  i think he is a little unlucky|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|djneill:  1@d may contain strong NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|djneill:  wow 5@d other room|pg||
nt|djneill:  East forced to game over the strong NT with 7 no Aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@D a little unambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  2@s is very delicate, 4 good trumps yes?|pg||
nt|ady: yes   true   unlickely then 4@S will go down that way|pg||
mb|p|pc|d5|nt|athene: yes 2@S as well|pg||
nt|athene: delicate is one way of putting it|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C might get the job done i suppose|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|athene: of course west doesn't think his partner has a singleton spade|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: so maybe only-2@S worked quite well|pg||
nt|djneill:  South may balance West into game|pg||
nt|athene: if south had bid 3@S west might have been more inclined to take a shot at 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: has a very good hand for a single raise|pg||
nt|djneill:  or E-W can just double 3@s|pg||
nt|athene: so should probably move over 3@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: but after 2nt, she expects her partner to have spade wastage|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: the whole key to the hand is the singleton spade facing no ace, king or queen|pg||
nt|athene: quite hard for EW|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|odysseus69: what now for North?- went quietly - cant really fault that|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: but east should do more than just 2@D first time for sure|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 in each suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|djneill:  West will try to steal a @h before @c run, since can pitch only 2 cards on the clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|djneill:  he did not steal mariani's heart (nor taglias on this auction)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: they started fighting and claimed|pg||
