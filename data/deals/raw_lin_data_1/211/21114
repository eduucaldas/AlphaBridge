nt|roswolf: a pass from west at green - must be inconvenient for his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump cue = mixed raise|pg||

nt|ady: does not seem to good for a simple raise for me|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that you do NOT preempt a preempt  so Verhees has no bid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: just the opposite of standard carding|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 0+@D  but never fewer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 6-6- west  though   can be highly contested|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 1@C rather than 1@D    system must dictate the opener with 44 minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N relay|pg||
nt|ady: needs an ear;y club attack to beat 4@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Lall DBL = Responsive   i.e. takeout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2@d is very aggrassive, even by De Wijs's standards|pg||
nt|roswolf: no half measures for west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=a) 4441@H, any  b) 4@S, BAL, 12-14  c) 5+@S 4+@D, min  or 55 MAX|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: don't try this at home :)|pg||
nt|ady: USA 3 imps on hand 1   4@C -1   and 2nd board could be ok for USA as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S, <FG,  NF   F1 unless 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so PASS=5@S(332)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = min, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ultimate Canape   where 2-suited hands open the SHORTER suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: so  i don't know what vP was doing :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think vP was supposed to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: would not some type of raise in spades be sounder here?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: not much on here    e/w have the balance and a spade fit    but tje 2 level in jeorpardy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: when the players came in the room, the discussion between Zagorin and de Wijs was about the banana of Zagorin, if de WIjs will get the last or the first bite :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can locate shortness or signoff in 3/4@S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought  deWijs might [keyword] bid 3@S to confirm 4-fit, but  doesn't like @CK or red suit holdings|pg||

nt|rhelle: it does seem to have worked, after a fashion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hi all|pg||
nt|barbyh: good stop|pg||
nt|ady: restraint from North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS responses to 2N are unlike any I've seen from other pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = offer to play opposite the weak NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphznt: Sjoert when he puts dummy now, tja... hands you have to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink: Sorry...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps to show  min/max  unbal/bal|pg||
nt|ady: out of their depth|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Al,  with 5/5 max South would bid again over 1 nt? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room delays start of play so that live vugraph has scores for comparisons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: would he rebid spades or diamonds first? |pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle: since declarer has 4 sure losers; 2 in each major, the double @c finesse will have to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count & attitude  odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot card leads vs NT = Attitude|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to go down 3 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Muller saying  he has suit worth continuing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW contract proves     sometimes preempts work|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: could make 4 |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: yes more american imps likely|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: this has its difficulties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in udca  @S4 is ENCOURAGING|pg||

nt|rhelle: and lo and behold ... today, it does :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: faktycznie...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and indeed they do lead 2nd/4th thru declarer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@S = 4-fit   1@S-2@D=art invite maybe 3-fit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: spades also become good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are very few auctions where we have same inferences that are available to NS sequences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bermuda Bowl and Transnational Teams are playing the same set of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@D is only opener that can have 2nd suit that is shorter   5@D 4@C|pg||
nt|projekt1: y|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|ady: now all over |pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Peter |pg||

pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: now 4@C 2@H 2@S 1@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge who is very active opening at 1 level  does not go wild with preempts   so he passed the south hand on  3|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: West's @HQ lead fooled everyone|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cA|nt|sybarra: he led @H 10 |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: NS claimed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: IF  vP believes Hurd's signals   @D4 @D3  says  I don't like @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he guesses correctly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 8 16-board segements   5&6 played later today  7&8 tomorrow|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|frankaus: here comes the end play|pg||
nt|rhelle: surely East will unblock the @dJ when the Q is played|pg||
nt|ady: needs to unblock   is experience enough to kmow|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the @D spots for that?|pg||
nt|rhelle: but it won't help, as then when West wins the trick, he can't play @h|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Joel Wooldridge's thinking with Q10 doubleton was that if partner has @HJ, leading the ten makes little difference to lead the ten, and if S has @HJ, then @HQ will score an ...|pg||
nt|petergill: unexpected trick over the jack later|pg||
nt|rhelle: so declarer's 4th @d will then become the winning 9th|pg||
nt|ady: but long diamond now good|pg||
nt|sybarra: so will play q of @D and @d |pg||
nt|rhelle: very likely. East is void in @c, so very unlikely the @sK is now singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: ducking a @d now looks safe enough, but S is checking if endplays are possible on other layouts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: unblock the jack was only chance on @DQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now endplay dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: i guess he is thinking about an end-play|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: now endply East for @S trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rhelle: now that East doesn't unblock, exiting with a @h looks safe|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: sorry   i missed the good @H|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dummy squeezed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: first     then endyplay|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|ady: unblcok was best    might have exited with a heart|pg||

mb|p|nt|rhelle: I can't see East bid. 3@s was bid under pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: A TRUE CANAPE OPENING|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|ady: ok   this time they could escape|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Zagorin in 4@S   2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
nt|ady: last hand bad for USA   3 hearts could have been beaten and 3@S making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  invert the PASS/DBL from the way most Big Clubbers bid over interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point from Hedy on Voice Commentary    deWijs upgraded his hand from 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @S lead it goes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
nt|ady: but now it looks n/s may get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to shift|pg||
nt|bobholl: or switch :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit i wouldn't do that with 4333 and no fillers|pg||
nt|lokaty: bardzo ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|lokaty: 4@H wygl¹da na bez dwóch, a 4@S powinien sobie poradziæ|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: one down...|pg||
nt|desinka: Rusev dont have to pass this overbid.. in mine little opinion 4@C is with support..|pg||
nt|desinka: Yes, Lukas|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW obviously discussed this auction   with  2N showing minors|pg||
nt|chick: hard to imagine anyone leading anything except a diamond honor, but he can still switch to spade later, if he gets the diamond count right|pg||
nt|desinka: pretty easy minus 1|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
nt|lokaty: Dziadek przeszed³ oczekiwania Kality. Dwa czarne fity i dwa asy czerwone.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [1N-2]    Grue in 2@H North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try to give Verhees @D ruff now??|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they gave count he won't |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Wooldridge in 3@HSouth|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford the 9@D|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile on 2, the Dutch declarer in OR took 12 tricks in 4@H, making it a 4-ttrick difference -- quite impressive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphznm: oh, even two |pg||
nt|desinka: oh yeah :)|pg||
nt|desinka: we forgot K@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
nt|lokaty: obrona, po której atuty nie musz¹ sie ju¿ dzieliæ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
nt|bobholl: ok :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver play  3@D-3@S as non-force   not a common treatment|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that opens up  1N-2@H//2@S-2N as artificial to show 2 suiters [and other things]|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a cautious view of his hand - quite rightly at these colors|pg||

nt|rhelle: and to add to the insult, he finesses the @c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not until you see location of @SQ|pg||

nt|petergill: It looks like the @d ruff will hold them to 9 tricks, if West rises on the first heart - he may not|pg||
nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I predict this contract will just scrpe in|pg||
nt|rhelle: *scrape*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expecting Hurd to have 0--2@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 aces and a bidding parftner|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: West is thinking BOTH - do I play partner for a singleton @D - and - do I rise when a @H is led from dummy later?|pg||
nt|ady: just down 1 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means  3rd from even   of cards   low from odd    [3,5,7]|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope this will be the nail in the coffin :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since they overbid -- the raise is a winner|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: easier to duck @SJ  playing 3rd/5th leads|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1:  4 Hurd 3N north|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: in college we decided since all invitational bids were accepted we'd change system to make them SLAM tries|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d7|pg||

nt|ady: not the best    but still should be down 1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on voice   Ben describes upgrade as hand he would bid playing natural as 1@D opener that would jump rebid 3@D   a nice description|pg||

nt|petergill: An easy 3NT which makes in comfort|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Bert te Velde for pointing out to me that @S9 on the 6@D slam might well ahve been the wrong card to play - this is the sort of fine detail that Joe Grue and Justin Lall ...|pg||

pc|h3|nt|warrens:  looks like a good hand for a @C safety play: K, then low towards A9|pg||

nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so Warren's point about the safety play is good - to protect against Q10xx in either hand|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: And i think he wrote that 3@H was Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: if Q@H played and ducked  then (@C switch |pg||

nt|vugraphznt: but I am not sure -- and N does not have a very nice handwriting :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  laydown on a @H lead, but not so easy on a @S lead|pg||

pc|c8|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very reasonable choice|pg||

nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to force NS guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is only defensive start that gives declarer problems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bobholl: @D now and indeed problems|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: kept them out of a slam that needs some luck on a spade lead  cutting of the 3rd heart trick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: there are lay outs where the defence have 4 spade trricks   but no this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had good results playing Raptor NT overcall  but felt uncomfortable in hands like this felt uncomfortable with normal DBL sequences|pg||
nt|ady: still ok    |pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Raptor.html|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|sA|nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||

mb|5S|nt|petergill: It looks like a major card was led by the Dutch in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||

nt|wstuart: The lucky star the American EW were playing under burned out on board 4.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 9 can be H98 or HH98, |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: So East denies the @H10 and always has an honour|pg||

nt|petergill: With only 16 HCP missing, North figured to have @HK, even with S's heart bids|pg||
nt|petergill: and he expects black kings to be offside in opener's hand, thus needed @H hook|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||
nt|petergill: That also happened yesterday at Muller's table when playing against Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW had @S8, then I think Muller would cash @SA before the heart hook, in case @SK was singleton, but @SJ108x in S is hard to pick up with lack of entries|pg||

nt|roswolf: west will run out of exit cards|pg||
nt|petergill: In due course, as we can see (but East cannot see the 52 cards), all lines work. |pg||
