mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: that's all we can ask :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzps: °°@S@S This is the last board of the Championship. Let me thank our commentators:|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@H@H Dan Neill and William Frisby @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: °°@d@d This show came from the cooperation of BBO with F.I.G.B. (Italian Fed). |pg||

nt|joest: 3NT is often played as 'a good 4@s bid"|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may also be a splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: it is a splinter without intervention|pg||
nt|joest: I think we will see some NT call in NOrth's future: "pick a minor partner"  I doubt North will let 4@s rest|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: so a straightforward 4@c|pg||
mb|4N|nt|athene: 6nt basically on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: played in 3 Nt closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder what 1nt showed? surely it might be less than that|pg||
nt|athene: so you might expect west to make another move over 3nt|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest: and now 4NT showing shorter diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: the two 4-1 minor splits means some handling charges |pg||

nt|paulg:  Bell trying to reconstruct Byrne's hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  he must have a singleton club and hence the @hA|pg||
nt|joest: If Zia covers Byrne can still get a club ruff|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|nt|joest: if Zia ducks..|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|dburn: with spades bid to his left|pg||
nt|ady: wonder how they reached 3@D in CR|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, Zia avoided hearing spades bid to his left by bidding them himself|pg||

nt|joest: no not at all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: so 1@d is 11/13 balanced or natural unbalanced|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: since 1D was nebulous, Bell might be thinking of 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: so Zia's activity has the effect of jostling east-west into a poor spot|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: and 2@d just a good @s raise|pg||

nt|joest: seeing four spades in dummy is a great disappointment I'm sure|pg||

nt|joest: the open room began with board 22 I believe|pg||

nt|paulg:  the good news for Bell is that he has little choice in how to play this heart suit|pg||
nt|joest: the bad news is he has only one entry to play hearts and may choose it to hook clubs instea|pg||
nt|joest: instead|pg||

nt|joest: Bjornlund asking himself "would WEst really lead away from the queen?"|pg||
nt|joest: as do I.  A very good treatment IMHO|pg||
nt|joest: "slightly preemptive" meaning 'a distributional raise to 3@h"|pg||

nt|paulg:  Bell should have responded, "Wasn't it Rodwell's book?"|pg||
