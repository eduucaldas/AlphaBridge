pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: well from his point of view the contract is wrong-sided and 3nt was likely to be the best contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: giving east an early decision|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes good defence|pg||

nt|yke:  sorry 5 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: East just relayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West showed 6@d 4@h|pg||
nt|yke:  3@S weak relay, 3NT minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: looks like the right contract anyway|pg||
nt|yke:  the name Tarzan precisicion is because it is named after the guy who played tarzan Weismuller, which is almost their names|pg||
nt|panosk: nice one Yke he was Johhny Weismuller yes the 1st tarzan in movies|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala intends to lead @hQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yke:  in many auctions, one person relays while the other one just tells what he has|pg||

nt|yke:  it is always harder to lead against relay auctions, the closed hand is unknown|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yke:  East could have 3 spades or even 6 spades|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: East claiming|pg||
nt|panosk: *without sorry|pg||
nt|yke:  and the shape is determined by what you bid first|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|psyck:  Ghestem style 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: 3@C   spades and diamonds    I think known as Ghestem|pg||
nt|psyck:  Ghestem has the advantage over say Michaels that the two suits are known|pg||
nt|roswolf: but is not well remembered and creates a lot of appeal situations|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt is a stultifying bid -|pg||

nt|penseur9:  yes :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: a razorblade slam here?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  I beleive it's the last two boards which will decide the final outcome|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 6@D defeats automatic|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: as 6@S due to lack of entries|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|xenya: the last 2 boards were good for Allegra -- but 2 more boards to go|pg||
nt|penseur9:  can 4@S make here EW?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: as it happens slam makes. |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: how?|pg||
nt|panosk: is E hand too strong for bicolour?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but only on misdefence.|pg||
nt|yke:  6@D does not make|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala estimated the IMP scores on some boards on his score paper |pg||
nt|panosk: can you see his sum Tobias ? |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: can you read these")?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but EW might play 4 sp (East bids 4 sp now, and west perhaps passes that.)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: east should know there is dead meat on west,s hand.|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: for the scores|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: in a variety of ways i think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jbennet: 6-2 or 7-2 in D; D contract is favourite  to produce at least 1 more trick than  a spade contract.|pg||

nt|penseur9:  wow...on  45 the OR in only 3@H for a 13 IMPs swing|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: tomorrow at 11 CET, the first session of the finals start|pg||
mb|2C|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: last board of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Madala is a bit tired|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|xenya: on 45, the German EW failed to get to 4@H -- moreover, they sold out to 3@Smaking. 13 imps to Allegra |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jbennet: 2 clubs might among other things contain 118-20 NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  yes thank you Anna (merci beaucoup), great job you did|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Anna :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 18-19|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  thanks also to my fellow co-commentator Vladimir...|pg||
nt|xenya: A thanks Andre|pg||
nt|yke:  2@D is probably hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north showed 4@h|pg||
nt|jbennet: was 3sp showing excatly 4 h?|pg||
nt|panosk: 5@D cant be made either here i think |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbennet: both 3NT and 5d hangs on the lead.|pg||
nt|yke:  push|pg||
nt|yke:  next|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I guess 2@d was 4@h and 3@s was a trf to 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  don't miss the finals tomorrow, it should be a great show for all|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N has been wrongsided, in a sense, as the killking club lead is much easier for W|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|yke:  maybe he can try to stal a spade tick and then squeeze W|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|jbennet: yet it is vital that EW have adequate signalling methods.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|yke:  but he can always thrwo all of his spades|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes west should know that he can discard 2sp+2hearts. but......|pg||
nt|panosk: now @d |pg||
nt|yke:  East needs to keep at least 2 clubs for an entry to cash the @S|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 rounds of diamonds now.|pg||
nt|yke:  its not that obvious, but I think they will prevail|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jbennet:  situations like this are common. declarer reeling of a long suit. |pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|xenya: i think EW's performance over the last few boards has been quite impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we also must thank our great specs who showed great interest and knowledge, we appreciate your comments always|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes EW most impressive|pg||
nt|penseur9:  to be expected of these 2 players|pg||
nt|xenya: nothing spectacular -- they just bid every game that came their way|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes very interesting for all of us...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while the final outcome seems determined, could you keep the table open Anna until the last board results are known from the other room :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  confirmed|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jbennet: many 3NT contracts have been slipped thorough due to errors from defence.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzng: NS discussing 33|pg||
nt|jbennet: easy disacrd|pg||

pc|dA|pc|s3|nt|vugraphzng: so thanks all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we were ptiviledged to watch great bridge as shown from our super operator...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  try privilidged even :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks again Vlad...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I suppose we should congratulate the Allegra team for a great commeback and victory|pg||
nt|penseur9:  the BSC team also performed well trueout|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: i am sry, but i have to go... ich hope you all enjoyed|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: bye|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on this high level. such mistakes shouldn't happen. |pg||
nt|yke:  club now, but E can play the T|pg||
nt|jbennet: now play a club.|pg||
nt|yke:  no|pg||
nt|panosk: is there a chance that clubs can be blocked ?|pg||
nt|yke:  on a club, E can play the T and cash the @SA|pg||
nt|jbennet: if south plays spade then its all over, but if he instead plays a club and see what happens. |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: this is the last board of the first session|pg||
nt|jbennet: ew of course can prevail.|pg||
nt|xenya: clubs can be blocked if EW try hard, but i don't think they will|pg||
nt|panosk: i think he will play spade now|pg||
nt|jbennet: but much of the game is to induce errors from opponents|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
mc|8|nt|panosk: i meant originally blocked not after play|pg||
nt|jbennet: no south simply gave up.|pg||
