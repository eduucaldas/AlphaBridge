mb|p|nt|ady: unusual 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass from west at green - must be inconvenient for his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump cue = mixed raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mixed =  shapely hand too good for simple raise, not good enough for invitational raise|pg||
nt|ady: does not seem to good for a simple raise for me|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that you do NOT preempt a preempt  so Verhees has no bid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW play 1@D-2@H/@S  = 5@S 4/5@H  weak/inv   so 2@H  is a different hand type|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts played by West  may be awkward on J@C lead   getting forced immediately   may not be able to bring in spades|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S, <FG,  NF   F1 unless 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so PASS=5@S(332)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = min, unbal |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ultimate Canape   where 2-suited hands open the SHORTER suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: so  i don't know what vP was doing :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think vP was supposed to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: would not some type of raise in spades be sounder here?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: not much on here    e/w have the balance and a spade fit    but tje 2 level in jeorpardy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: when the players came in the room, the discussion between Zagorin and de Wijs was about the banana of Zagorin, if de WIjs will get the last or the first bite :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can locate shortness or signoff in 3/4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought  deWijs might [keyword] bid 3@S to confirm 4-fit, but  doesn't like @CK or red suit holdings|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic lights say go :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: it does seem to have worked, after a fashion|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: hi all|pg||
nt|barbyh: good stop|pg||
nt|ady: restraint from North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the NS responses to 2N are unlike any I've seen from other pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = offer to play opposite the weak NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphznt: Sjoert when he puts dummy now, tja... hands you have to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink: Sorry...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps to show  min/max  unbal/bal|pg||
nt|ady: out of their depth|pg||
nt|sybarra: so Al,  with 5/5 max South would bid again over 1 nt? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room delays start of play so that live vugraph has scores for comparisons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: would he rebid spades or diamonds first? |pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: since declarer has 4 sure losers; 2 in each major, the double @c finesse will have to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count & attitude  odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot card leads vs NT = Attitude|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to go down 3 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Muller saying  he has suit worth continuing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the EW contract proves     sometimes preempts work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: could make 4 |pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: yes more american imps likely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: this has its difficulties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in udca  @S4 is ENCOURAGING|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst checking if EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, and rest of signals|pg||
nt|lokaty: sympatyczne rozdanie dla Polaków, bo 11 lew wierzchem|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: could be duplicated    unless a sacrifice at the 5 level with n/s cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry folks comment to a spec re previous bd|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rhelle: and lo and behold ... today, it does :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: faktycznie...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and indeed they do lead 2nd/4th thru declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@S = 4-fit   1@S-2@D=art invite maybe 3-fit|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: spades also become good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are very few auctions where we have same inferences that are available to NS sequences|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bermuda Bowl and Transnational Teams are playing the same set of boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  1@D is only opener that can have 2nd suit that is shorter   5@D 4@C|pg||
nt|projekt1: y|pg||
nt|lokaty: nie wiemy co to 3 trefl, ale kontra N niewiarygodna|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: 3@c bergen|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: can still make 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right,   in known long suit   @H2 also carries suit preference for @C|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: and heart position favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must guess if this is @C position or deWijs @CKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way  Muller figures to hold @HA|pg||
nt|ady: will not need to pin the 10C!  in west hand   rather than play for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: no club played|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd 1 team orange tried 5@C-3 for a 2 imp loss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'll take any plus|pg||
nt|ady: nice duck by Hurd|pg||
nt|ady: now  might go down|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back now|pg||
nt|barbyh: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW finished set 5 of 8 very late   does anyone know if there were any time penalties?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: well that removes all doubt|pg||
nt|eweber: der andere ist, dass du z.B. von AQ109 hinter dem J vom Dummy die technisch richtige Karte spielst du Partner weiß, dass du das Ass noch hast (und nicht der AS), von der Sorte ...|pg||
nt|eweber: Haltungen gibt es einige|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: has to ruff a spade  so not only needs the J@H with west   but 3-3 split   which it is|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: on 18  Grue in 4@H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: you cannot though enjoy the sspades as that means drawing 2 more trumps   and that will lead to down 1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: expect that to go down for 5 imps to Netherlands|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|ady: problem for e/w    west wants to take action after weak 2 opening with good shape   and then the auction esculated  and got well over the top|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: a good one forthe dutch in the bank|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||

pc|c5|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands done well to keep out of alsm|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ady: now all over |pg||

nt|ady: problems|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: now 4@C 2@H 2@S 1@D|pg||

nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||

nt|chick: hard to imagine anyone leading anything except a diamond honor, but he can still switch to spade later, if he gets the diamond count right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
nt|lokaty: Dziadek przeszed³ oczekiwania Kality. Dwa czarne fity i dwa asy czerwone.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [1N-2]    Grue in 2@H North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try to give Verhees @D ruff now??|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they gave count he won't |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Wooldridge in 3@HSouth|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford the 9@D|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile on 2, the Dutch declarer in OR took 12 tricks in 4@H, making it a 4-ttrick difference -- quite impressive|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
nt|lokaty: obrona, po której atuty nie musz¹ sie ju¿ dzieliæ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
nt|bobholl: ok :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: hand 2   4@H played by east     much better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: this going  well down|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|petergill: @H10 might have worked better|pg||
nt|rhelle: well played!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 9 was already gone  so 10 known  [and 10 8 equal]|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin doing well, reading the play well, still has a chance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rhelle: looks like he's home now - ruff, @sK, high cross ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|ady: big swing for Netherlands  if this goes down which looks likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: apologies - forget that last comment|pg||
nt|xenya: yes i know it was declared by W there -- whay i meant is the difference LOOKS impressive |pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: He can count the spades as 4-2 due to E having 4 @s and 3 @H and 2 @C and thus 4 @s|pg||

nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||

nt|petergill: West is thinking BOTH - do I play partner for a singleton @D - and - do I rise when a @H is led from dummy later?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that means  3rd from even   of cards   low from odd    [3,5,7]|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope this will be the nail in the coffin :)|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 22: "pip power" = West played @S7 early in play. playing UDCA. Consistent with 79 or 7Q, or else falsecard (unlikely?). Then East played @S9 on spade to king-ten at end - was ...|pg||
nt|petergill: this too revealing?|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 21 I mean|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of the USA2 pairs are hyperactive opening bidders|pg||
nt|rhelle: Good point Peter - 7-4 is not consistent with high-low even|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT  down on best defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller shows no preference and now will show a decent hand    i think|pg||
nt|ady: game force with 8 hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is one reason Eric Kokish likes [almost] unlimited overcalls    you don't have to guess when partner bids 5@C here|pg||
nt|bobholl: A @S small @H ?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other table will start  1@H-3@H  so same problem there for East|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if @C2 was suit pref   then  @DA seems automatic|pg||
nt|ady: assuming 17+ with west?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on voice   Ben describes upgrade as hand he would bid playing natural as 1@D opener that would jump rebid 3@D   a nice description|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: North could relay more with 3@h, but slam is unlikely now|pg||
nt|petergill: An easy 3NT which makes in comfort|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Bert te Velde for pointing out to me that @S9 on the 6@D slam might well ahve been the wrong card to play - this is the sort of fine detail that Joe Grue and Justin Lall ...|pg||
nt|petergill: take advantage of. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 20  declarer again hid @C length   but I still don't see when it could be right to win 1st round of @C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: USA2 has picked up 17 imps in 5 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: decent  but well below the average they need to catch up|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  looks like a good hand for a @C safety play: K, then low towards A9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: good call by Hurd|pg||
nt|xenya: this is just the kind of hand USA2 needs at this score -- arriving at 3N was an excellent shot|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: als nay be a warning to the americans not to mess around too much on the future bds|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Lall said they will bid this slam on the other table|pg||

nt|roswolf: agree but they seem to have the forse with them|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't this will slow down the American's style at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or stayman?|pg||
nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: so Warren's point about the safety play is good - to protect against Q10xx in either hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D invitational or better with clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grip & rip 3@S from Lall|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: force|pg||
nt|wstuart: The boys are bidders at both tables.|pg||

nt|ady: dont think this can be made on a heart lead despite specs claims that it can|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 3NT missed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21 [3@D+1]    Muller overcalled 1@S with 3@D    Bathurst in 4@S North|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And i think he wrote that 3@H was Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: if Q@H played and ducked  then (@C switch |pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah  calling it Stayman  saying shows 4@S  equivalent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but I am not sure -- and N does not have a very nice handwriting :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|warrens:  laydown on a @H lead, but not so easy on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ady: this maif fail  on a spade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: True - but I predict the @h10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very reasonable choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to force NS guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is only defensive start that gives declarer problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bobholl: @D now and indeed problems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: kept them out of a slam that needs some luck on a spade lead  cutting of the 3rd heart trick|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: there are lay outs where the defence have 4 spade trricks   but no this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had good results playing Raptor NT overcall  but felt uncomfortable in hands like this felt uncomfortable with normal DBL sequences|pg||
nt|ady: still ok    |pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Raptor.html|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: down 2    very nice defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: ricco likes the developments :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: he missed the @D nad -1 propably now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle: I've played with him a fair few times, and it takes getting used to. Saving grace is that he normally emerges with the right card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old BOLS Bridge Tip   Zia described player "heats"   Heat 1  everything you do is right|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Joe Grue led @H at other table - there's an article somewhere by Kit Woolsey that leads from Q9xx and K10xx tend not to work out well - the choice perhaps was random.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||

nt|petergill: With only 16 HCP missing, North figured to have @HK, even with S's heart bids|pg||
nt|petergill: and he expects black kings to be offside in opener's hand, thus needed @H hook|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||
nt|petergill: That also happened yesterday at Muller's table when playing against Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||

nt|bbramley: hello again - while we were gone netherlands picked up 2 vul games swings vs. 1 NV game swing for USA2|pg||
nt|sybarra: good very early morning from Washington DC,  hello Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: the play of the @S10 was unusual in that it might cost a trick if south started with Qx or Jx, but could gain if south started with Qxx or Jxx|pg||
nt|bbramley: but this deal was about the @DK:  if it was offside then he was probably going down|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: bathroom stop... |pg||
nt|ady: USA  likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this table will never fall behind the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak 2@D?    usually shows 6, but at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another upgrade to 2N??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue-Lall auction may go 1@D*-2@S**    * precision  ** 5@S 4/5@H, invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: wooldridge knew he could probably claim, but there might have been a club ruff out there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall was very disappointed @S weren't blocked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gordon v Angelini now mathematically confirms Gordon advance to Transnational SemiFinal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of how many breaks they take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1@D-2@H  5@S 4/5@H non-invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never should have doubted|pg||
mb|1C|an|*|nt|ady: n/s  hands too flat to be in game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3@S, 9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 27: If South was 4333 shape, then 3NT might have been better than 4@S, but reaching 3NT seems difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Actually, the 1@h opening on substandard values may help NS in staying low|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N asks Features    haven't seen that treatment in a while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i apologize for waffling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 21+ balanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: more likely e/w could make game in hearts    but 4 losers with A@D wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = 4-card limit raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have 40 minutes for 5 hands - in my opinion, South has been the slowest player at this table|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a 5@H save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bathurst also saw vulnerability when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't hurt hurd :)|pg||
nt|chick: is 7@H makeable?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: RDBL with 3-fit   haven't seen that before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it shows GOOD 3-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the 1 @C alert is "could be 2" |pg||
mb|2D|nt|bbramley: i'll have to get up to speed on the N/S system - not sure exactly what the bids mean - looks sort of like Polish so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he always is slow |pg||
nt|ady: but they have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS must be forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: hmm   i wonder how they differentiate 3@S & 2N   thought 1 might show 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: nothing going for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The fact that we're seeing so many transfers (2@H showing spades) in the WC Grand Final is food for thought for those who don't like such methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  PASS with 2   accept transfer with 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C now |pg||
nt|bobholl: only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 4@H and what does Hurd do|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and that might e also Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: i think 1@D=0-7, then natural|pg||
nt|bbramley: if so, i'm a little surprised south did not upgrade to a positive with his good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps   so close to 6 imps behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure with 4-fit in 1462|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey might argue for lead of 3 card suit |pg||
nt|ady: USA    get lucky   heart lead no chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure they've defined Wooldridge PASS   but we don't know :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: wooldridge not worth more than 4 @S imo|pg||
nt|april7: still 7, the 9 takes care of it!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great analysis   do you think there is any chance they'll bid it??|pg||
nt|chick: kibs are split about 80-20 that 7@H can make :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @S 4-1 ?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@S cannot make because of the 4-1 split, but 7@H looks makeable tome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy analysis of card play is academic if auction can't get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: South should now play the @sK, in case declarer needs to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|ady: but always likely to get to 3NT   and likely to make  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 to instill doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse count/attitude   7 could also come from  J74|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: rdbl says 3 card and I want you to play|pg||
nt|ady: plenty of time for defence to get all the tricks|pg||
nt|chick: too true, Al, but maybe they can get to 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 @H surely can make 9 of @D is the extra trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WOW   on 27  Grue-Lall bid 3N on the perfecta layout|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||
nt|chick: the real reason that 7@H is biddable is that USA2 needs it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: so he transferred to play the hand himself :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Daily Bulletin 11 says 24 board R16 matches in Transnational. Bull 11 also has interesting article about the massive preparation by Indonesia Ladies for this event ref pages 28 and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 15 I think, at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose if @C feature, might explore @D slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is getting very interesting|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Wooldridge expects only 4@S from Hurd??|pg||
nt|bobholl: too interesting :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with clearer 1 or 2 suiter -- Hurd would not PASS 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge almost bid 6@S, and is rethinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm already impressed that they found 6@H after 3@S    anything more is astounding|pg||
nt|chick: my kib opinion count is up to 42 making vs 6 can't make 7@H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: I"m told that in the Transnats, one pair bid 6@H making 7|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch pick up another 5 imps on  7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm guessing   4@H natural  exactly 4@H else 3@H rather than DBL   5@C cuebid  5N pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks as a good guess|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
nt|chick: we all agree that the @D9 is the key card, when the J10 fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think impressive recovery to get to 6@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sr 10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will correct in a second|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and bet they discuss later if     a) there was easier way   b)  they could/should get to 7@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: and Oswald Jacoby for original transfer concept|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even in context of Big Club system   too many losers, not enough winners  for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver-Brink 2@C auction uninterrupted so far|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bbramley: so instead he's ruffed up, which will fail as well because west's trumps are too good|pg||
nt|sybarra: or too many anyway |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|wstuart: Win 8 I mean - -300 and -50|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bbramley: but even if remaining trumps were 2-2 the fifth club would promote the setting trick|pg||
nt|roswolf: team america reportedly very slow in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: they'll have much easier time finding @H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|rhelle: I'd say, looking at the sequence in the other room, that the result justifies the means :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2-3-6... |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D  this time with weak NT  but longest suit @C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT   n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they very rarely PASS  the 1@D opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||
nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  if 2suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N weak NT, not 4@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Not here, he is very silent:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D  4@H 5+@D, 0/1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Ben!    |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't Symmetric Relay  developed by New Zealand's  Dr Kerr?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: ahhh Roy Kerr|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Ker   i never remember   or r's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in New Zealand, he might be better known as award winning Phyicist|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks  unless defence cash quickly when in with K@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to win spade and lay down A@D|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||

pc|sK|nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
nt|ady: swkward communication   but as 10@C comes down in 3   does not matter|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs very surprised :)|pg||
nt|petergill: then NS could have got a @c ruff to beat it, I think (not sure)|pg||
nt|ady: how 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|ady: 12 imps to the leaders hand 10   they bid and made 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which part of nz you from?    my ex partner plays out of dunedin|pg||
nt|chick: USA2 36 to Netherlands 9 IMPs so far this session ... USA2 will run out of boards, but they are sure making a strong try for a comeback|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: ok North is back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 29 [1N-]   Grue 2@D in the 4-2 fit|pg||

nt|MolvaM: grubunda ilk 2 ye giren takýmlar yarý final ve kazananlar da daha sonra final oynayacak|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Redbl would almost certainly go P P 6@C or 5NT by East, then what happens next = I know not|pg||
nt|ady: must have been a diamond lead  for 12 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D led|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder what 5@S would mean now? Natural, strong slam suggestion?|pg||
nt|ady: I am told it was|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its good to have an agreement what the meaning of 4@S is by west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin will open South  -- but even playing Big Club   Verhees may not|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: and another 6 to the dutch on bd 8 - they bid and made 3nt|pg||
nt|wstuart: The dutch would be ahead by 2 now if not for the 18 IMP swing on board 2 where teh Americans bid approx a 2% slam which came in.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 11-15 HCP, 0+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can have longer @C/@S but not longer @H|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in either major for USA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry about the private message|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall took a shot bidding Stayman over Grue's NT opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the 2@H preempt there.  He has good intermediates and virtually no def outside.|pg||
nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: automatic opener for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a review of this auction please|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: oops   i don't know what they do after high interference :(|pg||
nt|ady: north fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: can we go back to 1N (about last board) to Muller|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is reasonable, needs @HA onside or (if played by W) @HA lead - plus @S not 5-1 - and @d not 6-0!|pg||
nt|rhelle: Pass = Forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: denies a penalty X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Rob!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@D|pg||
nt|xenya: slam swing for USA2 on 8|pg||
nt|ady: Lall trying everything to create swings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs DBL probably just "cards"|pg||
nt|yusufb: yarý final ve final 12 bordluk 4 devre 48 bord olarak yapýlacak|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS confirming that 1N is SemiForce|pg||
mb|2S|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect East  5(332)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu akþam bu maçtan sonra 1 maç daha var|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
nt|ady: nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ady: save for n/s in the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fairly automatic|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500|pg||
nt|ady: east has at least some usefull heart pips|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu arada takýmýmýz turnuvaya kötü baþladý inþallahh bundan sonra boyle devam etmez|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't need no stinkin' invites|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds really   not clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how EW differentiate Joel Wooldridge's sequence from immediate Michaels|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: north a bit quiet in this auction|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
nt|ady: race to 7 tricks    defence can take 4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: @DA asks attitude|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: but of they fail  declarer can take 4 clubs and 3 spades |pg||
nt|yusufb: ilk ciddi sayýmýzý bu borddan alacaz|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2. maçlar saat 2215te baþlayacak|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge was afraid Hurd psyched a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unlike old days   Ace asks Attitude|pg||
pc|c9|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D lead director?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ady: trying to get shortened    but singleton diamond in South hand stops that line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 3@S on 27   south gets writeup if he switches to @Dx from @DAx   that beats 3@S for a tie if declarer misguesses|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: literally no play too|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: about that slam: Playing UDCA, S should have played @C3 to show four cards in clubs - when he did not, N went wrong. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: to sleepy to think about which combination would have Verhees discourage with 7 intstead of higher spot|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: youth has definitely been served in Veldhoven   maybe our game has a future after all|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver used 2@C as relay  so they had plenty of room|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: @C2, not @C3, I mean|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last of the championship for our table :(|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: thx for watching all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznt: Grue telling 4@D was making after this auction, guessing the @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards of the championship  begins  1 hour 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: USA   plenty to do   but still a long way to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal 18+ bal     lots of controls so upgrade?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The investment in advanced bidding technique by Brink and Drijver, compared to the natural American auction, was the main reason for that swing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   15-17|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @D & a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: bad lay for 4@H  e/w|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N ostensibly 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks like 4@H i agree david|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: thx Harold   and thx all and kibs|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  3rd vul & always 4th|pg||
nt|warrens:  a nice squeeze on the previous hand for an overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins  in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was a plesure to be here, and a plesure to broadcast it! :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they confirm  Netherlands last win was 18 years ago|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: trial için uygun bir el deðil ama bakalým|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D=5+@H, INV+|pg||
nt|ady: looks on the face of it down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12  Brink-Drijver have found their @H fit|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  no use either on diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 4@H where Grue played 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: a little too much testosterone i think|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond loser on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Unsure about meanings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational  thru 27   Israel +33 over OZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OZ = australia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe oldest player on Israel is 25|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice if they bid 6@H on this one |pg||
pc|s2|nt|rhelle: now @d7 is count - odd number|pg||
nt|warrens:  needed to start with a @C, but most players avoid leading from Axxx against NT|pg||
nt|ady: if north comes in with A@C   will likely switch to a spade   and south will probably cash out for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand    thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you don't want to wait for the next set of this match  --- other rooms still playing   and  Transnational schedule is offset from us|pg||

nt|petergill: Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: clu ruff beats 4@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 players 25  that really brings up the average age|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  since S has all the entries, this should make easily|pg||
nt|ady: or win and switch to clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble   2 places to play|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall tried lead of @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 30: The golden rule of expert bridge is to trust partner, not the opponents. Thus, when N is faced with a choice between two impossibilities, he must trust partner, not the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponent who appears to have pulled out the wrong bidding card (went for 4@S and accidentally bid 6@S off two aces) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice try from John Hurd|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hurd gave up, he really threw the pass card|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge, why didn't bid 7 then?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: 1st session of Transnational Final has already started|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Joel Wooldridge was ashamed of the opening bid, i guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems normal to shift to @Cx|pg||
nt|petergill: low club now looks normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: too|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry @c loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice that EW don't play 'system on' either|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Australia Open  vs   Israel Juniors   both young teams   [except for one OZ pair]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of tables in Transnational only on 11   the other finishing 14  so still a lot of vugraph to watch after we're done here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And some youngsters playing there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller is the only player in the final to have a previous World Championship|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think the youngest from Australia is 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil  Edgtton  19 or maybe just turned 20|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: curious that in a Transnational   that both teams in finals are  mono-country  [i know  not a real work]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps he should have offered 5@D|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know age of Israel Juniors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
nt|roswolf: what happened there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue smoothly ducked @CA...|pg||
nt|ady: slip up    but should still be -1   if no other mistake|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: this looks flat  so of for some lunch     thx    all    bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: this can/should make shouldnt it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "@CA, @C, @D ruffout, @HA, @D for a pitch, @S to jack DUCKED..."|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i should say  OPEN World Championship|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bbramley: so this should be 8 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
nt|bbramley: thx everyone|pg||
nt|sybarra: see you all in about 1 hour |pg||
nt|bbramley: i'm told other room is in 3NT|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: for the kibs who does think this score indicates a win by the Dutch pls do not forget we only played half of the match (64 out of 128)|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for Netherlands   a cvery fgood set|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: this almost certainly a push|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: thx all   bye|pg||
