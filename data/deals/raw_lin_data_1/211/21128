nt|ady: out of their depth|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: would he rebid spades or diamonds first? |pg||
pc|d2|nt|rhelle: since declarer has 4 sure losers; 2 in each major, the double @c finesse will have to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count & attitude  odd/even discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: spot card leads vs NT = Attitude|pg||
nt|ady: this likely to go down 3 at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so  Muller saying  he has suit worth continuing|pg||

nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: faktycznie...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||

nt|ahollan1: either way  Muller figures to hold @HA|pg||

nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||

nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||

nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||

nt|kerasidis: :) and some relief comes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what does South respond??|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 20: When @D8 won, West might have inferred that South had all the @d's higher than that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D relay but not promising any points|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||

nt|kerasidis: an other chance to reduse the gap|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rhelle: and a useful 13 IMPs reward|pg||

nt|vugraphznm: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: @DJ had to be played smoothly, in totally normal tempo under @DQ, to try to convince S it was E's last @D. That's the only way 3NT might have gone down|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am tols on bd2 america likely to make 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why 1@D alerted  just shows 3+|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sry didn't mean to|pg||

nt|ady: oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worries   vP will bid @S|pg||
nt|ady: there should be a way to catch this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D can have longer @C/@S, but NOT longer @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|desinka: an intresting hand again|pg||
nt|desinka: 4@C for sure is with support @D|pg||
nt|desinka: it has to be :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C=LONGER @C|pg||
nt|lokaty: kein Problem:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: I can't see East bid. 3@s was bid under pressure|pg||
nt|roswolf: A TRUE CANAPE OPENING|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|ady: ok   this time they could escape|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Zagorin in 4@S   2@S-4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@S was mildly conservative, after S's weak raise. 4@S was possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try 5@C which will discourage Bathurst from bidding more|pg||
nt|ady: sorry folks  have connection problems|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
nt|ady: last hand bad for USA   3 hearts could have been beaten and 3@S making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  invert the PASS/DBL from the way most Big Clubbers bid over interference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point from Hedy on Voice Commentary    deWijs upgraded his hand from 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|bobholl: on @S lead it goes down|pg||
nt|kerasidis: it seems no Q@d makes the damage|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
nt|ady: but now it looks n/s may get too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to shift|pg||
nt|bobholl: or switch :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must admit i wouldn't do that with 4333 and no fillers|pg||
nt|lokaty: bardzo ciekawe rozdanie|pg||
nt|lokaty: 4@H wygl¹da na bez dwóch, a 4@S powinien sobie poradziæ|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: one down...|pg||
nt|desinka: Rusev dont have to pass this overbid.. in mine little opinion 4@C is with support..|pg||
nt|desinka: Yes, Lukas|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW obviously discussed this auction   with  2N showing minors|pg||
nt|chick: hard to imagine anyone leading anything except a diamond honor, but he can still switch to spade later, if he gets the diamond count right|pg||
nt|desinka: pretty easy minus 1|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
nt|lokaty: Dziadek przeszed³ oczekiwania Kality. Dwa czarne fity i dwa asy czerwone.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D by³o forsuj¹ce oczywicie...byæ mo¿e nawet do dogranej|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [1N-2]    Grue in 2@H North|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try to give Verhees @D ruff now??|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they gave count he won't |pg||
nt|lechcold: nie skoñczy siê to dobrze|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  3 Wooldridge in 3@HSouth|pg||
nt|ady: cannot afford the 9@D|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile on 2, the Dutch declarer in OR took 12 tricks in 4@H, making it a 4-ttrick difference -- quite impressive|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: nawet przy normalnym podziale kar, 3N nie ma szans|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphznm: oh, even two |pg||
nt|desinka: oh yeah :)|pg||
nt|desinka: we forgot K@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
nt|lokaty: obrona, po której atuty nie musz¹ sie ju¿ dzieliæ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
nt|bobholl: ok :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
nt|kerasidis: and now he is getting squezed as well|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: hand 2   4@H played by east     much better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: this going  well down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: @H10 might have worked better|pg||
nt|rhelle: well played!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 9 was already gone  so 10 known  [and 10 8 equal]|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin doing well, reading the play well, still has a chance|pg||

nt|roswolf: west took a cautious view of his hand - quite rightly at these colors|pg||

nt|petergill: It looks like the @d ruff will hold them to 9 tricks, if West rises on the first heart - he may not|pg||
nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||

nt|ahollan1: expecting Hurd to have 0--2@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 aces and a bidding parftner|pg||

nt|ady: just down 1 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means  3rd from even   of cards   low from odd    [3,5,7]|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hope this will be the nail in the coffin :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in college we decided since all invitational bids were accepted we'd change system to make them SLAM tries|pg||

nt|kerasidis: 4 card@s balanced|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1:  20   2N-3N   @H lead|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|petergill: hence West's very smooth low play on the 1st @H - it was the only chance to beat 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: not the best    but still should be down 1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
nt|kerasidis: yes some say redouble means bid your suit ....give the alternative ...pass for exaple|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: down 2    very nice defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: ricco likes the developments :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: he missed the @D nad -1 propably now|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: I've played with him a fair few times, and it takes getting used to. Saving grace is that he normally emerges with the right card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old BOLS Bridge Tip   Zia described player "heats"   Heat 1  everything you do is right|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c2|nt|petergill: Joe Grue led @H at other table - there's an article somewhere by Kit Woolsey that leads from Q9xx and K10xx tend not to work out well - the choice perhaps was random.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rhelle: Yes, that 2nd @s looks like a mistake|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||

nt|kerasidis: 3@d|pg||
nt|kerasidis: puppet asks for 5 ...bid it directly|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Wooldridge expects only 4@S from Hurd??|pg||
nt|bobholl: too interesting :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with clearer 1 or 2 suiter -- Hurd would not PASS 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge almost bid 6@S, and is rethinking|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Dutch pick up another 5 imps on  7|pg||

mb|p|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
nt|chick: we all agree that the @D9 is the key card, when the J10 fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think impressive recovery to get to 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and bet they discuss later if     a) there was easier way   b)  they could/should get to 7@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||

nt|ady: easy 3NT   n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they very rarely PASS  the 1@D opening|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||

nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  if 2suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 8 sry|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N weak NT, not 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||

nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Not here, he is very silent:)|pg||

pc|h7|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't Symmetric Relay  developed by New Zealand's  Dr Kerr?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: ahhh Roy Kerr|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Ker   i never remember   or r's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in New Zealand, he might be better known as award winning Phyicist|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks  unless defence cash quickly when in with K@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to win spade and lay down A@D|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Al   you type faster|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: 26 a quiet  2@S East|pg||
nt|MolvaM: selamlar|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
nt|ady: swkward communication   but as 10@C comes down in 3   does not matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational   thru 8   Israel over Australia by 41|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Lall took a shot bidding Stayman over Grue's NT opener|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: witam|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam M:)|pg||
nt|kerasidis: well well ....if this will be swing for Karlsruher then things will be very tough for Lazy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: even so, nasty problem for West. It could be anything, from 4@s to 7@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this match is tightening nicely -(for us neutrals)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijver taking a postion  for a long thought|pg||
nt|roswolf: that weak2 by south is a hippy bid if ever i saw one|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Drijer sighs a few times|pg||
nt|ady: will get to 6@S   iam sure|pg||
nt|roswolf: in a sense unlucky his pard is so weak|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like the 2@H preempt there.  He has good intermediates and virtually no def outside.|pg||
nt|ady: I  very much doubt pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: automatic opener for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a review of this auction please|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: oops   i don't know what they do after high interference :(|pg||
nt|ady: north fearless|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: can we go back to 1N (about last board) to Muller|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is reasonable, needs @HA onside or (if played by W) @HA lead - plus @S not 5-1 - and @d not 6-0!|pg||
nt|rhelle: Pass = Forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: denies a penalty X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Rob!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@D|pg||
nt|xenya: slam swing for USA2 on 8|pg||
nt|ady: Lall trying everything to create swings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs DBL probably just "cards"|pg||
nt|yusufb: yarý final ve final 12 bordluk 4 devre 48 bord olarak yapýlacak|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Nor th wil certainly lead the @cA|pg||
nt|petergill: 11 imps to Netherlands, surely|pg||
nt|ady: that  very ambitius  with void heart|pg||
nt|sybarra: look in movie,  it was club lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps 5@S would be voidwood (void spade, loking for 7@H), so West's choices were 4@S and 6@S - a guess. |pg||
nt|ady: as long as they dont bid 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS confirming that 1N is SemiForce|pg||
mb|4S|nt|warrens:  needs to lead @C Ace or a @S|pg||
nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect East  5(332)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: bu akþam bu maçtan sonra 1 maç daha var|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
nt|ady: nice lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ady: save for n/s in the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but fairly automatic|pg||
nt|lechcold: trefl silny u Islandczyka. kontra to 5-7 uk³ad dowolny jak s¹dzê|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 500|pg||
nt|ady: east has at least some usefull heart pips|pg||
nt|yusufb: bu arada takýmýmýz turnuvaya kötü baþladý inþallahh bundan sonra boyle devam etmez|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't need no stinkin' invites|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds really   not clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how EW differentiate Joel Wooldridge's sequence from immediate Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: north a bit quiet in this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
nt|ady: race to 7 tricks    defence can take 4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||

pc|cA|nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: but of they fail  declarer can take 4 clubs and 3 spades |pg||
nt|yusufb: ilk ciddi sayýmýzý bu borddan alacaz|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: jakby Grzesiek mia³ singla pik to nie bra³by waletem tylko dam¹ karo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is costly - and North has to be careful to not let it affect him|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|ady: played well    and then lapsed|pg||
nt|ady: not much further problem   will lose a spade|pg||
nt|ady: much better spades thant hearts?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nice defense|pg||

mb|4C|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unlike old days   Ace asks Attitude|pg||
pc|c4|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
nt|ady: can make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D lead director?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||

mb|1C|nt|vugraphznt: Grue telling 4@D was making after this auction, guessing the @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards of the championship  begins  1 hour 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: USA   plenty to do   but still a long way to go|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal 18+ bal     lots of controls so upgrade?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: The investment in advanced bidding technique by Brink and Drijver, compared to the natural American auction, was the main reason for that swing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: no   15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = @D & a major|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: sometimes it is to fast to look at unimportant details :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D=5+@H, INV+|pg||
nt|ady: looks on the face of it down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  12  Brink-Drijver have found their @H fit|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  no use either on diamond lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 4@H where Grue played 3@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a little too much testosterone i think|pg||
nt|ady: might get a diamond loser on 3rd spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Unsure about meanings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational  thru 27   Israel +33 over OZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OZ = australia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe oldest player on Israel is 25|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice if they bid 6@H on this one |pg||
mb|5C|nt|rhelle: now @d7 is count - odd number|pg||
nt|warrens:  needed to start with a @C, but most players avoid leading from Axxx against NT|pg||
nt|ady: if north comes in with A@C   will likely switch to a spade   and south will probably cash out for down 1|pg||
nt|ady: thx Gerbrand    thx all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you don't want to wait for the next set of this match  --- other rooms still playing   and  Transnational schedule is offset from us|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=21-23|pg||

nt|petergill: Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: clu ruff beats 4@S  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 players 25  that really brings up the average age|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 3rd and final set of the day begins in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  since S has all the entries, this should make easily|pg||
nt|ady: or win and switch to clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble   2 places to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Justin Lall tried lead of @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 30: The golden rule of expert bridge is to trust partner, not the opponents. Thus, when N is faced with a choice between two impossibilities, he must trust partner, not the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponent who appears to have pulled out the wrong bidding card (went for 4@S and accidentally bid 6@S off two aces) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice try from John Hurd|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hurd gave up, he really threw the pass card|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge, why didn't bid 7 then?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: 1st session of Transnational Final has already started|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Joel Wooldridge was ashamed of the opening bid, i guess|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 5@d asks for Q trump|pg||
nt|kerasidis: 5@h= no parnter i havent got it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems normal to shift to @Cx|pg||
nt|petergill: low club now looks normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: too|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry @c loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
nt|lechcold: W prawdopodobnie dok³adnie sprzeda³ swoj¹ trójkolorówkê i posiadane kontrole|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: 2@h 8-10 punktow|pg||

nt|vugraphznm: 3@d bylo pytanie o kontrole|pg||

nt|vugraphznm: i grzesiek sie juz trzymie za glowe...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Australia Open  vs   Israel Juniors   both young teams   [except for one OZ pair]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of tables in Transnational only on 11   the other finishing 14  so still a lot of vugraph to watch after we're done here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And some youngsters playing there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller is the only player in the final to have a previous World Championship|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I think the youngest from Australia is 19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nabil  Edgtton  19 or maybe just turned 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: curious that in a Transnational   that both teams in finals are  mono-country  [i know  not a real work]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps he should have offered 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesniak: czy mozliwe zeby do tego stopnia nie mial zaufania do przeciwnikow ktorzy mogli banalnie sprawedzic czy maja D kier|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: don't know age of Israel Juniors|pg||
nt|kerasidis: if i had 5-4 fit i would take tha risk to play 7 but not with 5-3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: Netherlands have made a nice recovery   |pg||
nt|roswolf: what happened there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue smoothly ducked @CA...|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ady: this looks flat  so of for some lunch     thx    all    bye|pg||
