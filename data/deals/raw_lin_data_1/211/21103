mb|3S!|an|0-1 !S, 5!D |mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ybob: 3@D shows @S suit and 3@S = don´t like surelly|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west was trying to set up one heart trick before declarer got the spades going|pg||
nt|athene: @SAKx is only holding them up for one tempo when north has singleton|pg||
nt|ybob: surely W not started with 4 trumps or 1, so D is 3/2 any|pg||
nt|athene: well of course on normal breaks there is no problem now|pg||
nt|athene: so south just wondering about 4-1 trumps|pg||
nt|ybob: if trumps 4/1 declarer needs @S trick|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|athene: if the lead was a singleton you might expect west to underlead the club for a heart ruff|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Indonesia decided to resign, and not play last sessions|pg||
nt|desinka: with @D back 4@S goes down |pg||
nt|desinka: if the cotract is 4@S of course:)|pg||
nt|othered1: this may make 4, but 4 isn't a good spot.  @D continuation will hold it to 3, anyway|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kfay: I'm not sure how well known this Israeli junior team is yet internationally but I can personally attest that they're the real deal and aren't just having a string of good luck in ...|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|gracelin: Israel Junior lead by 27 imps including the 5 imps from carry over. There are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|gracelin: South stopped cautiously at 3S.  At one of the BB match, the Netherland south jumped to 4S after similar start.|pg||

nt|orentol: Hey all|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher and Schwartz came in 2nd in the World Junior Pairs in Beijing and their team went on to win gold in Philadelphia last year.|pg||
nt|kfay: Of course Sontag and Berkowitz are no slouches themselves and they start out with a fair result in this set.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he guessed only one red suit, so is -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hey jan  you on stage again?|pg||
nt|ritong: tireless|pg||
nt|gracelin: The trmp lead instead of HK may give him a clue.|pg||

nt|mrt2000: showing 5@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I am always here -- have operated every board since last sunday :)|pg||
nt|ritong: you gamble with your health, buddy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 12 days - 48 boards a day -- thats healty :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which will likely dissuade W from bidding @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: these players in the Transnationals will have played 70 boards today -- when they finish these 16 boards|pg||
nt|gracelin: 11-14 1NT by Hans/Nunn|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: so 2@D will be support with 4+S.. |pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Alon in the tank.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: they have rightsided the Heart game.  defenders cannot force effectvely.|pg||
nt|othered1: Some don't believe in superaccepting with only 3-csrd support.  Certainly helps parner evaluate prospects better|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpf: Rodwell asks to the meaning of @h3 - discouraging says Rosenberg|pg||
pc|dK|nt|desinka: agree, Ed.. but he really have a nice shape..|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: 5@H only down 3 for 500|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: south needs some sort of mixed raise bid here|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H (other room's choice) wld normally be weaker than this i think|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|ybob: yes agree  but shows 4 trumps and 2@D can be 3|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@D promised only 3 hearts i guess south has a little more offence than he might have...still some bid tho|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|athene: east of course doesn't know the clubs are coming down|pg||
nt|athene: so he will be worried about conceding a club trick and having the defence draw two rounds of trumps immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: he may finesse in @D to get rid of one @C-loser|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|vugraphznf: then he doesn't need to pick up the @C :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: hello Marc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: South has asked for a time monitor, East has taken allmost all the time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: North just asked about @SK|pg||
nt|kfay: Schwartz probably played the hearts the wrong way round on this hand, in my opinion.  It's more likely that someone sitting in 3rd seat at favorable vulnerability holding a heart ...|pg||
nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||
nt|othered1: West did have a bunch of HCP and didn't act, which may have affected north's decisions here.  Not that NS's auction gave him much of a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: he said that too :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Lotan just noticed me, he was to concentrated when I came in and swapped operator|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ritong: sure he did:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpf: North: 1@D=natural, Berkowitz nooo!!|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ritong: flannery was a hint, on the other hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: there have been 154 teams in the Transnationals|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 16 teams qualified for the Round of 16 - |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and now this is the first section of the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the remaining 16 boards will be played tomorrow |pg||
nt|desinka: 3@H = preemptive|pg||
nt|othered1: East won't be cowed by the NS actions|pg||
nt|desinka: for sure :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: the Israeli juniors are the cinderella team of this event, they are the current World champions and European champions for U-26|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: 2S is a limited raise or bette in D.  West of curse sign-off at 3D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: With that north hand and unable to pass 1@s with only 2, I would have tried 2@h weak.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south's preempt is fairly strong, but likely tempered by north's limited opening|pg||
nt|desinka: 7420 shape.. is playing "almost" alone|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: welcome to migry zur campanile|pg||
nt|gracelin: An early club shift from East will beat 3H, but a good sacrifice against the makeable 3D.|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mrt2000: or +2 now!|pg||
nt|yuval10: they impressed me as well as many other with their bridge level, and already beaten some very tough team in the 1/16 ( Smirnov ) and 1/8 (China open ) with big margin|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: east caught a good dummy (on the auction), but doesn't need all of that|pg||

nt|kfay: Schwartz's last chance would have been to underlead @cAc but Sontag wasn't going to go wrong on that anyway on account of the double, most likely, so he actually would have wound ...|pg||
nt|kfay: up with an overtrick.|pg||
nt|kfay: So maybe it's best he didn't try it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the difference before this segment should have been 6 imps in favor of Israel|pg||

nt|gracelin: Seems not much chances for Australia in the first few boards|pg||
nt|desinka: an intresting contract here|pg||

nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
mb|3D|an|alert|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|4C|an|alert|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
nt|othered1: this is an OK game, vul at imps, that simply figures not to make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|desinka: always -1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|othered1: Duboin is quite a declarer, but this one is beyond his skills|pg||
nt|desinka: :) |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|sT|nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

nt|phil: annoying result - but normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hello Phil|pg||
nt|kfay: South has kind of an interesting decision on this hand.  It's pretty vogue these days to bid 1N-3N with 4333 distribution even if you have a 4cM simply because your hand probably ...|pg||
nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has missed a great play but don't blame him.  We are seeng al 4 hands.|pg||
nt|kareno: My dear Patrick, good morning :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|desinka: now 2@D open (weak 6M)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: EW can make a lot of tricks in the red suits, and E is waisting no time|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|2S|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mrt2000: best lead found|pg||
nt|ritong: did meck mutter " no problem "?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: position so would go through the whole Stayman process anyway but it's not that big a worry in my opinion.  For one thing if you bother to stayman the opponents might be more able ...|pg||
nt|kfay: to find a killing lead if you end up in 3NT anyway on a lot of hands since they have more information available to them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ew lead 4th best it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia gained a small swing by beating both 3H this rom and 4D other room on  3.|pg||
nt|kareno: Easy hand for a change but not what OZ wants.|pg||
nt|desinka: rejects|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrt2000: A@C from E works wonders!|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW needs to find the @c ruff then it's 2 down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: And the club fit.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|mrt2000: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: very!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton and Fisher having a party on their side of the screen|pg||
nt|gracelin: In fact you don't see many 800, 1100 in this tournament even everybody took very bold actions.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: hey Gonzo|pg||
nt|phil: yes, E gets squoze down to a bare @c honor holding the diamond pictures|pg||
nt|desinka: o/e discarding|pg||
nt|desinka: so wants @D|pg||
nt|othered1: setting up the second suit is a normal strategy to avoid being tapped out if trumps break badly|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|gracelin: declarer is making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: you do get 3400's though ;)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kareno: Haven't seen one of those in years!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kfay: A kib mentions that some pairs have gadgetry available to show exactly 4333 or 3433 distribution.  I think that's usually accomplished with 1N-3M or something like that.  Who knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: what's actually best but I personally have had a few good experiences hiding information with 1N-3N, when I've decided to be 'modern' and bid that way.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|gracelin: really ? from a redouble ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yeah, big misunderstanding apparently|pg||
nt|kareno: I know what generates it but I haven't seen one in forever, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer plays DQ here, he can even endplay East to make an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kareno: But ... I'm sure he will take his seven and be happy :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he won't do that, as if West gets in, he still has two H to cash.|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ady: now nonow north may balance|pg||
nt|athene: if south had limited his hand by passing over 2@D he could maybe double 2@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but if he has to pass 2@D with a strong 1-4-4-4 he can't really double 2@S with the hand he has as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i think 2NT by W shows an invitational hand |pg||
nt|athene: no need for 3@S to be invitational there|pg||
nt|athene: he can bid 2nt or something over 2@S |pg||
nt|athene: of course nanev has a monster hand for a weak-two |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but still a pickup of 6 imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: but still it looks like some sort of misunderstanding since west obviously did not think 3@S was at all inviting pd to go on|pg||
nt|jbennet: no it wasnt|pg||

pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: east felt that 4@S was a bit of a 2-way shot maybe i.e. if his pd can only bid 2@H first time then opps might well have 4@H on and they might get there if he passes 3@S|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mrt2000: understable|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I even believe that Transnationals started at 10.00 :) --|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT maybe on if D breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: But a discreet pass by south.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At matchpoints, I'd reopen with the south hand if north passed in tempo.  But north acted,  quite reasonably, but not without risk.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
pc|sA|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|kareno: North perhaps considering re-entering the auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fluffy: still @d10xx is a great holding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing bad happenning here and it will make easily, but declarer may take a while to work things out.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|phil: if you play partner for 7-8 when you compete over a preempt (and raise to 4@s yourself) you'll do OK|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east felt bidding was too risky I suppose.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: And Rosenberg did ask to see it twice|pg||
nt|yuval10: here W has a super-maximum and of course was driven to game after E invited. looks perfectly normal, especially when they're red|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||
nt|kareno: At the highest level, part scores are contested hard.  Those relatively small IMPs add up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only an overtrick at risk here.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kfay: That's true.  But what's the big rush non-vulnerable?  |pg||
nt|desinka: but the declarer wasnt thinking at all to fineesse it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|desinka: :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|kareno: Okay next :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Believe this Israeli team won the Junior event in Philadelphia last year.  They now prove they can also win in the adult world.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kfay: Maybe he was influenced by three not-so-great boards so far this set.|pg||
nt|fluffy: now Fisher might run over Schwartz for not bidding the making slam :)|pg||

nt|jbennet: a good philosophy is to act when its cheap to do so.|pg||
nt|athene: they might just transfer and stop in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but they might not be able to; depends how they play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thats  why I prefer natural weak opening 2 bis rather rhan 2 multi   more pre-emptive|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: or as the french do, bid 3 NT without a fit|pg||

nt|gracelin: final|pg||
mb|2D!|an|18/19 bal|nt|kfay: Even if you're more sound I still think this is a 1@H opener.|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: its been a 1@h opener for about 20 years :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|migry: 2NT is natural|pg||
nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is probably a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they have all been Bar Mitzvah so in theory they are adults :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
nt|desinka: right, make more sense now|pg||
nt|othered1: And then: 2@H show 4+S or strong one suited in @S-@C or @D|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||
nt|migry: a mobile phone rang in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|phil: the only relevant decision was actually stopping in 3|pg||
nt|kfay: From the schedule it looks like there's not a playoff in this event, so this would be the end of the line for the losing team.  Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong about ...|pg||
nt|kfay: that.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|ritong: dura lex sed lex|pg||
nt|migry: you are not even supposed to have any electronic devices in the playing area|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Whatever he pitches, he still needs the club onside.  Likely on the auction.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|yuval10: they're playing 3NT next door as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|migry: looks there is some meltdown in the other room|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and here ...............|pg||

mc|9|nt|othered1: in 4, west likely would have played differently and would have made it|pg||

nt|ady: cant see how A@H first costs|pg||
mb|1D|nt|friggi: it does not|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: if @H K is singleton you everytime win 2NT|pg||
nt|jbennet: playing ace of hearts first makes it impossible to induce an error from Kxx in hearts. |pg||
nt|athene: gives up control|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: makes it a bit less likely they will grab king when it's wrong (unlikely at this level but still)|pg||
nt|athene: also gives up chance of endplay|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: looks like an easy 3@C for south now|pg||
nt|jbennet: but by starting with H Jack ther might have been a layout where a defender with Kxx might find a reason to win the trick.|pg||
nt|athene: does he think he is too strong for that?|pg||
nt|ybob: 2NT my choice|pg||
nt|athene: or too weak? or what?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|an|4th suit|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|jbennet: agree that 2NT a better choice with all those NT-oriented honor cards.|pg||
nt|athene: finesse against the @D10 would work but i am not sure you want to do that as declarer|pg||
nt|athene: if you lose to west's @D10 you really are pretty much dead|pg||
nt|athene: he might finesse the other way i suppose - run the @D9?|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play well to make|pg||
nt|ybob: declarer needs guess @D|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: 3nt contracts where you have a solid 4-4 fit like the clubs here are often quite tricky|pg||
nt|ybob: 10@S @C to K and @D finesse ...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbennet: it looks like finding the d play is the only way.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: because you have a lot of cards and a lot of hcp (8 cards, 10 hcp) tied up in only 4 tricks|pg||
nt|jbennet: east probably showed 9xx.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: he might just play ace and another diamond to the queen|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: and hope that he can guess an endplay later if west does have @DK10xx or so|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jbennet: he has to guess who is favourite to have D 10.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ybob: now @C to 9|pg||
nt|athene: playing this way you have the chance they will cover the @DQ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||
mc|9|nt|ybob: and @d wd|pg||
nt|jbennet: now if he trusts east D play then he should finf the right play|pg||
nt|athene: and even if they don't you can guess whether @DK or @D10 is tripleton|pg||
nt|ady: good guess |pg||
nt|athene: well did west give honest upside-down count?|pg||
pg||
qx|c8|st||md|2SQ832H5DQJ98CKQJ9,SKJ76HKJ8DK75C762,SATHQT932DA3CAT43,S954HA764DT642C85|sv|o|nt|gracelin: Hans played nicely to make 4D, but probably o prize.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz asking where all the @S's were, Fisher just says next board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kfay: I'm informed that the team that finished higher in the Swiss between the two losing semi-finalists is awarded 3rd place.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
mb|2H|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a minisplinter and east likes it.|pg||
nt|kareno: For me it's 5 am so I don't object :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
pc|d8|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead and choice of plays from dummy give declarer 8 tricks.  Where the 9th comes from is another question|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they're juniors, we shouldn't expect anything less from them|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry Karen, I need to go and will leave the table to you.  |pg||
nt|kareno: And naturally, here it is|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye and good lucks eveyone.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|dA|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||
nt|migry: which explains the "passed out" score|pg||
nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, let s leave that into director's capable hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Padon asking 'how many you have, 17?'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 only|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman: 'no, 19'. Padon: I didn't mean points, I meant tricks :-)|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well too high now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: 4@h makes NS but GL getting in |pg||
nt|fluffy: to get 2 down schwartz has to play a club through to avoid endplay later|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: Oops.  best to be careful with that diamond shift.  Going down now.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|kareno: Diamonds break so six is assured.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: now an overtrick might be possible|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: East hoped that north's diamond was a doubleton and he could shut out the south hand.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|mc|9|nt|othered1: taking a very safe 9 tricks, juust in case|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West chewing his nails|pg||
pg||

nt|athene: and east also|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: yet easts signalling was everytime correct|pg||
nt|athene: it is certainly true that people who play UDCA tend to signal more |pg||
nt|ybob: i go out now, thx all :) enjoyed |pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-14|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|ady: assume 2@D   shows either major suit|pg||

nt|ady: looks like 3 losers   1 diamond  1 spade   and 1 heart|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jbennet: if south had been on lead it might have been embarrasing. Now East is likely to win and reel of AK9 of hearts.|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: west is asking what to lead from KQ, south explains he may play whatever he wants|pg||

nt|athene: you ruff high|pg||
nt|jbennet: he can prevail if and only if winning |pg||
nt|athene: then back to @DJ and throw the spade loser|pg||

nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|phil: same penalty got assessed against USA2 in the semis - I agree its excessive|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel Juniors was +6 beore this set\|pg||

nt|mrt2000: the dreaded flannery again!   lol|pg||
nt|ritong: not universally|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: so Gordon is +13 now|pg||
nt|desinka: bad guess :)|pg||
nt|othered1: not a 14 point 1N here?|pg||
nt|desinka: no|pg||

nt|othered1: OK, thanks.|pg||
nt|desinka: np|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|alert|nt|Walddk2:  Without it you would never be able to get to a heart contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT probably mere minimum|pg||
nt|migry: without 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|fluffy: berkowitz has good shape but bad vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: when I try this doubles opponetns have 5332 opposite 3334 and I'm toasted :P|pg||
nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|kareno: No slam.  Presumably south will think he has too many spades to get a penalty worth it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, that make the 1N on the last hand look even more strange to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: a trump at any point would have left declarer with 3 spade losers, the @h ruff and the A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@H would not work|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: Not enough controls.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: robert, what is the oz NT range|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpf: NS discussing system with screen still closed. 4432|pg||
nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
nt|kareno: Four can be made with the help of a spade finesse.  We'll watch and see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 6NT you have to guess the red suit which is seemingly impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: haven't seen an exact range yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: now there is a chance they never find hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: North needs to duck a club lead to the king if that comes first.  But still the spade play will win.|pg||
nt|kareno: ???|pg||
pc|d3|nt|migry: I was wondering when you'll say something roland:)|pg||
nt|ritong: easy|pg||
nt|ritong: any flannery bid and our friend is up for a small fight:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but schwartz still has the 9th spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nunn's wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|othered1: decent spot.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: declarer asking for the leads: 2/4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Looks like some IMPs are coming back to OZ|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but from xx the small one and from 10x the 10|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fluffy: wich is awful for defending|pg||
nt|othered1: would south really lead from 10x in an ambiguously opened suit?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|othered1: from xx, rather|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|ritong: talking about small fights, other room is a riot|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  How can you get to 4@H if North opens 1@H? Impossible, right? So that F convention is magical|pg||
nt|kareno: A club return by north would be far-seeing but east can get it right.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Always beware when opponents play a suit you cannot play yourself :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Oosman :)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Oosman-wlc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Could the @D10 have been an indication that South has the @SA?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So I missed a few cards here, but it looks like he can eliminate @D and then play @S up and pray?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: North would have to duck the first club to give declarer a real guess.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if South has A@C doesnt it make anyway?|pg||
nt|desinka: i explain it clearly..|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: when playing transfer responses i play 1@S rebid by west as asking opener to rebid 1nt to right side the contract|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|kareno: Yes, it does.  Here's Nunn going right at once.  Good job!!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: Getting a few comments arguing that the penalty is just or even not harsh enough (in chess you can forfeit if you're slow enough).  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||

nt|athene: that line would not work if north had another diamond because south could throw his last diamond on the club and ruff when you tried to get back to hand|pg||
nt|athene: so you would be playing north for 2-2 in the reds|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: Running scores from all matches are available at: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|athene: but everyone bends 1NT openers these days :) so maybe it was still findable|pg||
nt|ady: how could 3@D make   CR?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: it is down 2 in the CR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ady: sorry    seeing things|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|athene: NS might be in 4@S on the hand|pg||
nt|athene: in here|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 4@S should be a trick short|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt opener here means you won't play restricted choice in spades i guess|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C!|nt|ady: 4@S  kijely to make on K@H lead     and still has play on other leads|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: maybe you can make because of both @H KQ onside, but I'm still not sure :-)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S looks makeable to me|pg||
nt|jbennet: to beat 4sp ew must immediately shorten  south:s trumps with d play. |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 2@S shows either a balanced invitation to 3 NT, or both minors or weak with @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jbennet: think D king and another might break 4 sp.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: in 4@S even if the defence began diamond, diamond you could ruff, spade, @H10 covered, spade to hand, heart up, and east has to give dummy an entry in clubs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|athene: you can make 6 spades in hand, one diamond ruff, and two hearts and a club for sure|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|2N!|an|!ds|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||

nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||

pc|h6|nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dA|nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kfay: Glad to hear you play the same way :P|pg||

nt|athene: so they might well wander up to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: west might think his pd has the same hand but with the @SQ and/or @CK say|pg||
nt|athene: he might feel obliged to bid more than just 4@S now since he has the diamond control?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but knowing partner doesn't have a @D control seems to be a warning here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|athene: true u might be off @DA and ruff |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: partner has 2+ @D, you have 4, your opp rates to have 5+ often|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: ok so 5@S is a bit higher than u want to be |pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphznf: can you make 5@S after the theoretical lead of the @D J?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: tricky lead problem; on the bidding west has the @DK so cashing that might be wrong|pg||
nt|athene: pd didn't double 4@H but that cld still be right i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: you know pd shld have nothing if opps are half-way sane :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: north has to know partner doesn't have anything at all|pg||

nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|3C!|an|gf|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|3H|an|4+!cs|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: np - welcome back :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
pc|dK|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes indeed.|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher said @S are 3-3, Berkowitz, that's not fun :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
mb|1C|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|fluffy: berkowitz can envision 12 tricks if partner has a perfect hand, but soon he will see there is no luck today|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Maybe exclusion blackwood??  Does that give enough information?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: Teach me to assume :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: assume nothing.. works for me|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|phil: I for one appreciate Gerbrand's detail descriptions of the calls :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kfay: Yeah Gerbrand.  When are they going to give you a full-time job?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: bye|pg||
nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: I saw very slow players in this tournament which maybe the cause of the nap during the game.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Well, it would have been my play for what it's worth.  Sets up several tricks instead of one with a prayer.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: West hapy he is not vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|phil: his partner must habititually lead the beer :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah declarer won't put a honnor with an ace anyway|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzpf: only 50's he'll be saying to himself|pg||
mc|10|nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct as always, Patrick.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag: we gave them to much information, Fisher: yes, @H lead would have been better, Sontag: and faster|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is trying to guard against 4-1 in both majors.  He's finally aware can't be done with assurance.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: how's 3NT NS|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt my guess here.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: here NS in the OR did well to bid to a marginal game|pg||
nt|desinka: this opening may cost some trouble..|pg||
nt|desinka: will .. actually|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 3NT from South now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Qx is good enough|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, somebody has to bid notrumps.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have as north, frankly.|pg||
nt|othered1: How far is 2/1 forcing for them?|pg||
nt|desinka: GF|pg||
pc|d5|nt|desinka: far enough :)|pg||
nt|desinka: has to take the A|pg||
nt|desinka: like one of the specs suggested|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kfay: Is that some kind of crack about my declarer play?|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Well done Fisher|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Made it look easy. |pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.  |pg||
nt|desinka: good position of the @Ss but.. no communications.. |pg||
nt|desinka: 10 of @D lies..|pg||
nt|othered1: When you evaluate the light Precision opening, don't forget to include hands like this.  Usual Imp odds on vul games are for making v. down 1.  Down a bunch, even undoubled, change ...|pg||
nt|othered1: them meaningfully.|pg||
nt|desinka: so probably will try to finnesse..the @ds|pg||
nt|desinka: good point!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|ritong: would be fine to go down one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||
nt|migry: 2@s would have made, 3@c rates to go 2 down as it will be difficult to guess the 10@c|pg||
nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||
nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: schwartz should be thinking about @sA10xx in 1NT bidder's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to play under the assumption that good things will be  happening.  this contract isn't for pessimists|pg||
nt|desinka: like i said.. 10@D lies..|pg||
nt|desinka: 8@D now.. but it doesnt work|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He'll take this in a hurry!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|kareno: I agree with that strategy, Patrick.  I think you play as well as you can and keep track of the swings you think you are winning and can decide at the end what to do.  You have ...|pg||
nt|kareno: partners who may be having great results and you don't want to throw them away.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|phil: maybe - spade might have been led though|pg||
nt|gracelin: true.  A team should discuss their strategy for various scenario before the last set started.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: E taking a long look at the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now turns his card|pg||
nt|desinka: agree Ed, but we see the cards.. and we cannot be positive abt this contract :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|oosmanb: Nice careful play wants J@D as an entry|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kfay: The Israelis are running out of real estate fast.  These 32-board matches are just... bleh.  I'm really against them.  But I guess they only have so much time.  Still, I don't see ...|pg||
nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||

pc|h2|nt|yuval10: going down now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|migry: no idea how he figured out the 3 clubs with west when east didn't even show both majors|pg||

nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||

nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|vugraphznf: cannot imagine that passing 3 times east hand is winning bridge - and it isn't this time.. even if you play precision and cannot open light in 3rd hand with 1!@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 2nd half of the Quarter finals is playe tomorrow at 10.00 am here in Veldhoved -- guess its 4.00am in New York|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board, Parimatch will continue to the semi finals of the transnationals.|pg||
nt|yuval10: entering the last board of the first haw, Israel holds a slim lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board of this Semi-Final, the final should start at 18.20 local time, thats 35 min from now, I believe we are a bit late on shedule..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And a @c lead set up a ruff in 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||
nt|kareno: With the natural trump trick (unless first lead small from dummy)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (that's if you can drop singleton A without wasting an honour)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: David Berkowits and Alan Sontag are due up for the Gordon team.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Robert Stephens who like all the operators did an excellent job|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in trumps|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||
nt|kfay: But clearly it's at least somewhat undiscussed so I'm not sure why he'd expect all of this.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so all in all, not a bad board|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
mb|r|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @S|pg||
nt|othered1: another light 3rd seat opening by Sementa, this one feather-light|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: can the Israeli team hold up and "kill" yet another giant? we'll know right away. i believe the 2nd half was due to start 15:40 local time|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not pass with that east hand.  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they play 2@H as invitational here.  Many play it preemptive over a power redouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I'll be using it for some sleep :)  |pg||
nt|othered1: passing 3@C wold be quite a position, despite south's inaction at  his last two turns|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzpf: and DBL = "Clarify" partner|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as predicited   :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can ask Bas to bring you some Marc :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: predicted|pg||

nt|fluffy: another israel juniors had this same sequence yesterday|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: the 3@h bidder had @hAK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: a 2-way partial swing is, after all, 6 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpf: Bas is off today|pg||
nt|kareno: Claim before you make a mistake!!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: He heard me :)|pg||
nt|kareno: The other table is well behind ours so you can go over there now.  Looks very much like Mazel Tov to Israel :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok that is 1:30 am Vancouver time, 4:30 New York|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yuval10: he could've played @c and make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps the 1@SX a couple of boards ago had some psychological effect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno: Yes, precisely.  But he will get his partscore equity (if any) from this contract.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
nt|kfay: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|kfay: See you, Gonzo.  Thanks.|pg||

nt|oosmanb: It's good to instill some fear in your opponents, (entering into auctions is not free)|pg||

nt|ady: Vito have done extremely well in CR|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|athene: after EW bid hearts a lot you decide that @HAx facing @Hxx is not enough|pg||
nt|athene: madala has 1@S now to show 0-3 spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: or 2@H to ask for a stopper?|pg||
mb|1S!|an|0-3 !S, forcing|nt|ady: 4 spades can be defeated with a club ruff    but an unlikely defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but you were right|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: their old CC had continuations here in supplemental notes but their new one just has the 2-level openers, nothing about the other bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ady: could well settle for the 300|pg||
nt|athene: well all the indications are there that a 4-3 spade fit is good|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: can't you just beat 4@S with leading and continuing @H, ducking @S A twice or am I wrong?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: well spades are 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: doubleton clib lead ducked ?|pg||
nt|ady: club|pg||
nt|athene: you can beat with club ruff as declarer must lose a heart eventually anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but if you duck @S 2 times you may play @C first before giving the trick away with @S A|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can play two rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|athene: and if you duck twice then the club ruff is with the @SA anyway|pg||
nt|athene: and if you win the @SA earlier you can't force|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: it's only if two trumps get ducked that declarer might turn his attention to clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so there is no danger|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: madala has the @H 5 in his hand - not the right idea |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: now he thought the same ;-)|pg||
nt|athene: of course madala is worried that playing clubs now will incur a ruff with small spade|pg||
nt|athene: but if the @S10 is with short clubs and not the @CA you are just dead whatever you do|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but I think you have no choice but playing @C|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: you have to play clubs|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes the tactical issue here is trying to persuade someone with @CAxx to win it first time, not duck|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: and he is on the way to do it, just thinking which card to play so the opp may make a mistake if @C A doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: when in this sort of contract  have to assume things are right |pg||
nt|athene: so if north were declarer he might try leading a club to the king|pg||
nt|athene: if he thinks west has the @CA|pg||
nt|athene: or leading a club to the queen if he thought east had it|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: still more problems|pg||
nt|athene: with @CQJxx visible tho, there is not much you can do to induce a misdefence i would not think|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: in the closed room east gave the contract away|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: after south won the 2nd @H he switeched to @C which was not ducked|pg||
nt|jbennet: yep and only chance now another club (hoping sp 33 + no club ruff with sp 10 available)|pg||
nt|athene: south might be wondering if diamonds are 3-3; then he could throw the @H8 even if someone ruffed with the @S10|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: good idea, and e/w gave only honest count so far|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: will west do again if he plays @D 2 ?|pg||
nt|athene: well, west might have @C952 and east @DA4 doubleton|pg||
nt|jbennet: D 33 no use to him. |pg||
nt|athene: @CA4 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: that would make diamonds 3-3?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: if diamonds are 3-3 and the one with @C A doesn't have the @S A|pg||
nt|athene: you must assume 3-3 trumps, and you know hearts are 5-4|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: and @C will be 3-2 :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: so @D could be 3-3 :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: so play 4 rounds of D discaring the heart. ?? |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but would west with 4333 jump to 3 @H?|pg||
nt|athene: how about playing one diamond :) EW seem to give count very honestly|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jbennet: dummy being forced again.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|jbennet: and again when in with club ace|pg||
nt|jbennet: so D 33 would not have helped.|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: I think you are not right Johan|pg||
nt|athene: you would be ok as long as the person with the @SA can't get in and cash it|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: exactly, what means @C A has to be at the other side |pg||

nt|jbennet: 4sp need spades 3-3 + some other good things to happen. But sometimes the cards are friendly , and it declarers task to make the most of it. (not over until the fat lady sings)|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: he needs to find both @C Q and @H Q to make, doesnt he?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|jbennet: 4 sp makeable, but if east goes for D ruffs he will lose 4 trump tricks. Not clear if makeable DD.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: certainly makeable|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|athene: he had to decide whether to go for diamond ruffs or just draw trumps and try to set up dummy's suits|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphznf: if south plays @D now and ducks the J of @C of east, east has to overtake it in dummy and to finesse later, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|athene: yes clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: declarer needs all four club tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but he also needs two dummy entries to use the hearts|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: and he can't do it if the @CJ is not covered|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he return club east will finesse with the 10 (or win a and unbluck the jack)|pg||
nt|jbennet: but he should choose the latter and the play KJ of hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: beacuse then he will see heats 5-2 |pg||
nt|vugraphznf: i'm sure, it doesn't matter if I'm declarer or defender in this hand, I would much to prefer to be in 2@S :-)|pg||
nt|jbennet: but still only 9 tricks. 2+3+1+3|pg||

nt|athene: you squeeze south down to singleton @DK then north gets squeezed in red suits when you run the clubs|pg||

nt|athene: bocchi waiting for his pd to double 2@S - if so then he might have taken a shot at 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: now @H J would be the good to make sure down 2 on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: should be plus in both rooms for Allegra|pg||
nt|jbennet: -2 possible.|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: but even @D return now will lead to at least -1|pg||
nt|jbennet: but only if south plays heart now. (or at trick 4).|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: if the declarer plays @C 9 in the first @C trick|pg||
