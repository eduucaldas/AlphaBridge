nt|kfay: Schwartz probably played the hearts the wrong way round on this hand, in my opinion.  It's more likely that someone sitting in 3rd seat at favorable vulnerability holding a heart ...|pg||
nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||
nt|othered1: West did have a bunch of HCP and didn't act, which may have affected north's decisions here.  Not that NS's auction gave him much of a chance|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: the Israeli juniors are the cinderella team of this event, they are the current World champions and European champions for U-26|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt have predicted that contract|pg||
mb|2H|nt|gracelin: 2S is a limited raise or bette in D.  West of curse sign-off at 3D|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kareno: With that north hand and unable to pass 1@s with only 2, I would have tried 2@h weak.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south's preempt is fairly strong, but likely tempered by north's limited opening|pg||
nt|desinka: 7420 shape.. is playing "almost" alone|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: welcome to migry zur campanile|pg||
nt|gracelin: An early club shift from East will beat 3H, but a good sacrifice against the makeable 3D.|pg||

nt|kfay: Schwartz's last chance would have been to underlead @cAc but Sontag wasn't going to go wrong on that anyway on account of the double, most likely, so he actually would have wound ...|pg||
nt|kfay: up with an overtrick.|pg||
nt|kfay: So maybe it's best he didn't try it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the difference before this segment should have been 6 imps in favor of Israel|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 solid results for Australia on rather flat boards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Seems not much chances for Australia in the first few boards|pg||
nt|desinka: an intresting contract here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Or maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe he didn't have enough trump left.|pg||

nt|othered1: Do EW play Gazzilli?  If so, we may see it here.|pg||

nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@H transfer to @S|pg||
mb|2C!|an|drury|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|2H!|an|alerted|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C checkback i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt by Magnusson in open fared 11 imps to Iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
nt|othered1: this is an OK game, vul at imps, that simply figures not to make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|desinka: always -1|pg||
nt|panosk: or Grant Thornton if you prefer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|othered1: Duboin is quite a declarer, but this one is beyond his skills|pg||
nt|desinka: :) |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: can make 4 i think now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|panosk: no he cant no entry to hand to cash last gd @H and discard a @C so just 3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

nt|phil: annoying result - but normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hello Phil|pg||
nt|kfay: South has kind of an interesting decision on this hand.  It's pretty vogue these days to bid 1N-3N with 4333 distribution even if you have a 4cM simply because your hand probably ...|pg||
nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has missed a great play but don't blame him.  We are seeng al 4 hands.|pg||
nt|kareno: My dear Patrick, good morning :)|pg||
mb|1D|an|usually 5 cards|nt|desinka: now 2@D open (weak 6M)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: EW can make a lot of tricks in the red suits, and E is waisting no time|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mrt2000: best lead found|pg||
nt|ritong: did meck mutter " no problem "?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W thinking now|pg||
nt|april7: NS might reach 3NT here but will be unsuccessful|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kfay: position so would go through the whole Stayman process anyway but it's not that big a worry in my opinion.  For one thing if you bother to stayman the opponents might be more able ...|pg||
nt|kfay: to find a killing lead if you end up in 3NT anyway on a lot of hands since they have more information available to them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ew lead 4th best it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia gained a small swing by beating both 3H this rom and 4D other room on  3.|pg||
nt|kareno: Easy hand for a change but not what OZ wants.|pg||
nt|desinka: rejects|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
nt|april7: this was agood decision by N to pass|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H wasnt alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not on my screenside|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrt2000: A@C from E works wonders!|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW needs to find the @c ruff then it's 2 down|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kareno: And the club fit.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panosk: ok thx Frederic, |pg||
pc|h9|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: SW that is|pg||
nt|panosk: looks as if it was transfer to @S to me |pg||
pc|dA|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
nt|panosk: i can be wrong, i havent fully incorporated transfers in my system yet :) |pg||
pc|s8|nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

nt|phil: yes, E gets squoze down to a bare @c honor holding the diamond pictures|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT maybe on if D breaks|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: But a discreet pass by south.|pg||
nt|panosk: W needs to return @d early to defeat but i think he will|pg||
nt|april7: here a clear NT hand, but now EW might get into trouble in  the @S contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At matchpoints, I'd reopen with the south hand if north passed in tempo.  But north acted,  quite reasonably, but not without risk.|pg||
nt|april7: S should pass!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 tricks in his hand!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
pc|c3|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
nt|april7: 2 down on norma defence|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|kareno: North perhaps considering re-entering the auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fluffy: still @d10xx is a great holding|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing bad happenning here and it will make easily, but declarer may take a while to work things out.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: if S get recive the @D ruff,then 3 down|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil: if you play partner for 7-8 when you compete over a preempt (and raise to 4@s yourself) you'll do OK|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east felt bidding was too risky I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|april7: hi|pg||
pc|s7|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: And Rosenberg did ask to see it twice|pg||
nt|yuval10: here W has a super-maximum and of course was driven to game after E invited. looks perfectly normal, especially when they're red|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||
nt|kareno: At the highest level, part scores are contested hard.  Those relatively small IMPs add up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only an overtrick at risk here.|pg||
nt|panosk: gd try by S, but E had A@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kfay: That's true.  But what's the big rush non-vulnerable?  |pg||
nt|desinka: but the declarer wasnt thinking at all to fineesse it|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kfay: Maybe he was influenced by three not-so-great boards so far this set.|pg||

nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt is brave enough|pg||
mb|3S!|an|alerted|nt|ady: 3NT by north no chance though on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
nt|panosk: see how much easier double dummy makes finding the right contract :)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Karisruher  kept low in OR|pg||
nt|april7: its a unusual stop in OR at 2@H!!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and @H back and very down you go!!!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
nt|desinka: right, make more sense now|pg||
nt|othered1: And then: 2@H show 4+S or strong one suited in @S-@C or @D|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|s7|nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose can make now playing a club towards the queen|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|phil: the only relevant decision was actually stopping in 3|pg||

nt|kfay: that.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|ritong: dura lex sed lex|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
nt|april7: after a 2@S opener weak, NS might reach 4 @S, but E W will surely reach 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
nt|panosk: and Holland strikes back |pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a minisplinter and east likes it.|pg||
nt|kareno: For me it's 5 am so I don't object :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S too expensive  at the vulnerability|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
nt|april7: now Germany will pick up a few imps|pg||
mc|11|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2:  Without it you would never be able to get to a heart contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT probably mere minimum|pg||

nt|fluffy: berkowitz has good shape but bad vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: when I try this doubles opponetns have 5332 opposite 3334 and I'm toasted :P|pg||
nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|kareno: No slam.  Presumably south will think he has too many spades to get a penalty worth it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, that make the 1N on the last hand look even more strange to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: a trump at any point would have left declarer with 3 spade losers, the @h ruff and the A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@H would not work|pg||
mb|3C|an|puppet|nt|kareno: Not enough controls.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: robert, what is the oz NT range|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpf: NS discussing system with screen still closed. 4432|pg||
nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
nt|kareno: Four can be made with the help of a spade finesse.  We'll watch and see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 6NT you have to guess the red suit which is seemingly impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: haven't seen an exact range yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: now there is a chance they never find hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table(s) visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||

nt|april7: 3NT by EW, making exactly 9 tricks on normal play|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|1H|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
nt|panosk: another 6@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|2S|an|weak jump|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
nt|ady: some might open east hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
nt|panosk: Netherlands (EW) scored 23 imps in last 4 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C must be long diamonds and 3@S values in spades i think|pg||
nt|panosk: make it 36 imps in last 5 boards|pg||
nt|ady: playing weak jump shifts   so 2@S weak|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might chose now 3@C and S then 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W just said they dont play weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
nt|panosk: ok not then :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 2NT natural here   leb not necessary as a passed hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|panosk: the success of the dutch team in Bermuda Bowl is largely attributed in their slam bidding, you can see now why|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|ady: a better spot than 3@H   as played in OR by south|pg||
nt|april7: its a much better contract then 2NT but still going probably 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: E should take this trickn anyway andlead the Q of @H|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kfay: Glad to hear you play the same way :P|pg||

nt|panosk: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: and it was a push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: the idea behind [reverse] Smith is   when declarer leads his suit at trick 2, each defender can tell whether or not they liked the opening lead  [unless card needed to show length]|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: what would you do here?|pg||
nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!ss|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
nt|april7: E 1NT and then we will see after @S attack|pg||
mb|1S!|an|3!ss|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: np - welcome back :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S looking very surprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
nt|april7: E should actually go down |pg||
nt|ady: not much on here    2 spades might make with a struggle|pg||
mb|d|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
nt|panosk: if you think your pard is reasonable he must have around 7 @C and 6-7 pts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
nt|april7: N might come up with a X now but S can't probably stand it|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will be at  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: web page for the event   http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/Champions%20Cup/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friendly layout here for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: I have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT also might go down on a spade lead    south felt to weak to pass|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panosk: -1|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the round robin matches are 20 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups of 6 teams   then various KO matchups follow|pg||
nt|ady: 3 heart tricks available for declarer  playing next one to the 10  when the 9 drops|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: now 8 tricks available   draw trumps|pg||
nt|april7: even 9 by playing @D K now|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes indeed.|pg||

nt|baldjean: May wind up in 4@h here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
mb|2S|nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|baldjean: A@d looks likea liekly lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29   dutch also playing 5@C|pg||
nt|baldjean: likely*|pg||
nt|othered1: They can be topcarded out, but the @S have to be cashed before declarer gains the lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
nt|ady: could be the best plus for n/s  would be to pass the 1NT  but has its risks |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W showing his @H holding to S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just upside-down count/attitude|pg||
nt|othered1: If it did show preference to @S, why would west shift to trumps?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: bye|pg||
nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: I saw very slow players in this tournament which maybe the cause of the nap during the game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H8 DOES show suit pref for @S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it would have been my play for what it's worth.  Sets up several tricks instead of one with a prayer.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: West hapy he is not vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|phil: his partner must habititually lead the beer :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah declarer won't put a honnor with an ace anyway|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: only 50's he'll be saying to himself|pg||
nt|othered1: but too late|pg||
nt|baldjean: No idea, but what else can 9@d mean?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct as always, Patrick.|pg||
nt|panosk: tough hand|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yuval10: only hope for E is if W has Q@c and Q@s, not now though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kfay: Having a complete count has really helped the defense here.  It's important to know that as a defender you should NOT give count at ALL on a hand like this, since everyone knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: that anyway.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nabil bought the auction in 3@S and ended -1 undbld|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag: we gave them to much information, Fisher: yes, @H lead would have been better, Sontag: and faster|pg||

nt|kareno: 3nt my guess here.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|yuval10: here NS in the OR did well to bid to a marginal game|pg||
nt|desinka: this opening may cost some trouble..|pg||
nt|desinka: will .. actually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Gazzilli  |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not my cup of tea  weak jump overcall with that suit    but should be ok|pg||
nt|ady: west a bit stuck with 11 hcp|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) nat  b) any 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = nat and weak|pg||
nt|panosk: wc :)|pg||
nt|ady: thats a real gamble|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 3NT from South now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Qx is good enough|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, somebody has to bid notrumps.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have as north, frankly.|pg||
nt|othered1: How far is 2/1 forcing for them?|pg||
nt|desinka: GF|pg||
nt|ady: at least down 1    |pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: far enough :)|pg||
nt|desinka: has to take the A|pg||
nt|desinka: like one of the specs suggested|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Is that some kind of crack about my declarer play?|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: and 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a mystery to me|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: Well done Fisher|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Made it look easy. |pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.  |pg||
nt|desinka: good position of the @Ss but.. no communications.. |pg||
nt|desinka: 10 of @D lies..|pg||
nt|othered1: When you evaluate the light Precision opening, don't forget to include hands like this.  Usual Imp odds on vul games are for making v. down 1.  Down a bunch, even undoubled, change ...|pg||
nt|othered1: them meaningfully.|pg||
nt|desinka: so probably will try to finnesse..the @ds|pg||
nt|desinka: good point!|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps thinking 4@C a splinter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: NS are not on one wavelenght about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S thought cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N thought 5-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wind is swirling   [that's excuse they use in Golf --- why not here??]|pg||
nt|baldjean: It's rare to see such a misunderstanding on that high level|pg||
nt|panosk: a chance to make now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: would be fine to go down one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||
nt|migry: 2@s would have made, 3@c rates to go 2 down as it will be difficult to guess the 10@c|pg||
nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||
nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: schwartz should be thinking about @sA10xx in 1NT bidder's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to play under the assumption that good things will be  happening.  this contract isn't for pessimists|pg||
nt|desinka: like i said.. 10@D lies..|pg||
nt|desinka: 8@D now.. but it doesnt work|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree with that strategy, Patrick.  I think you play as well as you can and keep track of the swings you think you are winning and can decide at the end what to do.  You have ...|pg||
nt|kareno: partners who may be having great results and you don't want to throw them away.|pg||
nt|ady: will be 300 as it is provided he plays 2 rounds of trumps quickly|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panosk: duck of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: maybe - spade might have been led though|pg||
nt|gracelin: true.  A team should discuss their strategy for various scenario before the last set started.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: E taking a long look at the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now turns his card|pg||
nt|desinka: agree Ed, but we see the cards.. and we cannot be positive abt this contract :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Nice careful play wants J@D as an entry|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kfay: The Israelis are running out of real estate fast.  These 32-board matches are just... bleh.  I'm really against them.  But I guess they only have so much time.  Still, I don't see ...|pg||
nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||
nt|kfay: semifinal should be allowed.|pg||

nt|kareno: Possible pass by south at equal vulnerability.|pg||
nt|baldjean: Bertens has 11 good hcp  and 3 trumps as support, but a flat hand.|pg||

nt|kfay: In the swiss.|pg||

nt|ady: diamond ok   but had the diamond and club honors been reversed  could have been wrong|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: I like it!!|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't need a natural quantitative 2N raise here, as they open those hands 2@D (or perhaps rebid a forcing 2@C?) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens' option was  1@C=2+|pg||
nt|panosk: if 2nt id invitational my choice wud be 3nt as W hand looks nice to venture 3 nt|pg||
nt|panosk: *if 2nt is |pg||
pc|d5|nt|odysseus69: I am sure that it is the right thing to do - it is an agreement which is not apparent from the CC and oppo should be entitled to know what partner knows|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: GREAT bid from S|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher had the tougher decision about balancing between the two, in my opinion.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|migry: and another good result here, pushing EW to the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi offers his @s3 to Westra|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not critical of passing -- I would myself in almost all systems, even at these colors, just noting that it's not a position that many would take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer seems to have 2 options     1) go down slowly  2) go down quickly|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ady: down 2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: Same shape with the KJ in either rounded suit I'm sure Schwartz would have done something.|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|migry: especially assuming the spades are over him|pg||

pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: -4 likely|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its boards like these that have made Fisher and Schwartz possibly the best junior pair in the world right now|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: on the previous board nunn lead his partners suit so 3nt made for 10 imps to israel|pg||

mb|3H|an|5-5 GF|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@c should be 2-suiter , interesting to see that South didn't double for "support"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mrt2000: 6@C happens to make, but not a great contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
nt|panosk: in fact as cards ly isnt such a gd bet|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||
nt|kareno: This is likely to be down one and could be a pickup if n/s bid 4@h in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he probably didn't favour the colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S, 7+ HCP, maybe longer @D    [1@C is almost forcing]|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably not underrated at this table, I'm sure.  Just in everyday tournaments.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: if the declarer will take top @s in the 2nd round and plays @h, he'll due to make his contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Pd didnt have enough to even neg dbl 1@S |pg||
nt|kareno: Another possible pass of a negative double :)|pg||
nt|panosk: on probabilities not double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: any slam but 6NT is doomed here|pg||
nt|panosk: it isnt if you take both major finesses i think |pg||
nt|panosk: decl can discard a @C in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: even 6NT is down because lack of communication?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D= natural or 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|panosk: on @HA or @HJ |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @c ruff in 6@d|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|yuval10: E can play J@d in the 2nd round also, but that'd be tough|pg||
nt|yuval10: and of course declarer can still make his contract by attacking @c then|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll have to guess which Ace does E holds - A@h or A@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag when he saw @SA, hmm, |pg||
nt|panosk: true|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: 5@c should show good trumps|pg||
nt|migry: they don't play 'fast approach"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I agree with the pass|pg||
nt|kareno: He has a one club opening without the spade king!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|kareno: Good point, Oosman.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kfay: Looking at E/W leading agreements I'm not sure what the @cQ was all about.|pg||
nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
nt|ady: not much for the defence here as majors splitting well    should be an imp to Karisruher  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise responses look same as "walsh"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|panosk: ok stayed within making range|pg||
nt|panosk: E  showed 3-3-3-4 with 2 controls after 4@C as i was told, thx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kfay: In fact he probably should have played the jack.|pg||
nt|panosk: still needs some attention|pg||
nt|panosk: as like Frederic said entries to dummy are scarce|pg||

pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: On the assumption that with 5@Hs a neg dbl can be even lighter (you can bid 2@H over 2m as a weak 5 card suit), he really didnt think 4@H would be any good. |pg||

nt|vugraphznf: I think they said 2NT was limit or better. 3@D was described as "he has only 3@C and 3@D available as gametries" - west did not think his partner might make a slamtry here|pg||

nt|yuval10: entering the last board of the first haw, Israel holds a slim lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board of this Semi-Final, the final should start at 18.20 local time, thats 35 min from now, I believe we are a bit late on shedule..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And a @c lead set up a ruff in 4@H too|pg||
nt|ady: was maybe worried about a heart ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||

nt|oosmanb: (that's if you can drop singleton A without wasting an honour)|pg||

mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||

nt|oosmanb: so all in all, not a bad board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @S|pg||
nt|othered1: another light 3rd seat opening by Sementa, this one feather-light|pg||

nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: players|pg||
mb|4D!|an|Splinter|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they play 2@H as invitational here.  Many play it preemptive over a power redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   then only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|panosk: if W on the lead i cant see why not lead @S|pg||
nt|panosk: of course 5 in minors much less worrying |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 39 min playing time left|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
nt|panosk: a few more imps to EW|pg||
mb|5S!|an|2+Q|nt|kareno: I'll be using it for some sleep :)  |pg||
nt|othered1: passing 3@C wold be quite a position, despite south's inaction at  his last two turns|pg||
nt|ady: needs 4 ruffs to make 13 tricks  so trump lead stops that  and no joy on diamond split   an unlucky grand to fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: and DBL = "Clarify" partner|pg||

nt|fluffy: another israel juniors had this same sequence yesterday|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fluffy: the 3@h bidder had @hAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: a 2-way partial swing is, after all, 6 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|yuval10: he could've played @c and make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps the 1@SX a couple of boards ago had some psychological effect|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: Yes, precisely.  But he will get his partscore equity (if any) from this contract.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
nt|kfay: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|kfay: See you, Gonzo.  Thanks.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry   5@C-1|pg||
nt|othered1: East may try @HJ next . . . |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W leading @sQ|pg||
nt|panosk: natural lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: y but from wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N is playing|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make either most probably but may save 1 undertrick|pg||
nt|panosk: true|pg||
nt|panosk: minor lead from E i guess then|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N considering his options|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: forbids a @slead from E|pg||
nt|panosk: spade is also probable |pg||
nt|panosk: but not likely to me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: must lead something else now, because @s lead is barred|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|panosk: again true|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: if @C6 was @C7, i would have bid differently|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: E trying to steal a @c from N|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: much joking on the table|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|panosk: N has all the @H spots so he can afford to ruff 2 spades in dummy and save this cheaply|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|othered1: how 'bout another @H here, since east took the @CA perhaps prematurely?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does Rohowsky open 1@H or 1@D ?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there is one school of thought   if you don't open a major  you don't have a 5-bagger|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is a fundamental part of  Washington Standard|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|an|now alerted|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if 4N alerted as "optional"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine Fritsche wants to take control of the auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: he was thinking about 10 sec. and finally alerted, but it was not asked / explained till now|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: much better to go down in 6 than to go down in 5 :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same start for Brink-Drijver|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange reverse imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Drijver 3rd bid 3N-all pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if not planning to reverse, then should open 1@H|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|an|!!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many top pairs do extend reverse to include decent 56 with less HCP than normal reverse  but shape=extra playing strength|pg||
nt|bobholl: bauke isn't sure he can beat 7@D :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have later bids to clarify|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: south did not know what 4nt was, he meant 5@C as "1 or 4 aces"|pg||

mb|1D|nt|othered1: Anyone feel that the auction had more of a match;points flavor to it than at imps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Many, maybe most, top Precision pairs seem to have given up on weak NT openings.  I wonder why?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|baldjean: Certainly an unusual result when dummy has 8 top tricks alone. But there was no way to reach it.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT for n/s|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: do you reopen with south's hand?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At these colors, how often do you trap?|pg||
nt|desinka: obviosly something is not ok..|pg||
nt|desinka: so not sure..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: i wager he's never had a better suit that he never bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: In this position, I think a pass by north would be accepting 1@HXX, though perhaps it';s a matter of style|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: west's pass forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: i guess so|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: he alerted|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess it was dangerous for north to double 2@S (you have to beat it, if double was for penalty)|pg||
nt|ady: north top heave in the black suits   so must be wary in spite of reverse from south|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: saved by east|pg||
nt|othered1: It's been suggested that west's double showed 1 or 4+@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|othered1: I've seen these either/or doubles in use for decades and what I've seen is they can produce devastatingly bad results now and then.|pg||
