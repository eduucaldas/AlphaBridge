nt|ahollan1: good call by Hurd|pg||
nt|xenya: this is just the kind of hand USA2 needs at this score -- arriving at 3N was an excellent shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ben was spot on in Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: als nay be a warning to the americans not to mess around too much on the future bds|pg||
nt|roswolf: also may|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall said they will bid this slam on the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational   thru 21  Israel over Australia by 53|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP  5+@H  maybe 5@H 5@S|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: USA  would have to bid an against odds slam to gain on last one|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree but they seem to have the forse with them|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't this will slow down the American's style at all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N or stayman?|pg||
nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: so Warren's point about the safety play is good - to protect against Q10xx in either hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D invitational or better with clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grip & rip 3@S from Lall|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: force|pg||
nt|wstuart: The boys are bidders at both tables.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15, ostensibly 5+@S   but  3rd seat ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D preempt     they also have bid to show weak hand with @D & @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H shows 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: N has the 3@s bid almost at the table -- but stops|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and got a 3nt instead|pg||
nt|ady: dont think this can be made on a heart lead despite specs claims that it can|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 4@H  looks a make  |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but it can misfire|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/knockoutphaseconditstatMultievColours.asp?qphase=FF&qtournid=885  for live scores in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznm: Jacek Pszczola is reading a book while he is dummy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: All of their matches have been total slugfests, if you will, in the bidding.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT missed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21 [3@D+1]    Muller overcalled 1@S with 3@D    Bathurst in 4@S North|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And i think he wrote that 3@H was Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: if Q@H played and ducked  then (@C switch |pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah  calling it Stayman  saying shows 4@S  equivalent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but I am not sure -- and N does not have a very nice handwriting :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  laydown on a @H lead, but not so easy on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ady: this maif fail  on a spade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: True - but I predict the @h10|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very reasonable choice|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW did well to force NS guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is only defensive start that gives declarer problems|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: @D now and indeed problems|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: kept them out of a slam that needs some luck on a spade lead  cutting of the 3rd heart trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: there are lay outs where the defence have 4 spade trricks   but no this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they started teasing SJoert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had good results playing Raptor NT overcall  but felt uncomfortable in hands like this felt uncomfortable with normal DBL sequences|pg||
nt|ady: still ok    |pg||
nt|chick:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Raptor.html|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Yes indeed|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW auction is consistent regardless of who holds @CQ|pg||
nt|ady: I am assumming tot losing a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but gave them a shot at 4@SX     but point is  they forced NS to make the last guess|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: NS System Card (attitude leads to NT is "low = like") http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: down 2    very nice defence|pg||
nt|bobholl: ricco likes the developments :)|pg||
nt|lokaty: he missed the @D nad -1 propably now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rhelle: I've played with him a fair few times, and it takes getting used to. Saving grace is that he normally emerges with the right card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in old BOLS Bridge Tip   Zia described player "heats"   Heat 1  everything you do is right|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Hurd said sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Heat 3 -- you struggle to avoid revoke|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|warrens:  now he'll make|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|petergill: Joe Grue led @H at other table - there's an article somewhere by Kit Woolsey that leads from Q9xx and K10xx tend not to work out well - the choice perhaps was random.|pg||

nt|ady: after a 2nd diamond   club normal play|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear it did go off in the other room|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think so, and he's certainly not leading into the AQJ of @H's anyway|pg||

nt|ahollan1: most Weak NTers  use a runnout after Penalty DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks   and 4@C shows 1@D|pg||
nt|bobholl: K @D wasted :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs spade to the10 at some stage to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: It looks like a major card was led by the Dutch in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H was in case East was looking for slam - alas 4@H has wrongsided the contract slightly for the Dutch|pg||

nt|rhelle: Oh - it seems that East made a mistake in the endgame to let it make|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south bids on the artillery will start firng|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North looks like to have minors|pg||
nt|wstuart: The lucky star the American EW were playing under burned out on board 4.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and south showed 6-4|pg||
nt|petergill: With so many possible finesses, is taking the @H hook only a play for those who can see all 52 cards?|pg||
nt|ady: lead nice for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphznt: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 9 can be H98 or HH98, |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: So East denies the @H10 and always has an honour|pg||

nt|petergill: and he expects black kings to be offside in opener's hand, thus needed @H hook|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller worked that bit out fast - now, with limited entries to his hand, he has to figure out what to do next ---> takes time|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director is here for some time already, didn't say they are late, but they are, and it looks like he is looking who is slow|pg||
nt|petergill: That also happened yesterday at Muller's table when playing against Hurd and Wooldridge|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rhelle: great switch!|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW had @S8, then I think Muller would cash @SA before the heart hook, in case @SK was singleton, but @SJ108x in S is hard to pick up with lack of entries|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru  6  Israel Juniors extend lead over Australia Open  to 40 imps in  Transnational Teams Final|pg||

nt|xenya: NS can beat it if they set up 2 clubs tricks for N early -- to accomplish this, S needs 2 entries to lead clubs twice, so the unblock is essential -- very well done by N |pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: not many options    best  surely ace and another spade   hoping for king doubleton   and when not trust to luck only 1 club loser|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  7  Matushko game is 3N rather than 4@H   not sure how that will do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller slowing things down because he's unfamiliar with the situation == 3 boards ahead of the other room|pg||

nt|vugraphznj: ok, we found out the reasons: we have changed the places of the tables, to have the bbo matches at the tables with computers, but the TD forgot to move the bridgemates|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: bathroom stop... |pg||
nt|ady: USA  likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this table will never fall behind the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak 2@D?    usually shows 6, but at these colors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another upgrade to 2N??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue-Lall auction may go 1@D*-2@S**    * precision  ** 5@S 4/5@H, invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: wooldridge knew he could probably claim, but there might have been a club ruff out there|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Lall was very disappointed @S weren't blocked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gordon v Angelini now mathematically confirms Gordon advance to Transnational SemiFinal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of how many breaks they take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1@D-2@H  5@S 4/5@H non-invite|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i never should have doubted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s  hands too flat to be in game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3@S, 9-11 HCP|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 27: If South was 4333 shape, then 3NT might have been better than 4@S, but reaching 3NT seems difficult|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|rhelle: Actually, the 1@h opening on substandard values may help NS in staying low|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N asks Features    haven't seen that treatment in a while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i apologize for waffling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C includes 21+ balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: more likely e/w could make game in hearts    but 4 losers with A@D wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = 4-card limit raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have 40 minutes for 5 hands - in my opinion, South has been the slowest player at this table|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a 5@H save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bathurst also saw vulnerability when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
nt|bobholl: this won't hurt hurd :)|pg||
nt|chick: is 7@H makeable?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: RDBL with 3-fit   haven't seen that before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe it shows GOOD 3-fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think the 1 @C alert is "could be 2" |pg||
mb|3H|nt|bbramley: i'll have to get up to speed on the N/S system - not sure exactly what the bids mean - looks sort of like Polish so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he always is slow |pg||
nt|ady: but they have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: wrong again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS must be forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmm   i wonder how they differentiate 3@S & 2N   thought 1 might show 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: nothing going for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The fact that we're seeing so many transfers (2@H showing spades) in the WC Grand Final is food for thought for those who don't like such methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  PASS with 2   accept transfer with 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C now |pg||
nt|bobholl: only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 4@H and what does Hurd do|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and that might e also Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: i think 1@D=0-7, then natural|pg||
nt|bbramley: if so, i'm a little surprised south did not upgrade to a positive with his good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps   so close to 6 imps behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure with 4-fit in 1462|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey might argue for lead of 3 card suit |pg||
nt|ady: USA    get lucky   heart lead no chance|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure they've defined Wooldridge PASS   but we don't know :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: wooldridge not worth more than 4 @S imo|pg||
nt|april7: still 7, the 9 takes care of it!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great analysis   do you think there is any chance they'll bid it??|pg||
nt|chick: kibs are split about 80-20 that 7@H can make :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: with @S 4-1 ?|pg||
nt|chick: 7@S cannot make because of the 4-1 split, but 7@H looks makeable tome|pg||
nt|ahollan1: double dummy analysis of card play is academic if auction can't get there|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|rhelle: South should now play the @sK, in case declarer needs to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|ady: but always likely to get to 3NT   and likely to make  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 to instill doubt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing reverse count/attitude   7 could also come from  J74|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: rdbl says 3 card and I want you to play|pg||
nt|ady: plenty of time for defence to get all the tricks|pg||
nt|chick: too true, Al, but maybe they can get to 6@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7 @H surely can make 9 of @D is the extra trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WOW   on 27  Grue-Lall bid 3N on the perfecta layout|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||
nt|chick: the real reason that 7@H is biddable is that USA2 needs it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: so he transferred to play the hand himself :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Daily Bulletin 11 says 24 board R16 matches in Transnational. Bull 11 also has interesting article about the massive preparation by Indonesia Ladies for this event ref pages 28 and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 15 I think, at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose if @C feature, might explore @D slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction is getting very interesting|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Wooldridge expects only 4@S from Hurd??|pg||
nt|bobholl: too interesting :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with clearer 1 or 2 suiter -- Hurd would not PASS 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge almost bid 6@S, and is rethinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm already impressed that they found 6@H after 3@S    anything more is astounding|pg||
nt|chick: my kib opinion count is up to 42 making vs 6 can't make 7@H|pg||
pc|hT|nt|chick: I"m told that in the Transnats, one pair bid 6@H making 7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch pick up another 5 imps on  7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm guessing   4@H natural  exactly 4@H else 3@H rather than DBL   5@C cuebid  5N pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: looks as a good guess|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
nt|chick: we all agree that the @D9 is the key card, when the J10 fall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think impressive recovery to get to 6@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bbramley: he'd like about 5 entries to his own hand, but he's a little short of that|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: sr 10 tricks |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: will correct in a second|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Bd 25 here on BBO has been scored the same way it is scored (10 imp swing) on the WBF website and thus on the Bridgemate as scored by the players.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and bet they discuss later if     a) there was easier way   b)  they could/should get to 7@H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might pitch |pg||
nt|bbramley: the clubs are good, which would let him throw a small card in each red suit, but that would have conceded down 1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: and Oswald Jacoby for original transfer concept|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: even in context of Big Club system   too many losers, not enough winners  for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver-Brink 2@C auction uninterrupted so far|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bbramley: so instead he's ruffed up, which will fail as well because west's trumps are too good|pg||
nt|sybarra: or too many anyway |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no worries|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ostensibly  1N=12-15  but 3rd seat favorable [not vul vs vul]   rules don't apply|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 3-fit  but YOU play|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S!|an|5!H invitational|nt|kit: 7@H makes despite the 4-1 spade split, since J10 doubleton of diamonds drops.  7@S not so happy.|pg||
nt|kit: If E-W reach 7@S here, this table will think the match is very close|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: can anyone give a good description about how many fans are at the moment in Veldhoven and how ORANGE it is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: well, i'm at the vugraph theatre|pg||

nt|curtis: 500+ noisy. orange wearing fans watching vugraph|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: but not many wear orange, although they are clearly dutch|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: @D4 would have been interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does declarer have any option other than the winning play in trump?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: 6S can be made but needs care|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|kit: 7@H probably wouldn't be made on club lead, since entry short to establish spades and set up 4 diamonds|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kit: But I think it can make double-dummy by ruffing 2 clubs and eventually getting a minor-suit squeeze on South|pg||
nt|007 joosth: 2 spades now  and then diamonds?|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: applause when usa touches a wrong card? that sounds unpleasant to hear : glad not at bbo|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: glad i am in Spain|pg||

nt|wstuart: How can you call them slow?  They have played 6 whole boards in 80 minutes.  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: they have 30 min for last 4 boards|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+  often weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: should be doable right?|pg||
nt|ady: good spade slam on 11 card fit|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, looking at the sequence in the other room, that the result justifies the means :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2-3-6... |pg||
nt|wstuart: OK, they did start 10 minutes later than this table, to be fair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, (3)4+@D, unbal, 3@D if (41)35, maybe 2245|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D  this time with weak NT  but longest suit @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT   n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they very rarely PASS  the 1@D opening|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: big difference which lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey once did a study of masses of hands which suggested that AJxx, K10xx , Q9xx and J8xx are the leads that turn out worst when faced with choice of 4 card suits to lead ...|pg||
nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=game force relay|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  if 2suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N weak NT, not 4@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 bal or  1@S444|pg||

nt|warrens:  wow, a striped tale X|pg||
nt|sybarra: no XX,  "we" are happy |pg||
nt|ady: good value for australians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just announced in voice commentary    Senior Bowl  France leads USA2 by 4+fraction  just a few boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  also  5@HX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  our room wasn't doubled|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Not here, he is very silent:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right Ben!    |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wasn't Symmetric Relay  developed by New Zealand's  Dr Kerr?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhh Roy Kerr|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Ker   i never remember   or r's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in New Zealand, he might be better known as award winning Phyicist|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks  unless defence cash quickly when in with K@D|pg||
nt|ady: likely to win spade and lay down A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Al   you type faster|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 26 a quiet  2@S East|pg||
nt|MolvaM: selamlar|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
nt|ady: swkward communication   but as 10@C comes down in 3   does not matter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Transnational   thru 8   Israel over Australia by 41|pg||
nt|ady: now no communication problem when k@D taken |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s6|nt|warrens:  on a XX, wouldn't Hurd reconsider?|pg||
