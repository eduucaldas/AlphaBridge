nt|odysseus69: good afternoon from London for the start of the 2011 Lederer|pg||
nt|ady: this Might be 1@D passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Peter Clinch|pg||
nt|clinch: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EW strong NT with 5 card majors|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ady: hi Voctor|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Reverse attitude and standard count for both pairs|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: Victor|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Hanlon-McGann a tough Irish pair|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: Scotland are here by virtue of their win in the Commonwealth Championship. |pg||
nt|vugraphztg: notin the modern game 1D Passed out :)|pg||
nt|ady: no North decided to respond|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: 2NT any game force with 4@S, 3@c any minimum|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|djneill:  other room used direct Drury raise by north to stop in 2@h|pg||
nt|ady: might find K@S switch|pg||
nt|clinch: Scoltock a man who generally likes science; Myers an excellent player who has recently being playing a lot of bridge after a few years of not doing so|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: The scoring is a mixture of BAM (10 doesn't count) and IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: then a heart switch would set this 2|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: 36 VP for the IMPs and 2 per board BAM|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|djneill:  spades do set up but entries to them not so great if ruff a club first|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: on this scoreing overtricks or undertricks can be important|pg||
nt|odysseus69: E-W are both Derek - so I will remember to use surnames- good start by defence|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|clinch: This tournament has a very complicated scoring system, combining IMPs and point-a-board (board-a-match)|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ady: now east will get end played|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: so only down 1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  if West has @dA, entries are there, that is the hope now|pg||
nt|athene: it was a good play from east to force dummy with a club after winning the spade|pg||
nt|athene: othewise declarer could simply cash @HAK and run spades and dummy would still have a trump|pg||
nt|athene: now south has to get trumps right|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spade 8 asking for a heart but West safely ignores|pg||
nt|clinch: An Hanlon, by misguessing the heart, is not so well-placed in the BAM component this board|pg||
nt|clinch: Will nevertheless make his game|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Yes, 2 points for a win and 1 for a draw making 24 available|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: And 36 available as VPs from the IMP scoring|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks Guy|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: So the match scored out of 60|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: hard to find spades nowadays on this type of deal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c=17+|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: 1@d=0-6|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: however, that may be at the expense of getting too high|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Standings after match 2 - http://www.ycbc.co.uk/lederer2011.htm|pg||
nt|ady: east  a little psuhy    would have tht 1NT enough opposite 17-10|pg||
nt|ady: pushy|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|vugraphztf: maybe a diamond overruff instead of the 2nd club?|pg||
nt|ady: defence must have negleted clubs     maybe set up 2 heaert tricks   and got 2 diamonds on early play   4 spades and 1 club|pg||

nt|athene: if you are going to lead a diamond to the king you might as well keep the spade winner in dummy, go for the make|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|clinch: Spade partscore for EW |pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: 7@H is not so bad here; just needs trumps to come in |pg||
nt|djneill:  1@c strong, 1N 4 controls maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess they will reach six|pg||
nt|clinch: Though may end in 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: short @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  4@c cue with superfit @h|pg||
nt|ady: south decides to pass balanced 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: for the record the President's team is the octogenarians - Priday -Teltscher the Scots Coyle Matheson and the English Waterlow-Panto|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: quite right imo - filthy hand|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do ok in hearts|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|clinch: Diamond not best lead for defence|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: E has said that W now won't have 4@s....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: this not so good|pg||
nt|clinch: Oops|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|djneill:  West must know about 4th trump else slam might not be bid|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Or 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: (as a consequence)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: which may confuse the defence somewhat|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ady: south will duck 2 rounds of hearts|pg||

nt|djneill:  wd|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: @HA would be unfortunate|pg||
nt|athene: you can't then get the spades away before south ruffs in and cashes @SK|pg||
nt|ady: n/s playing udca|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: unlucky - not much to go on, i guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|djneill:  good lead, same at other table, just played @h starting low to @hK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: should be a trick short here|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Sandra ducking well|pg||

pc|d2|pc|c8|pc|s2|pc|dK|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @H2=singleton or three |pg||
nt|vugraphztf: dpends whether he thinks Mesbur would duck 2nd round with KT9|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: surely would    nothing really to lose|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: or KJt9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|ady: another reason for playing the queen 2nd round in case KJ109 on right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Bowles ignores the safety play anyway!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ady: might have played ace first   just in case stiff king    then take a view 2nd round|pg||

nt|athene: let's hope the previous board did not put EW off slams :)|pg||
nt|athene: clearly 7@H makes here but i would expect them to reach six|pg||
nt|djneill:  North might throw in italian 1@s overcall but that would be very aggressive|pg||
nt|odysseus69: scoring in the Lederer is a little unusual - effectively a combination of teams and pairs with the emphasis on the teams aspect|pg||
mb|1S|nt|clinch: Excellent|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: 2 points are available for the winning result on each board to which is added the convereted imps difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|djneill:  ok 1N weak|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@d = ART @h slamtry|pg||
nt|athene: west has a good hand for a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: for play in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: with the trick source in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  looks down 1     4@H a possible make though for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   not found their heart fit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|djneill:  4@c cue, denies @s cue|pg||
nt|djneill:  4@d shows @s cue|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: well judged by West (as they didn't x)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the club king is the key for 4 spades- taking the save at these colours looked a mistake but surprisingly no double|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: perhaps|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|djneill:  West obliged to bid more now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: tricky board    5@D  undoubled may be good for e/w    good go either way|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@s will make easily enough... Play  of the spade suit will determine how many tricks, though a straight finesse of queen seems likely|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|djneill:  5@d ask Queen if 5@c was 0/3 keycards, West making sure it cannot be zero|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|clinch: No particular reason to think W has Kx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|djneill:  5@s = yes Queen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: what happened to the heart ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: well depends if Nev guesses clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill:  West would like @dQ not @sQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: it's rare for the limited hand (1nt opener) to take control like this|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: maybe west wants to show that 6@H-1 last board won't keep him down :)|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S can be beaten for sure by leading K@C   and later puting east on trick with Q@D    not far fetched|pg||
pc|c3|nt|djneill:  it appears a finesse will be taken|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is show-up squeezed if needed, very uncomfortable for Mariani|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but west not on lead against 4S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: i suppose you ruff the diamonds good and cash the @CAK hoping to drop the queen and then fall back on the spade finesse?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d2|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|djneill:  here come the @d|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphztg: Sorry the 7@c was followed by the 3@c|pg||

nt|odysseus69: so far no results from other table- maybe not linked?|pg||

nt|clinch: The misexplanation board 2, where the 4-4 spade fit was concealed in bidding and explanation, resulted in 6 IMPs too YC when 3@s failed in the other room|pg||

nt|athene: of course west might get into the auction ahead of all of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Last hand of this match - thanks to Victor and david for their comments|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Last board here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: bad hand for scotland in OR    |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzps: at this moment Nardullo 158 and Fornaciari 157|pg||
nt|Vugraphzps: and Hugony 157|pg||
nt|athene: hard for east to stop out of a slam here i think, once west owns up to a fit|pg||
nt|athene: east really thinking this long? 3@D looks pretty easy to me|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she is not sure that is forcing|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|athene: not sure how 4nt was intended here|pg||
nt|athene: in standard methods it's natural and non-forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: best lead is aclub - don't tell Frank Wood fans!|pg||
nt|ady: seems they have fallen into the same trap|pg||

nt|athene: if 4nt really was rkcb, and 5@D one keycard, then isn't 5@H asking for the @SQ, and 5@S denying it?|pg||
