mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jjsb: 1nt P 2@c and now it will be on East to decide what she wants to do |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jjsb: even 5 @c for some agressive player (i would not do it) is not out of question |pg||
mb|2N|nt|jjsb: i know there is 4 card in @h but i think i considere this one as a complete 1 suiter|pg||
nt|don_kapu: normal  4@S and easy bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|jjsb: 3@c is probably the choice of many player |pg||
mb|3N|nt|jjsb: but she migth bid again on 3nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb: Mhay Encontro doesnt have an easy bid at all |pg||
nt|jjsb: Kx looks like a bit limit to play 3nt |pg||
nt|don_kapu: 2nt show 18-20 point|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 1@D is the right opener to prepare a rebid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jjsb: and sometimes 5 @d will work better |pg||

pc|s2|nt|jjsb: i i think 1@s 2@h a @c is the most defense can do |pg||

nt|josj: shows minors and W will sign off (and run away)|pg||
nt|ritong: some play question for 4m (i do)|pg||
nt|ritong: some kind of " stayminor"|pg||

nt|jjsb: tough hand for Gemma (East) but she has to continue i think |pg||
nt|ritong: and get 4NT negative and over|pg||
nt|josj: 3nt might well be 4-4 M now...|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: come on man, your hand is bad for minors  sign off in 4NT|pg||

nt|josj: @CK and run @C9 seems more logical|pg||
nt|jjsb: was there something wrong with just finessing @c? |pg||
nt|ritong: i think letting @c9 run was 1) elegant 2) efficient|pg||

nt|jjsb: here the very good things for declarer is that the J of @s is on South's hand |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|jjsb: hand an also favorable @s lay out |pg||
