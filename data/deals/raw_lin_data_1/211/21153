mb|p|nt|gluckenval: a different evaluation between Norby and Henrik Noberius in the CR at board 30... Norby didn't reopen. I agree (obviously) with Bocchi :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  That was not the winning lead|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|gsper:  I like understatements|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: of this 2nd session|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and in serious partnership you have many options, like jumping to 4@c over 2@s/@h from W to show shortness|pg||
nt|penseur9:  well done Tobias, great operating|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|yuval10: wd Tobias indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: South asking|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 2@d=several meanings|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|stc: a quite out of shape weak 2|pg||
mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  thanks to my co-comenters Avranm Yuval, Ed, Constantin and Johan...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|h2|nt|othered1: some play double shows a balanced hand with south's strength and use 2N for other things.  But it's strictly a matter of style.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  great work by our voice commentators Roland Handy and Cornelia|pg||
nt|penseur9:  next round to start in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 2@d is strong 1 minor /|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: weak 2 in a Major|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: NT 22-23|pg||
nt|stc: and he had nothing of them :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|stc: but of course in 3rd seat things are different|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|stc: today many people will open with W's hand|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|april7: 9 tricks because @H behaves and K of @D is with W, so 4@C,3@H 1 or 2 @D and possibly 1 @S trick|pg||

nt|vugraphznj: we have 5 minutes break. they all smoke a cigarette |pg||
nt|gsper:  That give us time to discuss the odds fÃ¶r 6@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  *for|pg||
nt|othered1: Might be good enough|pg||
nt|gsper:  Looks like roughly 2 finesses out of three, so reasonable|pg||
nt|othered1: And no distributional storms elsewhere|pg||

nt|vugraphznj: i am sry, i hadnt internet for a while|pg||
nt|gluckenval: thx Anna|pg||
nt|othered1: I can't see east getting excited with those terrible @S, even if a fit is found|pg||
nt|baldjean: 2! is weak 2-suited with long @h|pg||
mb|p|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|gsper:  2@D described as waiting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|tez: not very bad for NS..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|gsper:  2@H presumably Kokishis|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|othered1: and now what looks like a "birthright" (AKA Kokish) type approach has made the weak hand declarer if @S are to be played|pg||

pc|d8|nt|gsper:  This looks like a standard puppet Stayman sequence, but I suspect that there is more to it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: AM I right that west is still unlimited on this auction, so east has to b id his hand out fully?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|othered1: well, they did find it and it's likely to make|pg||
nt|gsper:  On board 10 E did not open in the other room and balanced with disastrous consequences|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: west showed with 2@H and later 2NT, that he has 24/25 bal|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: 3@C is puppet|pg||
nt|othered1: What would he have done with more than 25?|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: 3@H=@Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphznj: 3nt|pg||
