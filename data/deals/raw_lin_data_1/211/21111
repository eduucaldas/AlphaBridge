nt|jjsb: here its just not playable |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jjsb: u dotn like to lead sindleton normally when u have @h |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jjsb: but here nothing else is acceptable , u also have small @h anyway so |pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: hearts will set up and declarer will likely make an overtricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: overtrick :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: asbi knows defense in trouble|pg||
nt|jjsb: on a @c return all is very ok for declarer , on @d its a but more awkward to play |pg||
nt|fabsayc: will probably return a diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|jjsb: not sure about that play .. |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jjsb: even if u win and Q is second i dont see why its helping |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: he cross ruffs and eventually discards a club on hearts, still makes 4|pg||
nt|jjsb: u will have to play @h ruff @c ruff @h ruff it set tup but i think u still have to contine with @c ruff and AKof @s and @s |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jjsb: i understand that she felt the singleton @c and thougth N got long @h but still |pg||
pc|d9|nt|jjsb: N will have only @d to play |pg||
nt|jjsb: here as far as i see declarer in complete control with AK of @d dummy |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|nt|jjsb: ur only hope looks like Q of @h is doubleton either side |pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|s6|nt|jjsb: well i think AK of @s is secure , but i missed something maybe |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if declarer ruff high north would have to underruff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jjsb: not that if South is Qxx still ur not yet ok if u let run the J |pg||
