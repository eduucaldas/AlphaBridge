mb|p|nt|desinka: welcome|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: right contract wrong bidding sequence|pg||
nt|clinch: Having a few connection problems; I am sure the bidding was not as shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: A normal auction, not peculiar to Precision.|pg||
nt|desinka: in this bidding No|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at hand would have been nice to have in arsenal |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: but they got there anyway |pg||
nt|desinka: so 1st 13 imps to Vito|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, system works|pg||
nt|desinka: sorry 10 imps|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|desinka: wrong button|pg||

nt|desinka: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrt2000: nice quiet 3NT to start off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzpf: Indonesia decided to resign, and not play last sessions|pg||
nt|desinka: with @D back 4@S goes down |pg||
nt|desinka: if the cotract is 4@S of course:)|pg||
nt|othered1: this may make 4, but 4 isn't a good spot.  @D continuation will hold it to 3, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Brink still thinking|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kfay: I'm not sure how well known this Israeli junior team is yet internationally but I can personally attest that they're the real deal and aren't just having a string of good luck in ...|pg||
nt|kfay: this tournament.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: session*|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though the Dutch team have an early strike with a double part score swing here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|kfay: Although probably their results up to this point against excellent teams should have already dissuaded anyone from that notion.  When I played for the USA U-26 team last year in ...|pg||
nt|kfay: Philadelphia they totally dismantled our team.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|nt|desinka: in the OR Allegra's got 5@D..|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north had a 2@D response available as a passed hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|clinch: Declarer will just lose a heart, and gain 6 IMPs|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and we are LIVE now :)|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 and the first swing |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gracelin: Israel Junior lead by 27 imps including the 5 imps from carry over. There are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|gracelin: South stopped cautiously at 3S.  At one of the BB match, the Netherland south jumped to 4S after similar start.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|desinka: as I remember they play 2 way drury..|pg||
nt|panosk: @Ds now till S ruffs to discard a loser in spades |pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: I agree with Jeff Aker that 3nt is a more useful bid by west.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can make 3S here if he guess both the red suits.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|jaker: I think I would have risked 3n as west...you know partner won't be able to bid it|pg||

nt|kfay: Fisher and Schwartz came in 2nd in the World Junior Pairs in Beijing and their team went on to win gold in Philadelphia last year.|pg||
nt|kfay: Of course Sontag and Berkowitz are no slouches themselves and they start out with a fair result in this set.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he guessed only one red suit, so is -1|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: hey jan  you on stage again?|pg||
nt|ritong: tireless|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: I am always here -- have operated every board since last sunday :)|pg||
nt|ritong: you gamble with your health, buddy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 12 days - 48 boards a day -- thats healty :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which will likely dissuade W from bidding @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: these players in the Transnationals will have played 70 boards today -- when they finish these 16 boards|pg||
nt|gracelin: 11-14 1NT by Hans/Nunn|pg||
nt|clinch: Hi Tobias - apologies!|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|kfay: A lot of Israeli supporters are reminding me they took gold in the european youth teams last year and seem generally shocked that their names aren't standard around any bridge home ...|pg||

nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||

nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7 any|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
nt|desinka: precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  1N=12-15 and they play strong 1@C  but still PASS 1st/2nd seat much more than other pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@H transfer to @S|pg||
mb|2N|an|21-22 bal|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||

nt|desinka: 21-22 BAL|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|3C!|an|puppet|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 1@s=art. GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2N=short @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
nt|sybarra: some may not agree that is balanced |pg||
mb|3D!|an|at least 1 4card M|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
nt|desinka: u r faster :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4!s|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C checkback i think|pg||
nt|desinka: puppet|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@d showed his shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS played the Bermuda Bowl with different partners    looks like they're using Rusev's Convention Card|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt by Magnusson in open fared 11 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and 13-15 and 4+controls|pg||
nt|clinch: 6@s is not a terrible contract, but does need good things to happen in both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
nt|othered1: this is an OK game, vul at imps, that simply figures not to make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|desinka: always -1|pg||
nt|panosk: or Grant Thornton if you prefer|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
nt|desinka: yes|pg||
nt|desinka: Karaivanov - Trendafilov|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: and the @D's are 3/3  what more can you want?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Rusev-Darakchiev|pg||
nt|desinka: yes|pg||
nt|desinka: RUsev - Darakchiev playing for the Seniors Bowl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have links to the Convention Cards if anyone is interested|pg||
pc|d2|nt|clinch: 13 tricks made in the open room, which can be duplicated here, since the A@c is intact to enter dummy for the established hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|othered1: Duboin is quite a declarer, but this one is beyond his skills|pg||
nt|desinka: :) |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
nt|desinka: i know the system very well :) so i'll help if u want me to |pg||
pc|d8|nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
nt|clinch: On a club lead 13 doesn't look likely|pg||
pc|dA|nt|panosk: can make 4 i think now|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panosk: no he cant no entry to hand to cash last gd @H and discard a @C so just 3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||
pc|c8|pg||

nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: EW can make a lot of tricks in the red suits, and E is waisting no time|pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphzng: I get N-E bids at the same time|pg||
mb|d|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
nt|april7: this was agood decision by N to pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another hand that sits well for declarer |pg||

nt|vugraphzng: West asking about 1@d and souths pass|pg||

nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
nt|panosk: i can be wrong, i havent fully incorporated transfers in my system yet :) |pg||
pc|dK|nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit i never liked that jump bid  but partnerships need a lot of work to come up with alternative uses|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ryskiel_: N chyba móg³ jeszcze zalicytowaæ 3 trefl ale i 5 karo tu nie idzie|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|april7: another 5 imps for Nederland|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg:  hello Avram from voice commenting|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: EW carding   updside-down count & attitude, odd/even discard|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mrt2000: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: very!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton and Fisher having a party on their side of the screen|pg||
nt|gracelin: In fact you don't see many 800, 1100 in this tournament even everybody took very bold actions.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|phil: hey Gonzo|pg||
nt|phil: yes, E gets squoze down to a bare @c honor holding the diamond pictures|pg||
nt|desinka: o/e discarding|pg||
nt|desinka: so wants @D|pg||
nt|othered1: setting up the second suit is a normal strategy to avoid being tapped out if trumps break badly|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|clinch: So no luck for the very aggressive lead there|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gracelin: declarer is making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: you do get 3400's though ;)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kareno: Haven't seen one of those in years!|pg||
mc|11|nt|kfay: A kib mentions that some pairs have gadgetry available to show exactly 4333 or 3433 distribution.  I think that's usually accomplished with 1N-3M or something like that.  Who knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: what's actually best but I personally have had a few good experiences hiding information with 1N-3N, when I've decided to be 'modern' and bid that way.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice unblock in @S from Muller|pg||

nt|othered1: another weak 2, unless east sees it as a 1-bid|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e NS mieli porz¹dne trzymanie w karach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without @H10  deWijs might exit @C   with 10  he knows Buras won't have options other than @HA onside|pg||
nt|clinch: And a further 10 IMPs to the Dutch team|pg||
mb|1N!|an|12-15|nt|mrt2000: understable|pg||
nt|mrt2000: understandable|pg||
nt|migry: they are all playing since 10.30 in the morning with practically no break - that would be 11 hours now|pg||
nt|yuval10: exactly the same defence in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like EW aren't burdened with Multi.|pg||
nt|desinka: in vuln and st seat..|pg||
nt|panosk: Iceland on a flying start here|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: 1st|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 12-15|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|gracelin: 1NT from Hans, they only open 11-14 1NT on 1/2 seats|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I meant 1C from Hans.|pg||
nt|desinka: sorry|pg||
nt|panosk: or revenge for the quartefinal in Bermuda Bowl if yiu so prefer|pg||
nt|desinka: smolen convention|pg||
nt|desinka: i guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C invitational or better Relay   but response looks just like stayman [which is actually a relay]|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
mb|2H!|an|relay|nt|vugraphzpf: I even believe that Transnationals started at 10.00 :) --|pg||
nt|migry: NS play a very weak preemptive style so 1NT is 8+ to bad 12|pg||
nt|migry: sry - overcall style|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT maybe on if D breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat only   1N=15-17|pg||
nt|desinka: yes it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: But a discreet pass by south.|pg||
nt|panosk: W needs to return @d early to defeat but i think he will|pg||
nt|april7: here a clear NT hand, but now EW might get into trouble in  the @S contract|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play 14-16 all time|pg||
mb|2N!|an|2254|nt|othered1: At matchpoints, I'd reopen with the south hand if north passed in tempo.  But north acted,  quite reasonably, but not without risk.|pg||
nt|april7: S should pass!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's the big difference from stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 tricks in his hand!!|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, definately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N 22(54)|pg||
mb|3C!|an|relay|nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not according to the Bermuda Bowl convention card|pg||
nt|lechcold: -3 and flat board I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
nt|april7: 2 down on norma defence|pg||
mb|3D!|an|min|nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|kareno: North perhaps considering re-entering the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D=minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: still @d10xx is a great holding|pg||
mb|3H!|an|ask for 5card suit|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
mb|3S!|an|5!cs|nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing bad happenning here and it will make easily, but declarer may take a while to work things out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H asks which 5-suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and finally some good news    2245|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: thnx Al for the wonderful explanation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and now where do we go? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good thing i didn't make prediction   thought over 2@D he deWijs was going to bid invitational 2@S|pg||
mb|4D!|an|forces 4!h|nt|sybarra: a bunch of clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H  so deWijs can signoff in 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: if S get recive the @D ruff,then 3 down|pg||
mb|4H!|an|forced|mb|p|nt|clinch: This board should be fairly unremarkable; De Wijs found a good lead, but the contract is safe|pg||
mb|5C|nt|phil: if you play partner for 7-8 when you compete over a preempt (and raise to 4@s yourself) you'll do OK|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east felt bidding was too risky I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|april7: hi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: relayers call 4@D an EndSignal|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: And Rosenberg did ask to see it twice|pg||
nt|yuval10: here W has a super-maximum and of course was driven to game after E invited. looks perfectly normal, especially when they're red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Muller will be pleased with the dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: de Wijs is playing actually :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs will be happier with opponent @S layout|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||
nt|kareno: At the highest level, part scores are contested hard.  Those relatively small IMPs add up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only an overtrick at risk here.|pg||
nt|panosk: gd try by S, but E had A@C|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: tabela na razie dobra dla nas, co prawda spad³o siê na 4 miejsce, ale wystarczy nadrobic 4vp, ¿eby wyjc na drugie|pg||
nt|sybarra: it will be happy |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or a @H opening lead  :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kfay: That's true.  But what's the big rush non-vulnerable?  |pg||
nt|desinka: but the declarer wasnt thinking at all to fineesse it|pg||
nt|desinka: in OR Nanev open 1@D and the final contract is 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cross ruff is possible line too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS opening leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nanev playing 3@C East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H 4@C 1@S off the top now   so may just ruff @D in hand    but transportation could get dicey|pg||

nt|panosk: sorry N is declarer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kfay: Maybe he was influenced by three not-so-great boards so far this set.|pg||
nt|fluffy: now Fisher might run over Schwartz for not bidding the making slam :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south can ask about the @CK and claim 4 or 5|pg||

nt|panosk: yes gd point :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@C without spade ruff for EW but i doubt they will go there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is perfect example to show how players evaluate hands according to LOCATION of honors|pg||
mb|1S|nt|phil: its been a 1@h opener for about 20 years :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|migry: 2NT is natural|pg||
nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is probably a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they have all been Bar Mitzvah so in theory they are adults :)|pg||
nt|ady: Onstein kept low with 26 hcp between then in OR|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu punktów nie zdobêdziemy|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt is brave enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AKxxx xx xx Axxx is automatic opener|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: tu bêd¹ grali 3nt z drugiej rêki|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT by north no chance though on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
nt|panosk: see how much easier double dummy makes finding the right contract :)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Karisruher  kept low in OR|pg||
nt|april7: its a unusual stop in OR at 2@H!!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1/2/3 seat  1N=(13)14-16|pg||

nt|desinka: NS 2/4 leads, o/e 2|pg||
nt|desinka: and lead low one from xx , but the 10 from 10x|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both pairs would call their leads from doubleton "standard" :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||

nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
nt|mlodygda83: myla³em, ¿e W zd¹¿y skontrowac transfer kierowy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
nt|clinch: This will make 11 tricks with the club ace and queen well-placed|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and @H back and very down you go!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why deWijs didn't DBL 2@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: our match is Bracket A   made up of top 2 teams from each bracket of the round robin|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: or at least de Wijs said so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Yordan  i didn't notice 3rd seat :(|pg||
mb|2D|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
nt|april7: after a 2@S opener weak, NS might reach 4 @S, but E W will surely reach 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm only multi-lingual in bridge languages|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
nt|panosk: and Holland strikes back |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especially "¿", "CZ" "SZ" "sZCZ".TRZ, |pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h makes here, 5@d can be defeated on an unlikely low spade lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: probably north forgot their aggrement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 3rd vul  1N=14-15    |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and thought 2@c majors|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a minisplinter and east likes it.|pg||
nt|kareno: For me it's 5 am so I don't object :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S too expensive  at the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
nt|april7: now Germany will pick up a few imps|pg||
nt|clinch: Now spade needed to hold to 4|pg||
nt|clinch: This could be Vito's first IMP|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rusev CC says 2@C = majors    Karaivanov CC  2@C=some 1-suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: well Karaivanov told N just be4 the round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll find out later who's on wrong page :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: we play capp vs their NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: North said ok......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great    thanks Yordan|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead and choice of plays from dummy give declarer 8 tricks.  Where the 9th comes from is another question|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
nt|panosk: now watch the correct play of this hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they're juniors, we shouldn't expect anything less from them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Narkiewicz gets 2nd @S stopper!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry Karen, I need to go and will leave the table to you.  |pg||
nt|kareno: And naturally, here it is|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye and good lucks eveyone.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||
nt|migry: which explains the "passed out" score|pg||
nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, let s leave that into director's capable hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Padon asking 'how many you have, 17?'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 only|pg||

nt|sybarra: once the blood is in the water.......|pg||

pc|c7|nt|sybarra: difficult to do "on the fly"  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: now an overtrick might be possible|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|s6|nt|othered1: taking a very safe 9 tricks, juust in case|pg||

nt|kfay: The Israelis were caught for slow play in the last set and I guess the score here is actually something like 51-38 at the moment since the penalty is a whopping 7-IMPs.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||

pc|s8|nt|kareno: Yes, it does.  Here's Nunn going right at once.  Good job!!|pg||

pc|sT|nt|clinch: Again declarer will be worried about trumps, but we can see he is in excellent shape|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just like "standard" american    "standard" is oxymoron|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzng: both partnerships discussing now|pg||
pc|d7|nt|phil: normal 420 but 800 was for the taking in 3@c. Yet who can x it? |pg||
nt|kfay: I agree, the pace can be pretty bad sometimes.  But in the later rounds of a tournament I have more sympathy.  I realize that opinion isn't shared.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: south lead not really "mud"   they ALWAYS lead 2nd/4th  unless doubleton 10 or higher|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
nt|lesniak: moze, moze nieco mniej ze wzgledu na mozliwe piki 4-1 za impasem|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: na drugim stole 5@h, ale po treflowym|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @C lead  5@H probably down too|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc powinien byc kwit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
nt|lesniak: dziwne swoja drog¹ ze Buras nie zagral W kier, tylko blotke|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
nt|panosk: another 6@H here|pg||
nt|lechcold: martwi mnie, ¿e po naszej stronie nie widaæ ani jednego impa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-15, could hold 5+@S !!!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1S or 2@D?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
nt|ady: some might open east hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
nt|panosk: Netherlands (EW) scored 23 imps in last 4 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C must be long diamonds and 3@S values in spades i think|pg||
nt|panosk: make it 36 imps in last 5 boards|pg||
nt|ady: playing weak jump shifts   so 2@S weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: near transfer bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
nt|lesniak: wydaje sie prawdopodobne ze to przeoczenie operatora|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  balancing NT  = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D also make|pg||
nt|panosk: still i think 4@H will be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: see www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html for liveticker|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: in standard Precision, 2@D is NOT game force, so  1@S  but if they are playing 2/1 FG  then i think 2@D better|pg||
nt|sybarra: but since they are playing precision.... |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: lead is attitude|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course  that assumes you really want to force to game with north hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: small positive|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: mo¿e tutaj uda siê zdobyc jakie punkty|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might chose now 3@C and S then 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W just said they dont play weak 2s|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
nt|panosk: ok not then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: attitude leads ---  the lower the card, the more you want partner to return the suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H also went down  so board 9 pushed|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @c Q?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: for live scores|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 2NT natural here   leb not necessary as a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
nt|clinch: Afraid the meanings of these bids are not known as we don't have convention cards, but this is a Precision sequence|pg||
nt|sybarra: needed club lead |pg||
pc|cT|nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did NOT balance  so Pepsi  1@HEast|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: north bid a GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: south showed 0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@h= 3 card @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure why I would do that |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played those for years with one partner who LOVED them   but turns out he always defended assuming 4th :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|panosk: the success of the dutch team in Bermuda Bowl is largely attributed in their slam bidding, you can see now why|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: w meczu najbezpieczniej wygl¹da trefl do 8|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: i tak zagra³|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit i wouldn't balance with 1N   just not sure if I'd PASS or DBL|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przynajmniej tu trafi³|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E pokaza³ ju¿ otwarciem 5 kierów, wistem 4 kara i, o ile nie oszukali na zrzutkach - 3 piki|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like to think most days i'd PASS|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc ma singla trefl, a z punktów wynika, ¿e na 90% jest to figura|pg||
nt|lechcold: borderline decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course when 3N makes  i'd owe teammates a good bottle of wine|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc zabezpiecza kontrakt bior¹c 3 kara, 2 trefle, 3 piki i kiera|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Lech   VERY close decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another point    many big clubbers would respond with West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I know I would|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too Yordan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only because there is safety valve of rebid with @HJ9|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N getting annoyed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i've never played the EW system where 5+@S 5@H opens 1@H   that may create larger fear for deWijs|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: he is a smoker, 20 boards is to much for him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why  Balicki-Zmudzinski  often claim for their opponents :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: they open 1@H with 55 in majors because of relay scheme|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Muller "we still have time"|pg||
nt|lechcold: it's not possible to get full opener's shape after 1@S opening if this includes 55 in majors|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: a better spot than 3@H   as played in OR by south|pg||
nt|april7: its a much better contract then 2NT but still going probably 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: E should take this trickn anyway andlead the Q of @H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|d7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|clinch: Certainly well-bid, and a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: I really prefer in NT,  either 4th or 3/5  as long as pard knows! |pg||
pc|s5|nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither Muller nor any of us ever anticipated east on lead after winning @CQ :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: Glad to hear you play the same way :P|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: 5@s only because he did not overcall|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Nanev in 4@S|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||

nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
nt|april7: E should actually go down |pg||
nt|ady: not much on here    2 spades might make with a struggle|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
nt|panosk: if you think your pard is reasonable he must have around 7 @C and 6-7 pts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|clinch: One of those deals where nobody wants to open up any suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: trochê niepotrzepnie wstawi³ waleta w drugiej lewie|pg||
nt|sybarra: rebid of spades should settle it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
nt|april7: N might come up with a X now but S can't probably stand it|pg||
nt|clinch: A further heart now creates a finessable position in that suit for declarer if E takes K|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S would have been natural force also, so 3@S forced west to cue|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will be at  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: web page for the event   http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/Champions%20Cup/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friendly layout here for declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: I have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 1NT also might go down on a spade lead    south felt to weak to pass|pg||
nt|clinch: Club finesse and spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: -1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
nt|clinch: EW will be gaining as their counterparts drove to game in the other room|pg||
pc|hT|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the club cue bid (up the line)  did not really add interest to the E hand |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wygl¹da na imp straty|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: the round robin matches are 20 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups of 6 teams   then various KO matchups follow|pg||
nt|ady: 3 heart tricks available for declarer  playing next one to the 10  when the 9 drops|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: gra na swoje pewnie nadrobi ale tylko raz|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: now 8 tricks available   draw trumps|pg||
nt|april7: even 9 by playing @D K now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running scores  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes indeed.|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher said @S are 3-3, Berkowitz, that's not fun :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nicely played|pg||
nt|clinch: But nonetheless 4 more IMPs to Onstein 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last hand for this set |pg||
mb|1D!|nt|oosmanb: Israel juniors picked up 9 for their 6@d effort|pg||

nt|desinka: why not|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  or 3@D a maked for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd of 4 sets begins in about 25 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: we thank our brilling operator,  flawless as always |pg||
nt|ahollan1: same explanation for this 1@D as last hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: you are welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: hope you are all enjoying this|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Dessy and Al, |pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 then and 4 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|panosk: same hand Frederic|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right    Yordan is great|pg||
nt|desinka: ty all|pg||
nt|desinka: sry was busy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 of a major easy to bid - seven is there.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 3 pretendentów do 1 miejsca w 2 punktach siê mieci|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H=6-suit, weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: Yordan, you must be having fun too :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sure|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: berkowitz can envision 12 tricks if partner has a perfect hand, but soon he will see there is no luck today|pg||
nt|gracelin: but not 7S, |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W asking S for the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S thinking|pg||
nt|panosk: running scores and standings http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S is not sure about the meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Maybe exclusion blackwood??  Does that give enough information?|pg||
nt|baldjean: May wind up in 4@h here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+  1@D=0-8  1@H=19+ |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver 2N North|pg||
pc|c9|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: I like being operator,  get a chance to see up front and personal interaction and great play|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I like broadcasting better than kibitzing|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C9 attitude  =  continue suit at your own risk|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=6-8 HCP  3 suit short Major|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: http://picasaweb.google.com/109696376106903859175 |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the answer is  "if I had any I might"   |pg||
pc|h8|nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards again lie very well for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually   can be H98(x)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @h 8 - explained he doesnt like @cs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|baldjean: A@d looks likea liekly lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29   dutch also playing 5@C|pg||
nt|baldjean: likely*|pg||
nt|othered1: They can be topcarded out, but the @S have to be cashed before declarer gains the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: it seems pass from E started an escape sequence|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so top of interior sequence goes down to the 9   --   but that isn't as funny as talking about attitude leads|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: Teach me to assume :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: assume nothing.. works for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S rely controls    4@C=2  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: I for one appreciate Gerbrand's detail descriptions of the calls :)|pg||
nt|panosk: helpfull lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller would NOT count singleton @HK as control  so must be @CA|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Next set in 1 hour and 40 mins after a lunch break will have voice commentary for the Allegra-Karlsruhe match|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kfay: Yeah Gerbrand.  When are they going to give you a full-time job?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
nt|ady: could be the best plus for n/s  would be to pass the 1NT  but has its risks |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W showing his @H holding to S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2:  The other semifinal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no room to learn about @SJ so deWijs just guesses  [well in this case]|pg||

nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just upside-down count/attitude|pg||

nt|sybarra: they are having way too much fun now |pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
