nt|paulg:  South cursing his partner ... any decision could be right and it will all be his fault|pg||
nt|hedyg:  2@H= 5-6 @ss 3-10 or a gf 3suiter|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg:  surely K@C lead, yes Roland :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg:  looks like lose 2@ds 1@s and 1@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  a good example of why leading a low trump from xx is often best ... you retain ruffing potential|pg||

nt|paulg:  it was the competition in the closed room that made it very difficult to get close to the slam|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg:  on only 26 hcps, splits in all suits and 2 working finesses|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|paulg:  given a free run, North's diamonds might encourage enthusiasm|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|hedyg:  surely within Rolands 12.89%|pg||

nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|phil: same penalty got assessed against USA2 in the semis - I agree its excessive|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel Juniors was +6 beore this set\|pg||
nt|kareno: I have to report that while I was distracted, my cat BeBe stole my snack!!|pg||
nt|desinka: 2@C open I guess|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Again the 2@D Flannery|pg||
nt|mrt2000: the dreaded flannery again!   lol|pg||
nt|ritong: not universally|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: so Gordon is +13 now|pg||
nt|desinka: bad guess :)|pg||
nt|othered1: not a 14 point 1N here?|pg||
nt|desinka: no|pg||
nt|desinka: they play 15-17 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: Not that north's hand looks worth a real 14|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|migry: 2@d= GF|pg||
nt|desinka: just decition to open 1nt last one|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, thanks.|pg||
nt|desinka: np|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2:  Without it you would never be able to get to a heart contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT probably mere minimum|pg||
nt|migry: without 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|fluffy: berkowitz has good shape but bad vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: when I try this doubles opponetns have 5332 opposite 3334 and I'm toasted :P|pg||
nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|kareno: No slam.  Presumably south will think he has too many spades to get a penalty worth it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, that make the 1N on the last hand look even more strange to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: a trump at any point would have left declarer with 3 spade losers, the @h ruff and the A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@H would not work|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not enough controls.|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: robert, what is the oz NT range|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: NS discussing system with screen still closed. 4432|pg||
nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
nt|kareno: Four can be made with the help of a spade finesse.  We'll watch and see.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 6NT you have to guess the red suit which is seemingly impossible|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: haven't seen an exact range yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: now there is a chance they never find hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table(s) visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kareno: North needs to duck a club lead to the king if that comes first.  But still the spade play will win.|pg||
nt|kareno: ???|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: I was wondering when you'll say something roland:)|pg||
nt|ritong: easy|pg||
nt|ritong: any flannery bid and our friend is up for a small fight:)|pg||
nt|fluffy: but schwartz still has the 9th spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Nunn's wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|othered1: decent spot.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: declarer asking for the leads: 2/4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like some IMPs are coming back to OZ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|desinka: yes, but from xx the small one and from 10x the 10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fluffy: wich is awful for defending|pg||
nt|othered1: would south really lead from 10x in an ambiguously opened suit?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|othered1: from xx, rather|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS Convention Card from recent Bermuda Bowl  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|ritong: talking about small fights, other room is a riot|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2:  How can you get to 4@H if North opens 1@H? Impossible, right? So that F convention is magical|pg||
nt|kareno: A club return by north would be far-seeing but east can get it right.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Always beware when opponents play a suit you cannot play yourself :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Oosman :)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Oosman-wlc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Could the @D10 have been an indication that South has the @SA?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So I missed a few cards here, but it looks like he can eliminate @D and then play @S up and pray?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: North would have to duck the first club to give declarer a real guess.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if South has A@C doesnt it make anyway?|pg||
nt|desinka: i explain it clearly..|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: when playing transfer responses i play 1@S rebid by west as asking opener to rebid 1nt to right side the contract|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Yes, it does.  Here's Nunn going right at once.  Good job!!|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|kfay: Getting a few comments arguing that the penalty is just or even not harsh enough (in chess you can forfeit if you're slow enough).  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||
pc|d9|nt|othered1: I understand what it means, just wonder why south would lead from xx when partner can have xx as well|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzng: both partnerships discussing now|pg||
mc|12|nt|phil: normal 420 but 800 was for the taking in 3@c. Yet who can x it? |pg||
nt|kfay: I agree, the pace can be pretty bad sometimes.  But in the later rounds of a tournament I have more sympathy.  I realize that opinion isn't shared.|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|2C|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||

nt|hedyg:  Roland telling tell how tricky this hand is to play|pg||
nt|hedyg:  if he starts with a @s finesse he is down|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||

nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||

nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||

nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||

nt|ahollan1: friendly layout here for declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: I have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
pc|s6|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: the round robin matches are 20 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups of 6 teams   then various KO matchups follow|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes indeed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=18-19 balanced|pg||

nt|gracelin: but not 7S, |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kareno: Maybe exclusion blackwood??  Does that give enough information?|pg||
nt|baldjean: May wind up in 4@h here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|baldjean: A@d looks likea liekly lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29   dutch also playing 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just upside-down count/attitude|pg||
nt|othered1: If it did show preference to @S, why would west shift to trumps?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: bye|pg||
nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: I saw very slow players in this tournament which maybe the cause of the nap during the game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H8 DOES show suit pref for @S|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, it would have been my play for what it's worth.  Sets up several tricks instead of one with a prayer.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: West hapy he is not vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hQ|nt|phil: his partner must habititually lead the beer :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: only 50's he'll be saying to himself|pg||
nt|othered1: but too late|pg||
nt|baldjean: No idea, but what else can 9@d mean?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Gazzilli  |pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) nat  b) any 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = nat and weak|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 3NT from South now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Qx is good enough|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, somebody has to bid notrumps.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have as north, frankly.|pg||
nt|othered1: How far is 2/1 forcing for them?|pg||
nt|desinka: GF|pg||
mb|4H|nt|desinka: far enough :)|pg||
nt|desinka: has to take the A|pg||
nt|desinka: like one of the specs suggested|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Is that some kind of crack about my declarer play?|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: and 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a mystery to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Well done Fisher|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Made it look easy. |pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.  |pg||
nt|desinka: good position of the @Ss but.. no communications.. |pg||
nt|desinka: 10 of @D lies..|pg||
nt|othered1: When you evaluate the light Precision opening, don't forget to include hands like this.  Usual Imp odds on vul games are for making v. down 1.  Down a bunch, even undoubled, change ...|pg||
nt|othered1: them meaningfully.|pg||
nt|desinka: so probably will try to finnesse..the @ds|pg||
nt|desinka: good point!|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps thinking 4@C a splinter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: NS are not on one wavelenght about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S thought cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N thought 5-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wind is swirling   [that's excuse they use in Golf --- why not here??]|pg||
nt|baldjean: It's rare to see such a misunderstanding on that high level|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ritong: would be fine to go down one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||
nt|migry: 2@s would have made, 3@c rates to go 2 down as it will be difficult to guess the 10@c|pg||
nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||
nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: schwartz should be thinking about @sA10xx in 1NT bidder's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to play under the assumption that good things will be  happening.  this contract isn't for pessimists|pg||
nt|desinka: like i said.. 10@D lies..|pg||
nt|desinka: 8@D now.. but it doesnt work|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He'll take this in a hurry!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|kareno: I agree with that strategy, Patrick.  I think you play as well as you can and keep track of the swings you think you are winning and can decide at the end what to do.  You have ...|pg||
nt|kareno: partners who may be having great results and you don't want to throw them away.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|phil: maybe - spade might have been led though|pg||
nt|gracelin: true.  A team should discuss their strategy for various scenario before the last set started.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: E taking a long look at the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now turns his card|pg||
nt|desinka: agree Ed, but we see the cards.. and we cannot be positive abt this contract :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|oosmanb: Nice careful play wants J@D as an entry|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kfay: The Israelis are running out of real estate fast.  These 32-board matches are just... bleh.  I'm really against them.  But I guess they only have so much time.  Still, I don't see ...|pg||
nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||
nt|kfay: semifinal should be allowed.|pg||

nt|yuval10: not easy at all|pg||

nt|migry: needs to ruff with the 10|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gracelin: they should if they really have such an agreement.  But in reality, not heard of.|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know that that is information you need to convey to opponents but Bridge World probably would have something to say.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: going down now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|migry: no idea how he figured out the 3 clubs with west when east didn't even show both majors|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mrt2000: only joking !!!!!!|pg||

nt|phil: well you are also choosing a winner from 155 teams - in 6 days? |pg||
mb|2D|mb|3D|nt|migry: a pick up for the gordon team on board 12- NS stopped in 2@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: will South balance here?|pg||
nt|kareno: Possible pass by south at equal vulnerability.|pg||
nt|baldjean: Bertens has 11 good hcp  and 3 trumps as support, but a flat hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nowadays, east's AK-A is an opening bid for many, despite shape|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|kfay: They should just play down to 8.  That would be my suggestion.|pg||
nt|kfay: In the swiss.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: this might be messy|pg||
nt|kareno: Just three more boards.  Many thanks to our marvelous operator who has not only done the technical things but also brought the room to life and helped with conventions too.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go, but before my exit would like to congratulate both Israel and OZ Open for their success in this event.  and thank Karen for your companion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Berkowitz after slow pass from Schwartz, you are israeli, how can you pass?|pg||
nt|kareno: It's certainly worth a question to BW, |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 25, Open room in 4@Sxx... :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to you Patrick.  Your words are always welcome!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: yes he does, and it will earn some points for his side|pg||
nt|kareno: They will pick him clean.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Nice pass!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: I like it!!|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't need a natural quantitative 2N raise here, as they open those hands 2@D (or perhaps rebid a forcing 2@C?) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens' option was  1@C=2+|pg||
pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: I am sure that it is the right thing to do - it is an agreement which is not apparent from the CC and oppo should be entitled to know what partner knows|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrt2000: GREAT bid from S|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher had the tougher decision about balancing between the two, in my opinion.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|migry: and another good result here, pushing EW to the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi offers his @s3 to Westra|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not critical of passing -- I would myself in almost all systems, even at these colors, just noting that it's not a position that many would take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer seems to have 2 options     1) go down slowly  2) go down quickly|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Time for clubs later - A and Q of spades for now.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|kfay: With the @sKJ making up half my points I'm not very inclined to force partner to play at the 3-level.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|kfay: Same shape with the KJ in either rounded suit I'm sure Schwartz would have done something.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|migry: assuming 4@h shows this type of hand, it was difficult for west to double 4@s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|migry: especially assuming the spades are over him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess another option   down 1 or down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why Westra didn't go to dummy to lead towards the @C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: ? he did|pg||
pc|d5|nt|oosmanb: -4 likely|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its boards like these that have made Fisher and Schwartz possibly the best junior pair in the world right now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: If I'm not mistaken they have a couple of pairs titles|pg||

nt|kareno: Yes, though the auction can easily be duplicated.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Oz will have to hope the board is duplicated in the Open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 6@C happens to make, but not a great contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||
nt|kareno: This is likely to be down one and could be a pickup if n/s bid 4@h in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he probably didn't favour the colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S, 7+ HCP, maybe longer @D    [1@C is almost forcing]|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably not underrated at this table, I'm sure.  Just in everyday tournaments.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: if the declarer will take top @s in the 2nd round and plays @h, he'll due to make his contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Pd didnt have enough to even neg dbl 1@S |pg||
nt|kareno: Another possible pass of a negative double :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D= natural or 0-6 hcp|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|yuval10: E can play J@d in the 2nd round also, but that'd be tough|pg||
nt|yuval10: and of course declarer can still make his contract by attacking @c then|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll have to guess which Ace does E holds - A@h or A@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag when he saw @SA, hmm, |pg||
pc|d9|nt|migry: 5@c should show good trumps|pg||
nt|migry: they don't play 'fast approach"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I agree with the pass|pg||
nt|kareno: He has a one club opening without the spade king!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: Good point, Oosman.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kfay: Looking at E/W leading agreements I'm not sure what the @cQ was all about.|pg||
nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||

nt|curtis: \|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, it shows like @c HHxxx and out|pg||
nt|ritong: or so|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and a partscore|pg||
nt|ritong: hello curtis|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2nd half of the Quarter finals is playe tomorrow at 10.00 am here in Veldhoved -- guess its 4.00am in New York|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board, Parimatch will continue to the semi finals of the transnationals.|pg||
nt|yuval10: entering the last board of the first haw, Israel holds a slim lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Last board of this Semi-Final, the final should start at 18.20 local time, thats 35 min from now, I believe we are a bit late on shedule..|pg||
nt|oosmanb: And a @c lead set up a ruff in 4@H too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||
nt|kareno: With the natural trump trick (unless first lead small from dummy)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (that's if you can drop singleton A without wasting an honour)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=20-21|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: David Berkowits and Alan Sontag are due up for the Gordon team.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks to our operator Robert Stephens who like all the operators did an excellent job|pg||
nt|oosmanb: in trumps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||
nt|kfay: But clearly it's at least somewhat undiscussed so I'm not sure why he'd expect all of this.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so all in all, not a bad board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: @S|pg||
nt|othered1: another light 3rd seat opening by Sementa, this one feather-light|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|yuval10: can the Israeli team hold up and "kill" yet another giant? we'll know right away. i believe the 2nd half was due to start 15:40 local time|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not pass with that east hand.  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might win @SQ and play @C to 8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they play 2@H as invitational here.  Many play it preemptive over a power redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   then only 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kareno: I'll be using it for some sleep :)  |pg||
nt|othered1: passing 3@C wold be quite a position, despite south's inaction at  his last two turns|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and DBL = "Clarify" partner|pg||
nt|mrt2000: as predicited   :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can ask Bas to bring you some Marc :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrt2000: predicted|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: another israel juniors had this same sequence yesterday|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|fluffy: the 3@h bidder had @hAK|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|othered1: a 2-way partial swing is, after all, 6 imps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Bas is off today|pg||
nt|kareno: Claim before you make a mistake!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @C10 play from Madala  it just didn't work this time|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: He heard me :)|pg||
nt|kareno: The other table is well behind ours so you can go over there now.  Looks very much like Mazel Tov to Israel :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: ok that is 1:30 am Vancouver time, 4:30 New York|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: he could've played @c and make|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps the 1@SX a couple of boards ago had some psychological effect|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: Yes, precisely.  But he will get his partscore equity (if any) from this contract.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
nt|kfay: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|kfay: See you, Gonzo.  Thanks.|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx all|pg||
nt|kfay: Thanks to our excellent operator, Gerbrand!|pg||
nt|fluffy: thx kevin and gerbrand|pg||
nt|fluffy: going ot hte other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: leaving this table open, incase other table crashes|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have Fisher and Schwartz behind me now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is getting crazy a bit|pg||
nt|oosmanb: It's good to instill some fear in your opponents, (entering into auctions is not free)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  so the broadcast restarts to morrow 10.30 CET|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 10.00 -- sr Henri :)|pg||

nt|ritong: okay  phew:)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|kareno: I'm sure they are reeling from that.  But at this level of play, you have to put those results aside in your mind.|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: the restults entered in the live ticker are right - but sometimes they are just results from other matches in the tournament|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra NEVER bid @C|pg||
nt|hedyg:  can W not make 5@cs?|pg||
nt|paulg:  wasn't his 2@s call a transfer to clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: so if lazy is leading against grant thornton with 44:27, it may be it's karlsruhe bsc leading against auguri warsaw :) nobody knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be close to the record for best suit that was never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i dont see why not|pg||
mb|3C|nt|hedyg:  S never gets to hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: excellent question Paul   i'm not sure if 2@S was @C or just general force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|hedyg:  and if N doesnt cash his tricks he doesnt make them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think Duboin will move past 3NT|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I just asked him last sunday.  it's general force|pg||
nt|hedyg:  oy, why not 3@D??? pd is big enough to bid 3@s to ask for a stop|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: getting to 3N with no entry to the solid 8-bagger ??|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@S a transfer, if so, why doesn't west want to protect the @DK?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite an aggressive 3@S, but this is best game, I think|pg||

nt|hedyg:  the official site is : http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/Champions%20Cup/|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  you need to get the spades right when played by north as the heart lead creates the fourth defensive trick before the diamonds are established|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i wonder what would 2@d be|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: just bid 3 NT so you don't need to defend against 4@S :-)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: after a high bid in clubs reaching game might be more difficult then making it for NS|pg||
nt|hedyg:  that might work too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: IF  Duboin bids conventional 2@S   is North good enough for DBL?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 2nt, he seems to be a little bit older then me :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg:  anybody for double in S?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: her Raptor 1NT by S would have worked very well|pg||
nt|paulg:  no, i overcall 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i dont like raptor here with AKx in @h|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: Playing raptor NT this would be no 1NT bid for me at all with a good 3 card M|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: so i would be forced to dbl because 1@D denies a 4 c M :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing that so many here actually KNOW  Raptor|pg||
nt|hedyg:  Roland!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|hedyg:  i love Raptor|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|paulg:  i wonder if 2NT is natural or invitational club raise?|pg||
nt|vugraphznf: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|hedyg:  http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Raptor.html|pg||
nt|paulg:  Now I'd double as South|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Raptor NT overcall    shows 4-card major and 5+minor    over 1m = 4@H/@S and 5+ other minor    over 1M = 4 other Major and 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: like 10/15|pg||
nt|ritong: according to vul|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: lots of other auctions affected   example   (1@C)-1@D would deny a 4-card major|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg:  S chickened out here which is why maybe initially double was better|pg||
nt|paulg:  a swing generated by madala and duboin|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: the part that always made me uncomfortable  when playing Raptor   DBL can include strong NT  so advancer  [partner of doubler] unsure about bidding suits in competition|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|2S!|an|!cs|nt|othered1: Many, maybe most, top Precision pairs seem to have given up on weak NT openings.  I wonder why?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|baldjean: Certainly an unusual result when dummy has 8 top tricks alone. But there was no way to reach it.|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: do you reopen with south's hand?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At these colors, how often do you trap?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: i wager he's never had a better suit that he never bid|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: In this position, I think a pass by north would be accepting 1@HXX, though perhaps it';s a matter of style|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: i guess so|pg||
