pc|c3|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: good morning|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: right contract wrong bidding sequence|pg||
nt|clinch: Having a few connection problems; I am sure the bidding was not as shown|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: A normal auction, not peculiar to Precision.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|desinka: yes|pg||

pc|c7|nt|vugraphzpf: Indonesia decided to resign, and not play last sessions|pg||
nt|desinka: with @D back 4@S goes down |pg||
nt|desinka: if the cotract is 4@S of course:)|pg||
nt|othered1: this may make 4, but 4 isn't a good spot.  @D continuation will hold it to 3, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Brink still thinking|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kfay: I'm not sure how well known this Israeli junior team is yet internationally but I can personally attest that they're the real deal and aren't just having a string of good luck in ...|pg||
nt|kfay: this tournament.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: session*|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though the Dutch team have an early strike with a double part score swing here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|d5|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kfay: Although probably their results up to this point against excellent teams should have already dissuaded anyone from that notion.  When I played for the USA U-26 team last year in ...|pg||
nt|kfay: Philadelphia they totally dismantled our team.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|desinka: in the OR Allegra's got 5@D..|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if north had a 2@D response available as a passed hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||

nt|desinka: EW playing Precision club|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|desinka: 2@D relay ask|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  2@D asking for a 4-card major, getting the wrong one|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Gerben42:  so will settle in 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  since W normally has 4@H now, probably leads @D then|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, looks like.|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42:  of course North might have had @D8|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  do Nanev and Gunev play strong @C too?|pg||
nt|desinka: Hello Krishna|pg||
nt|desinka: yes|pg||
nt|desinka: but the names are wrong :):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so it probably started 1@C , W overcalling|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  and North would pass showing 0 - 4 of some sort not getting to 3@S|pg||
nt|desinka: oh, they fix it|pg||
nt|desinka: probably..|pg||

nt|orentol: Hey all|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher and Schwartz came in 2nd in the World Junior Pairs in Beijing and their team went on to win gold in Philadelphia last year.|pg||
nt|kfay: Of course Sontag and Berkowitz are no slouches themselves and they start out with a fair result in this set.|pg||
nt|gracelin: he guessed only one red suit, so is -1|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ritong: hey jan  you on stage again?|pg||
nt|ritong: tireless|pg||
nt|gracelin: The trmp lead instead of HK may give him a clue.|pg||
mb|p|nt|calabres: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d=Flannery|pg||
nt|mrt2000: showing 5@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I am always here -- have operated every board since last sunday :)|pg||
nt|ritong: you gamble with your health, buddy|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 12 days - 48 boards a day -- thats healty :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which will likely dissuade W from bidding @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: these players in the Transnationals will have played 70 boards today -- when they finish these 16 boards|pg||
nt|gracelin: 11-14 1NT by Hans/Nunn|pg||
nt|clinch: Hi Tobias - apologies!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|desinka: so 2@D will be support with 4+S.. |pg||

pc|c5|nt|gracelin: they have rightsided the Heart game.  defenders cannot force effectvely.|pg||

nt|yuval10: hello Marc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: South has asked for a time monitor, East has taken allmost all the time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: North just asked about @SK|pg||
nt|kfay: Schwartz probably played the hearts the wrong way round on this hand, in my opinion.  It's more likely that someone sitting in 3rd seat at favorable vulnerability holding a heart ...|pg||
nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||
nt|othered1: West did have a bunch of HCP and didn't act, which may have affected north's decisions here.  Not that NS's auction gave him much of a chance|pg||
nt|panosk: @C was ok as it killed commincations with declarers hand |pg||

nt|clinch: OK :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzpf: he said that too :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=multi-purpose, forcing  a) BAL not range for 1/2NT opening  b) 5+@C, 10+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not pure Polish Club     NS use 2@C opening as artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Lotan just noticed me, he was to concentrated when I came in and swapped operator|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt makes as N has all entries|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: sure he did:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzpf: North: 1@D=natural, Berkowitz nooo!!|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: 1@h = 4+ piki|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|r|nt|ahollan1: 2@D probably  3-fit  reverse+ strength   totally artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: flannery was a hint, on the other hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: there have been 154 teams in the Transnationals|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 16 teams qualified for the Round of 16 - |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and now this is the first section of the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the remaining 16 boards will be played tomorrow |pg||
nt|desinka: 3@H = preemptive|pg||
nt|othered1: East won't be cowed by the NS actions|pg||
nt|desinka: for sure :)|pg||
nt|clinch: Redouble presumably support, showing three spades|pg||
nt|clinch: Although, of course, N only has 3 himself|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yuval10: the Israeli juniors are the cinderella team of this event, they are the current World champions and European champions for U-26|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt have predicted that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2S is a limited raise or bette in D.  West of curse sign-off at 3D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: South thinking|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kareno: With that north hand and unable to pass 1@s with only 2, I would have tried 2@h weak.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south's preempt is fairly strong, but likely tempered by north's limited opening|pg||
nt|desinka: 7420 shape.. is playing "almost" alone|pg||
nt|lechcold: better to stay low here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: welcome to migry zur campanile|pg||
nt|gracelin: An early club shift from East will beat 3H, but a good sacrifice against the makeable 3D.|pg||
nt|gracelin: expect a D lead and club return|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrt2000: making +1|pg||

nt|clinch: and is now saddled with the 3-3 fit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrt2000: or +2 now!|pg||
nt|yuval10: they impressed me as well as many other with their bridge level, and already beaten some very tough team in the 1/16 ( Smirnov ) and 1/8 (China open ) with big margin|pg||
nt|desinka: I mean this kind of shape.. :) |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|clinch: "@c would probably not have made either, but the damage would have been less severe|pg||
nt|clinch: 2@C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yuval10: now they're off to a good start against the Gordon team, also consist of David Berkowitz - Alan Sontag|pg||
nt|desinka: @H back its safe|pg||
pc|sT|nt|panosk: 3@S is down of course so gd call to defend 31D|pg||
nt|panosk: *3@D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: east caught a good dummy (on the auction), but doesn't need all of that|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: the trump lead led to the same effect.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yuval10: 3rd pair in the Israeli juniors' team - Gal Gerstner - Moshe Meyucas|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: i think he can make now by playing @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: very hard for W to see he should discard J@h and leave small @h as an entry to P|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: South checking EW' carding, closed the screen to ask west.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Karen.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@D was a general force, responses natural|pg||
nt|clinch: It looks as though this will go 4 down, for 2 more IMPs to Onstein|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: now W can cash KJ @H and exit with @s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kfay: I like Fisher's 4NT bid offering a choice between clubs or diamonds.  The partnership knows that Schwartz has shown a bunch of cards in the pointed suits so it's clear that South ...|pg||
nt|kfay: must have a lot of clubs and a few diamonds.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: for -1|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet another swing for the Israeli team is likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: sry, E still thinking ...|pg||

nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@H transfer to @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 1@s=art. GF relay|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2N=short @d|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C checkback i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@d showed his shape|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt by Magnusson in open fared 11 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: and 13-15 and 4+controls|pg||
nt|clinch: 6@s is not a terrible contract, but does need good things to happen in both majors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
nt|othered1: this is an OK game, vul at imps, that simply figures not to make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|desinka: always -1|pg||
nt|panosk: or Grant Thornton if you prefer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|clinch: 13 tricks made in the open room, which can be duplicated here, since the A@c is intact to enter dummy for the established hearts|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|othered1: Duboin is quite a declarer, but this one is beyond his skills|pg||
nt|desinka: :) |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
nt|clinch: On a club lead 13 doesn't look likely|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panosk: can make 4 i think now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|panosk: no he cant no entry to hand to cash last gd @H and discard a @C so just 3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: hello Phil|pg||
nt|kfay: South has kind of an interesting decision on this hand.  It's pretty vogue these days to bid 1N-3N with 4333 distribution even if you have a 4cM simply because your hand probably ...|pg||
nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has missed a great play but don't blame him.  We are seeng al 4 hands.|pg||

nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe 1@D can be other 4441|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: I get N-E bids at the same time|pg||
mb|1H|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||
nt|clinch: This time 1@d is passed, and the 5-4 spade fit may not be found!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|mrt2000: best lead found|pg||

mb|p|nt|kfay: position so would go through the whole Stayman process anyway but it's not that big a worry in my opinion.  For one thing if you bother to stayman the opponents might be more able ...|pg||
nt|kfay: to find a killing lead if you end up in 3NT anyway on a lot of hands since they have more information available to them.|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: 2@h z zatrzymania|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
nt|april7: this was agood decision by N to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H wasnt alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not on my screenside|pg||
nt|clinch: Not that this is a disaster, as it's EW's hand|pg||

nt|lechcold: tak|pg||
nt|clinch: Same contract as open room, but not much play with cards as they lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West asking about 1@d and souths pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: pass of 1@d does not show @d length|pg||
nt|clinch: Seems declarer must lose a club and two diamonds, in addition to a trump|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kareno: And the club fit.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panosk: ok thx Frederic, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2N would also be invite|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: podobnie jak na drugim stole|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: SW that is|pg||
nt|panosk: looks as if it was transfer to @S to me |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
nt|clinch: Well, that lead gives a chance if declarer finesses the spade|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
nt|panosk: i can be wrong, i havent fully incorporated transfers in my system yet :) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i must admit i never liked that jump bid  but partnerships need a lot of work to come up with alternative uses|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: N chyba móg³ jeszcze zalicytowaæ 3 trefl ale i 5 karo tu nie idzie|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: understable|pg||

nt|panosk: or revenge for the quartefinal in Bermuda Bowl if yiu so prefer|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I even believe that Transnationals started at 10.00 :) --|pg||
nt|migry: NS play a very weak preemptive style so 1NT is 8+ to bad 12|pg||
nt|migry: sry - overcall style|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT maybe on if D breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th seat only   1N=15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: But a discreet pass by south.|pg||
nt|panosk: W needs to return @d early to defeat but i think he will|pg||
nt|april7: here a clear NT hand, but now EW might get into trouble in  the @S contract|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play 14-16 all time|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At matchpoints, I'd reopen with the south hand if north passed in tempo.  But north acted,  quite reasonably, but not without risk.|pg||
nt|april7: S should pass!!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 tricks in his hand!!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not according to the Bermuda Bowl convention card|pg||
nt|lechcold: -3 and flat board I think|pg||
pc|sT|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
nt|april7: 2 down on norma defence|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||
nt|kareno: North perhaps considering re-entering the auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fluffy: still @d10xx is a great holding|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||
nt|othered1: nothing bad happenning here and it will make easily, but declarer may take a while to work things out.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|april7: if S get recive the @D ruff,then 3 down|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|clinch: This board should be fairly unremarkable; De Wijs found a good lead, but the contract is safe|pg||
pc|d7|nt|phil: if you play partner for 7-8 when you compete over a preempt (and raise to 4@s yourself) you'll do OK|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east felt bidding was too risky I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|april7: hi|pg||
pc|s5|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: And Rosenberg did ask to see it twice|pg||
nt|yuval10: here W has a super-maximum and of course was driven to game after E invited. looks perfectly normal, especially when they're red|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||
nt|kareno: At the highest level, part scores are contested hard.  Those relatively small IMPs add up.|pg||
nt|kareno: Only an overtrick at risk here.|pg||
nt|panosk: gd try by S, but E had A@C|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: tabela na razie dobra dla nas, co prawda spad³o siê na 4 miejsce, ale wystarczy nadrobic 4vp, ¿eby wyjc na drugie|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|kfay: That's true.  But what's the big rush non-vulnerable?  |pg||
nt|desinka: but the declarer wasnt thinking at all to fineesse it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|desinka: :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mlodygda83: a w danej chwili drugie oznacza Bu³garów w pó³finale, ale jeszcze duu¿o rozdañ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Okay next :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Believe this Israeli team won the Junior event in Philadelphia last year.  They now prove they can also win in the adult world.|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry N is declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kfay: Maybe he was influenced by three not-so-great boards so far this set.|pg||
nt|fluffy: now Fisher might run over Schwartz for not bidding the making slam :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south can ask about the @CK and claim 4 or 5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzng: he did|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW playing Tarzan Precision  PASS more hands 1st/2nd seat than almost any other Big Clubbers|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: what you would expect at a world championship fina :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: final|pg||
nt|clinch: enabling the promotion, somewhat unnecessarily, as the cards lay|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kfay: Even if you're more sound I still think this is a 1@H opener.|pg||
nt|panosk: yes gd point :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@C without spade ruff for EW but i doubt they will go there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is perfect example to show how players evaluate hands according to LOCATION of honors|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: its been a 1@h opener for about 20 years :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  |pg||
mb|5D|nt|migry: 2NT is natural|pg||
nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is probably a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they have all been Bar Mitzvah so in theory they are adults :)|pg||
nt|ady: Onstein kept low with 26 hcp between then in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu punktów nie zdobêdziemy|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt is brave enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AKxxx xx xx Axxx is automatic opener|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: tu bêd¹ grali 3nt z drugiej rêki|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT by north no chance though on a spade lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
nt|panosk: see how much easier double dummy makes finding the right contract :)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Karisruher  kept low in OR|pg||
nt|april7: its a unusual stop in OR at 2@H!!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1/2/3 seat  1N=(13)14-16|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
nt|mlodygda83: myla³em, ¿e W zd¹¿y skontrowac transfer kierowy|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
nt|clinch: This will make 11 tricks with the club ace and queen well-placed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and @H back and very down you go!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why deWijs didn't DBL 2@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: co niewiele zmienia, gdy¿ i tak nie ma sk¹d wzi¹c jedenastej lewy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: chyba  ¿e z magazynu:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
nt|desinka: right, make more sense now|pg||
nt|othered1: And then: 2@H show 4+S or strong one suited in @S-@C or @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm also wondering     it would be cool if i also understood polish commentary|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: I suppose can make now playing a club towards the queen|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s3|nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||
nt|migry: a mobile phone rang in the other room|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: the only relevant decision was actually stopping in 3|pg||

nt|ritong: dura lex sed lex|pg||
nt|migry: you are not even supposed to have any electronic devices in the playing area|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kareno: Whatever he pitches, he still needs the club onside.  Likely on the auction.|pg||
nt|ady: playing for spades 4-4   and K@H right|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|kfay: I'm informed that the team that finished higher in the Swiss between the two losing semi-finalists is awarded 3rd place.|pg||
nt|panosk: error in @D play in open in last board landed 4@S home in open|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||
nt|migry: and 2@d asks|pg||
nt|april7: after a 2@S opener weak, NS might reach 4 @S, but E W will surely reach 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm only multi-lingual in bridge languages|pg||
mb|1N|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
nt|panosk: and Holland strikes back |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especially "¿", "CZ" "SZ" "sZCZ".TRZ, |pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h makes here, 5@d can be defeated on an unlikely low spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||
nt|phil: seems hard to keep up your intensity for a 3/4 match|pg||

nt|kareno: For me it's 5 am so I don't object :0|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S too expensive  at the vulnerability|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
nt|april7: now Germany will pick up a few imps|pg||
nt|clinch: Now spade needed to hold to 4|pg||
nt|clinch: This could be Vito's first IMP|pg||
pc|dT|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead and choice of plays from dummy give declarer 8 tricks.  Where the 9th comes from is another question|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
nt|panosk: now watch the correct play of this hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they're juniors, we shouldn't expect anything less from them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Narkiewicz gets 2nd @S stopper!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman advising Willenken to lead his ace|pg||

nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: bye and good lucks eveyone.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||
nt|migry: which explains the "passed out" score|pg||
nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, let s leave that into director's capable hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Padon asking 'how many you have, 17?'|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 only|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Birman: 'no, 19'. Padon: I didn't mean points, I meant tricks :-)|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh well too high now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|phil: 4@h makes NS but GL getting in |pg||

nt|fluffy: berkowitz has good shape but bad vulnerability|pg||
nt|fluffy: when I try this doubles opponetns have 5332 opposite 3334 and I'm toasted :P|pg||
nt|phil: unsurprisingly partner has 3433 across - on a bad day its 4=3=3=3|pg||
nt|kareno: No slam.  Presumably south will think he has too many spades to get a penalty worth it.|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, that make the 1N on the last hand look even more strange to me.|pg||
nt|timb: 6@H by East is a reasonble contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: a trump at any point would have left declarer with 3 spade losers, the @h ruff and the A@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@H would not work|pg||

nt|phil: however on a good day, partner has a 5 card suit - but are you really buying the hand? |pg||
nt|kareno: Four can be made with the help of a spade finesse.  We'll watch and see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4NT of course would be easy, with 4@s 1@h 3@d and 2@c|pg||

nt|othered1: decent spot.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: declarer asking for the leads: 2/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 20-21|pg||
nt|ady: best for defence if north wins first diamond trick and plays 9@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sry cannot alert after bidding is over......|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 2@d was 15-18 any suit or 20-21 bal|pg||

nt|lechcold: I think most popular is Classic Polish Club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: currently in 5@H  but auction isn't over|pg||
nt|clinch: Interesting - obviously counter-instinctive to many to construct auctions from knowledge of partner's shortages|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|panosk: 7 is a gamble and i doubt they will take it|pg||
nt|ady: east will make though  if taking heart finesse  and ducking next heart when it loses|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 4@H=3 controls|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: talking about small fights, other room is a riot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: of course W is thinj|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: *thinking|pg||
nt|timb: I played some relay systems in the 1990s and I reckon David is correct because you need to identify honors that are almost worthless opposite a shortage|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes...of course this is seen often by club players when deploying the splinter bid|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: but others play the NS system?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: So I missed a few cards here, but it looks like he can eliminate @D and then play @S up and pray?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: North would have to duck the first club to give declarer a real guess.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if South has A@C doesnt it make anyway?|pg||

nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
nt|panosk: another 6@H here|pg||
nt|lechcold: martwi mnie, ¿e po naszej stronie nie widaæ ani jednego impa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-15, could hold 5+@S !!!!!|pg||
mb|1C|an|alerted|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
nt|ady: some might open east hand|pg||
mb|1D|an|alerted|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
nt|panosk: Netherlands (EW) scored 23 imps in last 4 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C must be long diamonds and 3@S values in spades i think|pg||
nt|panosk: make it 36 imps in last 5 boards|pg||
nt|ady: playing weak jump shifts   so 2@S weak|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: near transfer bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
nt|lesniak: wydaje sie prawdopodobne ze to przeoczenie operatora|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  balancing NT  = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D also make|pg||
nt|panosk: still i think 4@H will be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: see www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html for liveticker|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: mo¿e tutaj uda siê zdobyc jakie punkty|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might chose now 3@C and S then 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W just said they dont play weak 2s|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
nt|panosk: ok not then :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H also went down  so board 9 pushed|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @c Q?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: for live scores|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 2NT natural here   leb not necessary as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
nt|clinch: Afraid the meanings of these bids are not known as we don't have convention cards, but this is a Precision sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did NOT balance  so Pepsi  1@HEast|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: north bid a GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: south showed 0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 3@h= 3 card @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|panosk: the success of the dutch team in Bermuda Bowl is largely attributed in their slam bidding, you can see now why|pg||
pc|d6|nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: w meczu najbezpieczniej wygl¹da trefl do 8|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: i tak zagra³|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must admit i wouldn't balance with 1N   just not sure if I'd PASS or DBL|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przynajmniej tu trafi³|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E pokaza³ ju¿ otwarciem 5 kierów, wistem 4 kara i, o ile nie oszukali na zrzutkach - 3 piki|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like to think most days i'd PASS|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc ma singla trefl, a z punktów wynika, ¿e na 90% jest to figura|pg||
nt|lechcold: borderline decision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course when 3N makes  i'd owe teammates a good bottle of wine|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc zabezpiecza kontrakt bior¹c 3 kara, 2 trefle, 3 piki i kiera|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Lech   VERY close decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another point    many big clubbers would respond with West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I know I would|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too Yordan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only because there is safety valve of rebid with @HJ9|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N getting annoyed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i've never played the EW system where 5+@S 5@H opens 1@H   that may create larger fear for deWijs|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: he is a smoker, 20 boards is to much for him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why  Balicki-Zmudzinski  often claim for their opponents :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: they open 1@H with 55 in majors because of relay scheme|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Muller "we still have time"|pg||
nt|lechcold: it's not possible to get full opener's shape after 1@S opening if this includes 55 in majors|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: a better spot than 3@H   as played in OR by south|pg||
nt|april7: its a much better contract then 2NT but still going probably 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: E should take this trickn anyway andlead the Q of @H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|clinch: Certainly well-bid, and a flat board|pg||
pc|c8|nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither Muller nor any of us ever anticipated east on lead after winning @CQ :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kfay: Glad to hear you play the same way :P|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: 5@s only because he did not overcall|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  Onstein not leaving any gaps for Vito to score |pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42:  1@D is art. negative or some good hands|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  so can be 0 |pg||
nt|psyck:  S may come under pressure with all cards marked with him|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then it is obv. to play a natural NT bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  no good lead in S...|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, will likely make contract now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|Gerben42:  probably !A is the best lead but impossible|pg||

nt|Gerben42:  the reason for no result must be Muller declaring?|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  actually it's de Wijs declaring|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but the reason was an endless relay auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  good bidding by Onstein on both tables|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Brink - Drijver good opposition, de Wijs - Muller after 1NT relaying to the top score|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  this is the usual situation, Drijver trying to find the layout to set it |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  declarer will need 1 @C trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  if N leads a @D, S has a problem on the @s10|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  then if declarer reads the position right he will still make|pg||

nt|panosk: and it was a push|pg||
nt|lechcold: there are the points we needed:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea behind [reverse] Smith is   when declarer leads his suit at trick 2, each defender can tell whether or not they liked the opening lead  [unless card needed to show length]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what would you do here?|pg||
nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s=att, south asked|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
nt|april7: E 1NT and then we will see after @S attack|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: na drugim stole raczej normalny wist Kality nie okaza³ siê najszczêliwszy|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s5|pg||
nt|clinch: EW will certainly want to restrict entries to dummy... We can expect passive play from declarer, and a club duck at some stage|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
nt|april7: E should actually go down |pg||
nt|ady: not much on here    2 spades might make with a struggle|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
nt|panosk: if you think your pard is reasonable he must have around 7 @C and 6-7 pts|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
nt|clinch: One of those deals where nobody wants to open up any suit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: trochê niepotrzepnie wstawi³ waleta w drugiej lewie|pg||
pc|h9|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
nt|april7: N might come up with a X now but S can't probably stand it|pg||
nt|clinch: A further heart now creates a finessable position in that suit for declarer if E takes K|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will be at  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
nt|ahollan1: web page for the event   http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/Champions%20Cup/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: friendly layout here for declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: I have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT also might go down on a spade lead    south felt to weak to pass|pg||
nt|clinch: Club finesse and spade|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|panosk: -1|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
nt|clinch: EW will be gaining as their counterparts drove to game in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mlodygda83: wygl¹da na imp straty|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the round robin matches are 20 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups of 6 teams   then various KO matchups follow|pg||
nt|ady: 3 heart tricks available for declarer  playing next one to the 10  when the 9 drops|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher said @S are 3-3, Berkowitz, that's not fun :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nicely played|pg||
nt|clinch: But nonetheless 4 more IMPs to Onstein 1|pg||
mb|1N|nt|oosmanb: Israel juniors picked up 9 for their 6@d effort|pg||
nt|othered1: Might this pass out?|pg||
nt|desinka: why not|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  or 3@D a maked for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well that particular hand was definintely a pretty surprising result.  I think it was in the semifinals or finals of the USBF versus the Fleisher team.|pg||
nt|phil: precisionesque 2@d|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 then and 4 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|panosk: same hand Frederic|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 of a major easy to bid - seven is there.|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|fluffy: berkowitz can envision 12 tricks if partner has a perfect hand, but soon he will see there is no luck today|pg||
nt|gracelin: but not 7S, |pg||
pc|s7|nt|phil: would have to be a remarkable minimum|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: S is not sure about the meaning|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kareno: Maybe exclusion blackwood??  Does that give enough information?|pg||
nt|baldjean: May wind up in 4@h here.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+  1@D=0-8  1@H=19+ |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||

nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
nt|clinch: Cards again lie very well for EW|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|baldjean: A@d looks likea liekly lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29   dutch also playing 5@C|pg||
nt|baldjean: likely*|pg||
nt|othered1: They can be topcarded out, but the @S have to be cashed before declarer gains the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: it seems pass from E started an escape sequence|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kareno: Teach me to assume :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: assume nothing.. works for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S rely controls    4@C=2  [A=2 K=1]|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|phil: I for one appreciate Gerbrand's detail descriptions of the calls :)|pg||
nt|panosk: helpfull lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller would NOT count singleton @HK as control  so must be @CA|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Next set in 1 hour and 40 mins after a lunch break will have voice commentary for the Allegra-Karlsruhe match|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kfay: Yeah Gerbrand.  When are they going to give you a full-time job?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
nt|ady: could be the best plus for n/s  would be to pass the 1NT  but has its risks |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W showing his @H holding to S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2:  The other semifinal|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no room to learn about @SJ so deWijs just guesses  [well in this case]|pg||
nt|lechcold: strefa szlemowa po raz kolejny przyniesie nam du¿¹ stratê|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  14.00 CET|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just upside-down count/attitude|pg||
nt|othered1: If it did show preference to @S, why would west shift to trumps?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: bye|pg||
nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gracelin: I saw very slow players in this tournament which maybe the cause of the nap during the game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H8 DOES show suit pref for @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a very helpful lead for declarer|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lechcold: w poprzednim meczu by³o to 17imp za wypuszczonego (ale bardzo dobrego) szlema do koñcówki na drugim stole|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: trzeba chyba drog¹ dyplomatyczn¹ zadzia³aæ w kierunku likwidacji strefy szlemowej w bryd¿u|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie wiem tylko jak dobry jest to szlemik|pg||
nt|lesniak: pamietajmy ze czesto musimy bic 2 kiery w dziadku|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still a number of options for declarer|pg||
nt|clinch: 9 tricks likely, for another Dutch IMP|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kareno: Well, it would have been my play for what it's worth.  Sets up several tricks instead of one with a prayer.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: West hapy he is not vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|phil: his partner must habititually lead the beer :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah declarer won't put a honnor with an ace anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can see that all choices work but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|lesniak: wtedy trzeba by znalezc co najmniej 1 figure pik w impasie i czesto piki 3-2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzpf: only 50's he'll be saying to himself|pg||
nt|othered1: but too late|pg||
nt|baldjean: No idea, but what else can 9@d mean?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobry szlemik, to ten co idzie...a jeszcze lepszy ten, który nie idzie a poszed³...mia³em kiedy partnera - specjalistê od takich szlemików|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct as always, Patrick.|pg||
nt|panosk: tough hand|pg||
nt|panosk: cant see how it can make|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|pg||
