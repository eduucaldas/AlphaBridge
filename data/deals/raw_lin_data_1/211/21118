mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|psyck:  Hello everyone|pg||
nt|rv: Hi all, warm regards from sunny Bangalore|pg||
nt|rv: this match-up is nearly a repeat of Bermuda Bowl QFs between Holland and Iceland|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|psyck:  problemic hand to start with...could go several ways with most hands having various options...|pg||
nt|rv: here West's 2@c doesn't show any strength, some play pass by West as no choice of suit and 1n to play with predominant @s length and some values|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d!|an|T/O|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|rv: Magnusson possibly indicated this sequence as 2 places to play or even both minors|pg||
nt|rv: he could have bid 2@c in earlier round if he just wanted to play there|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|rv: I suspect he indicated this as 2 places to play and East didn't correct to 2@d since he was afraid second suit was @hs|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: no way to beat this 2@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: hoi from cold and misty NL|pg||
nt|psyck:  Hoi :)|pg||
nt|rv: in such auctions, finding 7 card fit is first priority, hence Hjaltason passed 2@c|pg||

nt|desinka: if the cotract is 4@S of course:)|pg||
nt|othered1: this may make 4, but 4 isn't a good spot.  @D continuation will hold it to 3, anyway|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kfay: Although probably their results up to this point against excellent teams should have already dissuaded anyone from that notion.  When I played for the USA U-26 team last year in ...|pg||
nt|kfay: Philadelphia they totally dismantled our team.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: and we are LIVE now :)|pg||
nt|panosk: -1 and the first swing |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|gracelin: Israel Junior lead by 27 imps including the 5 imps from carry over. There are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|gracelin: South stopped cautiously at 3S.  At one of the BB match, the Netherland south jumped to 4S after similar start.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|desinka: as I remember they play 2 way drury..|pg||
nt|panosk: @Ds now till S ruffs to discard a loser in spades |pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: I agree with Jeff Aker that 3nt is a more useful bid by west.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gracelin: declarer can make 3S here if he guess both the red suits.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jaker: I think I would have risked 3n as west...you know partner won't be able to bid it|pg||

nt|vugraphznf: that was their conclusion as well|pg||

nt|kfay: Fisher and Schwartz came in 2nd in the World Junior Pairs in Beijing and their team went on to win gold in Philadelphia last year.|pg||
nt|kfay: Of course Sontag and Berkowitz are no slouches themselves and they start out with a fair result in this set.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: hey jan  you on stage again?|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 12 days - 48 boards a day -- thats healty :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: which will likely dissuade W from bidding @Ss|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: these players in the Transnationals will have played 70 boards today -- when they finish these 16 boards|pg||
nt|gracelin: 11-14 1NT by Hans/Nunn|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: so 2@D will be support with 4+S.. |pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: they have rightsided the Heart game.  defenders cannot force effectvely.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kfay: A lot of Israeli supporters are reminding me they took gold in the european youth teams last year and seem generally shocked that their names aren't standard around any bridge home ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: South has asked for a time monitor, East has taken allmost all the time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: North just asked about @SK|pg||
nt|kfay: Schwartz probably played the hearts the wrong way round on this hand, in my opinion.  It's more likely that someone sitting in 3rd seat at favorable vulnerability holding a heart ...|pg||
nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||
nt|othered1: West did have a bunch of HCP and didn't act, which may have affected north's decisions here.  Not that NS's auction gave him much of a chance|pg||
nt|panosk: @C was ok as it killed commincations with declarers hand |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: flannery was a hint, on the other hand|pg||

nt|othered1: East won't be cowed by the NS actions|pg||
nt|desinka: for sure :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: the Israeli juniors are the cinderella team of this event, they are the current World champions and European champions for U-26|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt have predicted that contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gracelin: 2S is a limited raise or bette in D.  West of curse sign-off at 3D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: With that north hand and unable to pass 1@s with only 2, I would have tried 2@h weak.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: south's preempt is fairly strong, but likely tempered by north's limited opening|pg||
nt|desinka: 7420 shape.. is playing "almost" alone|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: welcome to migry zur campanile|pg||
nt|gracelin: An early club shift from East will beat 3H, but a good sacrifice against the makeable 3D.|pg||

nt|kfay: So maybe it's best he didn't try it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the difference before this segment should have been 6 imps in favor of Israel|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: a live ticker is available at www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|nt|kfay: Hey Phil|pg||
nt|kareno: No really not.|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW can make 5C on club finesse.  in 3NT, defenders can beat it with a spade lead, but south is likely to lead a H, presumably his partner's suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: lets see how they instate slam platform|pg||
nt|yuval10: E discarded 6@d and 4@d over the first 2 @c's, i'd say he showed interest in @s|pg||
nt|migry: usually 5+|pg||
nt|panosk: 1@H transfer to @S|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|migry: i assume they have the methods|pg||
nt|ritong: possible, yes:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: knowing these two, it's more or less a certainty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: So team Gordon is 10 in front by now|pg||
nt|kareno: They need some action hands, not flat 1nt ones.|pg||
mb|2C!|an|puppet to 2!d|nt|vugraphzpf: not the 3 imps that are displayed|pg||
nt|kfay: I know that N/S play a really 'natural' system, but I'm still surprised they don't have a variety of 2-suited bids available over the strong club opening.  They probably play 1NT = ...|pg||
nt|kfay: minors and X = majors and call that good enough.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|2D!|an|forced|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@h asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 4@c = @d shortness|pg||
nt|migry: with the spades 4-1 declarer has some work to do here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C checkback i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the preempt seems to have stolen the board, 4@H will make NS|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt by Magnusson in open fared 11 imps to Iceland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|migry: sry - on a @h lead|pg||
nt|migry: spade is tricky|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to ruff twice on the same side to come up to 12, at first sight|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h+2@c+1@d implies 6 @s tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: who can blame him, but now he is down.|pg||
nt|othered1: this is an OK game, vul at imps, that simply figures not to make on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|desinka: always -1|pg||
nt|panosk: or Grant Thornton if you prefer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|migry: and work on the hearts- probably hearts 3-3 will make it easy|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphzpf: 5@h asks for Kings|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 5@s says -- Sorry partner - I have none|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|othered1: Duboin is quite a declarer, but this one is beyond his skills|pg||
nt|desinka: :) |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|migry: 5@d would have asked for the Q@S|pg||
nt|migry: and the second step confirms all key cards|pg||
nt|mrt2000: he found it|pg||
nt|ritong: he has to lose the lead in @hs no matter what|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a second round of trumps would be clumsy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he certainly plans to lead a @h towards QJ asap  the question is, does the timing demand a ruff before that?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sorry -- says Rodwell -- and put his cards on the table |pg||
nt|migry: easiest would be to try and ruff 2 clubs in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah  achesslike hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gracelin: low spade to SJ may also be a good idea.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|panosk: can make 4 i think now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: an other solution can be @h hook then Xruff|pg||
nt|mrt2000: N's 7@S could grow up quickly here|pg||
nt|migry: can't make it now as he will have to give a @h and that little @s7|pg||
nt|kareno: West can be one-suit squeezed if he is not careful.  And yes, that develops at least one spade trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer cashes all his H winners in order not to be put back to dummy with H.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mrt2000: strange play from dummy at trick 1|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gracelin: the CJ played by East on 1st round maybe either singleton J or Jx.  Nunn will unblock anyway.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kareno: Good (very early) morning from Las Vegas :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but i would think twice before questioning a rodwell's play:)|pg||
nt|migry: agreed|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when it does not consist in second play low|pg||
nt|mrt2000: I wasn't questioning, just onserving  :)|pg||
nt|mrt2000: observing|pg||
nt|ritong: i think his play simplified matters with @s9 in north|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: I am not sre if declarer shud find this play.  I thk he should but remember, this is the 14 days of the long tournament.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panosk: no he cant no entry to hand to cash last gd @H and discard a @C so just 3|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gracelin: West is playing for partner having another club.|pg||
nt|kareno: Dangerous spade discards.|pg||
nt|gracelin: from the auction south is very likely to hold 4-card clubs.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|migry: doesn't look like there were communication problems so not sure why the 8@s was relevant at that point|pg||
nt|ritong: in case of Xruff plan|pg||
nt|mrt2000: agrred, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and for those of you thinking about an operator error -- forget it -- not this time :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|migry: the point is that while the 8@s was the "wrong" play here, I'm sure that Rodwell had a very good idea about why he's playing it|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|desinka: with @C lead will be -2|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzng: italians discussing the bidding|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: Hi Karen|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panosk: another chance to make 4 is to play the @D ruffing finess if no @C return|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|gracelin: now declarer is down, East may cash 2 Spade winners and put declarer back with D.|pg||

nt|phil: annoying result - but normal|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: hello Phil|pg||
nt|kfay: South has kind of an interesting decision on this hand.  It's pretty vogue these days to bid 1N-3N with 4333 distribution even if you have a 4cM simply because your hand probably ...|pg||
nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has missed a great play but don't blame him.  We are seeng al 4 hands.|pg||
nt|kareno: My dear Patrick, good morning :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: now 2@D open (weak 6M)?|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|yuval10: EW can make a lot of tricks in the red suits, and E is waisting no time|pg||
nt|gracelin: 4H for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2N!|nt|mrt2000: best lead found|pg||
nt|ritong: did meck mutter " no problem "?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W thinking now|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: position so would go through the whole Stayman process anyway but it's not that big a worry in my opinion.  For one thing if you bother to stayman the opponents might be more able ...|pg||
nt|kfay: to find a killing lead if you end up in 3NT anyway on a lot of hands since they have more information available to them.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ew lead 4th best it seems|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia gained a small swing by beating both 3H this rom and 4D other room on  3.|pg||
nt|kareno: Easy hand for a change but not what OZ wants.|pg||
nt|desinka: rejects|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H wasnt alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not on my screenside|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: A@C from E works wonders!|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW needs to find the @c ruff then it's 2 down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: And the club fit.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|panosk: ok thx Frederic, |pg||
pc|d4|nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: SW that is|pg||
nt|panosk: looks as if it was transfer to @S to me |pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
nt|panosk: i can be wrong, i havent fully incorporated transfers in my system yet :) |pg||
pc|cA|nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|mrt2000: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: very!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton and Fisher having a party on their side of the screen|pg||
nt|gracelin: In fact you don't see many 800, 1100 in this tournament even everybody took very bold actions.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|phil: hey Gonzo|pg||
nt|phil: yes, E gets squoze down to a bare @c honor holding the diamond pictures|pg||
nt|desinka: o/e discarding|pg||
nt|desinka: so wants @D|pg||
nt|othered1: setting up the second suit is a normal strategy to avoid being tapped out if trumps break badly|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|gracelin: declarer is making this|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: you do get 3400's though ;)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kareno: Haven't seen one of those in years!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kfay: A kib mentions that some pairs have gadgetry available to show exactly 4333 or 3433 distribution.  I think that's usually accomplished with 1N-3M or something like that.  Who knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: what's actually best but I personally have had a few good experiences hiding information with 1N-3N, when I've decided to be 'modern' and bid that way.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: really ? from a redouble ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yeah, big misunderstanding apparently|pg||
nt|kareno: I know what generates it but I haven't seen one in forever, Patrick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if declarer plays DQ here, he can even endplay East to make an overtrick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: But ... I'm sure he will take his seven and be happy :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but he won't do that, as if West gets in, he still has two H to cash.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|fluffy: lovelly squeeze by fisher|pg||
nt|fluffy: could we call it "suicide squeeze"?|pg||
nt|phil: Fluffy squeeze|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: What is your carding here - asks Rosenberg -- Upside down says Meckstroth|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT maybe on if D breaks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: But a discreet pass by south.|pg||
nt|panosk: W needs to return @d early to defeat but i think he will|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|othered1: At matchpoints, I'd reopen with the south hand if north passed in tempo.  But north acted,  quite reasonably, but not without risk.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil: 4@s is a little aggro, but the 5th spade, and round honors are nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz showed his 4 aces first :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: an Spec notes that if east discards a diamon instead of a club declarer has another guess to make as well|pg||
nt|fluffy: 4@s for me is supper agro, I reopen 3@d with 8 HCP at this vul, he could be playing some 17 HCP game sometimes  _ |pg||
nt|kfay: 4@s looks like a good way to prevent partner from balancing in the future, for me.|pg||
nt|phil: same|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
pc|hK|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: which woulld make i believe|pg||
nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||
nt|migry: depends on the style - i would prefer a different hand for a weak jump overcall |pg||
nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||

pc|d4|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||

pc|d3|nt|migry: that was an unexpected discard by east|pg||

nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||

nt|kareno: Only an overtrick at risk here.|pg||
nt|panosk: gd try by S, but E had A@C|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: yes, no problem for NS to be pushed to 3D on their 9-card fit.  But I prefer north to bid 2D earier and south 3D over 3C.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|gracelin: what you would expect at a world championship fina :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: final|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kfay: Even if you're more sound I still think this is a 1@H opener.|pg||
nt|panosk: yes gd point :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@C without spade ruff for EW but i doubt they will go there|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: its been a 1@h opener for about 20 years :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2NT is natural|pg||
nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is probably a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they have all been Bar Mitzvah so in theory they are adults :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt is brave enough|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
nt|panosk: see how much easier double dummy makes finding the right contract :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: i have no idea about that, mig|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on their areement, but normally, a spade.|pg||
nt|desinka: right, make more sense now|pg||
nt|othered1: And then: 2@H show 4+S or strong one suited in @S-@C or @D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: perhaps with rubbish|pg||
nt|ritong: tryi_ng to hit pard with entries|pg||
nt|fluffy: but that's just for the overtrick 3@s can't be beaten|pg||
nt|phil: right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|migry: apparently something happened in the other room and the Angelini team gets a 6imps penalty|pg||
nt|yuval10: all academic when they stopped in the sensible contract of 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|migry: and some more action over there|pg||

mb|p|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|2H|an|alert|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
nt|panosk: and Holland strikes back |pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
pc|c4|nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead and choice of plays from dummy give declarer 8 tricks.  Where the 9th comes from is another question|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
nt|panosk: now watch the correct play of this hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ritong: scored as passout up to that point|pg||

nt|kareno: Thanks for being here, Patrick.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|desinka: yes, but from xx the small one and from 10x the 10|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|fluffy: wich is awful for defending|pg||
nt|othered1: would south really lead from 10x in an ambiguously opened suit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|othered1: from xx, rather|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS Convention Card from recent Bermuda Bowl  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|panosk: 7 is a gamble and i doubt they will take it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: talking about small fights, other room is a riot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: of course W is thinj|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: *thinking|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  How can you get to 4@H if North opens 1@H? Impossible, right? So that F convention is magical|pg||
nt|kareno: A club return by north would be far-seeing but east can get it right.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|kareno: Always beware when opponents play a suit you cannot play yourself :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Oosman :)|pg||
nt|aramesh_:  Hi Oosman-wlc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Could the @D10 have been an indication that South has the @SA?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So I missed a few cards here, but it looks like he can eliminate @D and then play @S up and pray?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and therefore not the @CA|pg||
nt|kareno: The queen would speak louder for spades.  I suspect the ten meant clubs.  North known to have the queen.|pg||
nt|kareno: North would have to duck the first club to give declarer a real guess.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if South has A@C doesnt it make anyway?|pg||
nt|desinka: i explain it clearly..|pg||
nt|desinka: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk: to be honest i havent the faintest idea what they have showed so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: i think it was some kind of asking for distribution from opener|pg||
nt|panosk: and maybe 4@C was aksing aces?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 4@c could have been RKCB|pg||
nt|panosk: here some explanation from a learned spec 3NT=3325 4S=4 controls|pg||
nt|panosk: thx|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: close it showed controls|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when playing transfer responses i play 1@S rebid by west as asking opener to rebid 1nt to right side the contract|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, it does.  Here's Nunn going right at once.  Good job!!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kfay: Getting a few comments arguing that the penalty is just or even not harsh enough (in chess you can forfeit if you're slow enough).  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: well done|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: I understand what it means, just wonder why south would lead from xx when partner can have xx as well|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzng: both partnerships discussing now|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|phil: normal 420 but 800 was for the taking in 3@c. Yet who can x it? |pg||
nt|kfay: I agree, the pace can be pretty bad sometimes.  But in the later rounds of a tournament I have more sympathy.  I realize that opinion isn't shared.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|yuval10: they're playing 3NT in the OR, after N passed there|pg||
mc|13|nt|fluffy: how is it that they know who gets teh penalty? is it because of the new system that watches everything?|pg||
nt|panosk: controls are A=2 controls K=1 control add the sum of 2s and 1s and give them as a sum|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W: and i make 7, because you have the king of clubs|pg||

nt|yuval10: and here's another grand slam, very interesting boards this set|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!h or !s/!c|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
nt|panosk: another 6@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
nt|panosk: Netherlands (EW) scored 23 imps in last 4 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C must be long diamonds and 3@S values in spades i think|pg||
nt|panosk: make it 36 imps in last 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D also make|pg||
nt|panosk: still i think 4@H will be it|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: see www.merlin-liveticker.de/Champions%20Cup/11_11_17_wer.html for liveticker|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|oosmanb: Unless East leads a brilliant @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
nt|panosk: ok not then :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|panosk: the success of the dutch team in Bermuda Bowl is largely attributed in their slam bidding, you can see now why|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h9|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
mc|13|nt|migry: looks normal|pg||

nt|panosk: wd|pg||
nt|panosk: and it was a push|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the idea behind [reverse] Smith is   when declarer leads his suit at trick 2, each defender can tell whether or not they liked the opening lead  [unless card needed to show length]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what would you do here?|pg||
nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
mb|4C|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They should stop in 2@h, the limit of the hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: np - welcome back :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S looking very surprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: possibly|pg||
nt|mrt2000: oooops|pg||
nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
nt|panosk: if you think your pard is reasonable he must have around 7 @C and 6-7 pts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi: I have the ace of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|kareno: The diamond lead could be a problem for west.  He needs to duck it or lose a promotion in clubs.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|panosk: -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fluffy: be careful with all thos transfers, some ladies ended up in -3400 in the venice cup RR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: EW referring to the dutch ladies, with the 4@Hxx for 3400|pg||
nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
pc|dT|nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: Of course, declarer may ruff high on the next diamond and finesse in clubs to neutralize north's ten.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: going to be testing though|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: heh|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: the round robin matches are 20 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 groups of 6 teams   then various KO matchups follow|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|kareno: Ruff high, hearts to ruff in dummy and hope for 3-2 clubs.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Or an inspired @c finesse which would also work|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so wont go wrong here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher asked Schwartz to overruff..|pg||

nt|kfay: And redouble would show a hand that's willing to compete if the opponents take a sacrifice.  Presumably a hand that strong wouldn't mind if responder HAS to play 4M.|pg||

mb|1D|an|alert|nt|yuval10: a lot of action in the OR where NS already bids to the making 3NT, but EW bided them out of it|pg||

mb|r!|nt|oosmanb: Not too many tricks for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 10 imps will quickly come back to the Gordon team|pg||
nt|kareno: No, a spade raise would have been more useful.  (or a pass by east over 1@c)|pg||
nt|kareno: Blocking play by declarer.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South has an entry, so he'll cash AK@H and use their signalling method to show @D|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzpf: E still thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt looks normal, but this time dummy does not have the required stopper in unbid suit, and 5@D was easy make|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: or that :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: duck is superior.. partner doesnt have to discard twice for no reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: well bid NS|pg||
nt|kfay: I think the usual explanation for the 2@D bid is something like "4415 minus a card".  So you could be (43)15 or 4405, etc.|pg||
nt|kareno: Jack of clubs I assume now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: brb|pg||
nt|baldjean: A@d looks likea liekly lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29   dutch also playing 5@C|pg||
nt|baldjean: likely*|pg||
nt|othered1: They can be topcarded out, but the @S have to be cashed before declarer gains the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: it seems pass from E started an escape sequence|pg||

pc|sA|nt|kfay: Yeah Gerbrand.  When are they going to give you a full-time job?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Never I guess..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just upside-down count/attitude|pg||
nt|othered1: If it did show preference to @S, why would west shift to trumps?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: I think Aristos will slip to 2nd position after this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzrq: bye|pg||
nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gracelin: I saw very slow players in this tournament which maybe the cause of the nap during the game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H8 DOES show suit pref for @S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|kareno: Well, it would have been my play for what it's worth.  Sets up several tricks instead of one with a prayer.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|oosmanb: agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: West hapy he is not vulnerable :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d6|nt|phil: his partner must habititually lead the beer :)|pg||
nt|fluffy: I do, but I also play a rule that says don't underlead aces|pg||
nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||
nt|fluffy: yeah declarer won't put a honnor with an ace anyway|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzpf: only 50's he'll be saying to himself|pg||
nt|othered1: but too late|pg||
nt|baldjean: No idea, but what else can 9@d mean?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||
nt|kareno: Correct as always, Patrick.|pg||
nt|panosk: tough hand|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag: we gave them to much information, Fisher: yes, @H lead would have been better, Sontag: and faster|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is trying to guard against 4-1 in both majors.  He's finally aware can't be done with assurance.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|oosmanb: how's 3NT NS|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt my guess here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|yuval10: here NS in the OR did well to bid to a marginal game|pg||
nt|desinka: this opening may cost some trouble..|pg||
nt|desinka: will .. actually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|2D|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Gazzilli  |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) nat  b) any 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = nat and weak|pg||
nt|panosk: wc :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oosmanb: 3NT from South now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Qx is good enough|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, somebody has to bid notrumps.|pg||
nt|kareno: I would have as north, frankly.|pg||
nt|othered1: How far is 2/1 forcing for them?|pg||
nt|desinka: GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: far enough :)|pg||
nt|desinka: has to take the A|pg||
nt|desinka: like one of the specs suggested|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Is that some kind of crack about my declarer play?|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: and 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a mystery to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||
pc|d7|nt|oosmanb: Well done Fisher|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Made it look easy. |pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.  |pg||
nt|desinka: good position of the @Ss but.. no communications.. |pg||
nt|desinka: 10 of @D lies..|pg||
nt|othered1: When you evaluate the light Precision opening, don't forget to include hands like this.  Usual Imp odds on vul games are for making v. down 1.  Down a bunch, even undoubled, change ...|pg||
nt|othered1: them meaningfully.|pg||
nt|desinka: so probably will try to finnesse..the @ds|pg||
nt|desinka: good point!|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps thinking 4@C a splinter?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: NS are not on one wavelenght about 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: S thought cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N thought 5-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wind is swirling   [that's excuse they use in Golf --- why not here??]|pg||
nt|baldjean: It's rare to see such a misunderstanding on that high level|pg||
nt|panosk: a chance to make now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|ritong: would be fine to go down one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||
nt|migry: 2@s would have made, 3@c rates to go 2 down as it will be difficult to guess the 10@c|pg||
nt|ritong: when west doubled 1@c, declarer will have trouble picking them right|pg||
nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: schwartz should be thinking about @sA10xx in 1NT bidder's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to play under the assumption that good things will be  happening.  this contract isn't for pessimists|pg||
nt|desinka: like i said.. 10@D lies..|pg||
nt|desinka: 8@D now.. but it doesnt work|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|panosk: duck of course|pg||
pc|c6|nt|phil: maybe - spade might have been led though|pg||

nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||

mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: I ask because it only happened to me once - the only time I played against Brogeland- he said at the start that they were going to be swinging- I was very impressed and had never ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thought about it before |pg||
mb|d|nt|mrt2000: only joking !!!!!!|pg||
nt|migry: south is shortsighted:)|pg||
nt|ritong: but that does mean he s not 4423  well done chris|pg||
nt|phil: well you are also choosing a winner from 155 teams - in 6 days? |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|migry: a pick up for the gordon team on board 12- NS stopped in 2@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: will South balance here?|pg||
nt|kareno: Possible pass by south at equal vulnerability.|pg||
nt|baldjean: Bertens has 11 good hcp  and 3 trumps as support, but a flat hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nowadays, east's AK-A is an opening bid for many, despite shape|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: W has 2NT bid in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: puts it back|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kfay: They should just play down to 8.  That would be my suggestion.|pg||
nt|kfay: In the swiss.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: this might be messy|pg||
nt|kareno: Just three more boards.  Many thanks to our marvelous operator who has not only done the technical things but also brought the room to life and helped with conventions too.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go, but before my exit would like to congratulate both Israel and OZ Open for their success in this event.  and thank Karen for your companion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Berkowitz after slow pass from Schwartz, you are israeli, how can you pass?|pg||
nt|kareno: It's certainly worth a question to BW, |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 25, Open room in 4@Sxx... :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to you Patrick.  Your words are always welcome!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: yes he does, and it will earn some points for his side|pg||
nt|kareno: They will pick him clean.|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Nice pass!|pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt was the bid in open |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: I like it!!|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't need a natural quantitative 2N raise here, as they open those hands 2@D (or perhaps rebid a forcing 2@C?) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens' option was  1@C=2+|pg||
nt|panosk: if 2nt id invitational my choice wud be 3nt as W hand looks nice to venture 3 nt|pg||
nt|panosk: *if 2nt is |pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: I am sure that it is the right thing to do - it is an agreement which is not apparent from the CC and oppo should be entitled to know what partner knows|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrt2000: GREAT bid from S|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher had the tougher decision about balancing between the two, in my opinion.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|migry: and another good result here, pushing EW to the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi offers his @s3 to Westra|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not critical of passing -- I would myself in almost all systems, even at these colors, just noting that it's not a position that many would take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer seems to have 2 options     1) go down slowly  2) go down quickly|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kareno: Time for clubs later - A and Q of spades for now.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d2|nt|kfay: With the @sKJ making up half my points I'm not very inclined to force partner to play at the 3-level.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|kfay: Same shape with the KJ in either rounded suit I'm sure Schwartz would have done something.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|migry: assuming 4@h shows this type of hand, it was difficult for west to double 4@s|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|migry: especially assuming the spades are over him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess another option   down 1 or down 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why Westra didn't go to dummy to lead towards the @C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: ? he did|pg||
mc|10|nt|oosmanb: -4 likely|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Its boards like these that have made Fisher and Schwartz possibly the best junior pair in the world right now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: If I'm not mistaken they have a couple of pairs titles|pg||
nt|kareno: King and a spade his best shot to endplay south.  |pg||

nt|kfay: As it is I think that Fisher SHOULD have doubled 2@S... but that's easy to say when I can see it works out well.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: on the previous board nunn lead his partners suit so 3nt made for 10 imps to israel|pg||
nt|oosmanb: will be a full game swing if NS play 3NT in the other room|pg||
nt|oosmanb: perhaps it will be duplicated we'll see|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, though the auction can easily be duplicated.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Oz will have to hope the board is duplicated in the Open room|pg||
nt|desinka: so classical 2@C open in Presicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|panosk: minor slam here lets how they deal with it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|oosmanb: Ok I've been told they are current World Junior champs, Euro junior champs AND won Silver in World mind sports junior pairs!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|yuval10: 2@c should be 2-suiter , interesting to see that South didn't double for "support"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: 6@C happens to make, but not a great contract|pg||
nt|kareno: Wow!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz content with his 800 on the previous board, staying out of trouble here..|pg||
nt|kareno: Discreet pass by north.  But 4@h is a decent contract (and can be made with mirrors if no club lead.|pg||
nt|panosk: in fact as cards ly isnt such a gd bet|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|oosmanb: 4@h not a bad contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But he didnt like his K@S and so didnt dbl|pg||
nt|kareno: This is likely to be down one and could be a pickup if n/s bid 4@h in the OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he probably didn't favour the colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+@S, 7+ HCP, maybe longer @D    [1@C is almost forcing]|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kfay: Double partscore swings are really underrated at IMPs, usually.  People talk about gameswings and not going for numbers but the 6s and 7s available really add up.|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably not underrated at this table, I'm sure.  Just in everyday tournaments.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if the declarer will take top @s in the 2nd round and plays @h, he'll due to make his contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Pd didnt have enough to even neg dbl 1@S |pg||
nt|kareno: Another possible pass of a negative double :)|pg||
nt|panosk: on probabilities not double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: any slam but 6NT is doomed here|pg||
nt|panosk: it isnt if you take both major finesses i think |pg||
nt|panosk: decl can discard a @C in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: even 6NT is down because lack of communication?|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D= natural or 0-6 hcp|pg||
nt|panosk: on @HA or @HJ |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @c ruff in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|yuval10: E can play J@d in the 2nd round also, but that'd be tough|pg||
nt|yuval10: and of course declarer can still make his contract by attacking @c then|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll have to guess which Ace does E holds - A@h or A@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Sontag when he saw @SA, hmm, |pg||
nt|panosk: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 5@c should show good trumps|pg||
nt|migry: they don't play 'fast approach"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so I agree with the pass|pg||
nt|kareno: He has a one club opening without the spade king!|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Good point, Oosman.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Looking at E/W leading agreements I'm not sure what the @cQ was all about.|pg||
nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise responses look same as "walsh"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: ok stayed within making range|pg||
nt|panosk: E  showed 3-3-3-4 with 2 controls after 4@C as i was told, thx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kfay: In fact he probably should have played the jack.|pg||
nt|panosk: still needs some attention|pg||
nt|panosk: as like Frederic said entries to dummy are scarce|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: on 32 where Westra found wrong shift at trick 2 -- Dutch playing from North ... but 3@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: On the assumption that with 5@Hs a neg dbl can be even lighter (you can bid 2@H over 2m as a weak 5 card suit), he really didnt think 4@H would be any good. |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|h2|pg||

nt|baldjean: declarer played nicely for a few overtricks|pg||

pc|s4|nt|panosk: not an easy thing to play against the world champions especially after their comprehensive perfomance in BB|pg||

nt|oosmanb: And a @c lead set up a ruff in 4@H too|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: indeed|pg||
nt|kfay: In that case maybe he should have played the J also.|pg||
nt|fluffy: padon made 4@h on the other table the match is very close|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
mb|d|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: DBL is a transfer to 2@c|pg||

nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might win @SQ and play @C to 8|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they play 2@H as invitational here.  Many play it preemptive over a power redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   then only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|panosk: if W on the lead i cant see why not lead @S|pg||
nt|panosk: of course 5 in minors much less worrying |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 39 min playing time left|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||

nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|nt|desinka: 1@D 0+@D 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what a strange hand for west to hold after this start|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: when W took the @cK, Madala asked: sure?|pg||
nt|panosk: "this years pessimism award goes to N - twice"  comment from a fellow spec :)|pg||
mb|1D!|an|5+!h|nt|othered1: But, as they say, 8-card suits are trumps|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|an|15+|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: getting to 3N with no entry to the solid 8-bagger ??|pg||

nt|panosk: gd thing its ending (the year) if i may add |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Quite an aggressive 3@S, but this is best game, I think|pg||
nt|desinka: yes!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no transfer  seems just looking for @S stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W asking how many @hs S promised|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: W: i hope, i have an entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 33 [4@H-2]   the other room  5@C-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N counting the @cs on the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   5@C-1|pg||
nt|othered1: East may try @HJ next . . . |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W leading @sQ|pg||
nt|panosk: natural lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: y but from wrong hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N is playing|pg||
nt|panosk: this wont make either most probably but may save 1 undertrick|pg||
nt|panosk: true|pg||
nt|panosk: minor lead from E i guess then|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N considering his options|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: forbids a @slead from E|pg||
nt|panosk: spade is also probable |pg||
nt|panosk: but not likely to me too|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: must lead something else now, because @s lead is barred|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panosk: again true|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: if @C6 was @C7, i would have bid differently|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: much joking on the table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|panosk: N has all the @H spots so he can afford to ruff 2 spades in dummy and save this cheaply|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|othered1: how 'bout another @H here, since east took the @CA perhaps prematurely?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!s|nt|othered1: Many, maybe most, top Precision pairs seem to have given up on weak NT openings.  I wonder why?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|baldjean: Certainly an unusual result when dummy has 8 top tricks alone. But there was no way to reach it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: do you reopen with south's hand?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: At these colors, how often do you trap?|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: i guess so|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|othered1: It's been suggested that west's double showed 1 or 4+@C|pg||
