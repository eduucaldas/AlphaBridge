nt|vugraphzpf: South has asked for a time monitor, East has taken allmost all the time.|pg||

nt|kfay: Schwartz probably played the hearts the wrong way round on this hand, in my opinion.  It's more likely that someone sitting in 3rd seat at favorable vulnerability holding a heart ...|pg||
nt|kfay: void would find a bid of some sort rather than someone in first chair.|pg||
nt|kareno: They picked him clean.  He could have taken one more heart trick before the door closed.|pg||
nt|othered1: West did have a bunch of HCP and didn't act, which may have affected north's decisions here.  Not that NS's auction gave him much of a chance|pg||

nt|lechcold: ³adnie zagra³|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzpf: he said that too :)|pg||

nt|othered1: East won't be cowed by the NS actions|pg||

mb|3C|nt|yuval10: the Israeli juniors are the cinderella team of this event, they are the current World champions and European champions for U-26|pg||
nt|panosk: i wudnt have predicted that contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 2S is a limited raise or bette in D.  West of curse sign-off at 3D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kareno: With that north hand and unable to pass 1@s with only 2, I would have tried 2@h weak.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south's preempt is fairly strong, but likely tempered by north's limited opening|pg||

nt|lechcold: better to stay low here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: welcome to migry zur campanile|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrt2000: wonder if they'll get to 6@S?|pg||

nt|gracelin: if south does lead a spade against 3NT, when north plays SA, East must unblock SK to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: is it?|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: south found the damaging lead, will declarer unblock SK on SA ?  I don't thk so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: oh yes  :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|migry: the question is how good the slam really is|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 3@D = @s raise - slam invitational|pg||
nt|mrt2000: unless they get to &, that is|pg||
nt|mrt2000: 7|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: 'mildly invitational with not good spades' is now wat R'berg says loudly|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mrt2000: still a make though, I think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: right, and they need to grab any opportunity in sight.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may need to guess D position to make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: They'll need to defend carefully this hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C checkback i think|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, to deny declarer any entry to hand.|pg||
mc|12|nt|mrt2000: although a @S lead from N would be tricky|pg||
nt|migry: was wondering what would be "normal play" on a @c lead|pg||

nt|kfay: isn't worth any extra tricks in a suit contract.  But I could see how it might easily be wrong on this hand if partner has 4 spades since his cards are Aces and Kings, which are a ...|pg||
nt|kfay: little more 'suity.'  I know plenty of people who worry about whether their partner would have a doubleton heart in that|pg||
nt|phil: hi Gerbrand :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has missed a great play but don't blame him.  We are seeng al 4 hands.|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|desinka: wow|pg||
nt|othered1: Whether south's hand is good enough to make a positive effort is determined by NS style of opening.  Here, south rejects both preempting or making a constructive bid|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: 2@d 10+, forsuje prawdopodobnie do 3@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|vugraphzpf: I didnt hear it |pg||
nt|mlodygda83: 2@h z zatrzymania|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@D probably a mixed raise|pg||
nt|kareno: Hm, I would deem the south hand good enough for 1nt directly but we shall see.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton threatened a double if Fisher balanced, so he quickly passed|pg||
nt|kareno: Part scores are the heart and soul of long matches.|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's aggressive unless you upgaded the QJxx in spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: The team that does best on those hands usually wins.  |pg||
nt|othered1: I'm surprised at south's tkaing the middle position, as 3@H (pass or correct) looks more attractive to me.|pg||
nt|april7: this was agood decision by N to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I do.  And I confess to aggressive bidding, especially vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H wasnt alerted?|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree.  Two teams both with average ages below 30 are fighting for the top places in tis event.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: SW that is|pg||
nt|panosk: looks as if it was transfer to @S to me |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|migry: NS play standard carding with a lot of suit preference|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|yuval10: W needs play low @c to signal for @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the atmosphere is very friendly then :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: right, in fact Israel Junior added 6 imps to ledger on the small hands earlier. |pg||
nt|panosk: i can be wrong, i havent fully incorporated transfers in my system yet :) |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|desinka: may be have a 6th sense:):)|pg||
nt|othered1: East gave west lots of room for the overcall here.  A viable style is to overcall aggressively when short in opponent's suit.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: very tough here for E, if he's wrong to play small @d and S has the K@d singel the damage is really big|pg||
nt|yuval10: he might take insurance and cash A@d for -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: note that S played the 6@c over the 3@c ruff , and not the 2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gracelin: Australian players have an average of 28 years, and Esrael juniors are of course even younger.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I've seen a massive amount of imps generated in the slam department this tournament|pg||
nt|kareno: Youth must be served - that is true of at least one team in the BB final!|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: i must admit i never liked that jump bid  but partnerships need a lot of work to come up with alternative uses|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: N chyba móg³ jeszcze zalicytowaæ 3 trefl ale i 5 karo tu nie idzie|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gracelin: West found the most damaging H lead, but when declarer ducked twice, he has not enough entries to establish it.|pg||
nt|kareno: If the slams go all one way, that can have its effect too.  But I stand by my statement.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|nt|fluffy: to make this declarer will need to guess clubs in the end, unless berkowitz is sqeezed before|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: Edgtton and Fisher having a party on their side of the screen|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|kfay: A kib mentions that some pairs have gadgetry available to show exactly 4333 or 3433 distribution.  I think that's usually accomplished with 1N-3M or something like that.  Who knows ...|pg||
nt|kfay: what's actually best but I personally have had a few good experiences hiding information with 1N-3N, when I've decided to be 'modern' and bid that way.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice unblock in @S from Muller|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d7|nt|gracelin: really ? from a redouble ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: yeah, big misunderstanding apparently|pg||
nt|kareno: I know what generates it but I haven't seen one in forever, Patrick.|pg||

pc|c6|nt|kareno: But ... I'm sure he will take his seven and be happy :)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: they play 14-16 all time|pg||

nt|april7: S should pass!!|pg||

nt|kareno: 2nt is apparently club puppet.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East obviously can't bid a natural 2C and needs to use 2NT to transfer to 3C.|pg||
nt|gracelin: if north is thinking of bidding 3D, he sould bid 2D last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not according to the Bermuda Bowl convention card|pg||
nt|lechcold: -3 and flat board I think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|migry: i must admit i would have bid 2@h with south over 1NT|pg||

nt|mrt2000: and I would have bid 2@H, not 1|pg||
nt|mrt2000: on the first round|pg||

nt|migry: better suit, less defense|pg||
nt|april7: 2 down on norma defence|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: if i was tempted to do anything, it would be bid 3nt with south hand|pg||

pc|h7|nt|gracelin: also EW missed their 3H on 9-card fit.|pg||
nt|desinka: @D back|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: mainly because north wont have much outside of spades and hence minor values of use more in 3nt|pg||
nt|kareno: And so he was - east has done his share here.  |pg||
nt|gracelin: 3D  is -2 but no loss against the makeable 3C.|pg||

nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||

nt|gracelin: Australia lost a game swing on the 3NT hand.  Declarer didn't need to find the SK unblock since suth led a H.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: what you would expect at a world championship fina :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: final|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Even if you're more sound I still think this is a 1@H opener.|pg||
nt|panosk: yes gd point :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@C without spade ruff for EW but i doubt they will go there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is perfect example to show how players evaluate hands according to LOCATION of honors|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: its been a 1@h opener for about 20 years :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Absolutely.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 2NT is natural|pg||
nt|ritong: a @d lead might help|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT probably @d's|pg||
nt|fluffy: 2@d is probably a good raise in hearts|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT by West is fine. |pg||
nt|kareno: Well, they have all been Bar Mitzvah so in theory they are adults :)|pg||
nt|ady: Onstein kept low with 26 hcp between then in OR|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzpf: 3@H = 5card@H|pg||
nt|gracelin: need near ouble dummy defense to beat it, i.e. 2 round of H ended n south and spade shift.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice to have the 2@D bid for these hands.  Can get out quickly at 2@H, which most systems can't do.|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu punktów nie zdobêdziemy|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: so now they might play the @d contract from the right side after all|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But your point well taken.|pg||
nt|gracelin: in this field I guess very few players will pass the East hand.|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt is brave enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AKxxx xx xx Axxx is automatic opener|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: tu bêd¹ grali 3nt z drugiej rêki|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ady: 3NT by north no chance though on a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Yeah well, the guy I normally play with bids like it's 1970 so I'm a little behind that.|pg||
nt|fluffy: taking 10 balanced as a non invitational range is the proper way to handle IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: double|pg||
nt|panosk: see how much easier double dummy makes finding the right contract :)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry     Karisruher  kept low in OR|pg||
nt|april7: its a unusual stop in OR at 2@H!!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: as long as he doesnt wear a leisure suit at the table|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, we'll see how this plays out.  South doubles with clubs locked up.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on a spade lead it will be easy to insert dummy's S( and get a 2nd spade trick.  But will West dare to stand?|pg||
nt|gracelin: S9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1/2/3 seat  1N=(13)14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: where the @s's are defended|pg||
nt|kareno: And perhaps looking for a heart lead.|pg||
nt|desinka: yes , but.. |pg||
nt|mlodygda83: myla³em, ¿e W zd¹¿y skontrowac transfer kierowy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: although here, north is known a priori with 2@h and at most 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: which considerably reduces the chance to have the five first @ds to be cashable|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal to win in dummy and start on hearts|pg||
nt|mrt2000: so, is a @S lead not indicates?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indicated|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so, but maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: pard is supposed to hold at least 4, right|pg||
nt|migry: i thought europeans like to lead 3 card suits in these sequences, don't they Henri?|pg||
nt|fluffy: thdefence has to play trumps or diamonds to prevent declarer from discarding a diamong on @cQ and ruffing all spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe no way out at 2-level.  would limit efficacy of the bid, to my eyes.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|ritong: on the other hand, better lead your own suits than the inferred ones with pard, most of the time|pg||
nt|kareno: The game of chicken has ended right here :)|pg||
nt|othered1: anayone know if 2@H is artificial?|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead and @H back and very down you go!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why deWijs didn't DBL 2@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: With that lead, west should make this.|pg||
nt|kareno: e/w missed their best fit for nine tricks.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 2@H = trsf to @S, at 2 level can play only 2@S....2@D-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: West: nice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: yet still, a @c lead and a @s switch looks tricky , if you play 6@d. you have to ruff 2 @h's and you have no entry for the K@c in dummy|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if gosney had avoided the spade lead declarer would still make with help of heart suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Israel has a carry over of 5 imps going into this match, so they really have 14, not 9. Score will be updated for the next segment.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|migry: 2@s is a normal opening with 6 clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm only multi-lingual in bridge languages|pg||
mb|3N|nt|migry: 2@c|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no 3NT now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@s= more than minumum - no 4card Major|pg||
nt|ritong: nor 4@h|pg||
nt|mrt2000: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@d looks like E will take command|pg||
nt|yuval10: after he'll ask for aces and see 3 from Partner ( including K@d ) he can count to 13 and bid 7NT with ease|pg||
nt|kfay: Seems like a pretty good system to me.  I've played in two bronze-medal matches in my life (one courtesy of North-South) and I can tell you they're pretty tough to play.  Although|pg||
nt|kareno: Cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: think they want to get this over with quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6D for NS.  Declarer can afford to lose a trump unless West lead spade to take away dummy's entry for club discard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: which certainly was meck's hope at start|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: unclear about the nature of the 3@d bid, but if it showed and extra then it won't be so tough i guess|pg||
nt|kfay: it is nice to go away with something rather than nothing.|pg||
nt|panosk: and Holland strikes back |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: especially "¿", "CZ" "SZ" "sZCZ".TRZ, |pg||
pc|s6|nt|mrt2000: 3@C is where you'd want to play, I think|pg||

pc|s2|nt|gracelin: Guess they will be there.|pg||
nt|kareno: :) that is|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is a pro-am bid to my eyes, though it may be necessary to make other aspects of their system work efficiently|pg||
nt|ady: 5@S too expensive  at the vulnerability|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrt2000: well done|pg||
nt|april7: now Germany will pick up a few imps|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|migry: in  7 angelini passed a 1c opening and everybody was upset |pg||
nt|ritong: he seems to be allergic to fines|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would probably have loved to ask RKCB right away , but was affraid that 4NT over 3@d would be quantitive, as EW didn't agreed on a suit yet|pg||
nt|fabsayc: another optomistic auction, with red queens onside has a chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: in fact Diamonds are 2-2, so only a spade lead will hold it to six.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|migry: the director was called (again) and not sure what's happenin to that board |pg||
nt|yuval10: therefor the 3@s bid was good in removing all doubts|pg||
nt|othered1: @D lead and choice of plays from dummy give declarer 8 tricks.  Where the 9th comes from is another question|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: and there you have it|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fluffy: 3@s might be already too high if the defence is sound|pg||
nt|panosk: now watch the correct play of this hand|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kfay: And based on the Swiss standings the loser of this match will be the 4th-place finisher.  So if they want some hardware they've got to win here.|pg||

pc|s3|nt|yuval10: not even a 3@s bid by South in the OR stopped EW from bidding slam, when West found a 4@d bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|migry: so for now board  7 was skipped and they r playing  8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 7 scored as a pass|pg||

nt|migry: the board haven't been played yet|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: na drugim stole 5@h, ale po treflowym|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on @C lead  5@H probably down too|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: some of the new technology looks pretty interesting as a monitor|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: they ask BBO operators if there, and players normally call director to watch time|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: wiêc powinien byc kwit|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: West keeps getting these long @d hands|pg||
nt|lesniak: dziwne swoja drog¹ ze Buras nie zagral W kier, tylko blotke|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: overcall or pass with the south hand?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: any good partnership would get to 4@H after a 1@H opening bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@C= Game forcing -- maybe only 2@cs|pg||
nt|mrt2000: sorry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: (when I'm playing and that happens I get really annoyed why they arent @S )|pg||
nt|othered1: Vito picked up 6 more imps on board 6 when EW bid unobstructed to 4@S and went down 2, undoubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the open room also has Voice Commentary   [that is available with link provided earlier]|pg||
nt|panosk: another 6@H here|pg||
nt|lechcold: martwi mnie, ¿e po naszej stronie nie widaæ ani jednego impa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 11-15, could hold 5+@S !!!!!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kareno: 4 of a major depends on either club onside or hearts breaking.  Neither will happen and without mirrors for the heart suit, game will go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: only 14 tricks now though, as opposed to the 15 earlier|pg||
nt|kfay: I think a lot of it is on the honor system and usually players are pretty agreeable about who were the slow players.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: the new techonology is not in use on the tables where bbo is..|pg||
nt|kfay: Also players do call the director as Gerbrand said.|pg||
nt|kfay: I remember Levin calling the director a few times when playing against Hurd-Wooldridge in the semi-finals (or maybe it was the RR).|pg||
nt|phil: most events Ive played in the directors stay in their bullpen - but will occasionally check on things if a table is in time trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I don't like to have short spades either, Oosman :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: OR if the 3@H hand also had 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno: East starting an escape sequence.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and you have tempo to pitch the @D|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but assuming @d lead that's never going to happen|pg||
nt|ady: some might open east hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fluffy: I could tell you a couple of things about honnor in the transnational from a team that played BB, but BBO doesn't let me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no beer card when i was a junior, not even a diet cola card|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however isnt there eliminiation in play|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 2 rounds of @D and what does West exit|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That would work in hearts but not spades. |pg||
nt|kareno: Pass looks good to me.|pg||
nt|panosk: Netherlands (EW) scored 23 imps in last 4 boards|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@C must be long diamonds and 3@S values in spades i think|pg||
nt|panosk: make it 36 imps in last 5 boards|pg||
nt|ady: playing weak jump shifts   so 2@S weak|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrt2000: , I must have had a sense of humour bypass without noticing|pg||
nt|phil: so youre saying players actually LIE about how much time they are taking Fluffy? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: spade.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: near transfer bid:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: well, roland taunting a little  no sweat|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS's problem is to set up the @s suit as the fit first|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Yeah I'm playing 4@H |pg||
nt|lesniak: wydaje sie prawdopodobne ze to przeoczenie operatora|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher grins a bit and says nice about the dummy|pg||
nt|fluffy: no, players don't lie on purpose, they have a different perception on that matter, but they lie about other things|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D some kind of heart raise i suppose, but an unusual one with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: not inviting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  balancing NT  = 10-15|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yuval10: so they can ask for the Q@s|pg||
nt|othered1: I think some play 3@C doesn't accept and allows west to use this sequence on a weakish minor 5-5.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs 1N usually 15-17   [NS weak at favorable]|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@D also make|pg||
nt|panosk: still i think 4@H will be it|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2:  Trivia: You open 1@H showing 5+ cards, your partner has an opener as well with 4-card support. How do you get to 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You can't because you don't play F|pg||
nt|kareno: A diamond lead will let it make :)|pg||
nt|april7: N might chose now 3@C and S then 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W just said they dont play weak 2s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|migry: looks like they are playing board  7 now in the other room so ignore the result|pg||
nt|panosk: ok not then :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: ok -- Now I know that suit said Rodwell -- and a little laugh at the table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H also went down  so board 9 pushed|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @c Q?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fluffy: some do lie actually, but they are a minority, the vast majority on this level of the game are very ethical|pg||
nt|kfay: Any thoughts on the difference between a jump to 3@S and relaying to 3@S via a lebensohl, Phil or Gonzo?|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|fluffy: 3 sapdes vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 2NT natural here   leb not necessary as a passed hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: they made it through easily after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: all laughing. Willenken says this one is vul, we're ahead in the rubber :-)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzpf: so - Board 7 seems to have been scored as a "draw"|pg||
nt|ritong: ok lets move on|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's Birman's turn to lead the Ace...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fluffy: or if not passed before, for me 2NT+3@s is forcing|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So yeah this will make easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver did NOT balance  so Pepsi  1@HEast|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: stormy weather|pg||
nt|oosmanb: He's not falling for that|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|mrt2000: a simple soul like me would play for @H 3-3|pg||
nt|fluffy: sorry I meant 5 spades vs 4 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count/attitude  odd/even discard  Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|panosk: the success of the dutch team in Bermuda Bowl is largely attributed in their slam bidding, you can see now why|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|phil: no strong feelings TBH|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: w meczu najbezpieczniej wygl¹da trefl do 8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i must admit i wouldn't balance with 1N   just not sure if I'd PASS or DBL|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przynajmniej tu trafi³|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: wiêc ma singla trefl, a z punktów wynika, ¿e na 90% jest to figura|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: wiêc zabezpiecza kontrakt bior¹c 3 kara, 2 trefle, 3 piki i kiera|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Lech   VERY close decision in 4th seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another point    many big clubbers would respond with West hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I know I would|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too Yordan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only because there is safety valve of rebid with @HJ9|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: N getting annoyed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i've never played the EW system where 5+@S 5@H opens 1@H   that may create larger fear for deWijs|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: he is a smoker, 20 boards is to much for him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why  Balicki-Zmudzinski  often claim for their opponents :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: they open 1@H with 55 in majors because of relay scheme|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Muller "we still have time"|pg||
nt|lechcold: it's not possible to get full opener's shape after 1@S opening if this includes 55 in majors|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|ady: a better spot than 3@H   as played in OR by south|pg||
nt|april7: its a much better contract then 2NT but still going probably 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: E should take this trickn anyway andlead the Q of @H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|kfay: That's basically how I've played it in the past (4 v. 5 pieces) but since I came up with it on my own I assumed it probably wasn't any good.|pg||
nt|phil: Im not sure you can have all combos of 4 or 5@s, and inv + forcing|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|kareno: Excellent result for Israel.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|migry: looks normal|pg||
nt|ritong: makes south 5350 possible|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Doesnt need the finesse, specially when its presented free|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: the explanation is 1nt response to 1@H is only semi-forcing, so he does not have the option of 1NT followed by 3@H|pg||
pc|dT|nt|oosmanb: elegantly done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither Muller nor any of us ever anticipated east on lead after winning @CQ :)|pg||

nt|lechcold: there are the points we needed:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: the idea behind [reverse] Smith is   when declarer leads his suit at trick 2, each defender can tell whether or not they liked the opening lead  [unless card needed to show length]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: what would you do here?|pg||
nt|ritong: show both majors if possible, then insist on @ss?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: get to 4@S, I hope|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@c = @s-suit AND either @h or @c|pg||
nt|migry: either show spade shortness or clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: I think south will pass.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrt2000: in fact, I suspect it takes a @D lead to beat 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: no mistake|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c was probably a sort of "Drury", and now W is in with a @h and a minor bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: 7NT in the OR as well, good match we have so far|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2NT would've been a weaker hand|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cue bid to show max raise|pg||
nt|april7: E 1NT and then we will see after @S attack|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: na drugim stole raczej normalny wist Kality nie okaza³ siê najszczêliwszy|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: hopefully they have the tools to find the 503 heart fit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: 4nt now?|pg||
nt|yuval10: now S would probably bid 4@s with max and @d support|pg||
nt|phil: 5-3|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, let's say that I would have passed 2@d.  By the way I play 2nt in this auction as a cuebid and game invitational.|pg||
nt|kareno: This will work out just fine for n/s|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, was away.|pg||

nt|ritong: north has not passed yet|pg||
nt|ritong: by large|pg||
nt|migry: what wd u do with north?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: why would N remove the X?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's doing even better by bidding 4@d as there might be a slam going |pg||
nt|yuval10: in the matter of fact, 6@d only needs 3-2 @d's and @s 3-1 or 2-2, not the worst of slams ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: not this day, as 5@d seem to going down as well with 2 @s ruffs ( E is in with the K@c )|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW in the OR didn't get into the bidding, so EW can win a swing here even by playing and going down in a 5@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N still thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: W knows by now that East has maximum 2 @d's ( might suspect even less ) so as far as he's concerned he can make many tricks in @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: i can see him bidding 5@h over 4@s as well |pg||
nt|yuval10: ( or 5@c for the lead )|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: N has bid 4N two mins ago|pg||
nt|yuval10: what are the possibilities for N here? every contract he bids would be to play, save to 5@c perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: but officially we are supposed to enter the bids from one side at the same time|pg||
nt|april7: E should actually go down |pg||
nt|ady: not much on here    2 spades might make with a struggle|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fluffy: looks like they do|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Im curious why West didnt dbl 2@c|pg||
nt|panosk: if you think your pard is reasonable he must have around 7 @C and 6-7 pts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like berkowitz wrote down> 5crd Major|pg||
nt|kfay: E/W, I'm sure, probably have some discretion as to whether they can call an 8-cout a bad 8 (and bid 1@d) or a good 8 (and bid something else).  This is definitely a bad 8.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: and Sontag 5@H maximum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fisher has inferred his partner has spades stopped as gosney bid hearts|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does that show something else|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N shows 3-card support and invites.|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everybody!|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: because he has no clear idea about who makes what?|pg||
nt|mrt2000: if bidding again, I would prefer 4NT from S|pg||
nt|kareno: Again, west is competing for the all-important partscore.  Matches are so often won by an accumulation of part-score swings.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: perhaps its take out of @H's, which he doesn't have without @D's|pg||
nt|kareno: South will make many notrumps on this hand.  Three anyway assuming e/w cash.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Australia has some chance to pick up swing on the 3D +3, and 6S -1 hands, but probably not enough to overcome their deficit.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: trochê niepotrzepnie wstawi³ waleta w drugiej lewie|pg||
pc|h7|nt|migry: me 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: X = doesn't want @h lead i guess|pg||
nt|fluffy: transfering to berkowitz sounds ugly, but I think its just part of the system|pg||
nt|kareno: That could be.  Depends on their agreements.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: A@S on and a @h ruff in dummy is all he needs|pg||
nt|kareno: There are still five boards unplayed but it is asking for a Nickell-type ending to win it for OZ.|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@C, as alerted, was a game force|pg||
nt|april7: N might come up with a X now but S can't probably stand it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fluffy: they probably just play the same when 1NT is weak|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont usually thank dummy but this one is worth a special thanks, just perfect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kfay: I guess they must play something like 3@d=min 5@H, 3@H = max 5@H, 3@s = min 5@S, 3N = max 5@s.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Schwartz has left the room, so we'll wait a couple mins|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yuval10: possible misunderstandning here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: NS chatting 'you should have two without @SQ|pg||
nt|migry: 4NT is double Key Card|pg||
nt|migry: for @d and @s|pg||
nt|migry: with the Q@d being a specific king|pg||
nt|yuval10: anyways they got one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like operators have finished manually entering the scores for hands played during the connectivity problems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live score doesn't seem to be available yet for Round 2|pg||

nt|oosmanb: notice the small/10@h play to keep communication|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't know it yet|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|migry: which doesn't meant that 5@d would have been the final contract given east's shape |pg||
nt|migry: so 5@s doubled looks normal|pg||
nt|mrt2000: yes, it would push EW t|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I have 5@s and a stiff @h -- if thats helps you ---says Rodwell|pg||
nt|mrt2000: to 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Rosenberg answars -- that doesnt help me a lot |pg||
nt|phil: pass of 4@d is useful as  - I dont have a diamond control - you play it|pg||

pc|h8|nt|kareno: (actually the clubs are good enough to stand the pressure.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: That was a loser on loesr play, but what about the next @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: 1 down and 10 imps for the juniors|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kfay: 4@d was obviously a transfer and it led to a pretty interesting situation about how to handle the double.  There's a famous hand played by Fred Gitelman and Brad Moss a year ago ...|pg||
nt|kfay: where they had a Texas transfer auction where Brad redoubled, intending it to say 'you play 4M.' Fred passed and I think the final contract was 4@HXX down a lot.|pg||

mb|6S|nt|kfay: Yeah Gerbrand.  When are they going to give you a full-time job?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and then there were 3 commentators!   willkommen|pg||
nt|othered1: Cna west risk another high @D and get a suit preference?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why would he -- still possible that bertens has @DJxx|pg||
nt|ady: could be the best plus for n/s  would be to pass the 1NT  but has its risks |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: W showing his @H holding to S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: It's always tough when you find a fit but need to play in another suit.|pg||
nt|clinch: Good evening everyone|pg||
nt|baldjean: I think 9@d already shows a suit preference|pg||
nt|othered1: Hand shows the benefits of transfer responses -- keeping the much stronger hand closed with only information about points and @H length|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: surely a trump is right on this bidding?|pg||
nt|fluffy: my partner's would duck @dJ|pg||
nt|fluffy: knowing each other is important :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was unlucky to choose a 3D rebid.  If he had bid 3H over 2S and get a raise, the exclusion RKC may get the job done.|pg||
nt|kareno: South made a good overcall to cost them space.|pg||
nt|gracelin: East does suggest Heart as trumps, but doubt West will accept.|pg||
nt|kareno: And you are quite right.  When spades are raised, then hearts were out of the picture in east's mind.|pg||
nt|kareno: They actually can make seven with the friendly lie in diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: Except for the bad spade break :(|pg||
nt|kareno: (it's very late here)|pg||
nt|kareno: 7@h does fetch.  They definitely need swings so perhaps this is the time for a shot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Don't thk they will bid the grand, just 6H or 6S.  Both will make easily|pg||
nt|gracelin: West just cannot that much in East hand after a 1S opening.|pg||
nt|gracelin: cannot expect|pg||
nt|kareno: I am prepared to wait even longer for this bid than usual|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Hans is curled up with his eyes closed, deep in thought|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no room to learn about @SJ so deWijs just guesses  [well in this case]|pg||
nt|lechcold: strefa szlemowa po raz kolejny przyniesie nam du¿¹ stratê|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kfay: You don't play 3/5, Gonzalo? :)|pg||

nt|kareno: Hope he doesn't fall asleep!!  I have seen even THAT happen in a world championship.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: eventually throws a pass card down|pg||

nt|fluffy: oh right @d7 must be from A875 sorry|pg||
nt|kfay: I know what you mean, but the Ace was marked on this hand.  Wouldn't be so if the @d10 and the @d2 were switched, I guess.  Maybe Schwartz got lucky.  Or maybe Fisher would have ...|pg||
nt|kfay: gone up K anyway|pg||

pc|s2|nt|gracelin: draw two round of trump then test spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, I think it is a good exercise sometimes for a very slow player to play hands fast  - not in a world championship perhaps but just to do it. at other times.|pg||
nt|gracelin: and glad to see the second spade ruffed.|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart to the queen and ruff club when they both follow would be my thinking.  Then spade to hand to draw last trump and proceed from there.|pg||
nt|kareno: That is surely how I would play 7|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe, but in six that line is dangerous if Hearts are 4-1 even spades are 3-2.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S - never 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Personally I would have just blasted 4@H with Berkowitz's hand but he has way more experience with the 2@d than I, and I'm sure he had some really good reasons.|pg||
nt|phil: or - transfer the club threat to E and N is guard squeezed - only if declarer would have unblocked the @s8 earlier|pg||
mb|2S|nt|migry: 2@d = raise in @c |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: 2@d = mixed raise in @c|pg||
nt|fluffy: fisher has a double fit!|pg||
nt|phil: of sorts LOL|pg||
nt|kfay: Likely he was looking for a good slam.|pg||
nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: although he might have checked out with 4@h once partner shows a min|pg||
nt|fluffy: passive leads would make 4@h a make, but there are no apssive leads on this hand, and whatever lead but a trump if continued ends up beating 4@h|pg||
nt|kfay: I don't think it's really emphasized enough that this 2@H bid really shows a very nice hand opposite Fisher's pass.  I've seen a lot of 2@Hs thrown out just because opener is 5-4 ...|pg||
nt|kfay: and that is not a good way to play.  You'll get a lot of punishment.  That's why Fisher's thinking here because I'm sure he knows his partner is reliable.|pg||
nt|phil: especially when partner is already prone to respond light|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Gazzilli  |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not my cup of tea  weak jump overcall with that suit    but should be ok|pg||
nt|ady: west a bit stuck with 11 hcp|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: This is another good example of how the 4-4 plays better than the 5-3 since a losing @d can be pitched on the long spades.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's fine - three hearts and a diamond to lose on a heart lead.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@D not bad but failing. 3NT always makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) nat  b) any 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = nat and weak|pg||
nt|panosk: wc :)|pg||
nt|ady: thats a real gamble|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher: before he puts dummy down, please dont make to much!|pg||
nt|phil: every time I say that my partner doesnt :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: I can see that Hans/Nunn still play their normal game at this stage.  They could take chances in few hands to create swing, like a double here, but they chose not to.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that changes in 3rd/4th seat when responder can never have hand for game force relay|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|mrt2000: no chance here I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this auction 2@H likely not natural although forcing, so fisher choose 3@H to get the shape across immediately|pg||
nt|lechcold: it's not confortable spot..sholud be -1 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again we see where relay structure affects opening bids    in this case, 1N cannot have 5-card major|pg||

nt|kareno: Indeed.  |pg||
nt|desinka: good position of the @Ss but.. no communications.. |pg||
nt|desinka: 10 of @D lies..|pg||
nt|othered1: When you evaluate the light Precision opening, don't forget to include hands like this.  Usual Imp odds on vul games are for making v. down 1.  Down a bunch, even undoubled, change ...|pg||
nt|othered1: them meaningfully.|pg||
nt|desinka: so probably will try to finnesse..the @ds|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|ritong: would be fine to go down one|pg||
nt|mrt2000: likely 2|pg||

nt|phil: seems he will do well by drawing trump from the wrong side|pg||
nt|fluffy: schwartz should be thinking about @sA10xx in 1NT bidder's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to play under the assumption that good things will be  happening.  this contract isn't for pessimists|pg||
nt|desinka: like i said.. 10@D lies..|pg||
nt|desinka: 8@D now.. but it doesnt work|pg||
nt|ady: early club play   this might be 300 or 500|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D,  @H ruff, @D ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @h overruf first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just thinking about declarer plan  looking only at cards he can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: yes that one is reasonable|pg||
pc|s7|nt|oosmanb: He'll take this in a hurry!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strongly recommend that they try to imagine what they would do at the table as declarer/defender  when all 52 cards NOT visible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|kareno: I agree with that strategy, Patrick.  I think you play as well as you can and keep track of the swings you think you are winning and can decide at the end what to do.  You have ...|pg||
nt|kareno: partners who may be having great results and you don't want to throw them away.|pg||
nt|ady: will be 300 as it is provided he plays 2 rounds of trumps quickly|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panosk: duck of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phil: maybe - spade might have been led though|pg||
nt|gracelin: true.  A team should discuss their strategy for various scenario before the last set started.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: E taking a long look at the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: now turns his card|pg||
nt|desinka: agree Ed, but we see the cards.. and we cannot be positive abt this contract :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|oosmanb: Nice careful play wants J@D as an entry|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kfay: The Israelis are running out of real estate fast.  These 32-board matches are just... bleh.  I'm really against them.  But I guess they only have so much time.  Still, I don't see ...|pg||
nt|kfay: why they had to wait for the QF of the Bermuda Bowl et al. to be over before they started.  If they're going to call this a world championship I just don't think a 32-board ...|pg||
nt|kfay: semifinal should be allowed.|pg||
nt|phil: Kfay - no political comments in vugraph please|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Muller hoping Buras wouldn't have an entry to his long @H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: OR   @CK onside|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: if he tries for honor  and 10 hearts in south hand will lose 500|pg||
pc|c8|nt|migry: wow indeed|pg||
nt|kareno: I try to remember that 50 IMPs is only about four to five swings.|pg||
nt|gracelin: D shift to beat 1NT 2, or H shift for -1|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzpf: decl looks in trouble now|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an interesting point - if a pair  agree to "operate" should they announce this at the start|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|migry: not really - he's making it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: has to ruff with the T@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: then AK @h and @s ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: I mean he looks worried at the table|pg||
nt|migry: needs to ruff with the 10|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|gracelin: they should if they really have such an agreement.  But in reality, not heard of.|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know that that is information you need to convey to opponents but Bridge World probably would have something to say.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: going down now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|migry: no idea how he figured out the 3 clubs with west when east didn't even show both majors|pg||
nt|fluffy: if you are worried about 32 board Semis, the round of 16 was 24 boards :)|pg||
nt|panosk: will take his 8 tricks hapilly :)|pg||
nt|panosk: E that is |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: misclick|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: declarer still thinking|pg||
nt|panosk: i think you guessed :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe thinks of endplaying N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that actually does seem better than my 1st guess -- might account for Muller having won 2 more Bermuda Bowls than me  :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sQ|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: i suppose gib found a way to make this but i dont see it, spade shift came in time|pg||

nt|yuval10: will South balance here?|pg||
nt|kareno: Possible pass by south at equal vulnerability.|pg||
nt|baldjean: Bertens has 11 good hcp  and 3 trumps as support, but a flat hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: Nowadays, east's AK-A is an opening bid for many, despite shape|pg||
nt|panosk: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|lechcold: It won't be relay auction:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: W has 2NT bid in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: puts it back|pg||
nt|ady: could be best for north to lead A@S  on that type of bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops   forgot  North is allowed to bid|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kfay: They should just play down to 8.  That would be my suggestion.|pg||
nt|kfay: In the swiss.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: this might be messy|pg||
nt|kareno: Just three more boards.  Many thanks to our marvelous operator who has not only done the technical things but also brought the room to life and helped with conventions too.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I need to go, but before my exit would like to congratulate both Israel and OZ Open for their success in this event.  and thank Karen for your companion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: Berkowitz after slow pass from Schwartz, you are israeli, how can you pass?|pg||
nt|kareno: It's certainly worth a question to BW, |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: board 25, Open room in 4@Sxx... :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to you Patrick.  Your words are always welcome!!|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|yuval10: yes he does, and it will earn some points for his side|pg||
nt|kareno: They will pick him clean.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think alert of PASS is just  "forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|oosmanb: Nice pass!|pg||
nt|panosk: 2nt was the bid in open |pg||
nt|ady: diamond ok   but had the diamond and club honors been reversed  could have been wrong|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|kareno: I like it!!|pg||
nt|othered1: EW don't need a natural quantitative 2N raise here, as they open those hands 2@D (or perhaps rebid a forcing 2@C?) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens' option was  1@C=2+|pg||
nt|panosk: if 2nt id invitational my choice wud be 3nt as W hand looks nice to venture 3 nt|pg||
nt|panosk: *if 2nt is |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure about auction now :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I am sure that it is the right thing to do - it is an agreement which is not apparent from the CC and oppo should be entitled to know what partner knows|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mrt2000: GREAT bid from S|pg||
nt|kfay: Fisher had the tougher decision about balancing between the two, in my opinion.|pg||
nt|lechcold: 7@D ju¿ chyba poza mo¿liwociami pary EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: and another good result here, pushing EW to the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Bocchi offers his @s3 to Westra|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not critical of passing -- I would myself in almost all systems, even at these colors, just noting that it's not a position that many would take|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer seems to have 2 options     1) go down slowly  2) go down quickly|pg||

nt|panosk: decl can discard a @C in 6@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: even 6NT is down because lack of communication?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: should we try a " cooperative" 3@h?|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Good point, Oosman.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kfay: Looking at E/W leading agreements I'm not sure what the @cQ was all about.|pg||
nt|kfay: They lead A from AK below the 5-level unless shifting to a singleton...|pg||
nt|kfay: A friend of mine once told me of his idea that from AKQ ace should ace for attitude, king for count, and queen for suit preference.  But there's not really any way Berkowitz would ...|pg||
nt|kfay: know that Sontag held AKQ here (except for the presence of his jack).|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no advantage to transfers when responder if bidding game is the stronger hand |pg||
nt|ady: not much for the defence here as majors splitting well    should be an imp to Karisruher  |pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: the right spot might easily be 3NT when pard has somethink like @h QX  i m a bit surprised at chris' leap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise responses look same as "walsh"|pg||

pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: 1nt 9-12 1/2nd seat at favorable vuls|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kfay: If Sontag was expecting to receive a s/p signal on the @cQ then Berkowitz erred by not playing the J at trick one.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those live scores currently showing   1) Dutch  1  85  =2) Poland & Germany 80|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kfay: In fact he probably should have played the jack.|pg||
nt|panosk: still needs some attention|pg||
nt|panosk: as like Frederic said entries to dummy are scarce|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: on 32 where Westra found wrong shift at trick 2 -- Dutch playing from North ... but 3@H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how many boards reflected in those running VP totals|pg||
nt|lechcold: 14 I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top 2 teams from each bracket advance to KO for gold medal  lower ranked teams play in lower bracket KO|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: ruff and discard as good as any|pg||
pc|h9|nt|oosmanb: On the assumption that with 5@Hs a neg dbl can be even lighter (you can bid 2@H over 2m as a weak 5 card suit), he really didnt think 4@H would be any good. |pg||
pc|h6|pc|cT|pc|hQ|pg||

mb|3S|nt|vugraphzpf: remind all of you, Israel has 7 imp less!|pg||
nt|kfay: But clearly it's at least somewhat undiscussed so I'm not sure why he'd expect all of this.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so all in all, not a bad board|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: This will stretch for 6@h if e/w have the mechanism for it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S natural, game force|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H so called Junior-jump:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|migry: will it be a @s partscore or a @d one?|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|yuval10: can the Israeli team hold up and "kill" yet another giant? we'll know right away. i believe the 2nd half was due to start 15:40 local time|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not pass with that east hand.  |pg||
nt|oosmanb: "garbage" stayman|pg||
nt|oosmanb: auto 2@S for me, strictly to play|pg||
nt|kareno: South might pass 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might win @SQ and play @C to 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: players|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kareno: I never pass with a six-card suit and a little transferable value|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they play 2@H as invitational here.  Many play it preemptive over a power redouble|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah   then only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|panosk: if W on the lead i cant see why not lead @S|pg||
nt|panosk: of course 5 in minors much less worrying |pg||
nt|vugraphzng: 39 min playing time left|pg||
nt|lechcold: but I hope this won't push EW to grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpf: when will be my lunch break then? (and the players')|pg||
nt|oosmanb: didnt he want to end up in 2@S, if there was no interference from opp anyway|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead|pg||
nt|oosmanb: typical auction would be 1@c-1@S-1any-2@S ppp|pg||
nt|kareno: That was quick :)  |pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: Fisher is laughing at the bidding..|pg||
nt|kareno: Very efficient auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: he's considering using the full 1 hour left to find a lead|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kfay: I don't think the 'error' was really either E's or W's fault.  You kind of win those battles in the off season more than at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: to the WBF for letting BBO broadcast these events, to the spectator, and to my co-commentators (hey thats me)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: :)|pg||
nt|panosk: a few more imps to EW|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kareno: I'll be using it for some sleep :)  |pg||
nt|othered1: passing 3@C wold be quite a position, despite south's inaction at  his last two turns|pg||
nt|ady: needs 4 ruffs to make 13 tricks  so trump lead stops that  and no joy on diamond split   an unlucky grand to fail|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be planning to bid @D later?|pg||
nt|lechcold: which would be made easily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 4@C = @S fit???|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure what trump is, so can't tell what 5@D shows   [don't recall if they play 1430 or 0314]|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1 imps for Dutch?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yuval10: thanks very much for our operator Marc for a splendid job, also to Migry who joined me over this broadcasting|pg||
nt|fluffy: and they played a silly 5@h with @hAK opposite 9xxxx|pg||
nt|fluffy: now they all know 3@h doesn't show real support I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ryszard maybe right --- Muller may get @S right on this auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H looks like Queen ask for @S   so 4N[1430] and 5@D=3 keycards for @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: thoug danger of @H ruff save trick for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS lead 2nd/4th|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kfay: This hand kind of brings up an interesting topic for me and that's what S should do if his hand were AKQx Kxx Qx xxxx|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fluffy: this lead will lead to -460 quickly|pg||
nt|kfay: Well I guess since 1@H could be 4 maybe this is a poor example.|pg||
nt|kfay: But say it guaranteed 5 I believe it's best to bid 2@C in response to 1@H with that shape (4324 and a game force) simply to have a more efficient auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i believe the final 32 boards of this event start at 10:00 tomorrow local time, can you confirm that Robert|pg||
nt|vugraphzpf: looks like 10:30, so as to run alongside the other 3 events. They def start at 10:30|pg||

nt|vugraphzpf: most welcome, I might be back next session|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Perhaps the 1@SX a couple of boards ago had some psychological effect|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Yes, precisely.  But he will get his partscore equity (if any) from this contract.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kfay: If you bid 1@s and partner bids 2@d you have the nightmare scenario of having to force with 3@C and hoping you can agree hearts (unambiguously) by the 3-level.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction  unlikely @H 8-1  but won't risk contract even with all those data points|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: musia³em siê oddalic na jaki czas|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: i widzê, ¿e co nieco mnie ominê³o|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kfay: It's a lot easier just to bid 2@c and be assured you can get your hearts in cheaply later.|pg||
nt|kfay: If partner has 4 spades, he'll bid them anyway and you can still get to your 4-4.|pg||
nt|kfay: OK, exciting match.  Remember that Gordon currently has a 7-IMP lead.|pg||
nt|kfay: Good afternoon.|pg||
nt|kfay: See you, Gonzo.  Thanks.|pg||
