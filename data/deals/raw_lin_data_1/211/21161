nt|vugraphznf: The "best line" seems to be the normal line|pg||
nt|othered1: pitching @S on 4th @C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stc: X told him about the bad break in @h, so he took his chance elsewhere|pg||
pc|sK|nt|othered1: In east's defense, west had acted at these colors in CR . . .|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||

nt|jbennet: odds.|pg||
nt|stc: He needs to cross in dummy with @c for the @H finesse and go down becasue of a @c ruff|pg||
