mb|1D|mb|p|nt|suzanna2: the SA team: J Haffer, P Hudson, P Markey, J Williams, D Cherry, J Horowitz|pg||
mb|1N|nt|richardt: presumably a transfer to @hs|pg||
nt|richardt: is OK...he scored 450 so was a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: and the Vic team: B Jacobs, B Thompson, L Gold, S Hinge, P Hollands, M Henbest|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2D|nt|richardt: will East throw in the towel?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|richardt: This is not the usual Precision 1@d opening 4-card suit promised in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bebechira1: and we lost 11 on the first board|pg||
nt|richardt: both of these pairs are playing Acol|pg||
nt|suzanna2: and the event web site....  http://www.ntba.com.au/ANC/|pg||

mb|4D|nt|cc469: g'day Richard :)|pg||
nt|cc469: note my familiarity with Oz vernacular :)|pg||

nt|richardt: spot on Carl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|richardt: South can tell from bidding that North is short in @hs...makes his 3 small holding look good|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|richardt: this is a bit of bad luck...@h not 4-4 and they found the lead|pg||

nt|cc469: hmm, not sure I would have bid E's hand that way|pg||
nt|richardt: the 1NT seems to have dissuaded further bidding in Spades from East|pg||

mb|d|nt|richardt: 1NT?|pg||
nt|pelepele: SA looking to win after 20 boards ?|pg||

nt|pelepele: was bill asleep ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|richardt: ah yes...3NT by North in OR and didn't get fatal @h lead|pg||
nt|bebechira1: may be tired...they played a lot of bridge i the last week or so|pg||

nt|richardt: NS do|pg||
