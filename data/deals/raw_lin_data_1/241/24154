mb|3N!|nt|santyclz2:  6@s by north makes on any non-@h lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Looks like "serious" nt.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s probably showed 6 cards for them|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, in this case "non-serious"|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|psyck: South had enuf to try even after non serious, now 4@h may show @c cue|pg||
mb|4N|nt|santyclz2:  "Serious" in this case indicates a hand with serious slam interest (rather than q bidding just in case partner has a good hand).  "Non-serious" is the opposite.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|psyck: 4N was also a good choice with a good hand for his prior bids|pg||

nt|psyck: It will all come down to the lead now|pg||
mb|6D|an|..|mb|p|nt|psyck: wonder if 6@d a choice of slams or something else|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Wikipedia entry calls "non-serious" "frivolous 3nt".  I like it.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|psyck: not sure I like it, the non serious 3n is also a pertty serious bid, hardly frivolous :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: 6@d could also have been showing all key cards & looking for grand with 3rd round @d control with south|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I would mean "look at your @ds and bid 7 if  they are better than expected" by the 6@d bid here.  No idea what then mean.|pg||

nt|ady: weak 2 with west|pg||
nt|runnerup:  24 Hcp game makes in @h or 3nt|pg||
nt|othered1: EW should have an unimpeded run to 3 or 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   can ,ake 3NT    but 4 hearts fails on diamond finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|othered1: Maybe west has standards for a weak 2|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so -not makes -is ok -but finess of so maybe 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: The match is played with screens -- SW on the same side|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: west declined to open   maybe does not fit in their cystem|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgx: 3@d = invitational with 6@hs|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: I'm told: EW do not use weak bids :) All preempts are constructive (about 10-13)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: needs a diamond lead to make|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|othered1: It's not at all unreasonable not to play weak 2's (or multi).|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: I agree    play the system you are comfortable with|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he took the extra chance J10 in @d being on -but no luck|pg||
nt|ady: but might now go down 2|pg||
nt|ady: club switch now  and will need to try diamond finessxe to get club away|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: The other semifinal is Team Pharmaservice against Flemming Clausen|pg||
nt|othered1: I think south should be able to read @D spot and avoid returning the suit|pg||
