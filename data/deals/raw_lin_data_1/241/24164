nt|keylime:  As I receive word about the systems used I'll pass that along to you.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgy: only 4 spades was bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As there was some difficulty getting the table connected, this may just be the final contract, not the actual auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgy: no, actual bidding at the table|pg||

nt|riccho:  hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Looks like another 3NT hand here this time in South.|pg||
nt|keylime:  With the nice spade break and A@c sitting right, looks good for some overtricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  2@d = multi, normally a weak 2 in a major, but sometimes, the natural strong NT that in SAYC would open 2@c and then rebid 2NT.|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@h is pass or correct, assuming the weak hand. Our operator will correct this in a moment.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|santyclz2:  Some playing strong nt's would choose that for opening.|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m not sure that I would have passed with the N -hand this looks a bit timid to me|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|santyclz2:  S's 3@h bid shows extras and (in many partnerships) requests q bidding.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|keylime:  Doing VuGraph is challenging but a lot of fun I assure you!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|keylime:  5@s, 4@h, a diamond at least, and potential for a club trick here. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The Open and Closed rooms are staggered so scores will start trickling in.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The aggressive diamond lead will blow a trick, while the passive major suit lead works slightly better. |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|santyclz2:  N may have been nervous bidding 3@ss as a q since it might have been thought support.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgy: p|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|thorvald: Agree, bridge is a bidders game, and even with a passed hand partner some action from north was needed|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west has quite a bit of defence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: 500 is OK if you are sure opps are going to make their 620 |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thorvald: Is 4@h down on a @d-lead ?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H should lose two diamonds and two spades, surely?|pg||
nt|thorvald: I lead @SJ, then it is down|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  4@H makes on a diamond lead if declarer rises|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @DA, draw trumps via finesse and play a diamond yourself|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i wld have thought even then it should be down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2:  eventually you will set up a diamond for a spade discard|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: no, it might make i guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: yes, four trumps, two diamonds, three clubs and one ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|thorvald: But in the CR delarer did not finess in spades, so it looks like 5 imps to pharmaservice|pg||

nt|jaapfr: will they bid 4@S|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|keylime:  The other table started on board 11 so it'll be a few more minutes before we get comparisons.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|keylime:  It is a close game admittedly.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  2@ss could be either @ss or @ss and a minor, depending on their agreements.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|keylime:  The hearts lie nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|riccho:  on the other hand: this 3@s bid is very aggressive bidding|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer just needs to be neat here to bring the game home here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|riccho:  instead now of 4@h -1 E exchanges it to 4@sX-2 or so... not a very good deal|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|keylime:  J@c might be suit preference here.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|santyclz2:  On board 1 N opened 4@ss in the open room as well.  Perhaps the bid is played somewhat differently in Denmarkk than in the USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 2 spades was not alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi Krishna.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr: @D@D down|pg||
nt|keylime:  East's safe exit in spades has caused North some headaches.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough to bid and to make 4@S|pg||
nt|keylime:  You like 3@s there? It's a very prime 15.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2,5@S\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S mb 3nt not 4@S but tough tough|pg||
nt|keylime:  Likewise. If I had a 2.5 bid I'd use it, but I'm hardpressed to bid on with South's hand with ten cards in the minors and not many entries. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The allure of game tho at IMPs is hard to say no to.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the diamond holds the heart play may come quickly here out of fear. |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|santyclz2:  One of the things that we tend to assume (incorrectly) is that "standard" bids are the same world-wide.|pg||

pc|sT|nt|athene: it looks natural to duck this; i wonder what declarer is thinking about?|pg||

nt|vugraphzgx: she is thinking a lot|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  S has another 1nt opening - he should be playing rubber bridge...|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  6@s by north makes on any non-@h lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Looks like "serious" nt.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s probably showed 6 cards for them|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, in this case "non-serious"|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|psyck: South had enuf to try even after non serious, now 4@h may show @c cue|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|santyclz2:  "Serious" in this case indicates a hand with serious slam interest (rather than q bidding just in case partner has a good hand).  "Non-serious" is the opposite.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|keylime:  South's bought this hand cheap enough. 3@c is off 2@d, club, 2 hearts so should be a push or one imp difference between that and 2@h making.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|psyck: 4N was also a good choice with a good hand for his prior bids|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: It will all come down to the lead now|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if 6@d a choice of slams or something else|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Wikipedia entry calls "non-serious" "frivolous 3nt".  I like it.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|psyck: not sure I like it, the non serious 3n is also a pertty serious bid, hardly frivolous :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime:  B1 is a push.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@d could also have been showing all key cards & looking for grand with 3rd round @d control with south|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I would mean "look at your @ds and bid 7 if  they are better than expected" by the 6@d bid here.  No idea what then mean.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|psyck: well done|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The killing lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (they mean)|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|santyclz2:  If the 6@d was offering an alternative contract, it would have been the winning decision.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|psyck: only a slam by South would have worked as cards are here|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  In the matter (discussed in the voice commentary) of whether w should have jumped to game on bd 6, I think it depends on whether e would balance over 2@s with almost any  hand with 5 @ss.|pg||
