nt|keylime:  And away we go.....|pg||
nt|keylime:  As I receive word about the systems used I'll pass that along to you.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks, welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: only 4 spades was bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As there was some difficulty getting the table connected, this may just be the final contract, not the actual auction.|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgy: no, actual bidding at the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  I sit corrected, thanks Michael.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  North will like the intermediate here in diamonds, along with a friendly spade position.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|keylime:  First board of any major competition is an important hand. Bob Hamman, the great American superstar, commented that the first and last hands are the two hands you'll need to focus on the most.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: but here she is happy to defend hearts i suppose|pg||
nt|mbruun: Stiff king is bad news but hard not to make a gametry over 1 NT|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure east had game interest; perhaps was just intending to pass any rebid|pg||
nt|athene: maybe would have given it a try if partner showed spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|athene: interesting auction in the other room; started the same way but then west passed after stayman got doubled|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: maybe that denied a club stop, or maybe bidding 2@H would have shown five|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mbruun: In this sequence I learned a nice trick by the Swedes (Fredin). Pass over the D denies stopper, and now XX from "Staymaner" is a new majorinquiry. The contract shall never be ...|pg||
nt|mbruun: declared by the man with no stopper, so thats why NT-opener now X-shows his major. |pg||
nt|athene: yes, i saw del-monte and bessis have a misunderstanding last year with that sort of gadget|pg||
nt|mbruun: Nice if both players remember|pg||
nt|athene: it went 2nt - 3@C (X) pass and now there was a mixup over whether opener bid majors naturally or switched, to rightside|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h5|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: north obviously felt happy trying to beat 2@H but it should make, just losing three trump tricks and two black aces|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: maybe she should have bid 3@C anyway with the good fit|pg||
nt|mbruun: Balanced hand with good defensive values cant bid 3@c imo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: 3@C would be touch and go; you might make it with an intra-finesse in spades|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: lead low spade from the south hand and you can pick them up for one loser|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: now another club and declarer loses trump control but it does not matter, as north is out of clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h7|pc|cQ|nt|athene: declarer could even scramble 8 tricks by ruffing, cashing the @SQ, crossing to the @DQ, and ruffing a spade|pg||

nt|riccho:  hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Looks like another 3NT hand here this time in South.|pg||
nt|keylime:  With the nice spade break and A@c sitting right, looks good for some overtricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|keylime:  2@d = multi, normally a weak 2 in a major, but sometimes, the natural strong NT that in SAYC would open 2@c and then rebid 2NT.|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@h is pass or correct, assuming the weak hand. Our operator will correct this in a moment.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|nt|santyclz2:  Some playing strong nt's would choose that for opening.|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m not sure that I would have passed with the N -hand this looks a bit timid to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|santyclz2:  S's 3@h bid shows extras and (in many partnerships) requests q bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Doing VuGraph is challenging but a lot of fun I assure you!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|keylime:  5@s, 4@h, a diamond at least, and potential for a club trick here. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The Open and Closed rooms are staggered so scores will start trickling in.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The aggressive diamond lead will blow a trick, while the passive major suit lead works slightly better. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  N may have been nervous bidding 3@ss as a q since it might have been thought support.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzgy: Hagen asking Questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: p|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|keylime:  Declarer immediately going after their ninth trick with the club play - declarer is catering to 4-2 spades here.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|keylime:  The diamond spots work well for declarer if East plays them voluntarily.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: Thank You|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|keylime:  Declarer's still a little nervous - suits could from their eye be splitting poorly because of the early club play by East.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|santyclz2:  2 possible lines.  Ruff 1 @c and lose 1 or (hoping for a possible overtrick) set up the @ss for 2 @c losers.  Either works.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: 3nt from south now i guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mbruun: 3 N seems to be a standardcontract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: AJ will be a double stop if pd has 10xx or the queen; no sense fiddling around|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mbruun: Communications bad. Far from laydown despite the 27 HC|pg||
nt|athene: difficult to play|pg||
nt|athene: you might want to lead a small heart towards the jack|pg||
nt|athene: he might be considering ducking this, trying to make use of the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: one difficulty is that if you do duck this trick, even if clubs are 3-3, a club continuation takes out the entry to your second spade trick|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes, or casually take it and lead !J. This is the way to 4 @h tricks with 9x or 10x in West|pg||
nt|athene: if you do win this trick you are not so well placed|pg||
nt|mbruun: Remains to be proven|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|mbruun: I think my line is the only winning one but difficult at the table, and Im not at all sure its the right plan|pg||
nt|athene: another problem is: if you win this trick, another club cuts you from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: but setting up your second spade trick might let west set up HIS spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: well with clubs 4-2 it is easy for west to continue them|pg||
nt|mbruun: It was a very good lead. Declarer was marked with clubshortage after showing 9 red cards and spadestopper|pg||
nt|athene: yes, leading a suit declarer is short in is often very nasty for him, even when dummy has quite a good holding|pg||
nt|mbruun: @c 6 in E is huge|pg||
nt|athene: ducking the first club pretty much needed clubs 3-3 for sure|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good result in the other room leveling this match at 45 all|pg||
nt|mbruun: NS still has +15 IMPs on board 35-36|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mbruun: Just a prediction.|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might try a diamond to the 9, hoping that endplays west|pg||
nt|athene: aiming to make 2 diamonds, 4 hearts, 2 clubs and 1 spade, even if west avoids ever conceding a second spade trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|jaapfr: will they bid 4@S|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|keylime:  The other table started on board 11 so it'll be a few more minutes before we get comparisons.|pg||
mb|d|nt|keylime:  It is a close game admittedly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  2@ss could be either @ss or @ss and a minor, depending on their agreements.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  The hearts lie nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|riccho:  on the other hand: this 3@s bid is very aggressive bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer just needs to be neat here to bring the game home here.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|riccho:  instead now of 4@h -1 E exchanges it to 4@sX-2 or so... not a very good deal|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|keylime:  J@c might be suit preference here.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|santyclz2:  On board 1 N opened 4@ss in the open room as well.  Perhaps the bid is played somewhat differently in Denmarkk than in the USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 2 spades was not alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi Krishna.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jaapfr: @D@D down|pg||
nt|keylime:  East's safe exit in spades has caused North some headaches.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough to bid and to make 4@S|pg||
nt|keylime:  You like 3@s there? It's a very prime 15.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2,5@S\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S mb 3nt not 4@S but tough tough|pg||
nt|keylime:  Likewise. If I had a 2.5 bid I'd use it, but I'm hardpressed to bid on with South's hand with ten cards in the minors and not many entries. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The allure of game tho at IMPs is hard to say no to.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the diamond holds the heart play may come quickly here out of fear. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|santyclz2:  One of the things that we tend to assume (incorrectly) is that "standard" bids are the same world-wide.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|h7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|keylime:  Open Room is playing board 1 now so compaisons will come in shortly.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mbruun: With no tenaces you might just open 1@d and then jump to 3@d in the next round if you are in love with the hand|pg||
nt|athene: south should be able to work out here to cash his partner's @CA after he gets in with the @DA|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  S has another 1nt opening - he should be playing rubber bridge...|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  6@s by north makes on any non-@h lead.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|santyclz2:  Looks like "serious" nt.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s probably showed 6 cards for them|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, in this case "non-serious"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|psyck: South had enuf to try even after non serious, now 4@h may show @c cue|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  "Serious" in this case indicates a hand with serious slam interest (rather than q bidding just in case partner has a good hand).  "Non-serious" is the opposite.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|keylime:  South's bought this hand cheap enough. 3@c is off 2@d, club, 2 hearts so should be a push or one imp difference between that and 2@h making.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|psyck: 4N was also a good choice with a good hand for his prior bids|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: It will all come down to the lead now|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|psyck: wonder if 6@d a choice of slams or something else|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Wikipedia entry calls "non-serious" "frivolous 3nt".  I like it.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|psyck: not sure I like it, the non serious 3n is also a pertty serious bid, hardly frivolous :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|keylime:  B1 is a push.|pg||
mc|12|nt|psyck: 6@d could also have been showing all key cards & looking for grand with 3rd round @d control with south|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I would mean "look at your @ds and bid 7 if  they are better than expected" by the 6@d bid here.  No idea what then mean.|pg||

nt|athene: just so they get their two aces|pg||
nt|athene: maybe not so important at imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mbruun: At the other table South choose to overcall 1@h after 1@c in East. THis lead to a 4-3 fit but no luck this time|pg||

nt|thorvald: Whats your lead from West Mathias ?|pg||
nt|mbruun: @d J|pg||
nt|mbruun: Partner didnt double 2@c and NS shown a major each|pg||
nt|thorvald: Being passive knowing your fivecard is in decalrers 4-card|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzgx: @dJ has been a good lead several times this session :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: another nasty 3nt for south|pg||

nt|athene: maybe you do the same thing as before, bash out diamonds hoping for 3-3 break and @HK onside|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: hope for 4 diamonds 2 spades 3 hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|c2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: even if diamonds don't break you have some other chances, like making a club and all the hearts coming in|pg||
nt|mbruun: Probably a push|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer does not allow for the slightly bent 1nt opener he might put south with 3-4-2-4 rather than 2-4-2-5|pg||
nt|mbruun: South was seduced by his two tens and a 5c-suit and bid a tough 3N despite of only 15 p |pg||
nt|athene: in which case a spade return would be much more risky|pg||
nt|athene: so, nothing looks very appealing from his point of view|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|keylime:  I wonder if South is nervous. The slight overbid on the 4@h hand, the pushy 4@s hand, and now the ultralight opening.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|keylime:  Remember, N/S has no 2@d weak 2 in diamonds; that is the multi with them.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@c is a nice contract here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|santyclz2:  In the matter (discussed in the voice commentary) of whether w should have jumped to game on bd 6, I think it depends on whether e would balance over 2@s with almost any  hand with 5 @ss.|pg||

nt|keylime:  Such as: 1X-1Y-2NT in SAYC is your 18-19 hand, and so forth.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Clearly, their 2NT opening, since we've seen the multi, is either conventional or superstrong.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psyck: W wasn't interested in anything more opp a passed pd anyway|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mbruun: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Hi Mathias|pg||
nt|athene: double was an alternative, as a passed hand, but he wants to emphasize the good suit, mostly for lead reasons against 3@S i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|mbruun: I would prefer 2 N for ms if I had weaker clubs and a lousy 3c heart|pg||
nt|athene: east might try 3@H now but it's a bit of a gamble|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|athene: if you have the agreement partner will always bid clubs with equal length in the minors then it is not so bad to bid 2NT with 4@D5@C|pg||
nt|athene: not so good the other way around of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: EW are playing for the danish Open Team in Lille in august at the WMSG|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|keylime:  Hyperactive from South in their bidding selection. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|keylime:  Fatigue maybe creeping in for NS, who are playing 4 handed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Will West find a 3NT call here?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|keylime:  Or maybe a pass....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  2 clubs, diamond, at least one trump, and 2 spades for the defense.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|keylime:  And more importantly a blow to the psyche against South.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote for down 2 without an EW game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb DD makes 3nt|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think so too - no spade spots are a killer.|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psyck: could have made a couple of overtricks in 3@d on a cross ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  The equal colors here I think make the choice easier.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If I'm red on white with West's hand in this auction I think about it.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: how to get 11 tr in @C|pg||
nt|keylime:  I would think you'd need spades.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: help from ops|pg||
nt|keylime:  It would for a club game, be nicer to hold just three hearts to the Ace.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|psyck: @hK on 1st @h would have been interesting; then only 1 entry which is not enough to set up @d's & def can attacfk @c's|pg||
pc|c2|nt|keylime:  And the opps are just going to pound hearts|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mbruun: Yes need a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 2@H is natural - but limited to max 14 hcp|pg||
nt|athene: so declarer should be OK even if he gets the trumps wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: ok :) well done north|pg||
nt|athene: now a trump promotion for one down|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mbruun: Well done. South should cash @c a before playing 3rd round of @d|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking if that is right|pg||
nt|athene: for example suppose declarer had only 5-4-2-2 shape, but with better trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: not easy to cash @cA before @d - is it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer covered. I guess NS will get their tricks now. Potential swing for Clemmensen|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: now it might look as though cashing the @CA could cost|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: @d5 in hand - but not played yet|pg||
nt|athene: but given time declarer can pitch a club on a diamond anyway|pg||
nt|mbruun: @c A is the killer|pg||
nt|athene: the trump promotion is right when partner has the @HK or @HQJ|pg||
nt|mbruun: North deserves it after inspired lead|pg||
nt|mbruun: Hw will get it right|pg||
nt|mbruun: He|pg||
nt|athene: suppose declarer had @SAKJxx @HKQJx @Dxx @Cxx in hand|pg||
nt|athene: would it cost to cash the @CA?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think so because declarer would still be able to make even if you didn't|pg||
nt|athene: but if declarer had something like @SAQxxx @HKQJx @Dxx @Cxx - now it is a bit harder; he might run out of tricks if you don't cash it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: now @cA is the first card in the deck for S|pg||
