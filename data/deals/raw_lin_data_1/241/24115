nt|dan_ehh: hello everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Dan |pg||
nt|dan_ehh: hi Hedy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: usually Fantoni plays this event with the player who did best during the week|pg||
nt|hedyg: we seem to have missed a few boards already|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume we are waiting for the opps for round 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2 boards/round and change of opps|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: always a pleasure watching Fantoni|pg||
nt|hedyg: please do remember that this is vacation bridge and not the Bermuda Bowl and many of the players present are less than champions|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: ah, the operator must be entering the scores for the boards that we missed|pg||
nt|queequeg: Hi all :) Welcome to Vugraph Broadcast from Fantoni Vacations in Villasimius :)|pg||

nt|queequeg: The partner of Fulvio was decided by the overall ranking of all the tournaemnts played during the holiday|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H looks right except if they are playing Gazzilli|pg||
nt|hedyg: but the operator didnt alert|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: would be nice to know what is 2@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Gazzilli, Fulvio would have bid 3@c directly then|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: maybe they don't know either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: so 2@d was natural i guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: an overbid|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: Romoli won't enjoy playing this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: after which 3@h was forcing|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 3@s a cuebid with @H fit|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: agree|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that 2@H would be a piece of cake but better than playing 3@s|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dan_ehh: remember that north-south do not have many agreements. probably playing for the first time together|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: S showed a gf hand with @H fit by bidding 2@d and 3@H, 3@s was a cuebid on the way to game. S could not pass, but he did|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
