nt|cc469: hmm, not sure I would have bid E's hand that way|pg||
nt|richardt: the 1NT seems to have dissuaded further bidding in Spades from East|pg||

nt|richardt: NS do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nasty board for N/S|pg||

mb|p|nt|richardt: yes no game making that I can see|pg||
mb|2C|nt|richardt: 1@s must deny 4 card @s suit?|pg||

nt|richardt: it has been pointed out to me that SOUTH (not East) opened the 1@d in the OR...my mistake|pg||
mb|d|nt|ianmcc: must be a glitch here?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: or maybe all responses after 1@c|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|richardt: an IMP or 2 to SA for getting to superior game, but no real damage|pg||
nt|bebechira1: 1 imp or 2? what for?|pg||
nt|richardt: looks like 6 IMPs coming back to ACT|pg||
nt|richardt: their Precision is heavily modified...opening 1@d promises 4-card suit in 1st/2nd, and 1NT opening is variable|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ianmcc: pass would be good...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|richardt: West does better to rise K@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|richardt: getting to 4@s instead of 4@h|pg||
