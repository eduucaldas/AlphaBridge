mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|runnerup:  can you pass-south did here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: west sort of got stuck in CR and east simply took 4@H as a stronger hand.  Yet slam did have a play|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: might be hard to get to a @c contract now?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Now west's prepared (or canape) 1@H gives him a similar problem.  He's taken the low road|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Yes, Roland|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone think that maybe the west hand is managed best by beginning with a pass (my choice)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do, Ed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think this freak is best handled by passing first|pg||
nt|othered1: Well that must be the "ACBL District 4" position, but we may be alone :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think it is a minority even in D4|pg||
