mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sunsamvar: being good patners means they will both want partner to declare|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: thinking they have no vul tenaces|pg||
pc|d6|nt|thorvald: A small difference in the rebid from south at the 2 tables, I think i prefre the 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|mbruun: 2 d! is preferable to a NT bid looking at two little h!|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wouldn't 2@S show 3 cards Thor ?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2@s would show double, with 3-card support and 10-12 you bid 3@h in the first round|pg||
nt|mbruun: 2@s could easily be Hx with no @h stopper and 10-11 points|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|mbruun: With xx in @s and a strong @h holding 2 NT seems to be the best bid for me|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sunsamvar: how would they bid game going hands with 3 @Ss then ?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mbruun: FS and @s supp|pg||
nt|thorvald: A jump to 3@s in the 2nd round is forcing and 3-card support|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mbruun: But agreed, some players have methods to show inv. with 3@s to release 3 in partners suit as GF for an intelligent way of dieciding whether to go for slam or not   |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|mbruun: 1@s - 3@h to show 10-12 with 3c as Thorvald describes is a good way to take out these hands |pg||

nt|keylime:  As I receive word about the systems used I'll pass that along to you.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgy: only 4 spades was bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As there was some difficulty getting the table connected, this may just be the final contract, not the actual auction.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|keylime:  First board of any major competition is an important hand. Bob Hamman, the great American superstar, commented that the first and last hands are the two hands you'll need to focus on the most.|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgx: yes -- and a strong nt included|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgx: 3@h = transfer to @s|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzgx: 3nt = double @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|thorvald: Here i prefer 2 accept with double and bid 3NT with support (and retransfer), but its probably just a matter of style|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mbruun: Advantage of only accepting the Transfer with fit is, that @s is now settled, so responder have possibility of showing balanced slaminvitational+ with 3N, or give a Splinter in 4 ...|pg||
nt|mbruun: any|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|sunsamvar: N/S should make atleast 11 and so sopen their account|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|thorvald: Houmøller dont know @spades are running, so he is trying to develop som @c-tricks|pg||
nt|mbruun: If accept is mandatory, 2 N - 3 @h, 3@s - 4x is natural. Some might reserve 4@h to be slammy with spades but it complicates the auction. You should only play this way facing a 20+ ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|keylime:  Looks like another 3NT hand here this time in South.|pg||
nt|keylime:  With the nice spade break and A@c sitting right, looks good for some overtricks.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|keylime:  2@d = multi, normally a weak 2 in a major, but sometimes, the natural strong NT that in SAYC would open 2@c and then rebid 2NT.|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@h is pass or correct, assuming the weak hand. Our operator will correct this in a moment.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Some playing strong nt's would choose that for opening.|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  S's 3@h bid shows extras and (in many partnerships) requests q bidding.|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|keylime:  Doing VuGraph is challenging but a lot of fun I assure you!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  5@s, 4@h, a diamond at least, and potential for a club trick here. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The Open and Closed rooms are staggered so scores will start trickling in.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The aggressive diamond lead will blow a trick, while the passive major suit lead works slightly better. |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|santyclz2:  N may have been nervous bidding 3@ss as a q since it might have been thought support.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzgy: Hagen asking Questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: p|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer immediately going after their ninth trick with the club play - declarer is catering to 4-2 spades here.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|keylime:  The diamond spots work well for declarer if East plays them voluntarily.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzgy: Thank You|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer's still a little nervous - suits could from their eye be splitting poorly because of the early club play by East.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz2:  2 possible lines.  Ruff 1 @c and lose 1 or (hoping for a possible overtrick) set up the @ss for 2 @c losers.  Either works.|pg||

nt|mbruun: Right|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzgx: 2@d = both majorss|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: majors|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: good result for e/w in closed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|thorvald: I did go down on a @d ruff|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|sunsamvar: easy to draw trumps isnt it... why give the @D ruff|pg||
nt|mbruun: Helping declarer with the @h handling might give declarer 10 tricks |pg||
nt|mbruun: Getting endplayed in hand to give away two @hs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|thorvald: It looked very natural to go down, after club and spade switch, now there is 4 loosers if giving up the @d|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mbruun: After a @s switch the winning line is to play for @hq onside. Play a @h at trick three, draw trumps and enter the dummy on a diamond to repeat the @h finesse|pg||

nt|jaapfr: will they bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  The other table started on board 11 so it'll be a few more minutes before we get comparisons.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime:  It is a close game admittedly.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  2@ss could be either @ss or @ss and a minor, depending on their agreements.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|keylime:  The hearts lie nicely for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer just needs to be neat here to bring the game home here.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|keylime:  J@c might be suit preference here.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|santyclz2:  On board 1 N opened 4@ss in the open room as well.  Perhaps the bid is played somewhat differently in Denmarkk than in the USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 2 spades was not alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi Krishna.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|jaapfr: @D@D down|pg||
nt|keylime:  East's safe exit in spades has caused North some headaches.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough to bid and to make 4@S|pg||
nt|keylime:  You like 3@s there? It's a very prime 15.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2,5@S\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S mb 3nt not 4@S but tough tough|pg||
nt|keylime:  Likewise. If I had a 2.5 bid I'd use it, but I'm hardpressed to bid on with South's hand with ten cards in the minors and not many entries. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The allure of game tho at IMPs is hard to say no to.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the diamond holds the heart play may come quickly here out of fear. |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz2:  One of the things that we tend to assume (incorrectly) is that "standard" bids are the same world-wide.|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|santyclz2:  S has another 1nt opening - he should be playing rubber bridge...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|santyclz2:  6@s by north makes on any non-@h lead.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Looks like "serious" nt.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s probably showed 6 cards for them|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, in this case "non-serious"|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|psyck: South had enuf to try even after non serious, now 4@h may show @c cue|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz2:  "Serious" in this case indicates a hand with serious slam interest (rather than q bidding just in case partner has a good hand).  "Non-serious" is the opposite.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|keylime:  South's bought this hand cheap enough. 3@c is off 2@d, club, 2 hearts so should be a push or one imp difference between that and 2@h making.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|psyck: 4N was also a good choice with a good hand for his prior bids|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: It will all come down to the lead now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if 6@d a choice of slams or something else|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Wikipedia entry calls "non-serious" "frivolous 3nt".  I like it.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|psyck: not sure I like it, the non serious 3n is also a pertty serious bid, hardly frivolous :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime:  B1 is a push.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@d could also have been showing all key cards & looking for grand with 3rd round @d control with south|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I would mean "look at your @ds and bid 7 if  they are better than expected" by the 6@d bid here.  No idea what then mean.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: well done|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The killing lead...|pg||
