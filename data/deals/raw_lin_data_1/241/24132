nt|hedyg: even by a passed hand?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jron: but in MP slow bidding gives away a lot. I like her choice after partners original pass. |pg||
mc|8|nt|jron: MP is a dirty game at times|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably the right play here is two top clubs, then the @d finesse. Techically right but practically wrong|pg||
