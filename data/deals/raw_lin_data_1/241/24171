nt|keylime:  And away we go.....|pg||
nt|keylime:  As I receive word about the systems used I'll pass that along to you.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|mb|3H|nt|santyclz2:  Hi folks, welcome from the beautiful Poconos.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: only 4 spades was bid|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  As there was some difficulty getting the table connected, this may just be the final contract, not the actual auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgy: no, actual bidding at the table|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Welcome to Anders Sigsgaard|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you are short of entries to set up spades so the defence should not panic|pg||
nt|asig:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Hi Anders -- winner of the Danish Mix Pairs Championship -- isnt he?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|runnerup:  5 @c looks a good save here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|asig:  Yes, really happy :)|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzgx: congrats :)|pg||
nt|asig:  thx|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: hard for south to sacrifice with so many defensive cards |pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|asig:  4@c would have been a nice bid by N|pg||
nt|athene: north not prepared to venture the 4-level facing a passed hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: with only a 5-3 spade fit and no guaranteed club fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig:  No, that sounds reasonable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: also after the splinter, it looks as though spades are 4-1, so 4@SX might be quite expensive if that is where you have to go over 4@C|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @c is much better|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||

nt|riccho:  hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Looks like another 3NT hand here this time in South.|pg||
nt|keylime:  With the nice spade break and A@c sitting right, looks good for some overtricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|keylime:  2@d = multi, normally a weak 2 in a major, but sometimes, the natural strong NT that in SAYC would open 2@c and then rebid 2NT.|pg||
nt|keylime:  2@h is pass or correct, assuming the weak hand. Our operator will correct this in a moment.|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|3C!|nt|santyclz2:  Some playing strong nt's would choose that for opening.|pg||
nt|riccho:  IÂ´m not sure that I would have passed with the N -hand this looks a bit timid to me|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|santyclz2:  S's 3@h bid shows extras and (in many partnerships) requests q bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  Doing VuGraph is challenging but a lot of fun I assure you!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgy: no |pg||
mb|p|pc|c5|nt|keylime:  5@s, 4@h, a diamond at least, and potential for a club trick here. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The Open and Closed rooms are staggered so scores will start trickling in.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The aggressive diamond lead will blow a trick, while the passive major suit lead works slightly better. |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|santyclz2:  N may have been nervous bidding 3@ss as a q since it might have been thought support.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzgy: Hagen asking Questions|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: p|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|keylime:  Declarer immediately going after their ninth trick with the club play - declarer is catering to 4-2 spades here.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|keylime:  The diamond spots work well for declarer if East plays them voluntarily.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: Thank You|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h6|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|keylime:  Declarer's still a little nervous - suits could from their eye be splitting poorly because of the early club play by East.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
mc|10|pg||
qx|o39|st||md|1SQ4H873DQ63CQ7632,SAKJTHQT64DAK9CA8,S9652HJ2DT87CJT95,S873HAK95DJ542CK4|sv|b|nt|asig:  He was hoping that declarer needed another heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|asig:  Loosing - and then, spade to the king and a diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgx: 2nt here is 22-23hcp|pg||
nt|asig:  Decent slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: I guess E wil not stop before slam now|pg||
nt|athene: once the trumps come in you need the spade finesse or the double diamond finesse i suppose|pg||
nt|thorvald: 2 NT 21-22 or 22-24 ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but 21 only -so upraded ?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  graded|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  22-23 he shows|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 2nt = 22-23|pg||
nt|athene: yes i think west is worth more than just the 21|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|athene: with all those tens and aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|asig:  With trumps 3-2, there are two chances;  @sQ onside or !Q dropping|pg||
nt|athene: and honour combinations|pg||
mb|4D|nt|asig:  @dQ even|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you lose to the @SQ you need to bring in the diamonds for no loser|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: i think double finesse better than @DQx, but you might be a bit short of entries to east?|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|thorvald: Natural bidders - 6 @H even with an upgraded hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  a long way to tippe..or to rigth slam|pg||
nt|athene: interesting methods here; maybe 3@S forced 3NT and then east went into a sort of Baron sequence i.e. showing 4-card suits upwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 4@d wasnt alerted - and neither 4@h |pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  6 @h is much better than 6 nt -and done |pg||
mb|p|nt|asig:  I think 5@h agrees hearts and shows 2 aces and denies @hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: My reliable source tells that 3nt denies minimum and 4333|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 4@d natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 4@h natural|pg||
nt|athene: yes could be - you mean over 4@H, 4@S and 4NT would be natural, and higher are RKCB responses in hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: and 5@h 2 aces without @hQ|pg||
nt|asig:  With 4333 and minimum, opener responds 4NT|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|smoller:  @DQ 3rd with North (after elimination of clubs, and even queen  4th North plus Q@S South). Not good with @DQ 4th South and garded @SQ South|pg||

nt|jaapfr: will they bid 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|keylime:  The other table started on board 11 so it'll be a few more minutes before we get comparisons.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  It is a close game admittedly.|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|santyclz2:  2@ss could be either @ss or @ss and a minor, depending on their agreements.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|keylime:  The hearts lie nicely for declarer|pg||
nt|riccho:  on the other hand: this 3@s bid is very aggressive bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer just needs to be neat here to bring the game home here.|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|riccho:  instead now of 4@h -1 E exchanges it to 4@sX-2 or so... not a very good deal|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D!|nt|keylime:  J@c might be suit preference here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  On board 1 N opened 4@ss in the open room as well.  Perhaps the bid is played somewhat differently in Denmarkk than in the USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgy: 2 spades was not alerted|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Hi Krishna.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|jaapfr: @D@D down|pg||
nt|keylime:  East's safe exit in spades has caused North some headaches.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough to bid and to make 4@S|pg||
nt|keylime:  You like 3@s there? It's a very prime 15.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2,5@S\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: S mb 3nt not 4@S but tough tough|pg||
nt|keylime:  Likewise. If I had a 2.5 bid I'd use it, but I'm hardpressed to bid on with South's hand with ten cards in the minors and not many entries. |pg||
nt|keylime:  The allure of game tho at IMPs is hard to say no to.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If the diamond holds the heart play may come quickly here out of fear. |pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  One of the things that we tend to assume (incorrectly) is that "standard" bids are the same world-wide.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|3C!|nt|runnerup:  south has something to say too|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|asig:  Yes, I don't think he is done yet|pg||
nt|asig:  Wrong :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Dennis had the 4@h bid in hand -- but put it down in his biddingbox again - and starts thinking|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  lets start 1@s -p-1nt -3 or 4 @d then|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thorvald: How would you play 6@h on a @h -lead ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  3@C shows a good hand. They play good/bad 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: I wouldnt like too :)|pg||
nt|smoller:  Diamond cue probably shows 5-3-0-5|pg||
nt|thorvald: @C i mean|pg||
nt|athene: diamond lead makes 6@H not trivial i think also|pg||
nt|athene: if you try to ruff all the diamonds you might lose trump control|pg||
nt|athene: since you have to ruff so many spades back to hand|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h8|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: as it happens you are ok because even if you run out of trumps, north has nothing left but clubs in the ending|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.freewebs.com/bobbybridge/conventions/weakmustspeak.htm  is a link to the good/bad 2NT convention|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: this sort of play is often the best way to tackle these hands|pg||
nt|asig:  Good play (in 4@h)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if south bids 4 @d -on 1. round -east must raise his hair to bid 4 @h -or is there west who bids and what -ofcourse is north has no support 4 @d is wholy  wrong |pg||
nt|asig:  Maintaining trump control while setting up the side suit|pg||
nt|athene: concede your side suit loser whilst you have trumps in dummy to stop the weak suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|santyclz2:  S has another 1nt opening - he should be playing rubber bridge...|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  6@s by north makes on any non-@h lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Looks like "serious" nt.|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s probably showed 6 cards for them|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Or, in this case "non-serious"|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|psyck: South had enuf to try even after non serious, now 4@h may show @c cue|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz2:  "Serious" in this case indicates a hand with serious slam interest (rather than q bidding just in case partner has a good hand).  "Non-serious" is the opposite.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|keylime:  South's bought this hand cheap enough. 3@c is off 2@d, club, 2 hearts so should be a push or one imp difference between that and 2@h making.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck: 4N was also a good choice with a good hand for his prior bids|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: It will all come down to the lead now|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|psyck: wonder if 6@d a choice of slams or something else|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The Wikipedia entry calls "non-serious" "frivolous 3nt".  I like it.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: not sure I like it, the non serious 3n is also a pertty serious bid, hardly frivolous :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  B1 is a push.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: 6@d could also have been showing all key cards & looking for grand with 3rd round @d control with south|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  I would mean "look at your @ds and bid 7 if  they are better than expected" by the 6@d bid here.  No idea what then mean.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|psyck: well done|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The killing lead...|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (they mean)|pg||

nt|runnerup:  1nt was down when west was in with @h 10 -but +3 was the result |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: that 2@C overcall is not to everyone's taste, at these colours|pg||

nt|thorvald: The first ruff will be west, so he should move TO 4@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|keylime:  Remember, N/S has no 2@d weak 2 in diamonds; that is the multi with them.|pg||
nt|riccho:  6@c is a nice contract here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|santyclz2:  In the matter (discussed in the voice commentary) of whether w should have jumped to game on bd 6, I think it depends on whether e would balance over 2@s with almost any  hand with 5 @ss.|pg||

nt|psyck: would it be a lebensohl situation if E decides to bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: cr.....=creative:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psyck: that would depend on the methods against Multi...|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  For those kibbing, discuss with your partner what is called the NT ladder.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|keylime:  This means that you should know your NT ranges not only when you open but when opener rebids.|pg||
nt|riccho:  NS needs to cash their aces immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I'm told leb for them here, so this is a better 3@d hand than via 2n|pg||
mb|4D|nt|santyclz2:  For me it would be a lebensohl since s bid @ss, but not if he bid @hs.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Such as: 1X-1Y-2NT in SAYC is your 18-19 hand, and so forth.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Clearly, their 2NT opening, since we've seen the multi, is either conventional or superstrong.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: W wasn't interested in anything more opp a passed pd anyway|pg||
mb|4N|nt|keylime:  Just over an hour into the segment so pace of play not a problem.|pg||
nt|keylime:  About seven minutes a board currently.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|mc|12|nt|psyck: some have bids to show takeout of @h or @s immediately on 2@d|pg||

nt|vugraphzgx: hi Markku|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: and welcome to the last 12 boards of this final in the Open Team event|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: here from the Danish Bridge Festival 2012|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: 18 teams started playing monday in a round robin|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ns has points but ew has @s so maybe 2 @s here -if they can come in bidding |pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: after 17 round of 8 boards the 8 best placed teams played a quarterfinal - and then a semifinal yesterday|pg||
nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzgx: there was not much "extra"|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|keylime:  Hyperactive from South in their bidding selection. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|keylime:  Fatigue maybe creeping in for NS, who are playing 4 handed.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|keylime:  Will West find a 3NT call here?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|keylime:  Or maybe a pass....|pg||
nt|jaapfr: pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  2 clubs, diamond, at least one trump, and 2 spades for the defense.|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  And more importantly a blow to the psyche against South.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i vote for down 2 without an EW game|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb DD makes 3nt|pg||
nt|keylime:  I think so too - no spade spots are a killer.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|psyck: could have made a couple of overtricks in 3@d on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|keylime:  The equal colors here I think make the choice easier.|pg||
nt|keylime:  If I'm red on white with West's hand in this auction I think about it.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: how to get 11 tr in @C|pg||
nt|keylime:  I would think you'd need spades.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: help from ops|pg||
nt|keylime:  It would for a club game, be nicer to hold just three hearts to the Ace.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: @hK on 1st @h would have been interesting; then only 1 entry which is not enough to set up @d's & def can attacfk @c's|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime:  And the opps are just going to pound hearts|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the light 1@H |pg||

nt|athene: lots of high cards but no fit|pg||
nt|athene: you can make 6nt; not sure whether you should|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: it can't hurt to play on spades early|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then once you get 3 spade tricks you probably don't need to guess hearts as north will get squeezed in hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  yhe problems are the entryes to play @s from east twice no clear entryes for that|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: remember this is the last board to be played in the closed room -- |pg||
nt|athene: you might start with the first spade from the west hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: might be a swing?|pg||
nt|athene: lead small to the 9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup:  yes dd -but then north has K|pg||
nt|athene: lead small to the 9 and then finesse back through south if you lose to the jack, that is not so much worse than the double finesse anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so it is quite appealing if entries to east are limited|pg||
