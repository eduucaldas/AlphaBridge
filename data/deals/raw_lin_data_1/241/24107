pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: yes true    4 heart tricks  wont need heart finesse  |pg||
nt|ady: club finesse rather|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panosk: tempting to finess @H to throw losing @C|pg||
nt|sverjohn: I am sure Holm hoped for a black suit from pd|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But this should also make thx to the Kx in clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|oliverc: right-sided, too|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam @s or @d?|pg||
nt|knutte: Looks like Heimdal, Bergen and Kristiansand will settle for the medals|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|panosk: W pass?|pg||
nt|panosk: thats is true so usually is the hand with most points if no stopper issues involved|pg||
nt|panosk: past results and standings here  http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||

mb|4C|nt|ralfwil: in 6@d declarer can go wrong, but not in 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @D layout dicey:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Played by N-yes.|pg||
nt|panosk: cant see how to avoid game here |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: in this event, every bridgeclub can start with as many team as they are able to get toghether, then it is knockout rounds untill 7 teams is remaining, then then 7 teams remaining ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: plus the host of the event will get a place in the final. Where every team play eachother, very popular event to join for every player|pg||

pc|c8|nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|panosk: cover no cover the same|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|geot: 1 IMP til Heimdal, men mer må til. Mer må til for begge lag. Tromsø er etter medalje om de kan knuse Heimdal her. For Heimdal kan det bli alt eller intet|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s   have game in hearts|pg||
nt|panosk: last board was a very gd example of playing carefully|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: might make 3NT now, need to find the Q of @d it seems|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: though it  may be snags|pg||
nt|mamos:  is this a two suiter?|pg||
nt|knutte: 4 @S makable NS|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing the 2nd @d was a mistake|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: on a @h lead that is|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bobholl: better X or 1NT ?|pg||
nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: i like X with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|grebrof: some text went missing :)|pg||
nt|panosk: lets see how gd they are with finding Queens now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: lead is very reasonable if you cant see all cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|murat e: 3 hearts surely bid by west as a transfer bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+2@H+3@D+2@C=9 and @S hook can provide the 10th trick.|pg||
nt|murat e: or a single and choose contract bid we dont know|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: i would double too but 3 nt won't make i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: with doubleton @D better|pg||
nt|ybob: 3@C the best spot to E-W|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ugly - slam decent but the red suits do them in|pg||
nt|mamos:  wow  game is certainly close|pg||
nt|panosk: a more observant fellow spec suggested that if S plays low spade in 2nd trick E will not make|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if south did not open 3 nt from west is good on a heart lead but that is gone|pg||
nt|knutte: Just as my tricks sometimes does :)|pg||
nt|knutte: Good bidding by NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: sory it was as it is here|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: what to lead? @s of @H?|pg||
nt|panosk: thats also true, spade lead gives him more chances to make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @s lead gives the oportunity to make 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Will make now as A of @H in front|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panosk: 9@H shud be in dummy :) |pg||
pc|c6|nt|ybob: now @D lead defeat it|pg||
nt|ybob: not hard i think ...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: there is 3 definatge losers in spade and spade ruff   and a trump trick  and will have to cope with the bad diamond split|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|oliverc: Burns Law violation in progress :)|pg||
nt|panosk: must duck|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: South will think this well trough, got a very "compy" lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|panosk: today's schedule has only 1 and a half match in line, so just 48 boards to be played|pg||
nt|panosk: piece of cake compared to 80 boards played yesterday|pg||
pc|s3|nt|knutte: Not much points but nice layout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: now club switch    but may still make on an end play|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|murat e: 2 dia maybe showed both majors|pg||
nt|rnmalik: To think of yes plausible.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|panosk: even that wudnt be enough |pg||
nt|mamos:  i think looking at the nS hands youd want to b e in 4@s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @h lead isn´t my lead as W. @cQ or @cJ depending on leads. Why? the shorter suit has more odds for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|murat e: this hand shows how important to open the bidding when the suit is good without jack of clubs it is 11 hcp must still open at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: now should be down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gsper:  Ekrens, popular in Norway though Ekren does no longer play it|pg||

nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Goran Sperber|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzhc: Nice try by PIL|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panosk: maybe double dummy can make, 2 rounds of trumps, pull 3@H to throw loser in @C and thrn A@D and @D to 10|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|panosk: @H lead asks less points from pard, @S asks less and it doesnt give away a trick,  dont know, spade i think for me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos:  and as the cards lie @cQ would have beaten 4@s|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ralfwil: yes! but also the natural lead for me|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: also the more solid....|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: cannot make now|pg||
nt|ady: I cannot see any winning line|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|panosk: S asking for @C with 4@H|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|panosk: when i lead @H in such occasions dummy always 4 with honor and 10|pg||

nt|panosk: nice hands |pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: similar trump suit|pg||
nt|ady: was a case for playing ace of spades first round    but as it went needed to play K@C   first round  draw trump and exit with a club    either defender is end played|pg||
nt|ady: part score in sspades for e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you agree?|pg||
nt|panosk: anyway another gd result for Tromps|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 1st segment was very exciting, this will be too|pg||
nt|murat e: yes but previous board maybe bidding was different at the table....|pg||
nt|panosk: i think W have doubled 2@H |pg||
nt|ybob: thx all :)|pg||
nt|panosk: open to suggestions for East's bid :)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rnmalik: hi & wlc.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Apart from that I understand that bidding is fairly standard on both sides|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT on 19 is expert practice, usually described as upgrading to 20|pg||
nt|murat e: here north has too much property on spades which does not suit south if he was thinking about a dia slam|pg||
nt|murat e: ty bye|pg||
nt|ybob: bye|pg||
nt|panosk: 21C majors obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: if partner bidding volunterely at five level vulnerable how did west pass|pg||
nt|panosk: *2@C|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bobholl: poor north difficult choice|pg||
nt|mamos:  yes i do agree  you cannot expect to make many @h tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The best use of the green card.|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: 9 tricks in @S EW at the most, NS might make 4 @D|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gsper:  Sensible. Few pairs have good methods for minor slams after 2NT opening.|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have a fortunate 4 hearts    but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 spades|pg||
nt|knutte: For res: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/1916/2012-05-25-28.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos:  this is solid|pg||
nt|panosk: thats declares 9th trick|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess 2NT is lebensohl and than he guessed well|pg||
nt|ady: 4 spades down if clubs attacked early before diamond set up|pg||
nt|panosk: *declarer's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: add the 9 of hearts to E/W  then 4 spades around 75 percent|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not like many Norwegian pairs playing 2@c as either GF or just a nice suit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|murat e: normally after 2 nt 3 sp is transfer to 3 nt after which responder bids his minor to show slam interest|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone else for "Pass" with the West hand?|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S make but impossible to find, i'd personally venture a 3@C bid in case pard has 6-4 with cubs second suit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2/1 gf unless 2/1 suit rebid in next round of bidding, then it showed only a good suit|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W here play it as GF|pg||

pc|s9|nt|panosk: not me Oliver sorry , not of that disposition in life :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|oliverc: Must be the Aegean sun :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: defending 4 spades  may not be clear  how to defend after cashing A@H unless south casn give a suit preference signal|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Looks like 9 tricks could be the limit here. Actually not unreasonable to get to game|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@c probably weakish, 3NT would be serious slam try|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gsper:  Is that standard in Norway, KÃ¥re?|pg||
nt|murat e: but south instead of taking an adventure made a sensible bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can make 6 on any lead, same play. Am I right?|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems so to me too.|pg||
nt|andersk: hi|pg||
nt|ady: also a good chance of 10 tricks if the K@C was woth north    may be able to play a club towards the queen  and create a discard of a heart later|pg||
nt|knutte: Bergen gained 11 imp at board 17 |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Live update every 4th board from all the other matches|pg||
nt|baldjean: 11 tricks always|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if they use Serious 3NT|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: yes, cards lay good for E/W|pg||
nt|panosk: W knows that E has only 2 cards in spades otherwise he wud have bid 2@S after 2@C not 2@H |pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: underlead indicated but doesn't help|pg||
nt|knutte: The clue was to find the A of @C|pg||
nt|panosk: usually its honor doubleton|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: avoidance in @S to be safe with @C return|pg||
nt|panosk: its all over the world nowadays, spreading like a contagion|pg||
pc|h3|nt|panosk: i very much like 3NT by S, bold but you have to be in this time cause you cant actually check if pard has stoppers in both majors |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: found the best place to play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|STRIK3R: the 2@s opening was 5/6 - 10/11 in this vul, promising 5@s and normaly a 4+ minor suit, but could be only 3 card minor on the side|pg||
nt|knutte: also put opps under pressure|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|bobholl: guess a1D small @D|pg||
nt|ady: east thinking spade trick likely to make   not knowing opening a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|panosk: 3@S bid in fact asks W to choose best game 3NT or 4@S |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Børre sees that he might go down with @S and @D 4-2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: after the @d switch, no warning bells?|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk: thx O R|pg||

mb|1N|nt|murat e: this time 8-5 for a change|pg||

nt|grebrof: yes|pg||

mb|d|nt|ady: slam time    6 spades for n/s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes 4@c looks fair|pg||
nt|mamos:  specsakke agrees :)|pg||
nt|panosk: N was thinking 1NT or 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|knutte: Must close his eyes and make a 3NT bid :)|pg||
nt|panosk: both ok in this hand, i slightly favor 1NT too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|knutte: or keep them open and pass|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@D now? |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2NT asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Preempting with a 5-card major on the side is very unclassical, but what do you do?|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the 1972 Olympics, a Canadian opened 4@H with 6-6 in the majors. The opps...|pg||
nt|gsper:  bid 4@S, he doubled and it made|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@c one long suit|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to 3NT    but may have a difficult ride|pg||
nt|mamos:  its poss that 4@c is Texas|pg||
nt|panosk: trumps break well for decl |pg||
nt|knutte: N must switch to small @S after A of @C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: opted for part score|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Caution may pay off here. Guess Frank did not like his club holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: looks like 9 tricks for NS in @H and 8 EW in sp|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@C= i have long unspecified suit, 2@D say which|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@c show max hand, either @H or @s, 3@d ask what suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: need to ruff 2 hearts to make |pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: and on @C lead no entries to do that|pg||
nt|ady: or possibly ruff 1 heart and set up long club|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@s show @H|pg||
nt|panosk: ok he might have 25-27 also right? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Peronally I overcall 1 @S with Nybo's hand|pg||
nt|ady: low spase now best|pg||
nt|andersk: what line?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: he could yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  In general, if you have 5 trumps it is a good idea to lead one. I am not sure how it would have worked here.|pg||
nt|murat e: i think heart lead and dia shift needed to beat this contract|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree |pg||
nt|murat e: helgamos hand is rubbish and he has a passed parnner but hands fit very well|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: W must be feeling low on missing 4@S by that preempt and the defence cashed their tricks to the max.|pg||
nt|grebrof: interesting choice of switch|pg||
nt|knutte: Didnt see that one coming|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: after 3. hand openings and not vouln, m|pg||

nt|baldjean: 3@c max hand? with what N holds?|pg||
nt|panosk: *twice|pg||
pc|s3|nt|STRIK3R: West was in perfect spot for using "snapdragon", but they dont have that in their cc, dbl(snapdragon) would have showed 5@s and minimum Tx in @d|pg||
nt|grebrof: makes now|pg||
nt|baldjean: is it not rather min?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 6hcp is max of weak 2|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 6-7|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: they open 2@H with 8-11|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, ok|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: club lead is awkard    east has 3 spades to the 10 and doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: North thinking...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards - easy.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: in board 2 4@S were made hence 12 imps to Drammen|pg||
nt|andersk: needed to switch @D to couse any problems|pg||
nt|panosk: not an easy contract|pg||
nt|grebrof: or|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panosk: its a hopeless contract |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: thats why I wondered if he would made an upgrade at once, opening 2@h|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: even on this lead  awkward to make 12 tricks on the lay|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andersk: Probably down on @D switch|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 3@d would have shown a minimum hand with @h and 3@h would have shown a minimum hand with @s, after 2NT that is|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: always getting the contract on the strong hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wygbe1: i wonder why n didnt act sooner|pg||
nt|mamos:  no reason to choose anything other than this straightforward line is there?|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

nt|knutte: Yes, makes now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good way to treat multi responses|pg||
pc|s9|nt|knutte: because of @H 3-3 :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: N/S play what we could call UDA, upside down attitude, compared to STANDARD, Standard is HI-LO to show even number of cards, but hight card encouring, UDA would be HI-LO to show ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: even number of cards, but low card as encouringing|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andersk: Bakke thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 2@c is rather clear - isn´t it?|pg||
nt|andersk: If he pass, Helgomo knowes he's partner have a hand|pg||
nt|panosk: another hard 1 for decl|pg||
nt|rnmalik: your guess correct :)|pg||
nt|panosk: i think its very reasonable bidding |pg||
nt|panosk: this will be ducked|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panosk: im ok with pass in 2nd no 4-4 majors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gsper:  I wonder if 2NT was natural (unusual these days) or minors or something|pg||
nt|panosk: the rest two suits more likely|pg||
nt|murat e: red against white east did not fancy a negative double here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi David I will join you for the rest of this set|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Ronny    welcome|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks for S - at least....|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: that was a surprise....|pg||
nt|andersk: probably 8 tricks, even 9 on a good day|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|panosk: i think trump now by W, or 10@H|pg||
nt|panosk: trump doesnt look appealing to W as he may reveal trump lay out, @D and @C are out of the question i think|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: could easely get 13 tricks here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panosk: @C from dummy and if no @D return he will make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|STRIK3R: no, sorry|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: @s suit dosent behave|pg||
nt|panosk: very likely i think too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: in a hopless 6 diamonds here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Dag did his work bidding 3@s on this one, making it hard for East/West to make a controlled auction|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panosk: E doing his bit with highest @C available|pg||
nt|panosk: not a clear sign though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what switch @S or @D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: high @c = spade ?|pg||
nt|panosk: most likely |pg||
nt|panosk: depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, weired 1nt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: should be the first swing this set for Tromse|pg||
nt|panosk: no he found the A|pg||
pc|hA|nt|STRIK3R: Sitting in east seat, x of 1@h would normaly promise @d as well as @s, holding T72 in @d you dont want your partner to start bidding @d's, beside you know North has some @s's. ...|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Think pass of 2@c is ok in Teams|pg||
nt|baldjean: 7 without @d lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: well, can always ruff some small @s's before running @H|pg||
nt|panosk: indeed|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|panosk: in board 18 as was accurately suggested by operator Astrid earlier EW cud make 3NT which they did |pg||
nt|panosk: in open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo should have played the 2@C.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|STRIK3R: but as the hands are, N/S would have stopped bidding on either bid from west|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: EW might block the @H's and W might be endplayed for 9|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: true   if you bang out top cards you can make 6 hearts 3 diamonds 2 clubs and 1 spade|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hi all|pg||
nt|panosk: also 9@C becomes a trick if needed be|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: maybe still cant blame W at all very hard to find |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andersk: 8 most likely|pg||
nt|mamos:  West's double turns out  to be poorly timed here - i think it was too aggressive |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|STRIK3R: you said there was no lead that would give this away, there is no declaring either who will get this right :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|panosk: * our excellent operator Astrid |pg||
nt|panosk: trump now is imperative|pg||

nt|ady: a more secure 6@D this time  for n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: as you can see from this board banging Aces on the lead never a gd choice, even stiff ones, let decl find them him/herself|pg||
nt|ady: hi Ronny|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: N/S will reach 3NT and will most likely win it, just loosing 2@s and 2@d's|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree. |pg||
nt|panosk: you mean in the bidding?|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry private |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|STRIK3R: nice @d slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Interestingly, on board 1, 4@S was made against that awful trump break in the other room|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|STRIK3R: 3@s?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from east|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S   too expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: a coffee break board :)|pg||
nt|panosk: Hansen has got to play all hopeless contracts so far, i bet he wished he sat North by now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik was not pleased when his pd lost th2nd down by discarding @H 9 in stead of @D9|pg||
nt|knutte: 6 @D will have more than 50% chance as some specs suggested|pg||
nt|panosk: nice grand|pg||
nt|panosk: Heimdal missed 4@S in 2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|murat e: to make 3 nt west needs help in heart suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: no "muiderberg" (5@S and 4+ minor 6-10) nice weapont to have|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W was never afraid of bidding|pg||
nt|panosk: impressive they imediately started next board , no comments about previous board, exemplary attitude|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D now.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: dont thin anything will stop north here|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: west on lead must not cash either one of his aces to beat this slam very tricky hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: I was about to say 4@s must look tempting, but hopefully it dosent promise void|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: from North|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: backside of opening 1@H with either 5@h or 4-4 in Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: or not to be touched at all :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: @H is 4-4 so no problems for declearer here|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H shud be relay 3@H transfer i think, correct me if im wrong|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2NT showing 25-27|pg||
nt|panosk: yes i remember that from yesterday quite rare |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h just relay, and 3@h is transfer, correct :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 2@h as realy is pretty common in Norway|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: relay...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik is thinking..|pg||
nt|panosk: another bid i like from Anderssen, 1@H in 3rd position|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|panosk: NT not a safe place for NS|pg||
pc|c2|nt|STRIK3R: East wouldent like to see that @d holding in dummy after he lead A of @d|pg||
nt|panosk: S will pass|pg||
nt|panosk: whud ask for Aces i think|pg||
nt|panosk: *shud|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: 4@S nice save|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: dont think south will get exited  even with a void spade opposite|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not this time :)|pg||
nt|mamos:  nine on top|pg||
nt|larsarthur: auauau|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panosk: gd thing for decl W can get to play only on the lead, the rest is pretty tough|pg||
nt|knutte: 3 @H will make, but u wouldnt like to be any higher|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gsper:  That pass by S was disciplined, to say the least|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: A of @s continuation looks normal|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Yes a spade lead would have worried north more|pg||
nt|ady: re all    had connection problems|pg||
nt|panosk: dont know what the meanning of 4@C is in their system but maybe easilly misunderstood as 2nd suit if not clear agreement |pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: lose one in each suit.|pg||
nt|panosk: so i vote for Aces but open to other suggestions|pg||
nt|panosk: hi Oliver|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|murat e: actually heart slam is good|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed would have been nice|pg||
nt|panosk: N has to play for Ax @D on side to make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|murat e: dummys club can be discarded on long spade|pg||
nt|panosk: that is also true|pg||
nt|panosk: gd guess to ruff high|pg||
nt|knutte: well, why listen to me :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|STRIK3R: Still have :)|pg||
nt|knutte: opps just keep pushing spades|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|panosk: but which is the right side ? :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Play @D from the dummy to make.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|oliverc: 6@S from an aceless hand maybe a little risky (perhaps 4@C), but it got them there|pg||
pc|d5|nt|STRIK3R: but not sure you would choose to save in this vul|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: everybody who knows Frank, know that he uses strict rules, so his 1NT opening is most likely solid, and he rearly overbid hsi hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|murat e: yes help from partner or help from opps both exist here for his luck|pg||
nt|panosk: heats and heart and heart will be the winning play here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats what i meant after 1@S overcall|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|knutte: might switch to K of @C?|pg||
nt|grebrof: looks like it makes|pg||
nt|baldjean: all systems have downsides. there is no perfect system. which is what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panosk: anyway right contract is found eventually|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk: even if not in system and 1@H is 5card beter open 1@H with this than a poor 1@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true Jeanine|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: ups, 3NT went 2 down|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: where they made 12 here|pg||
nt|panosk: heart lead in 3 and no guess in @D +11 imps to Tromps|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: with that result, Heimdal finding them in third spot right now|pg||

mb|1D|nt|murat e: declarers usually have a void or single at this type of auction so the lead was not absurd|pg||

nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
mb|4S|nt|STRIK3R: I was thinking more after the first round of @c, since west showed up with a small one, you couldent really defend against J97x in east hand, but as you say, you would having that ...|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 3@s preemtive I guess|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 4 hearts    but 4 spades a good save for n/s|pg||
nt|mamos:  may well be 3NT again|pg||
nt|panosk: and plent of entries in his hand to establish a suit for an extra trick shud that was needed|pg||

pc|s6|nt|STRIK3R: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 7@D as compared to the declares 6.|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|murat e: declarer has entry problems from one hand to the other|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: wont distroy his income to dummy before setting up the winning @d's, all he need is to develop 1 trick beside his 6 clear winners|pg||

nt|panosk: 10@D to avoid blocking @D|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: I like his 3rd hand oopening 1@C - |pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: He wants pd to lead @C and not @D if opps get to play the contract.|pg||
nt|panosk: if its not strong @C i cant see the benefit in general, apart from this board|pg||
nt|panosk: with an 18 holding you hope to play, not to defend|pg||
nt|panosk: 41 imps exchanging hands in 1st six boards, translating to an imp gain for Kristiansands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so +1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|STRIK3R: because he know that east has 0-2 @s's, so the @s suit is most likely blocked|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: true, I dident see that|pg||

mb|d|an|Majors|nt|STRIK3R: according to their cc|pg||

nt|panosk: 3@C is very choice i agree|pg||
mb|2C|nt|STRIK3R: E/W open lowest 4 card suit, can open 1@c with 4333 if the @s suit is poor|pg||
nt|panosk: i wud prefer 3@C unless they play it non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Does anyone know if the opening showed 5 cards?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|murat e: good stop|pg||
nt|panosk: natural lead since no stayman by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: easy 8 tricks with diamonds breaking|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Easy to bid, but maybe not easy to win|pg||
nt|panosk: Garozzo said you must always lead your singleton, in a more elaborate way though :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If you dont lead you dont have one:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: 2@H might score better here. Declarer will surely get the Diamonds right|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Stokkvik does not like dummy very much :)|pg||
nt|baldjean: 4@s should make, even if Q@s is not guessed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: thats the problem pre-empting with 6 card suits   hard to evaluate with a good hand opposite that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: or if south ducked the @h lead|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: nothing seems easy here, except the @s layout|pg||
nt|sverjohn: As we thought a swing to Kristiansand on board 19. 4h was beaten|pg||
nt|ady: re all    sorry   bad connection|pg||
nt|baldjean: IMP exchange is usually an indicator for aggressiveness; the higher it is the more aggressive the teams are|pg||
nt|panosk: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: will make|pg||

mb|p|nt|knutte: Yes, but the set up for today shd be good :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bobholl: 4@S difficult now|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so N/S missed out a good sac in @d or @h, the 1@h opening probably scared North |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and only 9 tricks in @s as well, I will not make analyzes anymore, sorry... :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: could have been down on @H ruff but S expects no @D A in N|pg||
nt|panosk: sspade and wishfull thinking|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: playing one round of @c and two times @H, would later endplay east in @d|pg||
nt|panosk: tend to like @DA as lead|pg||
nt|baldjean: agreed. from AK I would almost always lead the A|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Very tight now  at the top|pg||

nt|panosk: its the 3 and 2 in @C to start with |pg||

nt|STRIK3R: VP 120|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: have only...|pg||
nt|baldjean: oh, ok. but even 12 VP can be gained|pg||

nt|panosk: and 4@H dont seem to make|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. I think 9 tricks the absolute limit for EW in hearts|pg||
nt|panosk: due to lack of entries mainly|pg||
nt|oliverc: and even that might depend on some help from Opps|pg||

mb|2H|nt|murat e: wrong...|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@D not bad EW, however it cant make|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: if you play weak 2 as their cc states, that is not a 2@s opening|pg||
nt|panosk: you can tell me in private also :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Christer is thinking, %&&/%¤&(=(&/)/&/) :)|pg||
nt|murat e: spade discard|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: pass in south now show 0-2@s's|pg||
nt|ady: firstr quiet hand|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: shall we predict just making? 2@c that is|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: though last hand could have been defeated  south might have considered saving in 6@C|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: an another 13 imp to Tromsø, 1 IMP now|pg||
nt|sverjohn: Would have opened 1 spade. But this could have worked out well|pg||
nt|knutte: Good contract thou :)|pg||
nt|panosk: 4@S can make DD|pg||
nt|oliverc: this should be ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: 4@C by S is new suit or cue bid in spades?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: should have been born in switzerland :)|pg||
nt|panosk: they dont have much oil there :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: 4 @S all about locating J of @H|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|baldjean: if you asked my wife that question, she would answer "Schalke 04" and talk about football :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: not checback, xyNT 2@c forces 2@d|pg||
nt|sverjohn: But a weak 2 opener should never bid again, so this could have waked up Holm|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ady: that was expected Ronny    6@D  - 1  with ace and king of clubs to loose|pg||
mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: hehe|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: south accepts game-try and bids 3 nt with 4-3-3-3 flat distribution|pg||
nt|gsper:  2NT is usually some kind of relay nowadays|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: so we guess east forgot system, or was not sure if the system was on after an intial pass in opening from west(ref board 4 in open room)|pg||
nt|sverjohn: 6-5 is obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  But you are right that natural fits this bidding|pg||
nt|murat e: north thinks 4 hearts is better in fact both contracts make|pg||
nt|baldjean: I would not like to pass, to be honest. the @s of partner can't be too good|pg||
nt|panosk: what does 5@S mean? |pg||
nt|panosk: cant be asking for spade honors to go to slam|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe not. needs to get the Clubs right here|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: More imps to Tromsø, as Heimdal only bid 6@s on board 7|pg||
nt|oliverc: unbelievable :)|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: smartly played @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Yes, always 10 with this layout :)|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess 1 down now but on @S lead at least -2|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzhc: 3nt= krAV OM cue|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT  @S fit, 3@C game at least|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: indeed, even that|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kemperg: not a 50% slam, @SQ and @CK had to behave|pg||

nt|panosk: ok i have responce to that think hard on the lead and then play all cards fast|pg||

nt|vugraphzhc: Yes :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|STRIK3R: good bidding from e/w again|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not making it easy for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 3NT|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bobholl: you have to discuss what redouble now is (retransfer ?)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: looks like it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and old rule - give opps as much rope as they need and they will hang themselves:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|STRIK3R: Tromsø in the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 4 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: see 7 safe tricks|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: getting 4 diamonds give you 8|pg||
nt|ady: even that not enough with Q@H wrong|pg||
nt|knutte: shd make easily|pg||
nt|oliverc: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|panosk: any news from the Bergens-Lillehammer match?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|panosk: i know what you meant Jeanine was just joking|pg||
nt|baldjean: the difficulty is to decide what is right, and that's part of what makes bridge so interesting|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bobholl: @c with @H ttolerance|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: E/W surely bid a lot, 3@c here is not my style, if x of 2@h show @h|pg||
nt|kemperg: 8 tricks in 3NT , but looking for the 9th|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: ....or 3 @D :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bobholl: but east didn't understand|pg||
nt|ady: north not moving after taking early action|pg||
nt|ady: is minimum   but very suitable|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: need to play @h to 9|pg||
nt|mamos:  this looks a normal contract and should make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gsper:  Many Scandinavians would have bid 3@C (minimum) as W. This is something different.|pg||
nt|panosk: was double an option for N?|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: Lillehammer leading with 28 IMPs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|murat e: even on a club lead declarer can duck twice and if he knows the rest can make it|pg||
nt|ady: minimum 1 down|pg||
nt|panosk: had some comments suggesting 3@S is beter , i agree|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|panosk: and @D back, pard has his reasons |pg||
nt|panosk: another way to look at it W has nothing beter to play|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: south have opend a weak hand, 3NT was not really an option|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: not after 3@c|pg||
nt|panosk: and everybody bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Plays the ball over to Rune I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: With a max hand Rune would bid 3 @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Then 3 NT from Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzhc: Tromsø now 1 VP behind Heimdal|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panosk: or double which maybe converted to penalty in absence of a gd game from S|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|baldjean: I think getting rid of an @h loser first would be better here|pg||
nt|panosk: thats very right |pg||

nt|kemperg: not a clear count signal, perhaps trying a @D signal?|pg||
nt|panosk: didnt agree with me :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gsper:  3@S maybe minimum wothout singleton|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: good save against 4@s :)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ady: J@H    backward finesse   and get diamond right    unlikely|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andersk: and @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|andersk: Per Arne Flott will probably not misplay this one|pg||

nt|kemperg: @SA and @S and@S is best|pg||
pc|cT|nt|STRIK3R: still in the lead, but not with so many imps|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panosk: the lead gives decl a @C trick and makes his life easier, still even without @C lead he wud have to ruff 2@H in hand and ends up the same with @H 4-2|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kemperg: big problems for leader|pg||

pc|d2|nt|kemperg: In OR 3NT on 27, |pg||
nt|knutte: a bit sci-fi I think :)|pg||
nt|panosk: he chose to play with the odds, quite rightly i think |pg||
nt|panosk: the way he played @C gives him 2 chances, either @CQ on side or clubs 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: on side means with E|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kemperg: discard @S looser|pg||

nt|panosk: but unfortunatelyclubs dont behave|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|STRIK3R: playing @c to be 3-3 is risky :) better hope for some luck in @s I think|pg||
nt|ady: needs clubs 3=3 with honours split  and J@S onside|pg||
nt|sverjohn: He could have made it through a late entry in clubs follwed by a trump finesse|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|murat e: declarer can crosruff or establish spades bot are ok but he does not see as we do with open cards|pg||
nt|kemperg: or @D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andersk: I think Helgemo is max unlucky here. And I totally disagree with 1 NT|pg||
nt|andersk: Helgemo have 43 in major, so if partner can bid a major over 1 @d he is normally in very good shape|pg||
nt|andersk: Very unlucky to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|panosk: how do u lose playing in majors after 1NT ?|pg||
nt|andersk: with the favouruble @H 3-3 NS probably would have made 3 @H|pg||
nt|panosk: still he will make|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|andersk: 1 NT bad, when partner dont have majors (which he often does not have when you self have 4-3 in MM)|pg||
