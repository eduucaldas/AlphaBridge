mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rv: N-S play precision, E-W play 2/1|pg||

nt|rv: if Ajay had bid 2@c in first round of bidding, JM would have raised to 3@c and it might have been more difficult to get to 5@d subsequently|pg||

nt|nkgupt: sry is cold|pg||
nt|key1809: u mean 7@s?|pg||
nt|nkgupt: y meant 7:)|pg||
nt|key1809: in the other room, west bid 3c over east's stayman showing a 5c M, but JM understood that as natural and bid 3nt|pg||
nt|key1809: no such problems here, as hooda will start with a str 1@c |pg||
nt|key1809: im sure they will reach this slam, the question is, whether they overshoot to grand |pg||
nt|key1809: actually even the grand makes , on red suit squeeze |pg||
nt|key1809: declarer can ruff 2 @c's ruff a @h in hand, and then start the run of trumps|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that will require 4+@h and 5+@d in the same hand...not sure if a better % than a simple @c finnese|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|nkgupt: AND where is the communication to @h after doing all that?:)|pg||

nt|rv: this is 4th round of RR, top 4 out of 5 teams (Cabal, Ruia and Azure are other 3) qualify for SFs|pg||
nt|sunit:  yes but on a @D lead 3 @D's and a @H loser|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|rv: this could be pick-up for N-S since OR playing standard and could possibly miss game|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Andy, good to see you after loong time|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi rv:)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rv: cold LS, some might even chance GS (not good though)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|p dalvi: south too rich |pg||
nt|rv: precision @c here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|rv: every team gets a bye since we have 5 teams and not playing turner movement|pg||
nt|andyv:  1NT with 5 card major becoming less unusual...I do like to have 3 cards in the other major however|pg||
nt|rv: JM started with 2@c hoping to bid smolen 2@h if Ajay had bid 2@d|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: Meenal, any idea about scores after 3rd round|pg||
mb|p|nt|p dalvi: probably use H relay and show 24-25|pg||
nt|indianidol: scores after 3 rnds : azure  59, poddar 49, indiablues 46,  nest inn 41  , cabal 36.|pg||
nt|rv: Kirpa's 2@d is aggressive O/C, he must have bid based on white position|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: ty Mahesh|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay's 3@c possibly shows 5M, JM has possibly forgotten sys|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like that|pg||
nt|andyv:  however no hard done although missed a good slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  no harm|pg||
nt|rv: JM plays with too many diff partners and this is not his preferred treatment, he plays 2n to show 5M min and 3M to 5M max on 2@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  and stayman used to be so easy:)|pg||
nt|rv: Ajay plays 3m to show 5M max hand and possibly shows 2n to show 5M min hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|indianidol: Welcome Rv|pg||
nt|sunit:  will make on a heart lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|p dalvi: north 5 -7 bal or c suit well not my style all J and Q|pg||
nt|rv: this could be costly even at these colors|pg||
nt|rv: double dummy defense can possibly take it 4 down?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal good for neutrals and supporters of Azure|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will net 10 tricks...if you are EW you have to hope 6@s isn't bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|geot: Det meste går galt for Heimdal nå. I det forrige spillet endte det med et rutervalg som gikk galt, og nye 11 IMP til Tromsø som kan presse trondheimslaget ut av pallen om dette ...|pg||
nt|geot: fortsetter|pg||
nt|arunbapat: Venkay's 4D instaed of 3C would have put lot of pressure on E.|pg||
nt|rv: good afternoon Arunji wlc|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: Kristiansand er på 2dre nu|pg||

nt|andyv:  if partner is known to make light opening bids or if that is the partnership style, then it's not as clear cut for E to bid 3N.|pg||
