mb|1C|nt|suzanna2: The 2 top teams, South Australia and Victoria are now playing a 60 board final, with 2 10 board stanzas tonight and 4 tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: The WA Youth Team:  M Bausor, R Cooper, T Knowles, J Reynolds, R Cooper, K Fuller|pg||
mb|2H|nt|suzanna2: the SA team: J Haffer, P Hudson, P Markey, J Williams, D Cherry, J Horowitz|pg||
nt|suzanna2: and the NSW team:  E Burrowes, J Ferguson, J Black, N Edgtton, A Edgtton, L Milne|pg||
nt|richardt: this match has tightened up in the last set...WA had a substantial lead earlier|pg||
mb|4S|nt|richardt: presumably a transfer to @hs|pg||
nt|richardt: is OK...he scored 450 so was a flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|suzanna2: and the Vic team: B Jacobs, B Thompson, L Gold, S Hinge, P Hollands, M Henbest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|richardt: will East throw in the towel?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|richardt: This is not the usual Precision 1@d opening 4-card suit promised in 1st/2nd seat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bebechira1: and we lost 11 on the first board|pg||
nt|richardt: both of these pairs are playing Acol|pg||
nt|suzanna2: and the event web site....  http://www.ntba.com.au/ANC/|pg||

nt|cc469: note my familiarity with Oz vernacular :)|pg||

nt|richardt: spot on Carl|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|d4|nt|richardt: South can tell from bidding that North is short in @hs...makes his 3 small holding look good|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|richardt: this is a bit of bad luck...@h not 4-4 and they found the lead|pg||
pc|s6|nt|richardt: This looks like it should produce 11 tricks, in which case this will be another flat board|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|richardt: both of these pairs are playing 2/1 Game Force|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|richardt: 4@s made the same 10 tricks on the OR, so another 7 IMPs likely for NSW|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cc469: ok, now sitting in front of my computer having just put the vegemite away :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|richardt: likely same at other table as also playing Acol, but might have been a swing if other NS had been playing SAYC and declasrered from the North hand|pg||

nt|cc469: hmm, not sure I would have bid E's hand that way|pg||

mb|p|nt|richardt: ah yes...3NT by North in OR and didn't get fatal @h lead|pg||
nt|bebechira1: may be tired...they played a lot of bridge i the last week or so|pg||
nt|richardt: on the lie of the cards, EW can make 4@s on their combined 16 HCP|pg||
nt|richardt: 2@S is 6-9 5+ @s and 4+ Minor|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: the score has tightened up since yesterday |pg||
nt|cc469: 2@S by W really didn't promise anything so E has not a good bid over 3@D|pg||

nt|sybarra: well I dont play acol |pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: so std ole me,  would try 1 @C |pg||
nt|cc469: 3 10's - I think I would upgrade this hand to 15 AND OPEN 1nt too playing 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|richardt: i suppose 2@h+1@s|pg||
nt|richardt: NS do|pg||
nt|ianmcc: nasty board for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: then sort out a rebid |pg||
nt|richardt: In OR, seems odd that Gallus passed 1NT with 13HCP after East opened the bidding...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|richardt: yes no game making that I can see|pg||
mb|p|nt|richardt: 1@s must deny 4 card @s suit?|pg||
nt|richardt: or is transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: easy to bid the hand after 1NT - partner is in charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: in our world carl,  think you are right |pg||

mb|p|nt|cc469: nice to know nwe come from the same planet Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: :) |pg||
nt|richardt: it has been pointed out to me that SOUTH (not East) opened the 1@d in the OR...my mistake|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ianmcc: must be a glitch here?|pg||
nt|ianmcc: or maybe all responses after 1@c|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|richardt: an IMP or 2 to SA for getting to superior game, but no real damage|pg||
nt|bebechira1: 1 imp or 2? what for?|pg||
nt|richardt: looks like 6 IMPs coming back to ACT|pg||
nt|richardt: their Precision is heavily modified...opening 1@d promises 4-card suit in 1st/2nd, and 1NT opening is variable|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ianmcc: pass would be good...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|richardt: West does better to rise K@d|pg||
pc|d2|nt|richardt: getting to 4@s instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|richardt: positive response after strong 1@c...unfortunately I don't think that's possible|pg||

nt|richardt: 3NTS-1 in OR is a good result for NS...looks like -2 on a @s lead and sensible def|pg||
pc|s2|nt|richardt: sadly...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira1: yep...you are right..|pg||
nt|richardt: for those that weren't here at the beginning, EW are playing a Forcing Pass system|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: these are "mad scramble" hands |pg||
nt|richardt: did North really underlead JT?|pg||

nt|richardt: this should not be a pickup for NSW, if so they will need to win the last board by 13 IMPs...tall order|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|richardt: 2NT strongish enquiry...3@c 5/5 black suits <opening values|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|nt|mrdct: the score on board 18 doesn't seem right - the gap might be closer|pg||

nt|timb: That would have been a nice deal if trumps had been 2-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: a very heavy 3@c|pg||

nt|cc469: and nobody even tried|pg||
nt|richardt: congratulations to the WA Youth Team..ANC winners for 2012|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|richardt: if flat only 9 IMPs will have changed hands on final 7 boards|pg||
