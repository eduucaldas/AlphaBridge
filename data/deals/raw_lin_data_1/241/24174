nt|suzanna2: The NSW team H Lowry, B Folkard, F Lyons, H Cusworth, D Smart, N Djurovic|pg||
nt|henryb:  Trick for N-S is to reach 4@h - or even 5|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  For E-W to save in 5@s|pg||
mb|2D|nt|suzanna2: And the WA team V Biltoft, L Fuller, V Wood, C Belonogoff, A Clark, M Leybourne|pg||

nt|suzanna2: The 8 Australian States and Territories have over the last 6 days played a double round robin|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|suzanna2: the SA team: J Haffer, P Hudson, P Markey, J Williams, D Cherry, J Horowitz|pg||
mb|2D|an|transfer !H|nt|richardt: presumably a transfer to @hs|pg||
mb|d|nt|suzanna2: and the Vic team: B Jacobs, B Thompson, L Gold, S Hinge, P Hollands, M Henbest|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|richardt: will East throw in the towel?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|bebechira1: and we lost 11 on the first board|pg||
nt|richardt: both of these pairs are playing Acol|pg||
nt|suzanna2: and the event web site....  http://www.ntba.com.au/ANC/|pg||
nt|richardt: 6-4 generally pays to bid more|pg||

nt|cc469: ok, now sitting in front of my computer having just put the vegemite away :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|richardt: likely same at other table as also playing Acol, but might have been a swing if other NS had been playing SAYC and declasrered from the North hand|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h8|nt|henryb:  I wonder whether it is better to play the @cQ to the A and run the @dQ before continuing trump. this caters to @d breaking and to E being 0=1 in minors|pg||

nt|cc469: hmm, not sure I would have bid E's hand that way|pg||
nt|richardt: the 1NT seems to have dissuaded further bidding in Spades from East|pg||
nt|cc469: seemed to have enough shape to try 2@S over 2@D artificial|pg||
