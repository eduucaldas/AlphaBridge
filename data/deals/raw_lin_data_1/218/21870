mb|3N|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||

pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead brutal   it gives declarer hope|pg||

pc|h8|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i vote for 5@C instead of 5@H    just in case NS bid 5@S, i'd like @C lead|pg||

nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||

nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: i'm surprised by action from EACH player|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: yes, running score available at http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=c9efb17f-ccb2-4cff-b5bf-3463f7676fc6&round=11&tourid=704|pg||
nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be worth at least one try   @D under control, stiff @C  @SA|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
mb|2N!|an|0-1!s|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
nt|mcphee: so 2@D was some game try or just annouced opening values?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=RELAY  but i don't follow-ups|pg||
nt|mcphee: just see if I ask you any more questions :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you'll have to yell them   i'm having trouble staying awake :(|pg||
nt|mcphee: OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: West could try 3N at these colors|pg||
mb|3H|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have raised|pg||
nt|mcphee: E hand getting worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  15  3N in South|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: west doesn't care|pg||
nt|djneill:  East could have had @hK, @dA, @cK, opposite singleton @s, that would have been nice|pg||
nt|mcphee: very nice|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Ton  not balancing with all of that shape seems very deep|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bobholl: direct ak of @S best now ?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcphee: not exactly a claimer, but he should manage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: defense decides   @D ruff or @C trick|pg||
nt|mcphee: only a @S lead had a shot to beat it I think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT speculative      poor trick taking potential|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|kemperg: @D onside, so its made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jansma in South passing throughout on  2   4@S East|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: could be a problem  with spades 4-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will also beat it if defenders are on the ball|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @S see S hop ace|pg||
nt|djneill:  for the locations of the @sA, @hK, and @cK, this is the only arrangement that provides danger for West, can he do something about it|pg||
nt|mcphee: and now a @C will get them the setting trick as W can not reach the dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but then doesn't @C go on @S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i get it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kemperg: both sides bidding up to par:)|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: always 5 made now|pg||
nt|bobholl: at least|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff a diamond and a club with 5 and 3 of spades    has not got the entries|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: after surrendering @d and @h back--puts dec on his back foot to cash out|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense could always force him to ruff a club if necessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but van Prooijen needed to duck, didn't he?|pg||
nt|mcphee: y|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gsper:  Yes, it was a bit of an insult to opps|pg||
nt|kemperg: has he entrys left for @D play?|pg||
nt|kemperg: yes @C anD @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are all 3N overcalls of 3-level preempts speculative?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now @H entry to @S|pg||

mb|1S|nt|twcho: slam time|pg||
nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||

nt|kemperg: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H  could be 5@H 5@S or 2nd suit LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N @H raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D  often weak NT   maybe 4@D and LONGER @S/@C [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is one bid that shifts the blame back to doubler, I think North will find it|pg||
mb|1N!|an|any 8+|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C shortness   still don't know if 1-suit @H or  longer @S/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 5+@H  invitational or stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a nice bid|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N shows any 8+ hcp|pg||
mb|3C|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL would have shown cards rather than typical negative double|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
nt|ady: 2 diamonds and 2 trump tricks to be lost for sure    might scrape home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = takeout|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 2-level suit bids would be natural 0-7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|sK|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
nt|mcphee: they only use that over 1@S dble or other suits also?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Carl -- DBL isn't always traditional takeout shape since 1N overcalls are artificial|pg||
nt|djneill:  good stop, 25 HCP, no game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: exchange @D 6 with 8 and it can be mad|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: settling for down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course seeing all 4 hands -- we know better :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kemperg: kib thinks he wanted opener on lead, wich is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opener will hold 4@H only if   a) weak NT  b) 4@H(441)  c) 4405    so i'm a bit surprised at choice of 3@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would want to be in 4@H though|pg||

pc|sT|nt|penseur9:  2nt makes but 3 ????|pg||
nt|ady: may play 3NT   down on spade lead|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: now vP needs to find @S lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C was a relay  did not promise a 4 card major|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzvc: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that helps|pg||
nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|ady: should survive  |pg||
nt|djneill:  a ruff, a palpable ruff, not that it gained much|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|gsper:  N may have wanted a little extra strength for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems to have marked the lead, lets see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @S is only logical choice   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely that @CA @C would get partner ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|penseur9:  4@D is pick a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Gerbrand doesn't tell us -- the opponents don't know either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D says  not 3@H/@S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C  0/3 keycards   5@H a bit of a mystery to me   maybe thinking 5@C showed 1 keycard??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 5@C showed 1 KC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank just told me he made a mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank seemed to be stressed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame it all on Kantar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Bas  that explains 5@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: He says he made three wrong calls :)|pg||
nt|ady: need the club finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invite opposite max -- seems forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP can change his mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  otherwise i'd sleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT = 4th|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
nt|mcphee: ruffed with a natural as it happens|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kantar would have been able to ask for keycards at lower level|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gsper:  Voice comentators suggest that they may not support D this high|pg||
nt|ady: there are losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a @D leader too -- which is why systems in college geared to having me on lead|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer guages this a 4 card suit  then best to cross and take heart finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this case 3 wrongs = a right|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  you have a point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @SKxxx might look for tap|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see   just as i told you   my leads are terrible|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib confirms that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o  so now he agrees that he did have 2@C opener :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyway  nice recovery|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees asking why vP didn't lead @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  may see a supernatural resurrection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H promotes a trump trick, doesn't it?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: oeff luckily @CA and @DA not in other hands|pg||
nt|gsper:  Wlc, Marshall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a few pairs can jump to 3@H/@S to show 4441 hands, but most use to show (31)(54)|pg||
nt|mcphee: could try 9@C|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: now down a lot|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south has 2 @H entries AND @C length to give ruffs|pg||
nt|bobholl: 380 difference indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 5@c -1 on bd 20 a push with 110 in 2@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must cash @DA first|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 3@H from bertens not as good as i said :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: well, that depends, without 3@h brink-drijver might have stopped below 5@c|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: in 5@D  if south leads a heart   must duck first round and later discard a heart on club|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: good guesses always help :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: West not agreeing with how East bid the hand, not sure what he should have done there to show his 6-6|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so you play 2 16 board matches against each team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: running total includes White House 10 imps for winning round robin|pg||

nt|penseur9:  yes shure does :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank very relieved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good question -- but i wouldn't ask it at the table|pg||

nt|djneill:  hi david|pg||
mb|1D|nt|twcho: sorry,|pg||
nt|twcho: trump is 31|pg||
nt|penseur9:  likely 4@H NS here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: More of a statement really: "Isn't a 1@S lead best?"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: won't be surprised if  5 is pushed |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=4+  NEVER the longest in a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd 2@C opener this set -- rare|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they are also surprised :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2@C for @H now ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they don't play that|pg||
nt|kemperg: weak 2 in @D or strong|pg||
nt|kemperg: 2NT strong relay|pg||
nt|kemperg: how good is your weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=5@S 5@H 1@D  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's THAT for a specific bid??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: vunderbar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = 4-fit, 3-8 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: but is a good convention :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: so declarer has to guess the @c for an overtrick|pg||
nt|famus: again dicey 3NT on @d lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and top 4 qualifies for semi-finals which are played now|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3@H transfer to @S|pg||
nt|dkkello:  good presure bidding from E-V |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think 2@h is NF by the Bakkerens|pg||
nt|kemperg: 10pts, but still not very good:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jansma really wants to bid |pg||
nt|sybarra: not often you have an 8 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C sets @H|pg||
nt|ady: games both sides fail here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but can be balanced|pg||
nt|mcphee: what is e/w nt range?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 15-17 for both|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S maximum in context of non 1@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H  minimum|pg||
nt|fabsayc: super duper dutch reverse flannery |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@CX on  1  was down 3  so only 2 imp swing|pg||
nt|ady: part score in clubs for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  slam may be here EW again but hard to get there... again|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  3nt going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point  5+@S  4+@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: the dealing machine in Utrecht has no problems with 8  or 9 suits:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be the set of 4-1 trump splits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will stop in 6@S knowing @SQ missing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: good news   @DK protected     bad news -- they get 5(+) before you get 9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry 6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is RKC in @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D=2 keycards no Q|pg||
pc|cA|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for new bridgeplayers , notice how much the bid on very few points |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     2 [5@HW=]   4@HX|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Welcome to my world.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my world they are 4-1 FITS|pg||
nt|ady: should not be a problem    has 2 clubs tricks 1 diamond and 1 heart     can surely manage 4 trump tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other table seems to be entering 2nd 10 minutes of board  2|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|nt|famus: @dQ and small|pg||
nt|twcho: good defense|pg||
nt|twcho: else, declarer may make|pg||
nt|ady: can ruff diamonds high  and Q98 of spades come in to play|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: drijver will have a difficult card when in with k@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  only two @S and a @C loosers|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Frank confirms 2@h was NF|pg||
nt|dkkello:  protected by "the law" even vulnerable |pg||
nt|bobholl: tya htg |pg||
nt|dkkello:  se you Bob |pg||
nt|penseur9:  tks Bob|pg||
nt|ady: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2 just finished  4@S=|pg||
nt|ady: just 4 side suit tricks   so need 6 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|penseur9:  now it's E with tough decision :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I expect 5@C-p-p-p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't make Verhees any happier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other forms of scoring  Schollaard very close to converting DBL to penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i missed the question Andy -- ask again|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  2  2@S made so 5 imps back to the leaders|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|gsper:  1@C strong or weak bal, I hear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paulissen didn't preempt with north hand on  3  [where 3370]|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||
nt|jaapfr: presumably he will return @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobholl: not necessary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E about to be squeezed if W exits with heart jack i think after clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a bid unfortunate here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from  17   Paulissen DBL 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't help the trailing team|pg||
nt|ady: may get home as it is going     just lose 3 club tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: west telling east that he thinks East has a minimum for 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: still will be ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so White House closes gap to 11|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: east known to have [at least] 9 black cards    how likely is @H finesse to work??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 imps on  2 after 4@HX made with 1 non-vul overtrick|pg||
nt|ady: club leads I suppose look obvious   but it seems to have given the contract|pg||
nt|ady: trumps now 2-2    so Q@C can be ruffed out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|twcho: As suggested by kibitzer, 4@h is cold for NS|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|gsper:  or unbal, @Cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: busy defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now ruffing @S finesse for overtrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does Jansma open 1N or 1@D  [their system derived from Polish Club]|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: best news -- 4@S not making either|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: but I wonder who can arrive at such great spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: no @C now and down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now W to find the @S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: even tougher for W|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9:  often when trum queen doubleton, it makes a trick :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *trump|pg||

nt|gsper:  Contradictory info from kibs|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  game force , but wich one ? |pg||
nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls   so 1N here would show 4@H and 5+@C/@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: this could be a  Slawinski spot card lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are not alone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still there could be overtricks, or a XX with nowhere to go.|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be a cold bath I afraid|pg||
pc|h5|nt|fabsayc: ok makes sense|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win @CA and THEN think -- when i've done that it usually means i shouldn't have won the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  4@H made for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@D is opened with  4@D & 5+@S   so weak hand with preference for @S bids  but if you reverse @S & @H maybe not|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  18  [3@CS=]   Paulissen playing 3@S East|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzvc: it's on their CC http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/Lombard_Schollaardt&Wortel.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 180 on the way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Ton Bakkeren stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 of the pairs on the winning Bermuda Bowl team play that  and a couple of pairs from Germany|pg||
nt|mcphee: whihc may make|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: ah   hi=odd without honor  or   even with honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D was likely to be down 1|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: wonder if Jansma had a 2-suited bid to make |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose this 2N was game force so ok to include 4-fit|pg||
nt|ady: this should be quick|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no problems for declarer now  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just a question of how many imps closer White House will be|pg||

nt|ahollan1: where Verhees 6@H-1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  now the question is only how many overtricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will be a struggle to make this 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H makes 8 or 9 now |pg||
nt|ady: now there will be a claim|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dkkello:  :)  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Maybe Drijver even guess the @D J |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: hoi kjeld welcome|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure of 9 tricks :) (after @H now) has to go for it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if @H now he has to go for @C 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @c2 lead, so he knows @c break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: assuming they lead 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D could be made if double finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: assumed that too but migth be 5 :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in @D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but it is not a speedball tournament today ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bertens doubled on 2@c for t/o of @h|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Dennis , is there any timeproblems at this table?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||
nt|kemperg: stuck?|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, not in this case where S has passed|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: they have 54 min left fot 9 boards now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 51 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
nt|kemperg: so 3 level for this combination, not advised with these bad suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C opening would make things interesting|pg||
nt|mcphee: i guess e/w have 9 tricks in 3N thqt hand|pg||

mb|1D|nt|twcho: and she did pass. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks the likely contract|pg||

nt|sybarra: Paulissen would have prefered a @S ruff no doubt  that might break up he end play |pg||
mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  big swing on board 5... slaam bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9:  for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: for EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can have 4+@D and longer @S or @C, but never longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well defended|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9:  are we looking at another 3NT by EW again?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you 1% serious?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = majors   if he chooses to bid|pg||
nt|ady: e/w may get to 4@S     bad split may make it awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|twcho: Many ask what is rule of 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
nt|ady: should come to 9 tricks   heart lead likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally serious that it would make it interesting    0% serious that it was a bid that would be considered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pull because of vulnerability|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: you can see explanation |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens never gets a decent trump break?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: jansma coming in now? |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 4@S, 5+@H, gamef or stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least only 4/1 this time  |pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the entries for that Cornelia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H is minimum, so W wont try slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cornelia suggesting that if Bertens plays the Ace of @H, he could finess the 10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2N just forcing or specifically showing ????|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's my guess and i'm sticking to it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, 2nt as a forcing bid is interesting|pg||
pc|h6|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bos ducked 2 rounds of @H and flew @CA  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  gtg , be back a little later , very good bridge we see today , |pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks see you later|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  after a penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't blame them|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead best |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm got there despite the systen!?:)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  if we remember that EW had a 10 IMp carry over, de Lombard team doing good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19 [3@C-2]  Jansma playing 2@H West|pg||
nt|ady: east will be wary of a bad trump split on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but what can he do about it?|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems you can pick up trumps |pg||
nt|ady: impossible on the bidding for south to start with ace and another diamond|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure that is worth it|pg||
nt|djneill:  what are the easy cases for East to imagine, if any|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might try @C9 to dummy then trump|pg||
nt|ady: I would back declarer to make this|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think so also David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: preemptor not leading @C/@D often suggests no singleton there -- so short trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with solid suit   lead from sequence overrides that inference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: declarer is asking what the signal of Norths hearts means, normally Lavinthal according to Van Prooijen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we have unfair advantage -- don't have to devise line of play assuming @C 4-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: silly question -- what if it is singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not impossible on the auction|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  seems that 2@S should go down here|pg||
nt|gsper:  N will agree with me that S did not have his double|pg||
nt|kemperg: he does with 15 to 15/14|pg||
nt|sybarra: too high now on a @D lead |pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   looks like being down    2 hearts better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen had rebid 2@H that would have been 5@H invite!|pg||
nt|ady: might make 2NT  if the clubs get entangles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why that wasn't his choice|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma already apologised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Frank may be thinking about correcting to 3N|pg||
nt|ady: at least down 3 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|twcho: this will make thanks to 33 @d|pg||
nt|twcho: east has to determine whether her partner leads a singleton or from 765|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought that was a Kokish-ism   after opener shows 6-card major, 2N forcing|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the reference to Lavinthal is   with singleton in dummy, 3rd hand card shows suit preference|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||
nt|gsper:  That lead makes it easier, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: I think maybe just 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my simple statement was too soon (is more to the hand than i thought initially)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank didn't realise 2NT was artificial he said|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Jansma did open 1N on the 4252 hand  Bertens playing 2@HX North|pg||
nt|mcphee: a frisky dble of 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in balancing hand  DBL from NT opener = max with doubleton in their suit   looks like perfect fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 5 comparisons  session score  2-0|pg||
nt|ady: if he ruffs 3rd heart now with 9@S   north does best to discard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with south out of trump  might just play @C|pg||
nt|ady: from here much easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  for some reason i thought 2 rounds of trump played   actually it was @H ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E mostly concerned about 4/2@C I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@HX made   11 imps to the leaders|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h9|nt|ady: well if 2 hearts would have been an invite    why not   instead of 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his actual sequence was still invite but showing one or both 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the club  stopped any defensive problems with the suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: good cash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy avoidance play to guarantee the contract|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: avoidance play -- finesse into East to protect the @CJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: seems everything wrong sided here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way to know |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant afford to duck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm  i think he needed to insert @H10|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: now what   @S or high @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the line in vegas       vanProoijen was bidding 5@D|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck and take 10 or fly ace to take 10   tough choice|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kemperg: only doubledummy will work:(|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: still if clubs were 2-2 was not hopeless|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: now down 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 3rd round of trump ????|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  Paulissen in 5@D  as expected another swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gsper:  !!|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: @C4*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in odd/even discards    odd says  "i like this suit"     even says "i don't like this suit, and shows suit preference by size of spot played"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 19 open room stopped sanely in 5@D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: since there is only one entry to dummy, declarer has to hope for even break in both red suits to bring in her contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  Bertens in 1@D North  |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: will that@D  play persuade dec to play for @h 4-1 ?|pg||

nt|sybarra: Bertens "on fire"  as one spec said |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Both apologised :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  5  Jansma has described his short @S opposite 1N opener  so they find 5@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Ton looking for coffee|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make mine a coke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system has 2@S as only weak 2 -- but it requires 6 card suit    but down a bunch, will vP slip @C into @S???|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  My predictions are unusually accurate today:)|pg||
nt|kemperg: teammate of me agrees too:(|pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9:  only 11 tricks here in @S due to king off side|pg||
nt|fabsayc: too early in the morning perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S [in my opinion a lucky stop]  big pickup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh  i said overtrick -- sorry  10@S on time|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this might be dangerous for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if east opens 1@S or 2@S   [the only weak 2 in the system]|pg||
nt|dkkello:  all 4 dammend good bridgeplayers , we danes envi you big time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra a big fan of responding light to partner's 1M-opening, especially at this vul|pg||
nt|gsper:  If kibs want response to chats, it is polite to have your full name in your profile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N="almost forcing"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS need decent 12 to open 1@D with balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|an|6!h and 3!s|nt|dkkello:  1 NT  ..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no transfers after DBL either -- that's a surprise to me|pg||
nt|ady: difficult re-bid   3@H   looks too high|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is a hefty 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it looks as if the table with bauke(muller) will finish before the one with hubbke(bertens) incredible :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  keep the flies away sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w sensibly keeping their heads down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s mustnt get carried away|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS might reach 4@S, guess West will dbl that|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with relish|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfavorable,  ambivalent suit,  7222 [i.e. outside losers]    3@S still doesn't occur to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3NT looks lik an reasonable contract in EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough choice vul at imps|pg||
nt|ady: even higher|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think 3@H a bad bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: no support doubles|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make  as south has only 1 entry to play diamonds threw the king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: good flying from brink drijver :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but i think it's becoming common practice to respond light here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not against theese guys however , the can smell a vul game |pg||
nt|dkkello:  or more!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D anyone ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jansma might have doubled 2@C if negative|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: 2@S strikes me as bold and has tempted north to go on|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by another spec:  If he knows that trumps never break for him it is easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 prevents defense from taking 3 tricks in the suit without declarer's help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D did make    22-0 set for White House|pg||
nt|ady: has the look of 1 down|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y DD:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given today's hand agree |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N = @S and 1@S was max. 3 @Ss|pg||
nt|ady: well this has pushed to game  ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: not everyone will open North hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean to pass 2@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D a good contract to reach    a nice fight back|pg||
nt|ady: might make on a cross ruff    will need to ruff 3rd club with 8@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  6 [4@SN=]   Paulissen in 4@HX   that should be another pickup for trailing team|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|twcho: and then 2@h is an invitaional bid showing at least 54 M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS are still juniors, what do you expect :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best to try and remove entry to 4th club   but 8@H is an entry|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: indeed with age comes caution because only juniors and madmen know no fear:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to play some form of Bart or Gazilli|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @D10 in East hand    for 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: 3 swings this set   all double digit|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we have big swingers :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect @H10 to show @D preference?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see ew only and know N opened you want to be in 6@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think this is even worse than 3@H:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: of course, north decline his partner's hearty invitation. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the tone of the set proves that @D won't run|pg||
nt|gsper:  Instructions for voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9:  with the 4@H preempt, declairer knows that trumps are mostly in East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H @H makes for interesting hand too|pg||
nt|kemperg: both majors spec tells|pg||
nt|ady: might try for trumps 3-2  which is 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and helps show why van Prooijen didn't open a non-systemic 'state of match' 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: isn't @C ruff with @S8   8 tricks?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  untill N finds the @s king he may think they missed slam|pg||
nt|ady: well we can see J9 spades with east|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: what is right    2@H  a little conservative|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: right  north just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: however exact methods are not known to us|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D also down 3  so Verhees bidding 1@S with junk  equates to push|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@H for me shows a trick taking suit, one where you do not have to give up the elad 3 times:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: this is not a nice dummy for declarer|pg||
nt|penseur9:  very hard to guess how declarer will handle this hand here|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he is going off -probably a few|pg||
nt|penseur9:  @D ruff ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes K and anor seems best|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer is fortunate that the @HJ falls|pg||
pc|c8|nt|penseur9:  now wat a relief it is :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: and she knows, as Jans girlfriend:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  wife - just married!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is 4@H for NS?|pg||
nt|sybarra: congrats to them@H@H |pg||
nt|ady: heaty seems best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|penseur9:  @C now ???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22  final contract 4@HX|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: now ruff and trump|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it is right to re-bid 3NT to show 6 hearts and 3 spades  with that strength|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: @HA  then @HK shows @D|pg||
nt|ady: nice position though if south has 1 big diamond  queen or jack to give a guess what the play is from?|pg||
nt|mcphee: rather than be pushy with a poor suit if you make the 2@H rebid you are well placed if partner bids again|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  4@Sx makes for headaches for declarer and commentators alike :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|nt|mcphee: if they pass 2@H most days you will be a happy camper|pg||
pc|h7|nt|penseur9:  should have played low|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is 6@D unbeatable?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: looks booked for -2|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: on 23  Jansma opened 2@D [multi] where Schollaard opened 1@S  [and Wortel down in 4@H]     Bos playing 3N East|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: those little baby @H spots in dummy |pg||
mc|5|nt|twcho: south is restraining enough to bid only 2@h but the dummy is really disappointing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: told you @D10 in dummy was nice :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can we replay that with a 2@S opener??|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3x yes so must been unbeatable:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: jaap you were rigth about DD i forgot the @D T|pg||
nt|penseur9:  10 IMPs diff with 9 boards to score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry play sped up there I may have missed something/ got something wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You can not have missed anything very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2-suit then 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid without those toys is wide range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is more a matter of weak two bids are weaker in Europe than NA, so south can be quite light for 1 and 2 spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's nice score for NS|pg||
nt|mcphee: that will lose a few imps I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should be able to get to 6 clubs  with wests great hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ghestem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  looking at wrong card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: michaels|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what am i saying??   28 is last of the set|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now where will this end up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: =4+@S, 10-15 HCP  a) 5@S(332)  b) canape, 4+@S & longer any  c) 6+@S no biddable 4other   NOT 5@S & 5@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@H & minor   DBL=cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bertens loves all of his choices with equal disdain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: It's late :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  East may never respond lite again :-)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: last time i'll copy/paste THAT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: great hand for the system!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does south reopen with DBL?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sunday afternnon so we are all so peacefull:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  sunday morning IMHO|pg||
nt|bobholl: no alert for 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 1-suited, 6+suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6 more imps    only 35 imps behind now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=3-fit Drury  [2@D=4-fit]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|mcphee: I didn't think he was light at all|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ahollan1: well   vP also had to decide to treat the hand as opener rather than preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   east gets to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@D seems to make EW but can it be bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know about 4@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possible  slam try in @C???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would be kool if 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good save  800 if 6 clubs is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 03:10 where i'm trying to stay awake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short suit game try???|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzvc: West before he sees dummy: down 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzvc: Yup screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume so    seems operator is waiting to display bids until after both screenmates bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl might give the save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not a RKC response    looks like cue showing 1st/2nd round control|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out 6NT can make by east    so n/s would need to go to the 7 level for 1100  for a save|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|twcho: the nebulous 1@d deprive NS from competing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this could be manna to n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might be hard to believe, but 1st 3 boards of the set actually were contracts that MADE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite unusual wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be blasphemy,    is west hand automatic 2@S bid opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they do not always alert all bids that need to be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem for me, i am on Marshall Islands time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT have weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he could have responded 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  2@S is the only weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C/@D/@H are all intermediate hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 8-11  3-places to play   so 5431/4441, some 5440|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: if 5431 then yes   but here with wasted round jacks, i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA lead destrys all hope of N here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is on the lead  and some more |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|an|4-5!s, 3!h, 4-5!d, 1!c|nt|twcho: 5@d is a cheap sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid is invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know i'd bid at the table, but not sure it is right|pg||
nt|ady: would you believe that     why save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough to show those solid 8-baggers :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: no save needed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees obviously expected better trump with 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: well surely even if the spades are solid   6 clubs will be a certainty|pg||
nt|ady: east could have had AQJXXX   and stil there can be a 5-1 split    cant be better than playing a solid  8 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've checked   after 2@S Michaels  they use both cue bids to show @S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL starts all good hands with 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  agree with voices from above   why not just Ask Aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since there are 2 ways to set @S then I think immediate 4N should be Standard Blackwood [not Keycard]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't use term "2 cues"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2N and 3@H to show different strength 4+@S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now i'm confused about why not 3@C -- still looking to see if i've made note about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees bids RELAYS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 1@C|pg||
nt|ady: solid 4@S for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D preempts  would also get votes|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is agressive anyway but mostly on the 3@D bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees apologising, saying 6NT may be the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also checking the draft of book  "the art of bidding solid 8 card suits"|pg||
nt|ady: amazing  clubs never mentioned once  with AKQJXXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or semi-solid 9-baggers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so in Ultimate Canape  you either open 3@H or PASS with what others open 2@H or multi 2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=3@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jaapfr: y N feels he has a beauty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: al, what is a 2h opening in VV system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe puppet to 2N to then show long suit try in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: regardless of meaning   they got there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and layout very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|ady: nice red suit splits    |pg||
mb|p!|mb|3D!|nt|twcho: but they don't have any chance to find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's lack of defence will be a deterrenr for future adventures!?|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D completes exact shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Martin  the responses change a bit for passed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have no life :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: auction says nothing about vP's @H length|pg||
nt|penseur9:  might make 4 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West hoped East could bid 3N over 3@S :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 10 of @D an importent card once again |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|roswolf: declarer should get the guesses right|pg||
nt|roswolf: or at least 1 of them|pg||
nt|penseur9:  pretty difficult decision to finesse here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much else for west's double than Qxx(X) IN @h +@c|pg||
nt|penseur9:  right, no entry to is hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might think Verhees short in @C rather than @D   but can't make in that case|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asked about possible shapes in East, not sure what the questions were, answers were 1@D and 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 hcp  5+@H 4+@C     2@D = @H & @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: leaders pulling away again|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|ahollan1: NONE of the Bermuda Bowl partnerships is known for timidity :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @C9 falling this makes, rather surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the practical level, 2D by S might have fetched a making 3N by N. E might well lead spade honor against that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@S forced 3N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: 28-0 so far this set for Het Witte and boards 8 and 9 dont look bad for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: small @D ducked and it can be made|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: now declarer is in danger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  10 in 4@SX|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @SK @D away, @H still works?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now 4@S mild slam try in @S|pg||
nt|ady: 20 bids to get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amateurs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: van Prooijen showed 5341 with bad spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: and 9-11|pg||

nt|chmitty: hard to resist to 7 rounds of trumps when you are down to 5 cards|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: still i believe he will find the @DJ|pg||
nt|chmitty: North will have - by force - to show the K of @s under the ace and West will know for sure he did not have KQ because of the lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: and the Jack of @d will be discovered|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|chmitty: but we are sitting in our chair|pg||
nt|chmitty: at the table it's another story|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chmitty: ha can also mount a double squeeze|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if comes in his mind S to have 3631 then everything can|pg||
nt|chmitty: and make the @s5 as last trick|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|chmitty: also works|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|chmitty: but it's an inferior line|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this the best line 2x double squeeze|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can still at the end decide the @D|pg||
nt|chmitty: kibs suggest that double squeeze does not work|pg||
nt|chmitty: but it does|pg||
nt|chmitty: North has to keep 4@d and then you discard a @d from dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|chmitty: the double squeeze xould probably best a good line without the @d10, but here it's different|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jaapfr: S fearing W to have @SAKX?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: can W have @SAKx and no @DQ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: he could|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|jaapfr: lol|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|chmitty: he will finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or not??|pg||
pc|dT|mc|12|nt|chmitty: soith is marked with K@h, so if he has the @dJ, North would have KD@s ... impossible|pg||
nt|chmitty: South*|pg||

nt|penseur9:  Hi Al|pg||
nt|penseur9:  de Lombard made another 11 IMPs on  23... only 3 IMPs diff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying he thinks 6 poor @S is not good enough to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra will open Verhees' hand with 2@D  = weak @H or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ady: that seems wrong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no overtrick???|pg||
nt|mcphee: back 2 mins|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: maybe west just condeeded a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 22 was another 8 for leaders   [that was 4@S hand that took so long   the other table was 4@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C   6 if taking a peep at the diamond position|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ady: good lay for game in hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = 5-7 hcp|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: wrong Al    westra 2@D is weak EITHER major or ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
nt|ady: trumps 2-2  and diamond finesse helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this interference probably helping EW   both in auction and in play|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = natural, forcing   not sure why it gets alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices discussing 3@S bid on last hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure where n/s were going    but now we know|pg||
nt|ady: surely south will not remove|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one twist is   1@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, but it is possible that other bids/pass  show  canape/5332 shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [3@HW+1]    Jansma playing 2@S South|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 300 to 500|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H    some action|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra hand got a lot better on this auction   but only because East bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: K@C   or Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ for me|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: who knows   @C lead could kill entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|ady: east badly of whichever  lead king of clubs or queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember when most common distributions were  5431 and 4432 ??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen  all of the Bermuda Bowl winners make bids like this|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H does NOT show @S length  it is 'normal'  1-suiter|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense, but declarer will prevail|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  21  [3@CW=]  Westra 2@H after opening 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in 4th seat|pg||
pc|h3|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10  Frank Bakkeren  thinking over the Michaels bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
nt|ady: nice 1 suiter?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice in context of  favorable vul opposite passed partner :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
pc|h5|nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: duck! @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Frank play for Ton to have underled @CA?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest   i typed that before he returned @C9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he needs a second club trick to have a chance, so pretty normal|pg||
pc|hT|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have bid 3@S thinking that 3@H was a psych    so - rather than losing a chance to defend 4@H  worried about what he would do over 4@C-P-P|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who started with duplicate    in the old days   holding 4 of top 5 trump got a bonus of 100 points, 5 of 5 got 150 for honors  [and all 4 aces in NT was 150]|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
nt|ady: duck a spade  and if trumps 3-1   hope 3rd trump has the length in spades|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  need right wiew in clubs and teammates will never notice what happend, my money goes on declarer here |pg||
pc|h7|nt|djneill:  North may pitch a @d, assuming needs South to have @dQ to set it, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  11 to the trailing team|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Frank Bakkeren jumps to 4N over Michaels|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|twcho: while the opponent's bidding shows a likely chance of bad break|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaapfr: especially this one:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course he doesn't have to worry about canape -- but i don't think that should have factored in here either|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s2|nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West surprised now|pg||
nt|ady: tht that was only money bridge Al ?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: final board is 28|pg||
nt|ady: on 23  with the 6 hearts and 3 spades  west chose to re-bid 2 hearts rather than 3NT   and gained 11 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24  Paulissen opened 3rd seat with his balanced 6-count :)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|kemperg: OK 1 down is enough|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: too tired    wondering if Ton should duck 2nd @C    i know doesn't matter on actual layout but ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  22  [3NN+1]  Paulissen North playing 3@C REDOUBLED|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South says sorry for taking @CA, and North sorry for showing wrong count|pg||

mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really did type that before the bid was made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Göran :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which may effectively end this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but mostly rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  vulnerable, but 1-level, 5-5, strong club - lots going for the X|pg||
nt|ady: n/s   will cetainly be ing game     3NT?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|penseur9:  O1 = Onstein1 :0|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thanks G|pg||
mb|2H|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
nt|ady: nice 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 1@H ignores DBL  so   FG  a) BAL [no singleton/void], 8+ HCP  b) 3 places-to-play, 12-14 HCP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: sorry, I was delivering some drinks for the guys, N and E did not think|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good fitting black suits     should make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  10-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and again  DBL=5-7 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S a good save for e/w|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not counting @SJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: we forgive you this one time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no real life kibitzers in the room??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: nope, not allowed|pg||
nt|mcphee: anyone a 3@H bidder as E?|pg||
nt|ady: reasonable|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose dble need not be 5/5  major tho|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm uncertain of auctions after the interference :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play on spades|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose could run 10@S   first round|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices from above make great point   why ONLY 2@H from east|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S good bid -- took away Verhees Michaels call -- so vP limited info|pg||
nt|ady: dbl showes majors?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west's dbl  yes  @H & @S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  not guaranteed    need correct diamond guess|pg||
nt|ady: certainly must defend 4@S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
nt|mcphee: not always 5/5 though correct Al?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: run 10@S   soade to ace and diamond|pg||
nt|ady: spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no lengths given on CC  but vul|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: switch to stiff A@C    and low diamond best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: alert of PASS implies they play PASS/DBL Inversion here   where PASS says willing to defend  and DBL says "i'd like to bid more"|pg||
nt|ady: can get 500|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1:  9 [2@SN=]  Bertens opened 2@S [2-suiter] and was raised  that should mean yet another pickup for White House|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess would be 55 highly probable|pg||
pc|s7|nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: as you see   responder does NOT promise 3+fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1:  25  Jansma playing 6@C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mcphee: so E should have perhaps considered 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I am not a great believer in these defences to strong club   if you dont play the hand the auction reveals too mcuh|pg||
nt|mcphee: i am a major believer you get in their face|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side   you really don't like giving Relay pair a free run in the auction|pg||
nt|mcphee: conventions like Suction or crash dak are good against strong @C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: in the other room on 9 west axed 4@S to gain 5 imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry zal (een beetje) verrast zijn als @H 4 1 zitten|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kemperg: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: now will explore the red suits |pg||
nt|jbennet: west still have sort of guess.|pg||
nt|jbennet: play for klub king south??|pg||
nt|jbennet: or play for at least 1 red suit 3-3?|pg||
nt|kemperg: lots of options now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) he thought 4N keycard   b) he thought 6@C asking 3rd round control|pg||
nt|ady: will not be good if 4 spades reached in OR    but better than 2 spades passed out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suction is called something different in other parts of the world    i think much of europe calls it Kelsey [or maybe Yeslek]   can't recall name in New Zealand/Australia :(|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: :( |pg||
pc|hT|nt|kemperg: even discarding a @H wont matter|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: sry berry will be surprised (a bit) with @H 41|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he will come to 8 tricks now one way or another  |pg||
nt|sybarra: now all ok |pg||
nt|kemperg: claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D was doubled  but Frank didn't give his brother a chance to bid 6N|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: brink smashing his @hJ on the table|pg||
nt|dkkello:  pitch spade  |pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't come to mind at first but it is a good idea|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i miss why he does not play @S7 in a split second?|pg||

nt|sybarra: can he scramble for 8 tricks? |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||

nt|twcho: I think a cautious pass will express his interest in slam too. Clearly forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they also play 4@SX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both Bakkerens in other room |pg||
nt|ahollan1: another strong 1@C|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: unimpressive defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and south will double and north can then bid 5@s to show his genuine interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: harder to make 3N here|pg||
nt|ady: 17 opposite 5     3NT|pg||
nt|ady: this may be a swing back to the leaders|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D 10-15, 0+@D  often [as here] weak NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+|pg||
mb|d|nt|twcho: south will definitely pass then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal  18+bal|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but you were right with the calculator somehow! |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was claimed for 2 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15, 0+@D  maybe @D and LONGER @S/@C, but as we saw with  26  NOT longer @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  the 10 IMP carry over is the difference just now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid W wanted to hear |pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems 4@H should make|pg||
mb|2D|nt|twcho: and they can stay on the makeable level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H is the exception -- it can have 5@S 5@H, 1-suit or  longer 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ HCP, maybe longer @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS = 0-4 or Penalty|pg||
nt|ady: defend  seems right|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is also forcing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb dennis had another ending od the last cards:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think the cards were as i entered, but they didn't see the ending|pg||
nt|penseur9:  somebody could get in trouble her|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: sometimes 8 bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=INV, 2/3@H, usually not 3@S|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 0-5 or penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  a 7 IMP swing for O2 on board  11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers have a bid over 1@D-(X)- to show weak hand with BOTH minors   but our EW need 5+5+|pg||
nt|mcphee: if 2@D is natural 2@H looks odd|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: I didn't notice an alert from Ton Bakkeren, but he still bid 2@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key point for partnership discussion    when you play against Big Clubbers where 1@D could be less than 3   are later @D bids natural or cue??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looks like a 2-way checkback sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 2@C Puppet to 2@D   then 2@H shows 5@H invite|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs  check back   2 diamonds  not 3 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: sorry Al    |pg||
nt|ady: tht checkback   but apparantly not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: XYZ same after 1N rebid  but also applies after  first 3 bids are suits|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzvc: South put the @h2 on the table like it felt bad to lead it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Dennis you were as great as operator as the very high level performance of the 4 players ty|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT looks poor contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i see down 2  any chance for down 3?|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: good in the sense of productive for the defense. pretty normal to lead a heart though|pg||
nt|ady: can only see 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT likely to make on the lay out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 3@H 2@D 1@C   oh  4th @H promotes 2nd trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: when partner played @H6 he should have withdrawn the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both wondering if they could pass 3@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  3 sets of 14 boards -- but sessions begin 30 minutes earlier than today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@C made|pg||
nt|mcphee: the trian went off the rails here|pg||
nt|ady: lucky to escape the red card here|pg||
nt|mcphee: I'll say|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: EW teammates in the Bermuda Bowl   wiijs-muller  playing Tarzan Precision also open 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  but not as part of canape - it helps their relay structure|pg||
nt|chmitty: new leader :)!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Berten again gets another "yukky" trump break |pg||
nt|fabsayc: note verhess can not have four spades and 5 diamonds (no 1@S opening)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to compare  12 imp difference|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|penseur9:  this more about how many extra tricks here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should not have any problem here since cards lye well for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: was missed in OR  so an opportunity for leaders to extend their advantage|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or best line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not fourth best?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "yukky"  is the technical term |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4-2 is the most likely break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertens likes his hand in context   @HQ, 5 card suit  ..|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: tx specs Kjeld and Bob|pg||
nt|bobholl: tytoo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a new lunch leadr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in EW system   opener could be 4@D 5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no reason to get spades wrong|pg||
nt|ady: maybe one more in end position|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: develop a line of play WITHOUT looking at south's  doubleton @HKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing 2@D losers -- how to you cover the @S and trump losers|pg||
nt|penseur9:  how about @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i must hockey so bye|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd/even discard|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: lucky vP didn't play 7|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example   how do you play if trump 41|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the other semi final is afer 24 of 80 97-19 to 't Onstein 1 (Drijver-Brink, Muller de wijs)|pg||
nt|ady: double of this could have put Het Witte almost level|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: and maybe that is the difference between 2@S and 2N      |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX  stalled after trick 3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: good play of K rather than J|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I meant a @S finesse sorry :(|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the rest of the winning Bermuda Bowl team|pg||

pc|d8|nt|penseur9:  @C ???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H ?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @H ruff best|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry missed that|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will give 8 tricks |pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: i meant that many would lead a spade|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession time -- how many of you said this was a blowout after 4th set?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: will be around 44 up adfter this the leaders|pg||
nt|mcphee: i might have passed 1NT dble was W actually|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: anythin but a trump now   down 3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: creates doubt about distribution|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i like Bertens moving over 2@H a lot more than Paulissen PASS|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  26  3N North but EW never bid|pg||
nt|ady: Jansma lost a heart in 6@C   and ran the whole club suit   and got the diamond right in the end game|pg||
nt|ady: yes I would have tht so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played as voice commentators suggested|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too late)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|twcho: as the card lies, there is no making game contract for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h, 5@d and 3NT all go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: East tells to north it isn't going down..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  problems now |pg||
nt|penseur9:  in trouble now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table on their final board|pg||
nt|ady: seems like 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead   @C to Jack|pg||
nt|mcphee: the end of the road is near for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry those 2 plays  the 3N hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: @D9  2nd/4th |pg||
nt|ady: paor that made 3NT in OR will be disappointed with this result|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: pair|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcphee: this hand must have been a misunderstanding for e/w|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: of course declarer does not know clubs are 3-3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  declarer played @S to King then finessed losing to Jack|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bobholl: since i stopped saying huubke iso huub they win :) so i'll continue not saying huubke :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: so why this line that potenitally strands dummy?|pg||
nt|ady: has 9 in the bag now  and 2 long clubs will be 11|pg||

nt|fabsayc: typo|pg||
nt|ady: if west can find a pass can get a few back|pg||
nt|ady: nice swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 3@D  assumes weak @D hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Pre-emptive if East has the weak 2 in diamonds|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Germ writing with me |pg||

pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|twcho: 4@h seems makeable here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the most inspired lead in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@D is supposed to be invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have allowed EW to find @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until partner gets clarification he can't bid in a way that does justice to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Gerben :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Cornelia and Gerben on voice |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
