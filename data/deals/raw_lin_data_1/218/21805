mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|sommer: while Kello is both serious and joking (as always), we here see a possible slam for EW|pg||
nt|snagolf: a very sneaky look at he opps cards and young Bilde can bid 7 @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  No pictures of Vest  Gregers Bjarnasson |pg||

nt|vugraphzyb: he changed his mind to 2@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: with a @c lead does 3@h not go down?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  last night we had a big debat about that subject  :)|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|nt|snagolf: but they will end up in 4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many play it as shortness and forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@c could be 4-5-3 in any way .. South would ussaly bid a major if he had one|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sommer: actually 6@D is a very fine slam|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think theese 4 players are perhaps the aggresive bidders we have in this country?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the most aggresive|pg||
nt|stigw: Ougt to go down, but....|pg||
nt|pelu: not the first time this weekend :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snagolf: but since he more or less i forced to double 2@hs it is very difficult to find when W has 3 card @h-supp|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sommer: this is not for children!|pg||

mb|1H|nt|sommer: ..weak multi..we agree!|pg||
nt|stigw: I think you are right, but South with his AQJx was taken out of the ruling !|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes John Wayne bidding filosofy seems to work just fine here |pg||
nt|pelu: remember B3 - in Open EW in 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: u would need those precesion relay system to get to 7@s knowing that it would win for sure or?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sommer: 4@H NS is still coming|pg||
nt|dkkello:  thats what a call agreesive bidding  ( 2 @D)|pg||
mb|p|nt|snagolf: a good 6 @hs with too much waste in @ss and a @cA that is situated w-r-o-n-g|pg||
nt|sommer: ..and "only" 2 losers;-)|pg||
nt|snagolf: not a good 6 @hs a ... an enterprsing one I mean|pg||

nt|dkkello:  and a world class star from Sweden , good morning Mats Nisland quistion if 7 @S is a winner |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: after this bidding it might get dbl yes.. although if he opens 7@S then drawing the wrong ace could make it win and therefor no reason for dbl or?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skaftij:  Difficult. If South is in chargem how would he know the North has 3@hs and not 3@Ds?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: meanwhile, if you assume W does not have the club queen (as S did), then with several small cards in both minors W might have led diamonds. the Principle of Restricted Choice has ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diverse applications|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in other words, W was a slight favorite to have the D queen, and E was a slight favorite to have the spade queen|pg||

nt|snagolf: a @D sacrifice against either Game in M|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot actually |pg||
nt|snagolf: 4 in either M|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well 4@S can be beaten by east getting a @c ruff with @s A:)?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde can hardly join the bidding   ?|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..a sacrifice from EW doesn't look obvious|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @C-lead would defeat 4@s - @c-ruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Martin has AKQJxxx not vulnerabel , he will make a lot of noise with this one |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think east at least non vull will bid in on anything on strong 1@c trying to get n-s out of balance|pg||

mb|p|nt|skaftij:  3@s the limit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  They have an exellent partnership and work with the system a lot|pg||
mb|1N|nt|snagolf: 3NT now|pg||
nt|dkkello:  gentleman my ...    I know you guys|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: You might never know for sure in board 2, but most likely down 2.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  - 1|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h lead and continuation|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  and Kasper konow- Ander hagen sholud join them i think   ..|pg||
nt|stigw: OK, and they do in fact play at 3 different tables.|pg||
nt|frm: E-W kan make 10 tricks in a heartcontract!|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should |pg||
pc|s4|nt|dkkello:  not yet  |pg||
nt|pelu: strange D by W|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT 12-14|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ws hand is not a nt-hand in my opinion - even if I play weak 1nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Ws hand is more like a multi or weak 2@h for me...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|dkkello:  agree Peter|pg||
nt|snagolf: this D is beyond me|pg||
nt|sommer: the 4-1 break in @D is-no-good for NS|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a lot of presure bidding and thats fine with me , what should Lars do now?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but 4!§C D is good for NS|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: 4@c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all pionts in the black suits|pg||
nt|ralfwil: points....|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the benefit of precision  .. the open very very light  |pg||
nt|stigw: I doubt they reach 4 H.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skaftij:  South presumably asks for help in @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dkkello:  5 @D   then  |pg||
nt|stigw: But 5 di ok too.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snagolf: take the money .. thatta boy|pg||
nt|sommer: agree|pg||
nt|stigw: Again we see a 4-card-support not jumping, I think they play 2 better than 3, and might have 4 card-support even when bidding only 2.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  which North certainly has|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: if north had Kxx in @d could 5@D really win?|pg||
nt|frm: A trumplead against 5 D would not be so nice!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer: ...like betting with Kello?|pg||
nt|pelu: what did Graversen have for lunch?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|dkkello:  talking of money , dont go before we settle a date for the next kierki  |pg||
nt|sommer: ..not for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 3@d was long suit trial bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I am sure they will catch up suddenly  , they can be very very fast  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and of course N-S also have potentiel to make it to the national team  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||
nt|snagolf: maybe Andreas can enlighten us to what Graversen has put in his tea cup .. ?? what was that Double all about. Telliing that he had the @c 8 as well?|pg||
nt|stigw: ot easy, but it should make I think.|pg||
nt|stigw: Not easy I meant.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not easy at all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sommer: 500 is a fine score for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: dono.. i think he alerted it although i am not sure|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: agree, Ralf|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|frm: The opponents cards are well placed for a ceossruff, and now they have missed the opportunity to lead trumps twice. So now it is a make!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s2|nt|pelu: but if u open 1@C what will u bid in next round - then 1NT would be 15-17|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes. I think they can show good support and 4 cards, this was not good enough|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: alert = I had made a bad bid :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H 2 from blakset now |pg||
nt|stigw: Club continuation might have been better.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|dkkello:  one for me  at last|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hi and welcome fredrik MÃ¸rk   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Frederik   even  ..|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sommer: ..must have been something like: My 2@C bid was "serious"??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  hmm|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and welcome our starcommentator  Peter Lund |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|snagolf: of course ... but it fries them totally|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: hello Peter:)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dkkello:  is 500 enough ?|pg||
nt|sommer: not now|pg||
nt|sommer: it was|pg||
nt|snagolf: Lars wasn't punished and we could have seen history in the making ... the November 3 1993 incident (where he made an error) shredded and replaced by a Jan 7 2012 incident|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a @C back  or @D  |pg||
nt|sommer: now NS can take 800, if they dont help @S|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: forced|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
mc|7|nt|snagolf: 800 it is ... Dennis won't be smiling|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes... somtimes you have no rebid:(|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I rebid my 5-card suit and hope for the best....|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C - 1@D - 2@C for sure 6 card suit, so by system u can only open 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I dont see the real problem with 1!n here to be honest... u will have more problems not opening 1!N and if partner opens will problebly at somepoint have to bid 2!n so.. i dont see ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|dkkello:  it is so easy for us who can see all hands   ..|pg||
nt|sommer: but doesn't look like a Martin defence:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snagolf: They have had a great session. This is crux time for the partnership. Lars is not known for his easy going temper (at the table) .. he is fuming even if he shouldn't be|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dkkello:  and wedensday night at the local club , bridge is difficult again |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sommer: 4@H..|pg||

nt|dkkello:  that much .?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: they get 3 hours for 22 boards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dkkello:  should be plenty of time   for a teammatch  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: one would think.. but this table needs to play 4 boards with this one in 15 minuts time to be on schedual|pg||

pc|c9|nt|skaftij:  "Your points were good" Askgaard said|pg||
nt|stigw: So the lesson from board 3 is, that you shouldnt interfere atall versus strong cl ? - I dont believe that, they must have had a seldom misunderstanding|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't think so.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|snagolf: not the dummy he had hoped for|pg||

nt|stigw: Its not so interesting to know the meaning of these bids, but they will surely end up right in 4 H or 3 nt I guess.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Rest is relay from North and mystery|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|dkkello:  but that is often what you buy  ..|pg||

nt|dkkello:  2 @C transfer obviously |pg||
nt|frm: Nice contract - probably 10 tricks!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer: ..right:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yet another case of not jumping to the 3 level with 4 card support|pg||
nt|stigw: Well bid E/W even on that flimsy opening, which I think is their style or system.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: after 3NT in N Martin a close to place N with @h KQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skaftij:  Askgaard just bid 2 @s and there they rested|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a good hand for a system like theirs   after 1 S! what to bid in vest playing natural?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|pelu: they have play 11 boards in Open|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sommer: ...may be a problem now.....|pg||
nt|sommer: too early for @Cruff!|pg||
nt|snagolf: he really didn't believe that the finesse would win|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: I think we started a lillte late.. but we should have started at 12,15 .. so they have used one hour and 40 minuts on 8 boards:)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|stigw: Crossruff all the way, and then count hov many tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  You better not say anything andreas|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dkkello:  probably a flat board  with players at this (high) level |pg||
nt|sommer: ..it depends on...it's VERY difficult to make now!|pg||
nt|snagolf: he needs @hs 2-2 since he is endplayed on his hand .. so he will play a heart now|pg||
nt|sommer: he must play on @H 2-2|pg||
nt|sommer: IF he believes E's carding (low-high=even), he may shift strategy|pg||
nt|snagolf: playing the crowd he is (Yoda-quote)|pg||
nt|snagolf: and what would that strategy be?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  normally they are all very fast players (maybe not Graversen?) |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: They have all but dennis left the table during this hand|pg||
nt|sommer: playing her ladyship, @HQ:)|pg||

pc|c7|nt|dkkello:  a top kibz   , Knut the brother og lars pointed out that it is unfair that Graversen pas with an 11 count in 3 position   , difficult for Martin to play him for that hand|pg||
nt|sommer: ..maybe even full house!|pg||
nt|snagolf: a @c lead would cut this one down to 2 seconds|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he thinks Bilde has the @H  K  of course|pg||

mb|d|nt|stigw: But now Im back, and 3 nt hopeless here, but what about 5 Cl (impossible to bid) ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  1 @C  or 1 @D from Bjarasson|pg||
mb|4S|nt|skaftij:  Disciplined pass by South|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: but do u allways open on anders hand?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  But Bilde - Graversen , my 4 . th pair has had a HUGE session here |pg||
nt|dkkello:  they can open 1 srong @C also with 15 |pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT  should be Gameforcing in precision ?  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bjarnasson has a huge hand now|pg||
nt|stigw: A nice sp-slam here, but hopefully they dont try 7 !|pg||
pc|dA|nt|stigw: Difficult hands to bid from all cormners except North, but I would have doubled 1 sp with Westa hand, even if no 4-card  H.|pg||
nt|stigw: Openeing biddings tend to be more and more aggressive the days, and he is protected by his strong cl, so - I would guess that more than 50 % of strong players would open|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they will find out about the @S Q  and stop in 6  |pg||

nt|dkkello:  anybodys 2 @S  ?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the road to 6 NT   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  but I think 1 @D - 1 @S  3 @S will do the work to at the other tables|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|stigw: In danger of reaching 7 now maybe, but you never can tell.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: or u have picked the first 3 pairs and maded them your favorites :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Even 7 nt has its chances, but not to recommend it.|pg||
nt|frm: E-W usually know what is going on, but I don´t know what the 5 C bid shows??|pg||
nt|dkkello:  7 will fail|pg||
nt|stigw: Asking for sp Q maybe ?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dkkello:  one for me Peter  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  It does help they are in the lead , agree o that one |pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzwa: not the best lead that for sure:)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  no|pg||

pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: harakiri:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and another bad luck for E-V   ?  |pg||
