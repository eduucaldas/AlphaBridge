nt|ahollan1: @H position very friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: trump lead would have been much better -- as a kib points out -- but W naturally wants to get as many tricks in the side suits as he can|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the auction  @SKx looks terrible so need to set up tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: in view of N's long spade suit|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  probably another 3nt NS here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|twcho: but not a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
pc|dA|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|twcho: yes, running score available at http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=c9efb17f-ccb2-4cff-b5bf-3463f7676fc6&round=11&tourid=704|pg||
nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||

pc|c4|nt|famus: after surrendering @d and @h back--puts dec on his back foot to cash out|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||

nt|xenya:  the 1N overcall looks a bit heavy, but perhaps there is no better alternative after W's opening |pg||

nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||

nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
mb|2S!|an|Max with 4!H|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||

nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|h4|nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||

mb|p|nt|penseur9:  slam may be here EW again but hard to get there... again|pg||
mb|5C|nt|penseur9:  3nt going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this point  5+@S  4+@C|pg||
nt|kemperg: the dealing machine in Utrecht has no problems with 8  or 9 suits:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good news   @DK protected     bad news -- they get 5(+) before you get 9|pg||
mb|6D|nt|penseur9:  very tough decision for W here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead beats more than @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N could be lebensohl or scramble here   both make sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike Precision 2@C   here 2@D says nothing about points|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS just discussed, not sure what they agreed after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: E needs to retain @d suit control by not rising up with @dA--i think thats the crux of this hand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for new bridgeplayers , notice how much the bid on very few points |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|famus: @dQ and small|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that won't make Verhees any happier|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||

nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||

nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||

nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in odd/even discards    odd says  "i like this suit"     even says "i don't like this suit, and shows suit preference by size of spot played"|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: EW came back, discussing about the 5@C board board  6 that is|pg||

nt|dkkello:  all 4 dammend good bridgeplayers , we danes envi you big time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra a big fan of responding light to partner's 1M-opening, especially at this vul|pg||

mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  1 NT  ..|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup with relish|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfavorable,  ambivalent suit,  7222 [i.e. outside losers]    3@S still doesn't occur to me|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: good flying from brink drijver :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@D anyone ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jansma might have doubled 2@C if negative|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S strikes me as bold and has tempted north to go on|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by another spec:  If he knows that trumps never break for him it is easy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jaapfr: y DD:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given today's hand agree |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N = @S and 1@S was max. 3 @Ss|pg||
pc|c7|nt|twcho: not everyone will open North hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
mb|2D|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||

nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
pc|s9|nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||

nt|twcho: I think a cautious pass will express his interest in slam too. Clearly forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they also play 4@SX|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: EW teammates in the Bermuda Bowl   wiijs-muller  playing Tarzan Precision also open 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  but not as part of canape - it helps their relay structure|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too late)|pg||

nt|kemperg: see you again and thanks, Shirley, Johann and Bas|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|twcho: 4@h seems makeable here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the most inspired lead in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@D is supposed to be invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have allowed EW to find @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until partner gets clarification he can't bid in a way that does justice to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Gerben :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to Cornelia and Gerben on voice |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: despite the bad break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was 3@C showing @D or  a Relay?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  what's a semi-alert?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: and all kibs for their questions and comments|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: ok, i should have waited for Gerbrand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's when a partially pregnant ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while we wait, a quick reminder that the final will take place on February 4th and 5th... don't miss it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2@S should make but a 2NT by NS probably down... so....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Bas....have a beer on me :)  always helps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hahaha, good idea|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9:  still much to do for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational to suicide?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other table  Bakkeren brothers play 2@C/@D AND 2@H as multi|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|twcho: but really need double dummy play to bring it in|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the Dutch Bridge Federation for bringing us this great tourney ! |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|penseur9:  so +1 it will be|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzvc: South: well played :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs,  great comments and questions   |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  ruffing @Cs may not provide an extra trick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st time i played after reading Larry Cohen's 1st book sure enough 2 boards against cohen-berkowitz    i followed the rules, went for 800 and got sympathy   but still a zero|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: now i'm having flashback to opening of M*A*S*H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  not here Cornelia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great point from Gerben [voice]   with zero controls, Westra could/should assume East has Strong variety|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry and on voice was Ralf Wilquist,  thx to you also |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: that plus Jansma PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @H10 for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since 2C is presumably forcing, S is under no great pressure to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make on diamond return with squeeze and endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  It can make on a diamond return|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: the @c return helps a lot|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Willquist |pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all later |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzvc: Bertens frustrated|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thank you all we'll be back in about 50 minutes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|twcho: now the play is simple|pg||
nt|twcho: just crossruffing and concede two trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  seems the OR is in 3@H here so a swing probable|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|c8|mc|11|nt|Vugraphzvc: See you all in an hour :)|pg||
