nt|ahollan1: Jordan doing Voice Commentary|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today is 2nd half of the final match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 sets of 14 boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|2+!C|mb|p|nt|penseur9:  probably another 3nt NS here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|twcho: possible 6@h for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ hcp, 4+@H, maybe longer @D|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|twcho: but not a good slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D  maybe longer @C/@D but not @H|pg||
nt|ady: no doublt west will emerge with a penalty double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C-1@D=0-6|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most of the Onstein2 lead came in 2nd set where they more than overcame the White House 20 imp carryover [from Round Robin match]|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: e/w have play for 4 spades      but this looks 500-800 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table visible without login via  http://bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  [which also gives access to voice]|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||
nt|gsper:  would have paid, or possibly even made|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are discussing various lines. They have lost me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: terrible hand to lead from |pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: good morning, seems to me heart king then spades is by far the best, almost 100%|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: heart  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|penseur9:  ah OK :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  however, only one @H and two @S to lose... should make|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|d4|nt|aramesh_:  Hello Hasan - Welcome|pg||
nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||
nt|penseur9:  always difficult to second guess declarer on these part score contracts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Sjoert saying 'Thank you' when he was allowed to win the trick|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Kjeld, welcome|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: do not want to play a forcing game|pg||

pc|dK|nt|twcho: hi Hasan|pg||
nt|gsper:  Welcome, Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looking like -1 here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's one wrong guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, spectators|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think i would have won first spade in hand to play clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps Verhees went wrong at trick 1?  yes, he picked up trump, but being in dummy left too few options |pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)  sorry marshall  i was typing   didn't see you got there first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: MARTIN|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: i have been called worse than marshall :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|famus: Hello Tommy & Ara|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|dkkello:  this could be a long afternoon  , but right wiew in @H |pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: ruff a diamond   then a club from south|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzvc: lol|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobholl: only good plays (as usual) from huubke (bertens)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i guess that a misguess in @H makes no difference :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ton duck whichever round suit is led  then Frank can win next round to play 4th @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ady: ruff a spade     same|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other room started with board 13, so we won't be seeing comparisons this set|pg||
nt|ady: 4 trump tricks for west   800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess now  win @HA exit @H|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|gsper:  But N would have differently then|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|penseur9:  well done|pg||
nt|dkkello:  a matter of principels ;) |pg||

nt|penseur9:  making now with one trump to loose|pg||
nt|gsper:  *have bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: White House started the match with 20 imp carryover from the Round Robin|pg||
nt|ady: in fact O got vulnerability right    was 800|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Onstein 2 had big 2nd set to take this 20-something lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are not handicapped by having to type|pg||
nt|ahollan1: progressive lenses don't improve matters |pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|famus: Wonder whether we have the latest leader board results??|pg||
nt|penseur9:  3nt looks like best contract for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: nice hand for bas :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Opinions differ about weak 2 on 7-carder|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|penseur9:  hi Bob, welcome|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Thats a Michaels  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  hi Bob |pg||
nt|kemperg: better speed than in first round:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2 suits then 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 15-17|pg||
nt|gsper:  Or Multi|pg||
nt|kemperg: canape, shorter suit first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=5+@H   note: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: eventually it will come up so a pre-alert   NS opening 2@C/@D/@H are all multi-purpose  either weak in next higher suit  [think transfer preempt]  or various strong hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@D avoids all alerts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is west worth another bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which slam try now from Verhees?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: reach 4@S (3nt down on @C lead)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW system is called Ultimate Canape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: yes, running score available at http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/RoundResult.aspx?section=c9efb17f-ccb2-4cff-b5bf-3463f7676fc6&round=11&tourid=704|pg||
nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be worth at least one try   @D under control, stiff @C  @SA|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: "must" was an overbid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on the downside, king and jack of diamonds may be worthless|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for justification - maybe Verhees worried about @H losers when vP holds less then 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jokes all around about the quality of Ton's preempts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they always seem to have 13 cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7 small is similar to Kxxxxx so often bid the same way|pg||
nt|gsper:  Me too, but some people would not dream of it|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Site: http://www.bridge.nl/uitslagen |pg||
pc|d2|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||
nt|twcho: so EW still has chance to clinch the title|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good lad should still make easely|pg||
nt|gsper:  Especially Law devotees|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS system is Dutch Doubleton|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|twcho: seems quite a no. of options available for declarer here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good bidding from EW here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: 4-1 trump split    but should arrive at 10 tricks  losing 2 hearts and a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  1  Bakkeren brothers get to 5@S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  on board  1, OR in 4@S -1 for 5 IMPs Onstein1|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: jansma looking for a line to make this hand, needs a miracle for that|pg||

nt|bobholl: at least|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff a diamond and a club with 5 and 3 of spades    has not got the entries|pg||
pc|c4|nt|famus: after surrendering @d and @h back--puts dec on his back foot to cash out|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||
nt|fabsayc: defense could always force him to ruff a club if necessary|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gsper:  Yes, it was a bit of an insult to opps|pg||

nt|sybarra: hello all  and hoi Germ |pg||
mb|1D|an|*|nt|twcho: slam time|pg||
nt|penseur9:  NS may have missed a @H trick in previous hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 0+@D often weak NT    maybe @D and LONGER @C/@S [canape] but not longer @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: authorities (especially school people) didn't like the way it went :)|pg||
nt|kemperg: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hola Shirley|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=10-15 HCP, 4+@H  could be 5@H 5@S or 2nd suit LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N @H raise|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=a) 6+@C 1-suit    b) 4+@C and LONGER @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello to Bas! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C shortness   still don't know if 1-suit @H or  longer @S/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think they can find @S now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually less than game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@D was 3+@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy 4 @H's probably +1  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Van Prooijen always has a short suit, Verhees explained|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very practical rebid from Verhees|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  does not look like any contract can ake either side|pg||
nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1@S a nice 3rd hand opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  15  [3NE+2]   Bertens in 5@D after Paulissen got to make lead directing DBL of @C |pg||
pc|cA|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
pc|c9|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
nt|kemperg: no retransfer from Jan|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is because he wants to stop the auction in 4 @H |pg||
nt|kemperg: retransfer has not to mean slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not a great hand for the system|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
nt|kemperg: I think 3@D had been the retransfer|pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@D splinter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse in @D works -- but will it be taken?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW flip-flop PASS/DBL     i think Eric Rodwell gets credit for that inversion|pg||
nt|bobholl: difficult to stop in 4@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends if they take their trump winners|pg||
nt|ady: very likely to go down|pg||
nt|kemperg: @H 41 is rather unlucky|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  already 4 IMPs for EW on board  1... only down one in OR|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|twcho: the winner - Netherlands having three pairs playing 3 different systems IIRC|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|famus: run of the mill board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honestly   i don't know why a 1@D bidder opposite a hand that was willing to play a partscore would be in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry wondering were the @S are on the bidding off course with huub|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi gm ga all|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi jaap :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi bob:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Finis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd @S from hand rather than @H to dummy then @S  since very possible for North to duck with @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then could lose @SA AND defense gets to play 2 round of trump and another potential @S loser|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: even DD i see no way of making this|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @H ruffs and @D 33 looks as best (and only) chance|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: wow   18  the doomed slams    Paulissen-Jansma stop in 3N!!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: we have 3 consecutive tie bds|pg||
nt|famus: possibility of going over board|pg||
nt|penseur9:  slam here for NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another 2@C opener  this time  @C    go figure|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: but expect other room 6@H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=multi  a) 5+@D, 3-10 HCP  b) 1-suit, FG  c) BAL, 20-21/26-27   wonder why Frank didn't try that 1st seat favorable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9:  any chance for slam here?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  EW|pg||
nt|penseur9:  actually a gran slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=4+ but could be balanced|pg||
mb|2H|an|*|nt|twcho: not sure what is 3@c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a bit surprising that NS not playing transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|penseur9:  is 4@H making NS here?|pg||
nt|bobholl: not imo whwn vulbarable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs strong NT|pg||
nt|kemperg: 6@D down on @H ruff|pg||
mb|4N|nt|twcho: but shd be GF hand with @s support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will NS ever bid???|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@S easy make so 5@HX-2 excellent save|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously 3@D some form of @H raise -- but what are the specifics?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: curious   hand upgrades for cuebid  but not good enough for 2@C opener  |pg||
mb|5C|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this method of 4+ spades is unplayable without support doubles, and i think north could double 3@D on this auction to show 3 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: specs say 5@D a better save but i doubt that with this awful distribution|pg||
nt|bobholl: in spite of @S 3 :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|penseur9:  2nt makes but 3 ????|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now vP needs to find @S lead|pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphzvc: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that helps|pg||
nt|ady: low spade best|pg||
nt|ady: should survive  |pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  N may have wanted a little extra strength for that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this seems to have marked the lead, lets see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems @S is only logical choice   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlikely that @CA @C would get partner ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  4@D is pick a major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Gerbrand doesn't tell us -- the opponents don't know either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D says  not 3@H/@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C  0/3 keycards   5@H a bit of a mystery to me   maybe thinking 5@C showed 1 keycard??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 5@C showed 1 KC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank just told me he made a mistake|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank seemed to be stressed out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: blame it all on Kantar|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: That explains it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Bas  that explains 5@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: He says he made three wrong calls :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: so   2236 or 2227|pg||
nt|ahollan1: invite opposite max -- seems forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe vP can change his mind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yep  otherwise i'd sleep|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS leads vs NT = 4th|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bobholl: good news for drijver knows his save is good now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: westra might get a long trump if drijver misguesses in @c|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is thinking about not becoming trump short|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|twcho: both this bd and the last one looks like another 2 flat bds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong side but can the defense take their @H AND kill dummy?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probable @C lead here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: really?   auction seems to highlight @H weakness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Kantar would have been able to ask for keycards at lower level|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gsper:  Voice comentators suggest that they may not support D this high|pg||
nt|ady: there are losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm a @D leader too -- which is why systems in college geared to having me on lead|pg||
nt|ady: if declarer guages this a 4 card suit  then best to cross and take heart finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in this case 3 wrongs = a right|pg||
mc|12|nt|penseur9:  you have a point Al|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Paulissen didn't preempt with north hand on  3  [where 3370]|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: correct spelling  of south   Schollaardt    but bbo field can't fit in last letter|pg||
nt|jaapfr: presumably he will return @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: only @S is rigth|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c first|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still only 8 tricks: 2@S4@H1@Dand 1@C\|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @DATx in W|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry 3 @D and 2@C to loose|pg||
nt|bobholl: but ew have to wait with cashing their 2 @C :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i think E can not deduct all permutations here at this moment so each card now has a risk to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: can cash 1@c, then @s switch sets up @ss before @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they cash 1@C it migth make anyway :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy but how he must know that or tell him:)?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: cashing a @c looks a normal option. Drijver doesn't know Bertens has 5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but the @S switch now or thereafter is vital|pg||
nt|bobholl: 60% bet on making |pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E about to be squeezed if W exits with heart jack i think after clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a bid unfortunate here |pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from  17   Paulissen DBL 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't help the trailing team|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvc: west telling east that he thinks East has a minimum for 3@C|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so White House closes gap to 11|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: east known to have [at least] 9 black cards    how likely is @H finesse to work??|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry, misclick, 6@D was just made ofcourse :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: whew|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Ton played the @HQ upside down and then picked up his cards, shuffled and put them in the board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: too right   first check for @C 3-3  and if that doesn't work  THEN @S play|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  will N simply raise to 3nt here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that hand plays a lot better for NS on defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 4@H/@S and 5+@C  [Raptor]|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT|pg||
mb|1S|nt|twcho: according to rule of 15, east shd pass|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D denies 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tends to deny 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: yes 4H sorry for typo|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Could he misguess @S in 4@H?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i should have alerted that i type transfers:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Haha|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly      the play should be quick as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think i'd vote for 2@S    lots of losers, no quick tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt is sorry for his dummy :)|pg||
nt|ady: will be happy to see Q@D appear|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzvc: West happy East didn't get doubled in 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  game force , but wich one ? |pg||
nt|gsper:  We will never know|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would be terrified to double with west hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i made comment about Verhees NOT holding 4@H because they play Raptor NT overcalls, so  (1@S)-1N would show 4@H & 5+@C/@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Raptor NT overcalls   so 1N here would show 4@H and 5+@C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this could be a  Slawinski spot card lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i need a cheat sheet to even try to explain|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but there is sonme slight consolation in that you are not doubling them into game|pg||
nt|gsper:  You are not alone|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still there could be overtricks, or a XX with nowhere to go.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: ok makes sense|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: i've had some good results playing raptor -- but always felt uncomfortable having to use DBL to include a normal strong NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems strange to win @CA and THEN think -- when i've done that it usually means i shouldn't have won the trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  3  4@H made for a push|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's on their CC http://www.bridge.nl/groepen/Wedstrijdzaken/1112/Lombard_Schollaardt&Wortel.pdf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 180 on the way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  4  Ton Bakkeren stops in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 of the pairs on the winning Bermuda Bowl team play that  and a couple of pairs from Germany|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: ah   hi=odd without honor  or   even with honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D was likely to be down 1|pg||

pc|c2|pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  now the question is only how many overtricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: will be a struggle to make this 2@H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 3 @H makes 8 or 9 now |pg||
nt|ady: now there will be a claim|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dkkello:  :)  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  Maybe Drijver even guess the @D J |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|jaapfr: hoi kjeld welcome|pg||
nt|bobholl: not quite sure of 9 tricks :) (after @H now) has to go for it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if @H now he has to go for @C 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @c2 lead, so he knows @c break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: assuming they lead 3rd/5th|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@D could be made if double finesse|pg||
nt|bobholl: assumed that too but migth be 5 :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: in @D|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but it is not a speedball tournament today ... |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bertens doubled on 2@c for t/o of @h|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Dennis , is there any timeproblems at this table?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||
nt|kemperg: stuck?|pg||
nt|gsper:  OK, not in this case where S has passed|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: they have 54 min left fot 9 boards now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: 51 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
nt|kemperg: so 3 level for this combination, not advised with these bad suits|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C opening would make things interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and she did pass. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks the likely contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0+@D  but never fewer|pg||
nt|sybarra: Paulissen would have prefered a @S ruff no doubt  that might break up he end play |pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9:  big swing on board 5... slaam bid and made in OR|pg||
nt|penseur9:  for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common hand type is weak NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: for EW CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/vanprooijen-verhees.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can have 4+@D and longer @S or @C, but never longer @H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well defended|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  are we looking at another 3NT by EW again?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you 1% serious?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: Many ask what is rule of 15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
nt|sybarra: smolen |pg||
nt|ahollan1: totally serious that it would make it interesting    0% serious that it was a bid that would be considered|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Alerted by Ton, not Frank|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: you can see explanation |pg||
nt|sybarra: Bertens never gets a decent trump break?? |pg||
nt|sybarra: jansma coming in now? |pg||
nt|kemperg: yes 4@S, 5+@H, gamef or stronger|pg||
nt|sybarra: at least only 4/1 this time  |pg||
nt|sybarra: does he have the entries for that Cornelia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|kemperg: 4@H is minimum, so W wont try slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: Cornelia suggesting that if Bertens plays the Ace of @H, he could finess the 10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if 2N just forcing or specifically showing ????|pg||
mb|3H|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, 2nt as a forcing bid is interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bos ducked 2 rounds of @H and flew @CA  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  gtg , be back a little later , very good bridge we see today , |pg||
nt|penseur9:  thanks see you later|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: hmm got there despite the systen!?:)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  if we remember that EW had a 10 IMp carry over, de Lombard team doing good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  seems that 2@S should go down here|pg||
nt|gsper:  N will agree with me that S did not have his double|pg||
nt|kemperg: he does with 15 to 15/14|pg||
nt|sybarra: too high now on a @D lead |pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   looks like being down    2 hearts better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if vanProoijen had rebid 2@H that would have been 5@H invite!|pg||
nt|ady: might make 2NT  if the clubs get entangles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why that wasn't his choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma already apologised|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: this will make thanks to 33 @d|pg||
nt|twcho: east has to determine whether her partner leads a singleton or from 765|pg||
nt|penseur9:  oops|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought that was a Kokish-ism   after opener shows 6-card major, 2N forcing|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|vugraphzvc: Muller - de Wijs missed 4@s on bd 5, so now 14 imps difference|pg||
nt|gsper:  That lead makes it easier, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe not but i dont think north had any extras after his 2@D bid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: from 109 combinations they lead the 10 and with 9xxx 2nd highest, so 9 promises a honor|pg||
nt|jaapfr: my simple statement was too soon (is more to the hand than i thought initially)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Frank didn't realise 2NT was artificial he said|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|ady: well if 2 hearts would have been an invite    why not   instead of 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: his actual sequence was still invite but showing one or both 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: ducking the club  stopped any defensive problems with the suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good cash|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy avoidance play to guarantee the contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: avoidance play -- finesse into East to protect the @CJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: seems everything wrong sided here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but no way to know |pg||
nt|fabsayc: now he cant afford to duck|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now what   @S or high @C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the line in vegas       vanProoijen was bidding 5@D|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: duck and take 10 or fly ace to take 10   tough choice|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kemperg: only doubledummy will work:(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: still if clubs were 2-2 was not hopeless|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1:  19  Paulissen in 5@D  as expected another swing for the leaders|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gsper:  !!|pg||
nt|ady: could have mae  playing a spade when in the east hand with 10@D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: i wish i was awake enough to analyze @CJ/9 shift|pg||

pc|s8|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: South checked that when West played @Cq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: @C4*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in odd/even discards    odd says  "i like this suit"     even says "i don't like this suit, and shows suit preference by size of spot played"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 19 open room stopped sanely in 5@D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|twcho: since there is only one entry to dummy, declarer has to hope for even break in both red suits to bring in her contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: will that@D  play persuade dec to play for @h 4-1 ?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case it wasn't mentioned    20  where Wortel made overtrick in 5@SX    Bos was down 1 in 5@CX   so 2 12-imp pickups in a row for de Lombard|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: :)  ruff sluff  tough to find in NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: westra a big fan of responding light to partner's 1M-opening, especially at this vul|pg||
nt|gsper:  If kibs want response to chats, it is polite to have your full name in your profile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N="almost forcing"|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  1 NT  ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that is a hefty 1@H overcall :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: it looks as if the table with bauke(muller) will finish before the one with hubbke(bertens) incredible :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  keep the flies away sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w sensibly keeping their heads down|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s mustnt get carried away|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS might reach 4@S, guess West will dbl that|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup with relish|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unfavorable,  ambivalent suit,  7222 [i.e. outside losers]    3@S still doesn't occur to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3NT looks lik an reasonable contract in EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough choice vul at imps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: no support doubles|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should make  as south has only 1 entry to play diamonds threw the king|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: good flying from brink drijver :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: but i think it's becoming common practice to respond light here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  not against theese guys however , the can smell a vul game |pg||
nt|dkkello:  or more!|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D anyone ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: jansma might have doubled 2@C if negative|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S strikes me as bold and has tempted north to go on|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by another spec:  If he knows that trumps never break for him it is easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D10 prevents defense from taking 3 tricks in the suit without declarer's help|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaapfr: y DD:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: given today's hand agree |pg||
nt|kemperg: 1N = @S and 1@S was max. 3 @Ss|pg||
pc|s8|nt|twcho: not everyone will open North hand|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@c is probably 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: west asleep!?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we're seing very agressive bidding here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean to pass 2@S?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|twcho: forcing his partner to bid 2@d|pg||
nt|twcho: and then 2@h is an invitaional bid showing at least 54 M|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: NS are still juniors, what do you expect :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead best to try and remove entry to 4th club   but 8@H is an entry|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed with age comes caution because only juniors and madmen know no fear:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: helps to play some form of Bart or Gazilli|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: nice @D10 in East hand    for 4@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 3 swings this set   all double digit|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we have big swingers :0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect @H10 to show @D preference?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you see ew only and know N opened you want to be in 6@D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|twcho: of course, north decline his partner's hearty invitation. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think the tone of the set proves that @D won't run|pg||
nt|gsper:  Instructions for voice commentary: http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743|pg||

nt|penseur9:  with the 4@H preempt, declairer knows that trumps are mostly in East|pg||

nt|kemperg: both majors spec tells|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Sorry play sped up there I may have missed something/ got something wrong|pg||
nt|gsper:  You can not have missed anything very interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S  if 2-suit then 2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid without those toys is wide range|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think is more a matter of weak two bids are weaker in Europe than NA, so south can be quite light for 1 and 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should be able to get to 6 clubs  with wests great hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play Ghestem|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does south reopen with DBL?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sunday afternnon so we are all so peacefull:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  sunday morning IMHO|pg||
nt|bobholl: no alert for 4@S ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = 1-suited, 6+suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well   vP also had to decide to treat the hand as opener rather than preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right   east gets to bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9:  5@D seems to make EW but can it be bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know about 4@H :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: possible  slam try in @C???|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would be kool if 4@H is RKC|pg||
nt|ady: 6 diamonds a good save  800 if 6 clubs is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anyone know if screens in use?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 03:10 where i'm trying to stay awake|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvc: West before he sees dummy: down 2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzvc: Yup screens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i assume so    seems operator is waiting to display bids until after both screenmates bid|pg||
nt|kemperg: dbl might give the save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D not a RKC response    looks like cue showing 1st/2nd round control|pg||
nt|ady: as pointed out 6NT can make by east    so n/s would need to go to the 7 level for 1100  for a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: the nebulous 1@d deprive NS from competing|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well this could be manna to n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it might be hard to believe, but 1st 3 boards of the set actually were contracts that MADE|pg||
nt|penseur9:  quite unusual wasn't it? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might be blasphemy,    is west hand automatic 2@S bid opposite passed hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they do not always alert all bids that need to be alerted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no problem for me, i am on Marshall Islands time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees did NOT have weak 2@H bid available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he could have responded 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for EW  2@S is the only weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C/@D/@H are all intermediate hands|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: if 5431 then yes   but here with wasted round jacks, i'm not so sure|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @CA lead destrys all hope of N here|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is on the lead  and some more |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: 5@d is a cheap sacrifice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S rebid is invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know i'd bid at the table, but not sure it is right|pg||
nt|ady: would you believe that     why save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough to show those solid 8-baggers :(|pg||
nt|kemperg: no save needed:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees obviously expected better trump with 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: well surely even if the spades are solid   6 clubs will be a certainty|pg||
nt|ady: east could have had AQJXXX   and stil there can be a 5-1 split    cant be better than playing a solid  8 card suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've checked   after 2@S Michaels  they use both cue bids to show @S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so DBL starts all good hands with 4th suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  agree with voices from above   why not just Ask Aces|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since there are 2 ways to set @S then I think immediate 4N should be Standard Blackwood [not Keycard]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i shouldn't use term "2 cues"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they use 2N and 3@H to show different strength 4+@S raises|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now i'm confused about why not 3@C -- still looking to see if i've made note about it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @D preempts  would also get votes|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is agressive anyway but mostly on the 3@D bid :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees apologising, saying 6NT may be the top spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also checking the draft of book  "the art of bidding solid 8 card suits"|pg||
nt|ady: amazing  clubs never mentioned once  with AKQJXXXX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or semi-solid 9-baggers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so in Ultimate Canape  you either open 3@H or PASS with what others open 2@H or multi 2@D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaapfr: y N feels he has a beauty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: al, what is a 2h opening in VV system|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|twcho: but they don't have any chance to find it|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's lack of defence will be a deterrenr for future adventures!?|pg||
nt|kemperg: undo|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction says nothing about vP's @H length|pg||
nt|penseur9:  might make 4 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West hoped East could bid 3N over 3@S :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  the 10 of @D an importent card once again |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: declarer should get the guesses right|pg||
nt|roswolf: or at least 1 of them|pg||
nt|penseur9:  pretty difficult decision to finesse here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not much else for west's double than Qxx(X) IN @h +@c|pg||
nt|penseur9:  right, no entry to is hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: might think Verhees short in @C rather than @D   but can't make in that case|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South asked about possible shapes in East, not sure what the questions were, answers were 1@D and 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15 hcp  5+@H 4+@C     2@D = @H & @D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: NONE of the Bermuda Bowl partnerships is known for timidity :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @C9 falling this makes, rather surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the practical level, 2D by S might have fetched a making 3N by N. E might well lead spade honor against that auction|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or a heart|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|bobholl: small @D ducked and it can be made|pg||
pc|sK|nt|penseur9:  will go down now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the other room playing  10 in 4@SX|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9:  I could be wrong :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: how loud were the gasps when dummy came down?|pg||
nt|ady: a bigger lead for Onstein after this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is result of using 1-level canape openings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: notice these strange meanings are forced to allow consistency in canape structure|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Verhees saying he thinks 6 poor @S is not good enough to rebid 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra will open Verhees' hand with 2@D  = weak @H or various strong hands|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wrong Al    westra 2@D is weak EITHER major or ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C like the precision 2 @C  can have a 4 card major |pg||
pc|s5|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H = natural, forcing   not sure why it gets alert|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voices discussing 3@S bid on last hand|pg||
nt|ady: not sure where n/s were going    but now we know|pg||
nt|ady: surely south will not remove|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one twist is   1@S only promised 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure, but it is possible that other bids/pass  show  canape/5332 shapes|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  9 [3@HW+1]    Jansma playing 2@S South|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 300 to 500|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Westra hand got a lot better on this auction   but only because East bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: K@C   or Q@H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HQ for me|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: who knows   @C lead could kill entry to partner's hand|pg||
nt|ady: east badly of whichever  lead king of clubs or queen of hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember when most common distributions were  5431 and 4432 ??|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
nt|sybarra: so even this hand Bertens gets a 3/1 break |pg||
nt|sybarra: better than 4/0 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I bet he is thinking about that option |pg||
nt|ahollan1: good defense, but declarer will prevail|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in 4th seat|pg||
pc|c9|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  10  Frank Bakkeren  thinking over the Michaels bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
pc|cK|nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
nt|kemperg: duck! @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Frank play for Ton to have underled @CA?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honest   i typed that before he returned @C9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well he needs a second club trick to have a chance, so pretty normal|pg||
pc|c6|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP might have bid 3@S thinking that 3@H was a psych    so - rather than losing a chance to defend 4@H  worried about what he would do over 4@C-P-P|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  need right wiew in clubs and teammates will never notice what happend, my money goes on declarer here |pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: 15 minutes remaining on the clock|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S never has shorter 2nd suit  could be 4@S with 5+other|pg||
nt|gsper:  I have to leave now. Thank you Bas for a great job (goes without saying)|pg||
nt|gsper:  And Martin, Marshall and informative kibs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 5@S 5@H opens 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might well be some fight between the majors of e/w|pg||
nt|penseur9:  9 IMPs on 10 for O1 for a 2IMP now... it's anybodies game now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i really did type that before the bid was made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Göran :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which may effectively end this match|pg||
mb|d|nt|penseur9:  O1 = Onstein1 :0|pg||

nt|marlowepi: thanks G|pg||
mb|2H|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
nt|ady: nice 4@S for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good fitting black suits     should make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D  10-15 HCP, 5+@H 4+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
pc|c6|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||
nt|kemperg: on board 22 2 down in 3NT, big win for Onstein|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not this opening is very preemptive on partner, this is excellent 4@H game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees could raise with something exceptional|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: 2@D= ANY INVIE!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@D=ART INV  a) 3/4@S  b) NT  c) 3@H/@S & 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H jump probably does NOT set up forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: that was that crazy hand "wrong sided" at both table |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: ty al|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to find the 9th trick here |pg||
nt|sybarra: but hts are 3/3  so should not be difficult |pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try a @H early,  that gets the club ace out of N hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry I mean a @C early |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|penseur9:  will declarer guess the trump the right way?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: total performance of all 4 here very high imo|pg||
nt|dkkello:  agree |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: last set almost half of the boards were double digit swings   here, the biggest exchange is 3 imps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: at 04:36  i should copy/paste rather than try to remember :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my     Ton bid over 6@C  so he really did think 4N was keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final is 7@C|pg||
pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 5@H isn't exceptional|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|penseur9:  looks like +2 here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: on  25  vLankveld overcalled 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  9  [vP's 3@S opener]    Bos opened 1@S and Lankveld declaring 3N West|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we seam frozen here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: no North thinking|pg||
nt|ady: unusual to be doubled in a solid 10 card fit   but should get 300|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: Is 6@s an odd on bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about this hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: yes, she is.. |pg||
nt|penseur9:  ok tks :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|penseur9:  again a reminder that EW had a 10 IMP carry over so very thight play here |pg||

nt|twcho: I think a cautious pass will express his interest in slam too. Clearly forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they also play 4@SX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and both Bakkerens in other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unimpressive defense|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|twcho: and south will double and north can then bid 5@s to show his genuine interest|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: south will definitely pass then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 16+ unbal  18+bal|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but you were right with the calculator somehow! |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was claimed for 2 down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10-15, 0+@D  maybe @D and LONGER @S/@C, but as we saw with  26  NOT longer @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|penseur9:  the 10 IMP carry over is the difference just now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|sybarra: just the bid W wanted to hear |pg||
nt|fabsayc: it seems 4@H should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: and they can stay on the makeable level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H is the exception -- it can have 5@S 5@H, 1-suit or  longer 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=7+ HCP, maybe longer @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S is also forcing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb dennis had another ending od the last cards:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: i think the cards were as i entered, but they didn't see the ending|pg||
nt|penseur9:  somebody could get in trouble her|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sometimes 8 bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N=INV, 2/3@H, usually not 3@S|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good stop|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|penseur9:  a 7 IMP swing for O2 on board  11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many big clubbers have a bid over 1@D-(X)- to show weak hand with BOTH minors   but our EW need 5+5+|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: good lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: looks like a 2-way checkback sequence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 2@C Puppet to 2@D   then 2@H shows 5@H invite|pg||
nt|ady: 2 clubs  check back   2 diamonds  not 3 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|ady: sorry Al    |pg||
nt|ady: tht checkback   but apparantly not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: XYZ same after 1N rebid  but also applies after  first 3 bids are suits|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: South put the @h2 on the table like it felt bad to lead it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx Dennis you were as great as operator as the very high level performance of the 4 players ty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: good in the sense of productive for the defense. pretty normal to lead a heart though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: 3NT likely to make on the lay out|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: when partner played @H6 he should have withdrawn the lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: EW both wondering if they could pass 3@H :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tomorrow  3 sets of 14 boards -- but sessions begin 30 minutes earlier than today|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW teammates in the Bermuda Bowl   wiijs-muller  playing Tarzan Precision also open 1@H with 5@H and 5+@S  but not as part of canape - it helps their relay structure|pg||
nt|chmitty: new leader :)!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and Berten again gets another "yukky" trump break |pg||
nt|fabsayc: note verhess can not have four spades and 5 diamonds (no 1@S opening)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|penseur9:  this more about how many extra tricks here|pg||
nt|penseur9:  should not have any problem here since cards lye well for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: was missed in OR  so an opportunity for leaders to extend their advantage|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: or best line for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not fourth best?|pg||
nt|sybarra: "yukky"  is the technical term |pg||
nt|Gerben42:  4-2 is the most likely break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bertens likes his hand in context   @HQ, 5 card suit  ..|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx specs Kjeld and Bob|pg||
nt|bobholl: tytoo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and a new lunch leadr|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but in EW system   opener could be 4@D 5+@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no reason to get spades wrong|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: develop a line of play WITHOUT looking at south's  doubleton @HKJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing 2@D losers -- how to you cover the @S and trump losers|pg||
nt|penseur9:  how about @H finesse now?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i must hockey so bye|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: lucky vP didn't play 7|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: example   how do you play if trump 41|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: the other semi final is afer 24 of 80 97-19 to 't Onstein 1 (Drijver-Brink, Muller de wijs)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe that is the difference between 2@S and 2N      |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX  stalled after trick 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: good play of K rather than J|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I meant a @S finesse sorry :(|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: that's the rest of the winning Bermuda Bowl team|pg||

nt|penseur9:  yes @H ruff best|pg||
nt|penseur9:  sorry missed that|pg||
nt|dkkello:  will give 8 tricks |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: i meant that many would lead a spade|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: will be around 44 up adfter this the leaders|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: creates doubt about distribution|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: i like Bertens moving over 2@H a lot more than Paulissen PASS|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too late)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|twcho: as the card lies, there is no making game contract for NS|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@h, 5@d and 3NT all go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: East tells to north it isn't going down..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  problems now |pg||
nt|penseur9:  in trouble now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table on their final board|pg||

nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: ok, i should have waited for Gerbrand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's when a partially pregnant ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while we wait, a quick reminder that the final will take place on February 4th and 5th... don't miss it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2@S should make but a 2NT by NS probably down... so....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx Bas....have a beer on me :)  always helps |pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Hahaha, good idea|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still much to do for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational to suicide?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other table  Bakkeren brothers play 2@C/@D AND 2@H as multi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: played from other side  this still won't be a treat for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you have two nearly identical suits (like north here) does anybody have a rule on which to lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS do play Smith Echoes vs NT|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: well not so much|pg||
pc|s6|nt|twcho: but really need double dummy play to bring it in|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the Dutch Bridge Federation for bringing us this great tourney ! |pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: not much joy here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: flatish 15 opposite flatish 9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|penseur9:  so +1 it will be|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IFF auction doesn't offer any hints  then highest pip count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but here  West did show @H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzvc: South: well played :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx specs,  great comments and questions   |pg||
pc|c4|nt|penseur9:  ruffing @Cs may not provide an extra trick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st time i played after reading Larry Cohen's 1st book sure enough 2 boards against cohen-berkowitz    i followed the rules, went for 800 and got sympathy   but still a zero|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: yes not perfect example, but in fact i use the lowest pip count, and my stats are better than 50%|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i read somewhere   87.3% of all statistics are fabricated|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3cxx made somehow, so the match still has a heartbeat|pg||
nt|fabsayc: never trust any stats with decimal points|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: now i'm having flashback to opening of M*A*S*H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  not here Cornelia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great point from Gerben [voice]   with zero controls, Westra could/should assume East has Strong variety|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry and on voice was Ralf Wilquist,  thx to you also |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@CXX did make   but only worth 5 imps to trailing team|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that plus Jansma PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @H10 for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since 2C is presumably forcing, S is under no great pressure to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make on diamond return with squeeze and endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  It can make on a diamond return|pg||
pc|sK|nt|twcho: the @c return helps a lot|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: *Willquist |pg||
nt|sybarra: cu all later |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Bertens frustrated|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thank you all we'll be back in about 50 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks everyone, hope to see you tomorrow at 10 AM Paris and 9 AM London|pg||
pc|s5|nt|twcho: now the play is simple|pg||
nt|twcho: just crossruffing and concede two trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|penseur9:  seems the OR is in 3@H here so a swing probable|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: martin  that reminds me of scene from West Wing   one politician talking to another  "those numbers are a lie!!"      "yes, but hear me out"|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
mc|4|nt|ahollan1: 90 minutes to restart   |pg||
