mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|dkkello:  So in this little redicilous country we are all friends or relativs , so it is not political correct to say who you wants to represent Denmark  .. :)  but i will |pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: wd - EW can take 8-9 trick in @s|pg||

nt|skaftij:  many down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: If anders where gonna lead a @s might aswell lead the K?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Agree, and so do kibs|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No doubt, it is the right lead|pg||
nt|stigw: I think 2 cl is either just GF or a canape.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Even if we do benefit from seeing all 4 hands|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

pc|h4|nt|frm: Probably 11 on a crossruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  og Bilde - graversen   very close to   |pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not 4@d from E?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snagolf: well . QTx in @ds helps nut you take the @s force on that hand as well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|snagolf: nut=but|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and Kello of course as a first substitute   |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|sommer: ok, you but:)|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of play when @DQ drop out after 1 ruff|pg||
nt|dkkello:  he said but |pg||
nt|stigw: If partner should happen to have the singleton Ace,  he has signalled a H shift at the same time maybe.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: this is the only lead that beats 4@h is it not?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dkkello:  nice lead p  thank you   |pg||
pc|d7|nt|stigw: Now it isnt nice to play on.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No, King is just King|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzwa: has to play for @d Qxx in place and @c ace well placed or?|pg||

nt|dkkello:  Poor Marquadsen  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|dkkello:  12 point vs your own big NT and yet  |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i was thinking that with a lead like @C Q for say that now u could pitch a @D on @s and win this way?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|h5|nt|dkkello:  come on , have to make it to the store   ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but not easy  |pg||
nt|pelu: but problems for decl if he try to play on @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 45 minuts for 6 boards :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that u has to ruff with @h2 and later u will have to ruff the 3. @d with @hQ - so my analyse was wrong - no way to make after D-lead|pg||
nt|pelu: but after a non-@D-lead u can set-up @ss and only 3 losers|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  test , do we have Werdelin back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  when you are in heat 1 you getaway with a bid like that (2 @D)|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: E-W keep bidding Hagen suits:)|pg||
nt|stigw: No makeable dame here, I think, even if it certainly looks so.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: and Hagen looked like one who wanted to bid 1@h:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi Mats , welcome back|pg||
nt|pelu: wellcome back - and u are right Mats|pg||
nt|stigw: Askgaard & Bjarnason has certainly had thir big share of unluck in this session. Only in board 1 did miss Foruna smile their way,|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dkkello:  n-s can steel the pot maybe in 2 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  he stold the pot   ..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  for 1 down?  |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  take out   |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Many would|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, sorry, It makes unless Di Ace and di for ruff.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Will not happen|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @h lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but also 2 missed games|pg||
nt|dkkello:  board 5 and 7 they could have done better  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 16 og course|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 9  .. :)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|stigw: Impossible to find that defence I would say, unless you have seceret singleton-signals (not invented yet I guess).|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: sorry Konow was thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  maybe board 9 ?  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: on board 13 - where Lars pass to 1NT - Open was in 2@H in N - and decl didnt find the best play - could make but down 200 - and 7 IMP|pg||
nt|snagolf: looks like 6 losers|pg||
nt|dkkello:  so fare I made 20 prediction , none come true but this is not that bad |pg||
nt|sommer: no game for EW with best defence, I guess, so 200 is good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..thats why I said: "Can he"?:)|pg||
nt|stigw: 9 I agree, but both 5 and 7 is just like 16 and 17 unlucky.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dkkello:  could be 1 or 2 NT on east hand without small NT by Blakset|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyb: current standings are: coldea 124, teodorescu 120, valeanu 112, filip 101, georgescu 90, grigoriu 83|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sommer: 2@H looked very difficult to make|pg||
nt|stigw: 15 and 16 I mean, on a lucky day they both make, and 5 and 7 are both down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N!|nt|dkkello:  Blakset is outstanding in playing contracts on the 2 level , doubled   maybe he can do something |pg||
nt|frm: The cards are certainly not well placed for W-E here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: yes Stig, but I think you want to be in game, even if it will fail|pg||
mb|6D|nt|pelu: a bet?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  like sneeking the 10 of @S   in trick 2   |pg||
nt|dkkello:  only if you agree to play Kierky soon |pg||
nt|pelu: I do - huirrab - hurra - hurra|pg||
nt|dkkello:  clubs ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: ..here, he can play well for -200|pg||
nt|vugraphzyb: if 5nt fac ? kings, nice upgrade from S :)|pg||
mb|7H|nt|dkkello:  and a 3 imps loose ? maybe more if E-V overbid at other table |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|snagolf: exactly .. neither more nor less|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyb: *was |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|pelu: why @h7 for ruff and not @h5 (asking for @c?|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: i am sure it was 1@c:)|pg||

nt|sommer: ..WHAT a blunder..but we all know, it's difficult|pg||
nt|stigw: They bid and made 5 cl in board 10 in the Open room, remarkable (but Spouth didnt opne, and the way for the strong cl was there).|pg||
nt|skaftij:  On bd 15, EW had come to a rest in 3@c (the hand with KJxxxxx against 17 HCP) |pg||
nt|skaftij:  South did regret reopening |pg||

mb|1D|nt|pelu: ruff and discard on this level :(:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Blakset - Schaltz are having a good set|pg||
nt|stigw: In 15 Konow Hagen stopped in 4 sp, so the grand slam certainly was an expensive gamble.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|stigw: In any way much better that 2 di !|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 @H   dont like , but of course a matter of style i quess|pg||
mb|p|nt|snagolf: East carefully petered in @cs (and @ss)... what sjape did W think he had?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  N-S  steeling again   they are hot   |pg||

nt|snagolf: first time we see the Xfer bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I told you they are very fast ? hmm  what do I know ..|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if you had not guessed |pg||
nt|snagolf: N's 1@h is @ss|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u can defeat 4@s: @DA, @DQ for tuff and @S2 back|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H 2|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry @hx back|pg||
nt|pelu: why alert om 1Nt?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s on board 15 had been 11 in instead of 11 out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzwa: dono.. Clemesen alertet it|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Clemensen*|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Talking about light doubles Red vs Green|pg||
nt|stigw: Good stab by Andreas here.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: a bet: Lars will make?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  but he will lead a @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  baord 18 wes 1 down , tx Charlotte koch Palmund |pg||
nt|dkkello:  former olympic gold medalist  |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and many other things!  |pg||
pc|h2|nt|snagolf: so!!! ... 4@s ended up in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|pelu: in B16 Konow had a @S-lead against 3NT to @sJ, and in on @cK N played @S = 9 toptricks . NS never found their 4 @D-tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: e-w seems a lvl to high now?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sommer: nope..Lars will make with overtrick:)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes a bet  :)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..putting pressure on W's minors|pg||
nt|sommer: ..or just raise a @C|pg||
nt|pelu: he can just ruff a @C and 11 reicks|pg||
nt|dkkello:  lead the queen next time , dosent matter but  |pg||
nt|snagolf: very very boring contract now |pg||
nt|dkkello:  spending the time they have been saving up  ,   NOT   |pg||
nt|sommer: big score and very sloid start for "the new constellation" in NS|pg||
nt|sommer: ..solid..|pg||
nt|dkkello:  zzz|pg||
nt|pelu: but they have Askgaard-Bjarnarson os team-mates here . they also have to compere with the 3. tabble where Hagen-Konow are EW|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dkkello:  E-V are behind with 66 imps , many due to just plain stupid things like not using stayman|pg||
nt|dkkello:  bidding slam missing 2 aces |pg||
nt|dkkello:  and so on |pg||
pc|h4|nt|dkkello:  ahmm |pg||
nt|pelu: in 3Nt there are 3@s, 2@h + 2 @d + 2@c = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dkkello:  we are beyond that  |pg||
nt|frm: 4 SP is a make with 19 HCP|pg||

nt|dkkello:  and a black queen |pg||
pc|c5|nt|nilsland:  W probably thinks then E has @c support|pg||
nt|pelu: in 4NT u can play for 3@c-tricks = 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: on their way to grand|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I think the need the lunchbreak |pg||
nt|frm: A low heart from Askgaard to the 10 i north endplays N to give up trick no 4 |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: Clemmensan was suprised that p passed saying that there problebly is misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|nilsland:  They need 11 tricks which may be possible|pg||
nt|dkkello:  if you can make 3 you can make 4 you can make 5  ..  |pg||
nt|pelu: I can see 10 tricks, but where are the 11.?|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @D lead    |pg||
nt|nilsland:  That is the question|pg||
nt|dkkello:  there is something rotten in the state of denmark|pg||
nt|dkkello:  @H lead   coming soon  |pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: 24 minuts 4 boards and this could be a long one|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dkkello:  no|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 4@H with @hs 4-1 and 2@D bid by Dennis? I OR no @D-bid = @cQ lead and 4@H made|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes 77 imps now      :(|pg||
nt|pelu: just a lead to -13 IMP|pg||
nt|dkkello:  it is the big figures that create this bloodbath  , 12+12+11+14+12+17+10    and so on|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: 3!n e-w seems like a normal spot so?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|stigw: With a diamond finesse now everything should be ok.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and exit with @c9|pg||
nt|stigw: Maybe even 10 tricks now.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|c7|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|stigw: Heart to understand both the play and defence here.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|stigw: must make 9 now, after all, but with a sp back previously, it seems it would have gone down.|pg||

nt|vugraphzwa: there might be an adjustment later on .. i dont know but i heard something about they will look on the board later|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|stigw: Yes, thats the problem with light doubles and/or opening bids.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dkkello:  3 nt , 5 @D  |pg||
nt|stigw: Really dangerous for E/W here now, at they must expect sp Ace in the North hand, and then ???|pg||
nt|dkkello:  they have to get the contract on East hand  here|pg||
mb|p|nt|frm: Not if they guess the spades-:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzyb: current standings: coldea 162, teodorescu 153, valeanu 153, filip 132, georgescu 108, grigoriu 102|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  they are 3 boards behind at tthe other table , ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: A scientific approach by Andres would complicate matters, and might still not lead to the right result, so I sympathize with his stab (would have done the same when I was younger).|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: not for 1 IMP there were 13 IMP to loose|pg||
nt|stigw: But not in cl which seems to be the only slam-makeable contract (except for an unlikely squeeze)..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|snagolf: he can show his hand completely now with 3@ds|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East may lead a @h, declarer not needing  a @h guess|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|snagolf: but no reason to of course ...|pg||
nt|stigw: Even 5 Cl is in danger on a sp lead through E.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  more Imps for N-S  now   |pg||
nt|stigw: If he tries 6 NT South wont start the spades.|pg||
nt|stigw: Probably 5 di only.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Thinks you are right stig   .. |pg||
nt|stigw: And even that maigt be down.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must play low on a @s lead from N to make 5@c|pg||
nt|dkkello:  East takin his time |pg||
nt|stigw: Right Ralf, but will he ?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|nt|skaftij:  Sry, meant @c|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vugraphzwa: South played @h 4 and then @h 2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Bilde laed earlier today a Q against 3 NT  , K was at the table , devlarer ducked |pg||
nt|stigw: At the other table E jumped to 3 nt immediately over the multi-opening bu North -much better I think.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|dkkello:  lead ..|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h4|pg||

nt|dkkello:  and Bilde took the A and  3 more tricks against 3 NT vulnerable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or @dHx|pg||
nt|dkkello:  never work when I try that   |pg||
pc|h2|nt|dkkello:  what to say !  at least the used staymann this time  |pg||

mb|1H|nt|stigw: In board 19 N/S bid and made game at the other table earning 7 lucky imps, but it all wont help to turn this match, Im sure.|pg||

nt|sommer: :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you are to slow Povl :)|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|skaftij:  surely|pg||

mb|p|nt|sommer: wow, yes..try to look at the play in "Movie"..no help from opps!!|pg||
nt|pelu: but here N open 1NT - and S bid 5@D - so the fines was with odds (almost :))|pg||
nt|skaftij:  15 tricks|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|stigw: This might have been a trap in order to nail them in 3 sp, but is he strong enough for that ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dkkello:  start the timer   .. NOW |pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: 1 min 15|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ralfwil: S got a better chance.....|pg||
nt|dkkello:  lol|pg||
nt|stigw: E feels uncomfortable now, but South didnt dare to double 3 sp (understandable).|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I started when u first time said NOW|pg||
nt|stigw: 1430 should mean 1 or 4, and 1 is impossible !|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now West can count to 12 and room for a lots of points at East |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sure 7 NT now|pg||
nt|stigw: If he goes for 1 ace by bidding 5 di East surely must continue nevertheless.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  1 @d seems weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: I guess 1 or 2 off.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: south did not get the chance to dbl 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  come on Lars   hurry|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: i think all he was wondering about was if there was a chance that 7!n would go down while 7@d would win|pg||
pc|c5|nt|stigw: Still losing imps, but might have benne neccessary to land in di instad of nt.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|skaftij:  He will suffer the wrath of is teammates by throwing 2 IMP's away|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: they allways open these hands:).. 3@d could be to keep opps out but if partner has a lillte extra they are in a dbl contract |pg||
nt|dkkello:  I dont mind they open on anything but they need to be consistent of doing that  |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stigw: Sorry, I didnt see they went to 4 sp, doubled, so 2 or 3 off is now my guess.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  awkward contract  to play  |pg||

mb|7H|nt|pelu: what now: 4@C or 4@D (as in OR)|pg||
nt|stigw: An unfortunate H J lead might help.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bd 19, Blakset did not double with the 9 HCP (of course but depending on style) and Schaltz bid 4@s ending the auction and earning 13 imps|pg||
nt|stigw: Now he has chances.|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Konow opened with a small NT  at the other table   |pg||

nt|dkkello:  i think Bilde done very well today ..   |pg||
nt|stigw: West should perhaps have doubled here for a MA-suit-lead (nort that it prevents 3 nt doubled to make, but would they stand that ?).|pg||
nt|dkkello:  renember the 2 @D bid on AQJx   early today   ..  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  Schaltz and Blakset have not yet worked out what to do in theese situations I think|pg||
