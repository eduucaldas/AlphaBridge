nt|VUGRAPHZVH: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have privately copies of e/w CC and will endeavour to interpret the auctions - they play a strong club system|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: this is Rob, your operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: Ok, we've had a techical problem, which has been fixed now. We will put in the scores for the first two boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: This time the familiar figure of Andrew Robson, playing with Alexander Allfrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: EW, as we know, play a strong club...NS do not|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nilsland:  Welcome back - in this match the Swedish team will meet some Icelandic world champions|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Practical 4@h from Robson|pg||
nt|roswolf: penalty double anyone?|pg||
nt|roswolf: of 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör 3 pik boardu|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w play a lot of transfers|pg||
mb|2N|nt|nilsland:  Among those my own favorite opponent - Jon Baldurson who beats mee every time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C was at least to me suprising|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hi all. Lots of people playing Multi-Landy in this position over a 1N overcall |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to the final stanza of the first weekend of the 2012 Camrose|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think we can assume that 2 @C showed majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Think i would pass 2S, but rex disagrees|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  NS for England are David Gold and Tony Forrester|pg||
nt|nilsland:  welcome - this in the last match|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: yes of course|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h looks a likely make; 5@h may make even on a trump lead because W's spades are so feeble because of the|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Some may prefer showing 6 @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör pas dese çok iyi skor alýcaktý ama dönüþe göre 4 kör yapýlabilir|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: bakalým yaptýrabilecekler mi|pg||
nt|dkkello:  Hi all Hi Mats ..|pg||
nt|nilsland:  wlc kjeld'|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW team i leading, NS second|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nilsland:  S unblock the J to be able to take 3 @D tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|clinch: 5! a decent save certainly|pg||
nt|roswolf: a rathe agricultural defence|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|clinch: @c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  their system is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/ForresterGold.pdf|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yorkbeach:  2@c was either weak with @d or a strong hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|clinch: Robson needs to get Allfrey in to lead a trump to maximise the NS score...would have involved underleading his heart|pg||
nt|clinch: Now may only be -1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|nilsland:  A little diffucult to play 4-3s but they are the experts :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  much easier to play with 6-1 - just take them from the top |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|clinch: or making?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it has kept EW out of the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dkkello:  1 NT with a 5 card major suit becoming "normal" , worked out well this time .|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Gillis should have ret a low spade - knowing p has 4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|cuttysark:  difficult lead - having cashed one ace he felt he had better cash the other|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: N joked at trick 3 'run out of aces, pard?'|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s6|pc|c2|nt|clinch: With Since Robson can't ruff the good diamond queen, 11 tricks on a cross ruff coming|pg||
nt|clinch: Spade lead from Roson was costly ...did he think declarer had @h K?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Normal if you play strong NT - not so normal in the weak NT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|nilsland:  EW can still beat the contract|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dkkello:  wonder if this is weak or strong ?!  Do you know Mats?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|nilsland:  the crossruff will work as @S4 beats @S3|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nilsland:  15-17 i think|pg||

nt|nurkumkale: 3 @s demiþler demek ki genelde|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 4 köre kontrlarda var|pg||
nt|emre kaya: eðer dekleran as kör kör oynasaydý rua pike vale vermek karo küçüðünü vermek trefl isterdi|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
nt|clinch: Strong chance of a double game swing there|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson says he got the hand wrong because AA led the 7 of clubs, not the low one he should have done from his holding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c was probably down one, so no great harm for Wales|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: strong club auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah|pg||
nt|clinch: club was an excellent lead|pg||
nt|clinch: but not the seven, apparently!|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will feel he should have made that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: W isn't happy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Another partscore|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: i would have transferred to @S|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  We should not expect happy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS can make 8 tricks in NT and @S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: balanced is an individual description|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C may be bid here|pg||
nt|clinch: Another fun hand here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW for Wales are Mike Tedd - John Salisbury http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/TeddSalisbury.pdf|pg||
pc|cT|nt|emre kaya: ayrýca bu deklerasyonda rua kör oturmamak gerekir valeye mazallah dam kör ortaktan tekten düþüverir:)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Against 4 @H a trump lead will be best - but hard to find from souths hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 4 pik kuzu|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@h will make all right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well who will make the last bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  "easy"  game in @H   , 2 C! obviously conventional  |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that East did not rebid 2@d|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 3@h|pg||
nt|clinch: Also 5@c, so EW needed to bid 5@h....as did NS on the prior hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south has won the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Greenwood would do very well to come again|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: 3@c on but south would compete to 3! which makes|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky heart finesse wrong|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|clinch: To defeat 5@h it looks as though N has to lead his stiff ace, then underlead his club ace|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzvu: s thinking about continuation|pg||
nt|nilsland:  impressive pass from wrang after partners cuebid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  the dxK-10 doubleton would have made atacking @d succesful but declarer would not visualise such a friendly layout|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h9|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A red suit lead could have hold it to 7 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|emre kaya: 4.renk yapmalýydý zaten Esin Haným|pg||
nt|dkkello:   maybe gazzili convention?  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  now defense will not be able to play two rounds of trump|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the swedish "HÃ¤xan"|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|golfsquash: claim time|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nilsland:  so probably an overtrick|pg||

nt|roswolf: declarer will guess the @HK is wrong but might try for a swindle|pg||

nt|clinch: Two hands with huge potential already, the IMPometer may be ticking over soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 N is easy without a heart lead|pg||
mb|1H|nt|clinch: A grand slam here, though not for the opening bidder!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: another very exciting hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: I think we can classify Robson's opening as weak :)|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s a bit strong....|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nilsland:  W 1 @C is natural or balanced 11-14/17-19 I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: e/w play 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and inverted minors, even with overcall|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 @H just made - not very exciting|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 1@H MAY BE A TRANSFER TO SPADES|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson will not be happy when he sees the dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the contract will surely be 3 NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 NT showing @H  |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and 5 card Majors, 4 D and 2C|pg||
nt|roswolf: DENYING 4 SPADES i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has a constructive weak 2@s available|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 2@d Multi shows a weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is one of the weak options|pg||
nt|nilsland:  N was tempted to go further but...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: in for a penny in for a pound|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have raised to 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S checking lead styles|pg||
nt|roswolf: will probably take the spade finesse to create an extra entry to dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or 5 @D which at least has a chance|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|clinch: Don't blame E for passing, though he might have bid on|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|nilsland:  Well done by Johan Upmark|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yorkbeach:  in 3rd seat I am not sure of the need to make the distinction - perhaps it helps partner judge whether to save|pg||
nt|dkkello:  to much bidding from N-S  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  but we miss an entry to make it easy|pg||
nt|dkkello:  But V @D are to good  :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Clubs must be played from E two times|pg||
nt|dkkello:  take it easy Wrang , Kick-off (Handball) in 3 h  and 10 min :)  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East might have wanted to bid 2NT after the double to show two places to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but perhaps he thought West would take it as natural|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nilsland:  Handball - what is that (we dont have that in sweden)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you have the good bridgeplayers then!  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  if you ask Fredin its only one...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true :) |pg||
nt|nilsland:  I didnt say it was true :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders will need to play @c eraly to stop the overtrick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: much harder to bid game if west opens strong NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no,  Fredin did  |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm so far so good|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks cold now and declarer is unlikely to go down because the defence will open up the suits to his advantage|pg||

nt|roswolf: the english sprint away|pg||

mb|d|nt|r_prah: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: everyone is in the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has a bewildering choice of actions here - 4@H or 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: ARE THE OBVIOUS ONES - PASS ALSO HAS ITS ATTRACTIONS|pg||
nt|rain:  Hi Everyone, r_prah is going to comment to spice things up for you all :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: hiding in the long grass is 3@S but what will north make of it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW has some transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 1NT rebid 15-17|pg||
nt|roswolf: the magical mystery tour continues|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Sorry i can't explain more..it's very murky here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing long spades and @D tolerance?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S weak raise - good raise via 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s bid on last is understandable, but surely EW had some kind of double-then-bid type of auction available|pg||
nt|ady: still tempting for north|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but  perhaps2 @S is not one of them :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-V should go down 1 in @H , but maybe N-S bid to 4 @S  ?  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  I lika the initial pass from West - some players seems to be unable to pass such hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: herkes kartý iyi oynuyor demek ki:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: ne de olsa final seansý|pg||
nt|roswolf: now south runs|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Gillis will probably not lead diamonds |pg||
nt|nilsland:  or?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzvu: 3@C and 3@H alerted, but not sure|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yorkbeach:  I like opening my longest suit|pg||
nt|dkkello:  I thought about open 1 @H , but I known you knows better  Mats   |pg||
pc|d9|nt|roswolf: hmm imaginative keepinf his clubs concealed|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS reached a sensible 3NT, although 6@C or 6@D has the virtue of making as the cards lie|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and then play in 2@d or 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S asking about the 3D bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: east doesnt give up|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It looks like 4 @S is making|pg||
nt|nilsland:  small heart from N to the 7@H (if East isnt awake) seems to be the only way :P|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark:  Lucky 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: auction on previous was something like 2@h-(2!n)-3@h..........4@h(S)-(X)-end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to diagnose the misfit and stop at a safe level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, declarer might set up the @d as the @sK will be an entry|pg||
nt|dkkello:  or 1 down  |pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzvu: got an explanation now, 3@C random game try, often with H and 3H is LT without 4@H|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  1NT was forcing|pg||
nt|r_prah: Baldursson, Jonsson and Jorgensen are veterans of the game; Einarsson is an extremely talented young player|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2 @H shows 11-13 and 6 @H|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - East needs two ruffs in dummy, and on this layout he probably can't get them|pg||
nt|dburn: unless there is some sort of pressure in the minors on North|pg||
nt|dburn: which I suppose there might well be|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or ten of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: should get to 4@S easily enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  2@c was presumably showing @d |pg||

pc|s4|nt|ady: 10@S    even better chance|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, will be interesting|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: with the heart finesse right declarer should be ok but is tested at T1|pg||

pc|sT|pg||
nt|r_prah: 3@C should make; as should 3@H. North's reticience may cost him a few IMPs here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West last pass took some time, maybe East was ethical|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe West's second pass took a while, and East didn't feel he could move|pg||
pc|cA|nt|clinch: Diamond more likely now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should come close on any lead, favorite to make on some:)|pg||

nt|clinch: Thanks Basil|pg||
nt|ady: close to making if ace and king of clubs would stand up|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N has the upside of making it a bit harder for EW to get together in spades, but with a strong club on one's left there is less likelihood foe will be seriously discomfited. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meanwhile it might well help the eventual declarer.  after all, if robson were to pass on this S hand at these colors, who would ever play him for this hand:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: on bd 20 the endglish n/s conceded -1100 in a very dubious auction - 15 big imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|dburn: that @cQ was likely to be a defensive value, even if he couldn't cash any diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: the test you should apply is: will this contract go two down more often than it will make?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in my club an 18 count with KQx of trumps behind the bidder is an automatic double|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch decides to open a packet of Boubon biscuits....not passing them round though|pg||

nt|marlowepi: E should play a low heart from hand ASAP to test S|pg||

nt|vugraphzwe: prize seremony in few min here and we have a winner in the teams event and that is Sparisjóður Siglufjarðar with the national team players Jón baldursson, Thorlakur jónsson, ...|pg||

nt|cuttysark:  Perfect defence gets another trick, but perfection is tough at the 1-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  'octave' suggested by Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  'octopus' suggested by Keth from England|pg||
nt|kemperg: defense now regrettes @SA taken to soon|pg||
nt|dkkello:  board 21 was a push  4 @Hx down 2 also in the open room |pg||
nt|nilsland:  another chance for EW to avoid game? _P|pg||
mb|1H|an|spades|nt|roswolf: a high level contract in @D is likely|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many players do not like to use Michaels when they have 6 in the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they've had about half the time for this stanza now|pg||
nt|r_prah: EW will likely end up in a spade partial|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     and fairly low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Ed:)|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW can make 3 NT but will they find it?|pg||
nt|dburn: 1@h probably spades - the French do not go in for psyching much|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nilsland:  I prefer bidding 2 @H with wests hand|pg||
nt|dburn: gives West a chance to show something without bidding at the two level - might bid 2@h anyway, but double seems OK|pg||
nt|dburn: now, East may be wondering whether he can ue 2@s or whether that ought to be natural|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: indeed a pass missed out perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: depending on how high they get the 4-0 trump break may hurt them|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the trump break appears to be 5-4 at the moment, since East-West are bidding diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: last board might have been opened and e/w would make up to 10 tricks in spade partscore|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they have played 7, so will need to play the reamining 9 a bit faster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they could have been a bit quicker on 23|pg||
nt|r_prah: If either North or South had bid an enterprising 2NT, they would have struck gold|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: he gave up wondering|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is always better to show your hand than letting partner guess it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|golfsquash: 2@d is control showing, 0 or 1 control|pg||
nt|r_prah: 2@S should go 1 down on normal play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzvu: Tk you Mr Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: don't quite understand 3@d, but maybe it was just a general invitation (or did 1@d show hearts?)|pg||
nt|othered1: South came to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players did not need to discuss terms for an 8-high hand :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are time penalties for finishing late|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, this lead may assist declarer, but he still has plenty to do|pg||
nt|dburn: when North rebid diamonds, East felt it unlikely his opponents could run spades against notrump|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: came into the world that way|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take 3 hearts  1 club   and at least 1 sspade|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS however have to defend accurately. Three rounds of hearts will allow declarer to discard his club|pg||
nt|r_prah: If North cashes the @CA, that should seal declarer's hopes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|golfsquash: 10 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: first trick won with the beer card...|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West has read the lead as 4th highest|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: likely down 1|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs has a chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: good views required in clubs  and hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W takeout double  a bit surprising. opening the hand does the job a lot better than pass and then double with the wrong shape facing a partner who couldnt open in 3rd chair green, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and foes who seem to have spades so  are solid favorites to declare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we all know what the prize is for winning a trick with the @d7 at trick 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trick 13|pg||
nt|kemperg: again @D8 an important card:)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  will go one down if not East get a chance to cover|pg||

pc|hT|nt|tez: yoksa %35 yapamazlardý  mý demek istiyorsun Emre:)|pg||
nt|r_prah: Declarer needs to play Ace and a spade |pg||
nt|r_prah: if he takes a spade finesse, the defense can engineer a trump promotion|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: good dfence|pg||
nt|ady: defence   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but i don;t see the upside of king of hearts on the first round|pg||

pc|c7|nt|kemperg: Is 1@H  forcing? pass with the E hand seems better|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzvu: Declarer in deep thought now|pg||
nt|dburn: better shift to clubs - can't draw any more trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|emre kaya: selam Tez Hocam:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump would have been nasty|pg||
nt|dburn: and even if they could, they'd have to lead them and find the suit not blocked - imagine West with @hKxxxx and nothing, and North with two honours doubleton in spades|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: west taking what's in front of  him|pg||

nt|roswolf: 6@D is a cool contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Rob here, and off we go again!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  21 was flat - play in 5@d was very similar to here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer might not duck a spade lead - he would play for a blockage (or a 4-3 break) maybe|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|copeyj: 1NT 14-16|pg||
mb|d|nt|yorkbeach:  14-16|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H @H and minor I suppose|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and we better agree on that |pg||
nt|nilsland:  On the other hand he will need @HK doubleton too|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: south feels preemption of semi-psyching 1N overrides the value of getting only KQJ9xx into the auction.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S natural NF|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 5@h+4m|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  matchpoints I suspect North doubles|pg||
mb|2H|nt|emre kaya: ha ok Koray abi trefl ruayý attý|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3@d is to play there I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: evet|pg||
nt|nurkumkale: @s leri çekince majörlerinin olmadýðý gözükmüþ zaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this may not be the way to reach it, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if North bids 3@s now South has a good hand for diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone's 1N but at these colours i couldn;t agree more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Club ruff is needed|pg||
nt|dburn: South here choosing not to play for penalties against 1@s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzvu: without the 2@s from S, 3@d is a game try in @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the advantage of screens is that South did not know who was thinking there|pg||
pc|cA|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: evet uyudu|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm hope this is not read has delayed support|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he bids 4@h and South understands it...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: A big sigh from S as he pulled the pass card|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm your Law violated again David|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to have faith in partner to apply splinter here |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he should have done, but that's not the kind of thing to spring on partner in the middle of a Camrose match|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: true but this is a belly blow|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: continuing the preempt?  Or have wheels come off?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: short in spades and not too many hearts, so obstruction is likeliest to the the Primary Issue of the Deal|pg||
pc|s4|nt|golfsquash: I trust that he won't switch to a low club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wheels? NS travel of skis:)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  great chance for the Swedes , good result in open room  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: sorry, no thought on the other side|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: W was explaining the situation to S|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table she did decide to defend 1@s doubled, but West meanly decided not to play in it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  we will have to guess the result here|pg||

nt|kemperg: with @SA onside made, but now 2 off, |pg||
nt|r_prah: I'm sure declarer must have ducked the @HQ, an obvious maneuver|pg||
nt|dkkello:  are vul  yes|pg||
nt|dkkello:  15  |pg||
nt|dburn: game only just about OK not vulnerable - makes on this friendly layout, but not a crime for either pair not to bid it|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: now anything could happen|pg||
nt|roswolf: double!?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially if South can't overcall naturally in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: the opening promises ZERO @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: so i think 2@D should be natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi roswolf|pg||
nt|dburn: but here is a bit of luck for France, who bid a slam that was more or less flat out on the trump finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: must come up fairly often, then - I mean, all hands have at least no diamonds|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: true but 3@D is in the zone|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks competitive|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Brian Short & David Walker|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like a routine game in @S and that EW won't be able to obstruct the auction sufficiently to get in the way|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Denmark leads the handball by 2 with 89 sek left|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: this is probably natural, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: western cue bids are not in fashion these days|pg||
nt|ady: just the 2 losers in spades   assuming a diamond lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scots may have won the auction|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 H seems makable|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: still a nce contract, bad luck for Anita|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but diffucult to reach|pg||
nt|dburn: students should note this spade combination - you are supposed to lead the jack from the West hand and run it|pg||
nt|dburn: in case of @sK10x with North, you must not lead low to the queen|pg||
mb|4H|nt|emre kaya: turnuvanýn son borduna geldik herkese teþekkürler bir kusur ettiysek affola iyi akþamlar|pg||

nt|golfsquash: pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 3nt too far fetched|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids 3@s as he might, the partnership should at least avoid 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...if he does that instead, Crouch may well lead a club and not a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: which black suit will west lead|pg||
nt|ady: Robson will find an agreeable dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N presumably is a specific @S raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: alerted, but didnt say what|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW play 2NT as limit or better, so 3@s is a 4-card raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 5 @C |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|dburn: since he knows Patterson doesn't have diamonds, so he is very likely to have clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   shows hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: spades looks natural|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's not 100% - he may well lead spades anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
mb|5S|nt|emre kaya: detaylý sonuçlar için  http://www.istanbulbric.com/ adresine bakabilirsiniz|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might just make four|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 3@D   random game try|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's a vul overcall worth a random game try, what's h is minimum in this situation?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the fact that S has made a game try gives us a hint of what the lower limits of a vul overcall might be for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you beat me to it Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he does have 3 tens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might have made on a @h lead|pg||
nt|r_prah: 246.5 Meters gained 11 IMPs on Board 22 when Jonsson and Baldursson appeared to have a misunderstanding about the meaning of a double|pg||
nt|r_prah: Meanwhile, a comfortable 3NT for EW here, not in any real jeopardy|pg||
nt|dburn: if report is to be believed, declarer in the other room did lead low to the queen, so France were doubly fortunate|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yorkbeach:  all may come down to guessing who has the @sJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  South does not show his clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed quite possibly n/s in the other room may run ino problems|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East has showed void and @D ace maybe should not be counted?|pg||
nt|dburn: Gills pretending to have the queen of spades because he has five of them|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: into|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|roswolf: yes but when your opps hardly know what they are doing then opening leads are much more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: 4-0 trump split will stop the 12th trick on the non diamond lead|pg||
nt|kemperg: cant see why 4@H was not made in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: This was the last board of this round. We start again in 1 hour 15 minutes.|pg||
