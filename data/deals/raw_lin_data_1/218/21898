nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if Yeh partnerships are playing standard or some Precision pairs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my dream is that someday  BBO will work on software for operator and there will be functionality to just INSERT PASS  instead of having to do all of those UNDOs|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not 1@C from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@C-P-  then  1@H=4+@S|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator won't be able to lead   so then auction should get fixed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP's 1@S [RHO's suit]  showing the 2 unbid suits|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|s6|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it's not unreasonable to play 1@S as natural even though RHO has shown 4+  since 1N by passed hand is available to show the 2 unbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: Sorry for wrong bits.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side for declarer is the opps can't really attack any suits themselves|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  vul maybe?|pg||

nt|othered1: south has a clear opening bid, by current standards|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kit: And that opening bid will have North thinking slam|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|othered1: double isn't penalty|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: If South gets to 6@C, the proper line of play is far from clear|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: I don't think North will quit just yet|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: South will have had enough|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 controls and a decent suit pretty much demanded more bidding by north.  Even 4N isn't overly aggressive.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think North should have been more aggressive -- that is a huge responding hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thinking over 4NT was an overbid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: but he knows what a minimum opening looks like in their system|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bakhshi will take the safety play in clubs and end up with at least 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: Playing in 4NT, declarer will definitely get the clubs right, as it guarantees making|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|othered1: he'll wind up making 6 as west will be squeezed in red suits|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|othered1: and known @S and @C length in east will make that a heavy favorite|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N=5@S 5@C 1@H|pg||

pc|s6|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: your call with west's hand over 1@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: But 14 is weak for the weak no-trumpers|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: double seems pretty clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: do you then sit 2@D?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|kit: that is not so clear -- would depend on partnership style of meaning of 2@H and/or 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: 3NT looks like a bit much.  If West bids 2NT and East (who can see the vulnerability) passes, I'd bet against game making|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N can be relatively shaded over a 1@S opening, but west still  have full values for his bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Patrick expected more for 1NT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|kit: what else could East bid?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree, east's 6-count is shaded to extreme, but what do you bid?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|kit: Diamond shift by South should be easy to find|pg||
nt|kit: South knows the spade position, since 6 of spades is lowest spade out and North would lead top of remaining doubleton.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And East did not bid 1NT on Qx|pg||
nt|kit: I'm surprised South is apparently having a problem here.  Looking at that dummy it seems like there is only one sensible defense.|pg||
nt|kit: can anybody figure out what he might be thinking about?  |pg||
nt|othered1: defense pretty much requires east to have bid as he did, without @DQ, but what else can south see?  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: True, if declarer has @DQ you can't beat it|pg||
nt|kit: you might beat it if partner has jack of hearts or jack of clubs, but so what |pg||
nt|othered1: mightn't it depend on east's @C lengths and position of rounded jacks?|pg||
nt|kit: I still don't see how winning spade and leading low diamond can ever be wrong|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: No law against thinking when you come out of the tank with the right answer|pg||
nt|kit: oh I agree with that Roland -- I was just wondering what his plan B was?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|othered1: I llike to play 10 and 9 showing 0 or 2 higher in this position (but not necessarily on opening lead)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs back to NEDUK when the Dutch pair found 4@H in the other room on board 25|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 14-16 NT did the trick at this table|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps he was trying to figure out whether to shift to 10 of diamond or low diamond -- declarer might have QJ8x, and partner one of the key jacks.|pg||

nt|vugraphzws: Alert with P is miss.sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: in OR, West's 1NT !  humm.|pg||
nt|mrdct: i guess there is chance for declarer to over think a potential bad trump break going for an endplay in @d|pg||
nt|mrdct: which could be indicated with the @H opening by west|pg||
nt|mrdct: btw 2@h is 10-13 5+@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: can be weaker in 3rd|pg||
nt|mrdct: the east-west system has no weak 2 available so with hands like west you need to improvise|pg||

pc|h6|nt|andyv:  card says 1@s was a balanced relay so probably couldn|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|kit: Declarer will think spade finesse is offside, considering East's initial pass|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|rick3son:  now needs the @s finesse for contract since @h are ready to cash|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: It is his only chance to make, but he might not take it depending on the enemy discards|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|pc|s4|nt|othered1: west has to make some pitches on @H|pg||
nt|othered1: @D, rather|pg||
nt|kit: now, will west blank his "king of spades"?|pg||
nt|othered1: will north fall for it, given that west can pitch @H, s ince east has 4?|pg||
nt|kit: I think that is what West should do|pg||
nt|kit: No, West can't pitch a heart -- then declarer can just play a club|pg||
nt|kit: defense would have only 5 tricks|pg||
nt|rick3son:  declarer has been counting east hand and you right may think not room there for K@s passed|pg||
nt|rick3son:  hand|pg||
nt|kit: Of course if West does have king of spades he can always pitch a club, provided the defense has heart communication (which declarer doesn't know)|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11 in other room after 1@C and interference|pg||
nt|andyv:  13 also a disaster for NS as 4@s was set in OR|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
nt|timb: David, that is an understatemet (too say the least) of a very British kind|pg||
nt|mrdct: in fairness to matt muulamphy - what else do you suggest he does when a green vs red 3@h preempt come around to him|pg||

nt|sybarra2: this is the "I have an opening bid" 1 @D |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 0+@D, maybe longer @C/@S, but NOT @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as here  often weak NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|r!|nt|ahollan1: and 3rd 2@D response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL=4+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|andyv:  must be nice to have so many hands fit into your system:)|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@h = @s showing, and 2@s = 4 card @s  maybe !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, and a minimum|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  S had a pretty easy dbl |pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Declarer mistimed this in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 3NT would be better contruct, but West choiced 4@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H holding 4  means  either weak NT or  4414/4405|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|andyv:  you aren't dealt NT hands in order to be passing |pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP described 7+@C again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would you overcall 2N or DBL Andy?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pole_as_ch: 3 in @s, 3 in @h, 1 in @d, 1 in @C, so 8 tricks.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: remember  2@C could be 4@C and 5+@S|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 2 ruff in each hand is not enought, because South would ruff 3rd @h.|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: they are accurate enough that north might have considered 3@H over west's pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't like Kx as stopper when opps say they have 6 of them...can't even hold up once|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pole_as_ch: Defender shoud attack @c |pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: right  over normal Precision 2@C where length guaranteed  DBL is clear|pg||

nt|othered1: Funny that the pass we criticized east for making on last board, won it for him|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rick3son:  I don't think was running scared by playing Ace @s, more likely as Kit said believed West bared @s King|pg||

nt|kit: Easy game with both red queens onside, but declarer doesn't know that for sure.|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  11  [the long auction to 5@C]  Miyakuni 3N West|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, South could have defeated it (ruffing @DK)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra2: bd 11 3 nt +2 in the other room |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: that picked up 2 overtrick imps   but  5@C much better at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra2: dealing machine having fun with club suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many @C has vanProoijen held this set?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: the Yeh Bros team is:  Chen Yeh, JuiYiu Shih, ChiMou Lin, Herstein Liu, Patrick Huang, Grace Lin |pg||
nt|sybarra2: and they Yeh Bros sponsor a great tourney also shown on bbo |pg||
mb|3N|nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd is remains. 40imp is 25-5 ! |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But it looked natural to him to get rid of his last heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d is the lucky spot on this hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: Oz might win those imps back here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 7@h seems kind of extreme on these EW cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: another invitation tourney |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang bid only 2N  but still got to game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra2: Patrick is a frequent commentator with us (when not playing) |pg||
nt|sybarra2: he also lived in Netherlands for many years and probably "brought these dutchies up" |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which black suit to attack??    that answer affects play to trick 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: and a quiet part score |pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: there is one more hand after this hand |pg||

nt|ahollan1: also an icon in the bridge world   has been playing international level bridge since late 1950s|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i would not even cue with norths non=opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: may not be an option in the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could bid bid 4@S over the double surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e.  common agreement  MUST return cuebid if available below game|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT is 10+ bal GF|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mrdct: 1@c is 14+|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: is prooijen pretending to lead a singleton|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mrdct: 2@h and 3@h look natural|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s i guess is a cue and 3NT is a slam try|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good contruct !  it looks cold.  so 5 imps buck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the first to play Precision  [helped CC Wei with some system clarification  or maybe just in introducing the system in Taiwan]|pg||
