nt|ahollan1: i wonder how auction progresses if Stamatov just jumps in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: 2@s ???  sry, bad comment|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and another 6 imp.  29imp is 22-8 vp.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Hanlon is normally extremely strong as a declarer but 4-1 breaks kill most of us |pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: good auction to best contruct!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eamongall: anyway tightens up the match |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes Lui played very nicely OR|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pole_as_ch: comes Chen's Ocaltic call.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Dec can catch 8 tricks easily, but 9th ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pole_as_ch: why so jumping ???|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Maybe, East Opening is not 2@c, so 6 was enough, Ch3n was thought.|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: *Chen|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Now Furuta safely settled 6, or not ????|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: this is 17 imp if he make this|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: and new leader !! or not ??|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|pole_as_ch: 2 bd include this only remains|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: @d7 shows @dA ?|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: Defence also have not tricks|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: so the move of Dec and North deside the fate.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|pole_as_ch: 9th will be a little fade.|pg||
