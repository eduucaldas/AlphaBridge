nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
nt|sybarra: how did we not make 6 @C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh I see,  the @D ruff :( unlucky |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 2@C balanced  8-11 or 15+ hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||
nt|mrdct: poor result for Oz in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home/English/nec/17th/results/7thFeb/tabid/665/Default.aspx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: thx|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||

mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: BD  3 is push !|pg||

nt|andyv:  3N was bid and made in OR on  3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I wouldn't know that, so i vote for 5@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or both majors|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|andyv:  5@d makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: immediately   let EW make the last guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, not so sure EW action was the best for them|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually, maybe not...hard to get rid of the 2nd @c loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: doesn't this lose @S and 2@C ?|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|pole_as_ch: Y, N's 2@h is very natural.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: East's @C spots prevail |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pole_as_ch: East might try @d. but 3, so she choiced pass.|pg||
nt|mrdct: although if north leads 4th best of longest and strongest after 1NT:3NT it has 9 tricks then|pg||
nt|vugraphzws: thanks >Walddk2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: imagine West then East  after   3@D-DBL-5@D-?|pg||

nt|mrdct: ben now showing @d as his second (and probably longer) suit|pg||

nt|mrdct: but it might mean something else|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  the 2@h bid may have caused EW to underestimate their values|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: 1@s open because of Scenken system.|pg||
nt|mrdct: so west's actions have talked NS out of 3NT|pg||

nt|mrdct: Oz Players here are 2/3 of the runners-up in Australia National Open Teams from a couple of weeks ago|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||

nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe it *shows*|pg||
