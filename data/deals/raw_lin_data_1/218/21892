mb|1D|an| |mb|p|nt|andyv:  we will have the names up shortly|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think the names are left over from previous match as Brown Stockdale are English Ladies |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mrdct: based on what's entered for the open room - we have Thompson-Jacobs EW here|pg||
pc|s9|nt|eamongall: however I am sure it will get fixed when operator gets a break in the play :) ...its very hard to be a vugraph operator |pg||

pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  a @s lead would probably have been better as E wouldn't be able to pull all the trump before he knocked out the A of @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we have Jacobs - Thompson   N-S   Dave?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Every event has new operators and after a few rounds they become experienced and learn stuff |pg||
nt|mrdct: but as it happens a low trump was going to work better as east is forced to rise Q and then doesn't have the tempo to take his trick|pg||

nt|andyv:  that's where they were saturday:)|pg||
nt|mrdct: pages 3&4 for bill & ben|pg||
nt|mrdct: so in the EW methods all one-level openings are frocing for one round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed,    N-S are    Stamatov - Karianov|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play Precision|pg||
nt|mrdct: so about 14+hcp|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|Walddk2: all Bulgarian top pairs do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and NS   akama-maruyama  [not sure who's where]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=game force   a bunch of hand types  in this case  balanced  [no singleton or void]|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: 2@s is 10-13 5+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: so east is clear a big max for his bid|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mrdct: *clearly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: 1@S RELAY  |pg||
nt|mrdct: btw - i'm going to predict bill jacobs is sitting east as ben thompson is a bit more agressive and would probably open 1@s with the east cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Bill is always E and N I noticed|pg||
nt|mrdct: believe it or not i've never noticed that|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mrdct: i think the 1st two matches are up|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|pole_as_ch: NS in this room are wife(N) & hus(S)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/home////tabid/223/Default.aspx  for tournament website. No results yet I'm afraid. They only update the page once a day if memory serves|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: 2N broke out of relay so East guaranteed declarer|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pole_as_ch: They (NS) prefer schenken|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eamongall: yes first two rounds are up ... and 3rd round was only finished ... |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4/5@D  not 4@H/@S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Andy was referring to the Dutch Premiere League final that was on BBO last weekend|pg||
nt|andyv:  declarer starts with 8 tricks and has 2 4-3 suits to find the 9th, or the @d suit.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mrdct: the problem in the open rooms is with only one @s stopper you need cashing tricks on top which just weren't there|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: EW team won by 1 imp after trailing by a bunch after 4 round|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  yes, they certainly made a quick turnaround to get to this tourney|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrdct: needs to make this to hold the damage to 5 imps - otherwise it's 8 imps out|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: they did that last year too|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert names        North:  Stamatov     South: Danailov       East: Jacobs      West: Thompson|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and went on to win the NEC Cup|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct: in fact when i last played against them i was south and screenmates with bill, but that may have been because ben didn't want to be screenmates with me|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  when you are good, you are good|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: curious that South didn't overcall this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side for declarer is the opps can't really attack any suits themselves|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=relay  but doesn't promise any points|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or smother 10 of @S? |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you can also try the @d suit |pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s is 8-10 bal and 3@d asks for a major I'm told|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this mostly needs two diamonds to survice, then a straight cross ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if @D lead 3rd/5th then unlikely choice of crossruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  if leads are 3-5, W may already know what is going on|pg||
nt|mrdct: obviously with north having already bid @s the transfer benefits are not there - but often you need to stick to your generla structure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: yes i dont think he will play that way, i was talking in abstract|pg||
