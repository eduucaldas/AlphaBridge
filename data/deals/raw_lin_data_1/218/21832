nt|penseur9:  good question Al|pg||

mb|4H|nt|gsper:  NS can make a lot in @C but the vul will hold them back|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: but not a good slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  part score seems indicated here... possibly in @H by NS|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzvc: 1@h might be only 3 sometimes, that's probably the reason that Ton did not bid 2@h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: more likely 6N|pg||
nt|penseur9:  this is not a forgone conclusion... lot's of work to do|pg||
pc|c3|nt|penseur9:  seems that N is tempted to go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4N is regressive  [doesn't like either of responder's suits]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N range  20-21(22)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi Al, welcome back|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|penseur9:  some work to do here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|penseur9:  good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: and he showed 4@h already|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if same bad breaks in the other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they start with board 31  so we won't know until the end of the set|pg||
nt|penseur9:  it seems that both rooms started on board 17, so comparisons may be available soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Was a minor mistake, they are playing 31 now|pg||
nt|gsper:  With the @S finesse marked, this should make, so the 5@C sac...|pg||
nt|gsper:  would have paid, or possibly even made|pg||
nt|gsper:  The voice commentators are discussing various lines. They have lost me|pg||

nt|penseur9:  however, only one @H and two @S to lose... should make|pg||

nt|famus: Tommy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: initial thinking   how do i combine chances in the majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that assumes 5@C tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: don't know why bertens played the @d10 here, Q looks better|pg||
nt|bobholl: in practice surely :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: if you play for Kx low is best of course, but against 98 the Q is the same as 10, but it gains with J9|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|penseur9:  I'm not sure I would have played @D here... most likely|pg||
nt|penseur9:  trump most likely*|pg||
nt|penseur9:  always difficult to second guess declarer on these part score contracts|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes, I also thought it was that simple|pg||
pc|s5|nt|dkkello:  they used to play chess, but that whent to fast for them |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Sjoert saying 'Thank you' when he was allowed to win the trick|pg||

nt|gsper:  Welcome, Martin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in fact he can claim now, and should :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but westra perhaps has to keep up his reputation for slow play|pg||
nt|gsper:  S may be considering a low @D return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for what purpose|pg||
nt|gsper:  In case W has Qxx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar problem in 6N - except that declarer probably won't suffer @S ruff|pg||

nt|twcho: but in Chinese characters|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|twcho: EW is now sitting at 3rd position before this round starts|pg||

pc|c4|nt|famus: a big B UT!!!:)|pg||
nt|twcho: NS lying 8th|pg||

pc|cA|nt|penseur9:  *lead|pg||
nt|penseur9:  nothing much the defense can do to defeat this contract here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

nt|dkkello:  yes |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|twcho: but @d is the most promising|pg||
nt|twcho: @c can wait and @s suit is not robust enough|pg||
nt|famus: he exercised one of em--next ought to be a small @s to Q to wind up |pg||
nt|penseur9:  this COULD make but difficult to figure out double dummy|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: @HJ from QJxx(x) or JT(x)     @HQ from QJ(x)|pg||
nt|penseur9:  probably will go down now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this could be a form of Slawinsky honor leads,   which i never remember|pg||
nt|penseur9:  remember though that they are much better then I am :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  should make in 12-15 min or so .. |pg||

nt|bobholl: would play @CK now|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||

pc|s9|nt|dkkello:  since Laura Dekker  spent 500 days on the sea(congratulation) ..|pg||
nt|bobholl: but this is better|pg||
nt|gsper:  He hoped to discard the @C3 on a @H and lose no trump tricks|pg||
nt|gsper:  Rather forlorn in view of the 3NT bid, but you can try|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 18+ bal|pg||
nt|penseur9:  we should see some scoring soon since the OR started on boards 14 to 16|pg||
nt|bobholl: authorities (especially school people) didn't like the way it went :)|pg||

nt|penseur9:  rare 1@D contract, S could hardly bid 1@H with that hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|twcho: so we can conclude that both pairs are playing precision, probably the most popular system in China|pg||
nt|penseur9:  hi AL welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: is it best for Wortel to bid now with the lousy 6@S or later?  and show both majors or ...|pg||

nt|penseur9:  *can make...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S looks good |pg||
nt|penseur9:  yes @S contract looks best here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no entry to West hand for @H ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D does not promise any points   because may prefer @S over @C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H from bertens now i guess|pg||
nt|dkkello:  well she didnt went owerboard  |pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: 3@h should say solid suit|pg||
nt|twcho: and invite cuebid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Kit Woolsey defines a good save as one that makes, but this is better than letting NS play 4@S|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder if W liked that opening or if he was forced by system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we lost the clubs in the 60's, diamonds in the 70's, balanced nt bids in the 10's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|twcho: 4@c probably deny @s control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the running total includes 10 IMPs for Het Witte Huis  [White House] for winning the round robin|pg||
nt|penseur9:  didn't somebody say that the five level belongs to the oponents|pg||
pc|cA|nt|penseur9:  *opponents|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: meanwhile onstein 2 won 5 imps on bd 17, letting them play 4@h undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: dbl by Drijver was GF|pg||
nt|gsper:  Not many losers, but a bit short on winners|pg||
nt|gsper:  He can ruff a @D high, but he does not know that|pg||
nt|gsper:  Could try something mundane like the @D finesse|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: Ed Manfield in a BOLS Bridge Tip back in the 1980s|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|famus: actually observing the Bermuda Bowl etc recently--the most favoured system appeared to be a combination of 2/1 with precision @c|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: but shd be GF hand with @s support|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously 3@D some form of @H raise -- but what are the specifics?|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: modified bergen:)?|pg||
nt|twcho: possibly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  1@D transfer to @H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  good question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=INV a) @C/@D  b) 5@H/@S  c) NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that pretty much covers it all, doesn't it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to me this method of 4+ spades is unplayable without support doubles, and i think north could double 3@D on this auction to show 3 spades|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 2N=bal max|pg||
nt|bobholl: would play @D myself now|pg||

nt|vugraphzvc: 5@c -1 on bd 20 a push with 110 in 2@h|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzvc: Schollaardt ai, when he sees @Hq|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West takes a toilet break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 3@D was 15-17 with 4@H, like a old school 3@H bid|pg||
nt|penseur9:  13 IMPs on  18 for HWH OR in 3nt only|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gerbrand -- can you explain this tournament   is it a seasonal/year long event??  does it impact selection of international team??|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it's basicly the premier league|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: it was a 12 team double round robin|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzvc: West annoyed about the @DK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
nt|gsper:  Shortening his trumps frantically|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why did he ruff with the 6?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to confuse us|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E can overruff in the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with one natural trick|pg||
nt|gsper:  But E gets shortened too to avoid the endplay|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed in general you should overruff if possible to avoid any trump endplays|pg||
nt|gsper:  In the other rooms it seems W even doubled a 3@C opening|pg||
nt|gsper:  *room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the difference between the actual 200 and the theoretically available 500 will probably be substantial here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling 3C is different. although it does double opps into game, that opening also tells you that your partner probably has more HCP than anyone else at the table|pg||
nt|gsper:  Why not opener's partner with a misfit the strong one?|pg||
nt|kemperg: stuck?|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4N  long @D and tolerance for @C???  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: West said this 1 is undiscussed, but it looks liks long @D with 2(3)@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sounds right -- ace ask makes no sense    real @C length would bid 5@C|pg||
mb|2D|an|*|nt|ahollan1: Wortel preventing EW from having misunderstanding    4@H and 1@D makes bid look right, equal vul and @CQ  not so much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course still a chance for EW to go wrong   [bid rather than DBL]|pg||
mb|3D|nt|twcho: it is a guideline for the 4th seat player whether to open the hand|pg||
nt|twcho: HCP + no. of @s cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually says  equal length\|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  3nt made in OR on  19 for Lombard team|pg||
nt|jaapfr: simple 9 tricks despite bad @HKJT|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: 9 lead denies 10 and shows a honor|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|twcho: because @s is so vital in partial contract competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with 3-2 we bid 2@D in Netherlands too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now --  is east hand really a prototypical 3@C bid??    only the shadow knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: if this sums up to >= 15, one can open|pg||
nt|twcho: if not, better pass|pg||
nt|penseur9:  that is 12 IMPs for...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: to find 5-2 fit instead of 4-3 :)|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: good unblock - now doesn't matter when Verhees wins @HK|pg||

nt|penseur9:  de Lombard made another 11 IMPs on  23... only 3 IMPs diff now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: players discussing how many 5@h or 5@c would have been off|pg||
nt|gsper:  That was nonsense by me, but it still made|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: @DQ was a BIG clue|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8   v Lankveld  5@D west|pg||
mb|p|nt|penseur9:  5@S for sure NS |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3nt or 4@H?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: ns 2@H/@S openers are natural weak 2's    go figure|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12-14 bal|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: make sure your partnership knows whether 4N or 5@C is asking for partner's minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: with strong leaping michaels they just bid 4m|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: they know :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: options include using 5m as saying  I have my own suit   or   using 4N/5@C to differentiate strength|pg||
mb|3D|nt|penseur9:  I beleive to take with the ace and play trump is best line here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H i guess|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still may go down one though|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: must be puppet stayman,   3@S=4@H, not 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Wortel gave any thought to leading trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close is North to making a stronger bid over 3@S?   other than 4@H  [which endplays partner] what else can he try without playing adjective bridge?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C slam try in @H|pg||
nt|dkkello:  coffe hand ?  ( i am told no hand is a coffehand! )|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this one is with @S 4-3 and @H 3-2 and @DK ok:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dkkello:  The coffeshops in Netherland is also better than ours ;)  |pg||
nt|gsper:  Voice commentator suggests that N had not shown 4@H|pg||
nt|gsper:  *5@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: safest line win spade ace, lead heart queen|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he has not shown five hearts i dont like this method, more likely jansma took a view|pg||
pc|sA|nt|twcho: 4@h can be defeated it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing|pg||
nt|bobholl: boils down to the @C decision i guess|pg||
pc|s9|nt|twcho: what is the best strategy for N to bid his hand against strong @c?|pg||
nt|twcho: it is an interesting problem indeed|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|twcho: EW has missed their par contract of 3NT but N came to their rescue|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y before 5 losers so a dutch coffeeshop hand:)|pg||
nt|gsper:  They have a number of canape positions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Jansma explained 3@D as showing 5-5 btw|pg||
pc|d4|nt|penseur9:  seems a resonnable stop here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North puts dummy down; to bad trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: not necessary in 4@H :) |pg||
pc|dK|nt|penseur9:  should make now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: I think east shd bid 3NT with regard to her sheer strength|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D creates a lot of pressure |pg||
nt|dkkello:  do you agree on the 2 @D bid?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4333333333333 for me ok to deny|pg||
nt|dkkello:  i agree it looks like a NT hand to me!  |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't even understand because 4@H stay 4@H without an hounour :)|pg||
nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzvc: South really took @C10 with the A|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok 2 different views (half specs agree and other disagree as we do)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: but huubke needs swings :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|twcho: her 12 points + her partner's 16+ make 3NT a hot favorite to make|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too much frustrated in the past with a 4333 and missing NT|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: finally an example of canape hand  i.e.  2nd suit is LONGER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H/@S  they use 1@S-2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is this a 1@H opening or upgrade to 2@D = bal 18-19|pg||

mb|p|nt|twcho: many kibitzers pointed out that 4@h should be cold even NS find their ruffs|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry for my wrong analysis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw that at the beginning of the set -- or maybe that was last set|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't see huub do anything wrong (no 2@D bid in the start may be)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: S ostensibly very strong for this sequence but presumably wishing to prevent EW finding viable save|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be more worried about missinbg a slam than about that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: need to drop the offside K, highly unlikely|pg||

nt|marlowepi: in my view -- perhaps skewed -- the consensus approach would be to hope that declarer has wasted cards in spades and  may have to guess the suit, and try to build tricks elsewhere. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: leading a spade puts all the eggs in one basket, whereas if it is right for the defense to play spades  they rate to get another crack at that suit (though adnmittedly it might be ...|pg||

mb|3D|nt|penseur9:  6:50am here in still pitch dark here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: north can you find a green card|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: North asked about 3@D, and north was about to pass, but now east changed it, and North reconsidering|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i had tunnel vision that @H and @D had to break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: law followers bid 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: actually could also have 0@D    4405  or   4414|pg||
nt|roswolf: the vultures are interested now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: law followers bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thems the laws :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nv  1N = 14.5-17    that's really what the CC says|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 3D = ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D is a new one on me, is that a type?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=2-way Multi  a) weak 2@D  b) Strong   CC says front=FG  b) FG @C/@D  c) SF @H/@S  d) 22-23 BAL|pg||
nt|fabsayc: typo|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: 3@D  assumes weak @D hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi al, so what is 3@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Pre-emptive if East has the weak 2 in diamonds|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|twcho: 4@h seems makeable here|pg||
nt|roswolf: not the most inspired lead in the world|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe 3@D is supposed to be invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have allowed EW to find @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Last board of the set now, we will resume at 1:15 PM local (Paris time) which is 12:15 PM London|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  Last hand of the segment - thanks to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt, organisers Marc van Beijsterveldt en Ad Cosijn, and the Dutch Bridge Federation NBB|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they may survive this but playing 2@C multi way you pay a heavy price on the strong hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, then 3D makes a bit of sense, though if E has that handtype the "preempt" is unlikely to hurt NS much. this is a congenital disadvantage of 2-way "weak or strong" bids --  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until partner gets clarification he can't bid in a way that does justice to his hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thanks Gerben :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|nt|twcho: despite the bad break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was 3@C showing @D or  a Relay?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  what's a semi-alert?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: ok, i should have waited for Gerbrand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's when a partially pregnant ...|pg||
nt|penseur9:  while we wait, a quick reminder that the final will take place on February 4th and 5th... don't miss it|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: Ton thinking of bidding, but he knows partner probably has 4-4 in the Majors, so fit not very likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: bd 15 and 16 do not provide good hopes for Onstein 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzvc: so they need to score some imps quickly|pg||
nt|penseur9:  2@S should make but a 2NT by NS probably down... so....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|penseur9:  still much to do for 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|roswolf: invitational to suicide?|pg||
nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at other table  Bakkeren brothers play 2@C/@D AND 2@H as multi|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c6|nt|twcho: but really need double dummy play to bring it in|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|penseur9:  so +1 it will be|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzvc: South: well played :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|penseur9:  ruffing @Cs may not provide an extra trick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st time i played after reading Larry Cohen's 1st book sure enough 2 boards against cohen-berkowitz    i followed the rules, went for 800 and got sympathy   but still a zero|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: now i'm having flashback to opening of M*A*S*H|pg||
nt|penseur9:  not here Cornelia|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great point from Gerben [voice]   with zero controls, Westra could/should assume East has Strong variety|pg||
pc|c2|nt|penseur9:  :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that plus Jansma PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  @H10 for clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since 2C is presumably forcing, S is under no great pressure to bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he can make on diamond return with squeeze and endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  It can make on a diamond return|pg||
pc|c4|nt|twcho: the @c return helps a lot|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|mc|7|nt|Vugraphzvc: Bertens frustrated|pg||
nt|Vugraphzvc: Thank you all we'll be back in about 50 minutes|pg||
pg||
