mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|an|both M longer and stronger H|nt|jallerton: SOS redouble would work very well, but not at all obvious|pg||
nt|dburn: if that is a typical 3@d opening, he probably should, but...|pg||
mb|d|an|takeout|mb|2S|nt|dburn: West may think this is a doubtleton, of course - surely North would not open 3@d with four hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: not that it matters - this is down about four whether he winds or ducks|pg||
nt|jallerton: and there are plenty of combinations with 8-doubleton|pg||
nt|jallerton: best to switch to a @c when he does win it|pg||

nt|VUGRAPHZVH: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have privately copies of e/w CC and will endeavour to interpret the auctions - they play a strong club system|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: this is Rob, your operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzwf: Ok, we've had a techical problem, which has been fixed now. We will put in the scores for the first two boards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: This time the familiar figure of Andrew Robson, playing with Alexander Allfrey|pg||
mb|1N|nt|clinch: EW, as we know, play a strong club...NS do not|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|nilsland:  Welcome back - in this match the Swedish team will meet some Icelandic world champions|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Practical 4@h from Robson|pg||
nt|roswolf: penalty double anyone?|pg||
nt|roswolf: of 1nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a gadget|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör 3 pik boardu|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w play a lot of transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Among those my own favorite opponent - Jon Baldurson who beats mee every time :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C was at least to me suprising|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Hi all. Lots of people playing Multi-Landy in this position over a 1N overcall |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  welcome to the final stanza of the first weekend of the 2012 Camrose|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think we can assume that 2 @C showed majors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: hi Liz|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Think i would pass 2S, but rex disagrees|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|yorkbeach:  NS for England are David Gold and Tony Forrester|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes of course|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h looks a likely make; 5@h may make even on a trump lead because W's spades are so feeble because of the|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Some may prefer showing 6 @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|emre kaya: 3 kör pas dese çok iyi skor alýcaktý ama dönüþe göre 4 kör yapýlabilir|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|clinch: 5! a decent save certainly|pg||
nt|roswolf: a rathe agricultural defence|pg||
pc|c9|nt|clinch: @c|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  their system is http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/ForresterGold.pdf|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yorkbeach:  2@c was either weak with @d or a strong hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|clinch: Robson needs to get Allfrey in to lead a trump to maximise the NS score...would have involved underleading his heart|pg||
nt|clinch: Now may only be -1|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|nilsland:  A little diffucult to play 4-3s but they are the experts :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  much easier to play with 6-1 - just take them from the top |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|clinch: or making?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it has kept EW out of the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|dkkello:  1 NT with a 5 card major suit becoming "normal" , worked out well this time .|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s7|nt|cuttysark:  difficult lead - having cashed one ace he felt he had better cash the other|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: N joked at trick 3 'run out of aces, pard?'|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|clinch: With Since Robson can't ruff the good diamond queen, 11 tricks on a cross ruff coming|pg||
nt|clinch: Spade lead from Roson was costly ...did he think declarer had @h K?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nilsland:  Normal if you play strong NT - not so normal in the weak NT|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|dkkello:  wonder if this is weak or strong ?!  Do you know Mats?|pg||

nt|emre kaya: eðer dekleran as kör kör oynasaydý rua pike vale vermek karo küçüðünü vermek trefl isterdi|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be fun|pg||
nt|clinch: Strong chance of a double game swing there|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson says he got the hand wrong because AA led the 7 of clubs, not the low one he should have done from his holding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@c was probably down one, so no great harm for Wales|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: strong club auction|pg||
nt|clinch: Ah|pg||
nt|clinch: club was an excellent lead|pg||
nt|clinch: but not the seven, apparently!|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will feel he should have made that|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzvu: W isn't happy|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: i would have transferred to @S|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  We should not expect happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: balanced is an individual description|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C may be bid here|pg||
nt|clinch: Another fun hand here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW for Wales are Mike Tedd - John Salisbury http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/TeddSalisbury.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: ayrýca bu deklerasyonda rua kör oturmamak gerekir valeye mazallah dam kör ortaktan tekten düþüverir:)|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nilsland:  Against 4 @H a trump lead will be best - but hard to find from souths hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: 4 pik kuzu|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks as though 4@h will make all right|pg||
nt|roswolf: well who will make the last bid|pg||
nt|dkkello:  "easy"  game in @H   , 2 C! obviously conventional  |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that East did not rebid 2@d|pg||
mb|4D|nt|golfsquash: 3@h|pg||
nt|clinch: Also 5@c, so EW needed to bid 5@h....as did NS on the prior hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south has won the auction|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Greenwood would do very well to come again|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: 3@c on but south would compete to 3! which makes|pg||
nt|roswolf: unlucky heart finesse wrong|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|clinch: To defeat 5@h it looks as though N has to lead his stiff ace, then underlead his club ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzvu: s thinking about continuation|pg||
nt|nilsland:  impressive pass from wrang after partners cuebid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yorkbeach:  the dxK-10 doubleton would have made atacking @d succesful but declarer would not visualise such a friendly layout|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|emre kaya: 4.renk yapmalýydý zaten Esin Haným|pg||
nt|dkkello:   maybe gazzili convention?  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  now defense will not be able to play two rounds of trump|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe the swedish "HÃ¤xan"|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|golfsquash: claim time|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so probably an overtrick|pg||

nt|clinch: Two hands with huge potential already, the IMPometer may be ticking over soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward hand|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 N is easy without a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: A grand slam here, though not for the opening bidder!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: another very exciting hand|pg||
mb|1C|nt|clinch: I think we can classify Robson's opening as weak :)|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s a bit strong....|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nilsland:  W 1 @C is natural or balanced 11-14/17-19 I think|pg||
mb|2D!|an|7-11p, no force|nt|golfsquash: e/w play 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|golfsquash: and inverted minors, even with overcall|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: 1@H MAY BE A TRANSFER TO SPADES|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson will not be happy when he sees the dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the contract will surely be 3 NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  2 NT showing @H  |pg||
mb|3H|nt|golfsquash: and 5 card Majors, 4 D and 2C|pg||
nt|roswolf: DENYING 4 SPADES i think|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North has a constructive weak 2@s available|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the 2@d Multi shows a weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|yorkbeach:  if it is one of the weak options|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: in for a penny in for a pound|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have raised to 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S checking lead styles|pg||
nt|roswolf: will probably take the spade finesse to create an extra entry to dummy|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or 5 @D which at least has a chance|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|clinch: Don't blame E for passing, though he might have bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|dkkello:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Well done by Johan Upmark|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  in 3rd seat I am not sure of the need to make the distinction - perhaps it helps partner judge whether to save|pg||
nt|dkkello:  to much bidding from N-S  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  but we miss an entry to make it easy|pg||
nt|dkkello:  But V @D are to good  :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Clubs must be played from E two times|pg||
nt|dkkello:  take it easy Wrang , Kick-off (Handball) in 3 h  and 10 min :)  |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  East might have wanted to bid 2NT after the double to show two places to play|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but perhaps he thought West would take it as natural|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Handball - what is that (we dont have that in sweden)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  you have the good bridgeplayers then!  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  if you ask Fredin its only one...|pg||
nt|dkkello:  true :) |pg||
nt|nilsland:  I didnt say it was true :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yorkbeach:  defenders will need to play @c eraly to stop the overtrick|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: much harder to bid game if west opens strong NT|pg||
nt|dkkello:  no,  Fredin did  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: hmm so far so good|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks cold now and declarer is unlikely to go down because the defence will open up the suits to his advantage|pg||

nt|roswolf: ARE THE OBVIOUS ONES - PASS ALSO HAS ITS ATTRACTIONS|pg||
nt|rain:  Hi Everyone, r_prah is going to comment to spice things up for you all :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: hiding in the long grass is 3@S but what will north make of it|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW has some transfers|pg||
mb|2S|nt|golfsquash: 1NT rebid 15-17|pg||
nt|roswolf: the magical mystery tour continues|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Sorry i can't explain more..it's very murky here|pg||
nt|roswolf: dbl showing long spades and @D tolerance?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S weak raise - good raise via 2@H|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@s bid on last is understandable, but surely EW had some kind of double-then-bid type of auction available|pg||
nt|ady: still tempting for north|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but  perhaps2 @S is not one of them :)|pg||
nt|dkkello:  E-V should go down 1 in @H , but maybe N-S bid to 4 @S  ?  |pg||
nt|nilsland:  I lika the initial pass from West - some players seems to be unable to pass such hands|pg||
mb|2N|nt|emre kaya: herkes kartý iyi oynuyor demek ki:)|pg||

nt|dkkello:  I thought about open 1 @H , but I known you knows better  Mats   |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm imaginative keepinf his clubs concealed|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS reached a sensible 3NT, although 6@C or 6@D has the virtue of making as the cards lie|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: and then play in 2@d or 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: S asking about the 3D bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: east doesnt give up|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It looks like 4 @S is making|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark:  Lucky 3-3 heart break|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: auction on previous was something like 2@h-(2!n)-3@h..........4@h(S)-(X)-end|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have done well to diagnose the misfit and stop at a safe level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has the @sA, declarer might set up the @d as the @sK will be an entry|pg||
nt|dkkello:  or 1 down  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzvu: got an explanation now, 3@C random game try, often with H and 3H is LT without 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson still thinking|pg||
nt|clinch: After opening his 1 count on 19, who can blame him for entering with this monster?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: wilkinson states that they could be in a 3-0 fit and hes not sure on the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer can see only 5 top tricks and a shortage of entries to hand|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: the real upside of 1N with the S hand comes when W is strong and balanced while EW have a 44 spade fit, and N can do something dynamic over the pass (or NT bid) by W|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yorkbeach:  'octopus' suggested by Keth from England|pg||
nt|kemperg: defense now regrettes @SA taken to soon|pg||
nt|dkkello:  board 21 was a push  4 @Hx down 2 also in the open room |pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: a high level contract in @D is likely|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  many players do not like to use Michaels when they have 6 in the major|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: they've had about half the time for this stanza now|pg||
nt|r_prah: EW will likely end up in a spade partial|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     and fairly low|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome Ed:)|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW can make 3 NT but will they find it?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|nt|roswolf: indeed a pass missed out perhaps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: depending on how high they get the 4-0 trump break may hurt them|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the trump break appears to be 5-4 at the moment, since East-West are bidding diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: last board might have been opened and e/w would make up to 10 tricks in spade partscore|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they have played 7, so will need to play the reamining 9 a bit faster|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they could have been a bit quicker on 23|pg||
nt|r_prah: If either North or South had bid an enterprising 2NT, they would have struck gold|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|golfsquash: 2@d is control showing, 0 or 1 control|pg||
nt|r_prah: 2@S should go 1 down on normal play|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzvu: Tk you Mr Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: don't quite understand 3@d, but maybe it was just a general invitation (or did 1@d show hearts?)|pg||
nt|othered1: South came to bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  players did not need to discuss terms for an 8-high hand :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there are time penalties for finishing late|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, this lead may assist declarer, but he still has plenty to do|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: came into the world that way|pg||
nt|ady: defence can take 3 hearts  1 club   and at least 1 sspade|pg||
nt|r_prah: NS however have to defend accurately. Three rounds of hearts will allow declarer to discard his club|pg||
nt|r_prah: If North cashes the @CA, that should seal declarer's hopes|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: likely down 1|pg||
nt|ady: 3 clubs has a chance|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: good views required in clubs  and hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W takeout double  a bit surprising. opening the hand does the job a lot better than pass and then double with the wrong shape facing a partner who couldnt open in 3rd chair green, ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and foes who seem to have spades so  are solid favorites to declare|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we all know what the prize is for winning a trick with the @d7 at trick 13|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trick 13|pg||

nt|copeyj: 2@H @H and minor I suppose|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and we better agree on that |pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: south feels preemption of semi-psyching 1N overrides the value of getting only KQJ9xx into the auction.|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  matchpoints I suspect North doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|emre kaya: ha ok Koray abi trefl ruayý attý|pg||

pc|h4|nt|dburn: this may not be the way to reach it, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if North bids 3@s now South has a good hand for diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not everyone's 1N but at these colours i couldn;t agree more|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Club ruff is needed|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvu: without the 2@s from S, 3@d is a game try in @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the advantage of screens is that South did not know who was thinking there|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|VUGRAPHZVH: evet uyudu|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm hope this is not read has delayed support|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: and if he bids 4@h and South understands it...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: A big sigh from S as he pulled the pass card|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm your Law violated again David|pg||
nt|xenya: you need to have faith in partner to apply splinter here |pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he should have done, but that's not the kind of thing to spring on partner in the middle of a Camrose match|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: true but this is a belly blow|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: continuing the preempt?  Or have wheels come off?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: short in spades and not too many hearts, so obstruction is likeliest to the the Primary Issue of the Deal|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|golfsquash: I trust that he won't switch to a low club|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: now anything could happen|pg||
nt|roswolf: double!?|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially if South can't overcall naturally in diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: the opening promises ZERO @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: so i think 2@D should be natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: hi roswolf|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: must come up fairly often, then - I mean, all hands have at least no diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: true but 3@D is in the zone|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks competitive|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Brian Short & David Walker|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: Looks like a routine game in @S and that EW won't be able to obstruct the auction sufficiently to get in the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: this is probably natural, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: western cue bids are not in fashion these days|pg||
nt|ady: just the 2 losers in spades   assuming a diamond lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scots may have won the auction|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4 H seems makable|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kemperg: still a nce contract, bad luck for Anita|pg||

nt|golfsquash: pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 3nt too far fetched|pg||
nt|dburn: and if South bids 3@s as he might, the partnership should at least avoid 3NT, but...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...if he does that instead, Crouch may well lead a club and not a spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: which black suit will west lead|pg||
nt|ady: Robson will find an agreeable dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N presumably is a specific @S raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: alerted, but didnt say what|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW play 2NT as limit or better, so 3@s is a 4-card raise to 2@s|pg||
nt|dkkello:  and 5 @C |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: since he knows Patterson doesn't have diamonds, so he is very likely to have clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D   shows hearts?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|xenya: spades looks natural|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's not 100% - he may well lead spades anyway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: might just make four|pg||
nt|ady: apparantly 3@D   random game try|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's a vul overcall worth a random game try, what's h is minimum in this situation?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: the fact that S has made a game try gives us a hint of what the lower limits of a vul overcall might be for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you beat me to it Ed|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: he does have 3 tens|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT might have made on a @h lead|pg||
nt|r_prah: 246.5 Meters gained 11 IMPs on Board 22 when Jonsson and Baldursson appeared to have a misunderstanding about the meaning of a double|pg||
nt|r_prah: Meanwhile, a comfortable 3NT for EW here, not in any real jeopardy|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes but when your opps hardly know what they are doing then opening leads are much more difficult|pg||
