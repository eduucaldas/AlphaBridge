nt|js1986: on board 1 weak NT opening by Anil padhye earned manyawar 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: Major prob in bidding understanding|pg||
nt|js1986: surprising for a regular pair in such an uncontested common auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: the doubleton @h queen in E, big @C fit with king under finesse all combine to make 5@C a making prospect here|pg||
mb|p|nt|js1986: maybe they have changed 2@d opening meaning recently|pg||
mb|1C|nt|psridhar: a fit showing 3@H now by S will do it|pg||

nt|vugraphzyc: S explained as Multi which is normally 6 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzyc: But he had 5 card suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vicky888: 1nt opening would be better than 1s|pg||

nt|rv: strong @c auction here|pg||

nt|js1986: he is well known for singing songs, cracking jokes and making fun on and off the table :) his p ajay is very serious tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: it is played as non-touching suits (@c+@h or @d+@s)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|js1986: as expected, 6@c earns I doctors 13 precious Imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|rv: as cards are 3n makes and N-S won't lose even if they don't find 4-4 major (@s) fit|pg||
nt|js1986: seems like a cold 4@s here and at this vul NS will not compete to 5 level|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: Pradhan they didnt promise a @s lead, what if they lead @d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 4@h double will save 3 IMPs for E-W, N-S unlikely to find 4-4 @s fit now|pg||
