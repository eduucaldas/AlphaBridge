mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-16 HCP, 5+@D, unbal or 5332 unsuitable for 1@C/1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play system called  Modified Polish   nobody remembers why it is called that except maybe Bilski used to play for Poland before move to OZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S forcing  usually 14+ hcp, maybe less if both majors|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: their version is called "Looney Tunes" according to the notes that Thompson handed me :)|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|robinswr: with 4-4 in the majors, respond 1@s to partner's take out double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes  that's what they have on their Convention Card too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: @H @S 3@D + @C to lose i expect|pg||
nt|loganrun: 1D shows hearts and double is t/o of hearts, redouble shows 3 hearts|pg||
nt|newart:  are these guys sitting in right direction?  table says Newman is NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart:  the score for last board seems to have gone to newman|pg||

nt|robinswr: that way you can bid hearts later|pg||
mb|3S|nt|robinswr: and lucky you're playing in the suit which splits|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant:  Wow|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tejjyid: North has a good hand, but the 4441 ness of it woulddissuade me from caling it a GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|newart:  should be 6 in the outbox for newman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if Thompson has shown 64 or if still possible 55|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|itinerant:  I don't like Nathan VJ's chances here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S sure implies  3@S was 64 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Beauchamp playing 3N North|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure what he would do with 5-4|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: i've learned this week that pairs only need to play ONE out of the 4 segments each match|pg||

mb|2D|nt|aramesh_:  Welcome to Serhat Ozenir|pg||
nt|serhat: hello everyone|pg||
nt|r_prah: Pass seems flawed by South, even facing a Non-forcing 1NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually when playing responding to 1nt you bid if you would bid 2nt over 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|loganrun: The boards are tamer at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger in 2@H East|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gulp    i expected DBL after bidding only 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must have seen Bilski's overcalls before|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Nathan "what more can i \ask for "|pg||
mb|p|nt|itinerant:  but I'm guessing it's pretty natural!|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Klinger Mullamphy - Standard|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'm sure it is - they're a casual partnership, right?|pg||
nt|itinerant:  this might be a quick defence also|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Braithwaite van Jole 2/1|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The correct score is Klinger 41 Newman 24|pg||
nt|ahollan1: identical start to the auction   but Mullamphy balanced with 2nd DBL|pg||
pc|s3|nt|itinerant:  diamond lead, |pg||
nt|itinerant:  prompt diamond ruff...|pg||
nt|itinerant:  or will the x-ruff take place..|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|robinswr: i think if partner had something worth saying he would have said it over 2@d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|itinerant:  With only 2 top tricks outside trumps, declarer would have to take 8 trump tricks o nthe x-ruff to make it...|pg||
nt|r_prah: Hi Serhat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: at 100 per undertrick   Klinger will need to work hard for a push|pg||
pc|cK|nt|itinerant:  doesn't seem likely|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|robinswr: with 14 and two 10's it would be clear to raise 2nt to 3nt as in the other room. the spades are even reasonable|pg||
nt|r_prah: right|pg||
nt|serhat: when you play normal NT reponces it happens.|pg||
nt|robinswr: change the ace of clubs to the queen and if might be right to pass 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over standard 1@D  do you agree with DBL or would you overcall 1N?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: I can't see 10 tricks on this line|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Andy just asking if he's in 2@s, no doubt|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, any line I choose now will be double-dummy; I think I would have tried a @S to the K though|pg||
nt|itinerant:  yes, sneaking 1 spade trick through without giving up the lead would have been handy|pg||
nt|serhat: on a H lead it is not that confortable as well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|r_prah: 10 tricks now|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|tejjyid: your judgement faster than his - but equally correct|pg||
nt|loganrun: Diamond lead and heart switch|pg||
nt|newart:  duck the D|pg||
nt|loganrun: Too many letters on the keyboard!|pg||
nt|petergill: or Italian bidding, in which 18-19 balanced is opened with (say) 2@D, so that 2NT rebid over 1@H here shows 6 @D's and 3 @H's.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when responder is accepting a jump rebid with 5 of his major  -- no worries, but when responder weaker  the west hand is pure guess|pg||
nt|robinswr: the one rebid you should avoid is 1@s since if partner has four spades you'll end up in spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 1 imp margin now - we all predicted a close match today, when we lost the semis yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: were you involved in development of Cole convention?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Peter -- you had TWO tough matches|pg||
nt|robinswr: yes Woolsey, Manfield, Boyd and me have all worked on it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i assume  Bill COLE|pg||
nt|petergill: Not clear how to play this 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: Actually Cole had very little to do with it|pg||
nt|robinswr: no we're incorpating transfer responses to 1@c which allows many Cole auctions|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Through his bleary eyes, he noticed the vulnerability, and perhaps also noticed that his pard is likely to have 4 spades along with some heart length|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|h2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: North thought south was making cue bid(s)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: a little surprised to see dummy|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right; they're highly unlikey to have moe than an 8 card fit at best, so why not defend?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Mullamphy could have had only two spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: robinson-boyd auctions over 1@C are very interesting|pg||
nt|petergill: Peter Newman is one of the very best players in Australia, but plays only one event a year due to family and work commitments. His annual event? He won the Gold Coast Teams (our ...|pg||
nt|petergill: biggest event, 420 tables in one room) one year, then the Grand National Teams a couple of years ago, and last year was 2nd best qualifier into the Finals of this event. Not a bad ...|pg||
nt|petergill: record. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19  2@H did go down 2     |pg||
nt|robinswr: I've found that very few players can play once a year and still play very well|pg||
nt|petergill: Peter Newman thus has every excuse to be rusty. He also told me yesterday that he finds it pretty tiring for a "once a year" player to play 7 days straight of 60+ boards. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event was won 2 years ago by Mat McManus  who also plays just once a year   and a very unusual system with Kiwi  Michael Ware|pg||
nt|petergill: Peter Newman has four kids plus a top job with Fujitsu, hence his lack of bridge. |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|newart:  small D lead yes|pg||

nt|robinswr: opening light with a balanced hand in 3rd seat could lead to a big minus score|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: multi|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: board 2 will be a bigger swing in the other SemiFinal match  Jacobs-Thompson NS bid and made 5@H   the other room in 4@SX|pg||
nt|robinswr: the major disadvantage of mult is that south does not know which major his partner has|pg||
nt|petergill: In the last qualifying match this year, the dangerous McManus - Ware combo (seeded 2) were beaten 24-6 by Dyke, putting them out of the Finals|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: still (11)12-14|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's unfashionable to gather imps in 5's, but it can still be effective|pg||
mb|2D|an|!hs|nt|itinerant:  yeah - it's an achievemnt  to stop in 2S with a 4333 12 count opposite an opening bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Klinger always like to build an appreciation ofloser count into his raise structures - 4333's have a LOT of losers|pg||
nt|frankaus: ur match V klinger was a close thing :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: normal transfer|pg||
mb|2H|nt|itinerant:  yes indeed. Weak notrumpers might have bid 1N 3N on the last hand and scored +600, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: seems like he didnt care|pg||
nt|robinswr: he assumes hearts but what if partner had spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=2/3 fit    all 4-fit super accept one way or another|pg||
nt|itinerant:  2C this time might be drury, i suspect|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well bid if so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (the 3nt auction)|pg||
nt|serhat: he has only 8 anyway|pg||
nt|r_prah: As it turns out, 3NT is on a diamond guess, which declarer should get right after the preempt from North|pg||
nt|newart:  9 tricks serhat on immediate d finesse|pg||
nt|serhat: he has to finese @D right as he needs that 9th tricks incase Qxxx on S|pg||
nt|serhat: ty Neil:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@S from E seems to make but not from W|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid with the south hand over 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|serhat: because he has no K or A of spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the percentage play for 4 diamond tricks is to play south for the queen (even without the auction)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: 3@H = game force  5+@S 4+@H  so not playing Smolen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: alerted as Drury - but North not respecting the convention|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Can i click "dislike" on the 3H bid?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: This is now double drury - the "are you sure?" variety...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|frankaus: this will  be 4 of the top|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|itinerant:  ha|pg||
nt|r_prah: True; finessing North for the diamond queen requires diamonds to be 3-3 as well. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tejjyid: brb|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Van Jole opting for the cheeky 4-carder in third seat has been punished...|pg||
nt|itinerant:  ... by partner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: Ben Thompson is not as wild as some Aussie bidders - though he was wilder in his youth - he almost won the 1991 World Juniors with teammates Matt Mullamphy and Peter Newman|pg||
pc|hA|nt|loganrun: Declarer must be careful to hold this together|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thompson's choice over 1N would have been 2@S [natural]   NS play ASPRO over 1N   a convention not seen in north america|pg||

pc|h3|nt|loganrun: Good start|pg||

nt|frankaus: 5 more to newman|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neat series of articles in Bridge World introduced  ASTRO, then ASPRO, then ASPTRO  one of those modifications was Terence Reece|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|itinerant:  ron possibly imagining that south's hand includes the @dA?|pg||
nt|itinerant:  he may, therefore emerge with the @sK|pg||
nt|itinerant:  Anyone know if EW lead attititude or count in the mid-game?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: that was late 60s or early 70s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: maybe that needs 9+ cards??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unless playing Kokish where able to show 4M & 5+@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: well EW think S has psyched?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they know they have a fit they are unsure about the psyche |pg||

nt|vugrapha2: damn supposed to be an undertrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gets my vote :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: some dispute about the explanation on 2@c - will be discussed later|pg||
nt|ahollan1: am i resulting that Steve?|pg||
mb|1C|an|14+|nt|ahollan1: 03:40 in D.C.   I shouldn't pick on Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is late|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = forcing, usually 14+  or  2+@C 15+ hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|!ss|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=0-11 hcp, 4+@S|pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: 3NT here could roll in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 29  Klinger opened 2N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: cant really C it happening|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@C 3@D +@H|pg||
nt|dan_hohor: the clear favorites are 40 imps behind with 32 boards to go after this set |pg||
nt|robinswr: of course with the hearts set up no reason to split the clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he'll also end up in 3N |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 4|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: thru only 10 boards   Klinger 32  Bloom 13|pg||
nt|r_prah: you're right|pg||
nt|serhat: this one might get ugly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: +@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: maybe|pg||
nt|loganrun: Could be Klinger in 2S in each room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Noble stuck after not bidding 1N over 1@H|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: time is officially up|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they may have some leniancy since they bid hand one|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you're going to open this hand you should rebid your hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|larrymori: asking about the @h raise|pg||
nt|loganrun: Even this 4H has a nasty surprise but is still very makeable|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think that double should be penalties|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT -1 would be a pick up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and a good thing too|pg||
nt|serhat: seems like dbled 3nt Steve!:)|pg||
nt|robinswr: after 2/1 all doubles should be (you made a big mistake)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: On a good day you make slam, with these breaks 4 is plenty|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Ish "Oh dear"|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|robinswr: newman thinks that the hearts are not spliting|pg||
nt|serhat: I wonder whats happening close room|pg||
nt|serhat: no dbl !|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|robinswr: slow auctions get doubled|pg||
nt|robinswr: if south had rebid 3@h over 2@s then he woulnd't have been doubled|pg||
nt|robinswr: east knows that he has a good hand and the auction was slow by the opponents|pg||
nt|r_prah: I confess I wouldn't open 1@H with the South hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: west can't double since east might not have any tricks|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|robinswr: it is not the primary benefit of transfers to get the strong hand to play the hand its primary purpose is to create extra  limbs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS in other room do not play transfer responses   so  what happens after 1@C-P-?    if Beauchamp PASS, does Newman balance?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: sorry  does Klinger balance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with Newman's hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|dan_hohor: good pick up for Nobel|pg||
nt|larrymori: I thought he was going to start @ds early|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you time it to perfection there is an overtrick when South must follow to four clubs|pg||
nt|loganrun: This line looks as good as any I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then you can ruff two spades and set up an endplay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But easiersaid than done|pg||
nt|serhat: best line is @D now.|pg||
nt|robinswr: the slow auction told east that partner had five hearts|pg||
nt|serhat: may be he can get away with -2|pg||
nt|r_prah: many options. Ruff a spade and lead a club up; ruff a spade and lead a diamond; lead a low club from dummy; lead the @DQ and duck|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|loganrun: Reminds me of a hand I showed Klinger along time ago - I said you are in 4S how do you play it? and he said which way EW or NS - it wasn't a good contract|pg||
nt|serhat: or if you see cards C even!:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|serhat: the only good thing about bad split is E can not play a trump!!|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|robinswr: west led the 4 of spades, he then played the 6 and the 8 if he had diamonds he would play the 8 and the 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very well guessed|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: final board for our room|pg||

mb|2N|nt|andyv:  EW may get to 4@s here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice from above reminds    BBO Schedule now has icon to show which events have Voice Commentary|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  N with Axx of @hs and another A has a 3@h bid|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so 1@H overcall with intermediate strength|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry about that Wayne  i know you came to play|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final board of 1st set    2nd quarter begins in 45 minutes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: will do|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: BREAKING NEWS:   Klinger making 3N on 29   will take the lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: ours is 1st room to finish   lots of hands to see in replay at other tables|pg||
nt|loganrun: I have to go - thanks all - this 6D looks fairly straightforward - good job Wayne|pg||
nt|r_prah: One more set after this|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C sets the game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is a group that won't do that with 4 card major unless 6@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: The others must make up for Braithwaite's slowness :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: although he has been quick this session|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT will be played from the other side in the open room after North opens a 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: was 4@C asking for cue bids  or asking for key cards?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: There is no other opening in the NS methods|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1nt range creates a swing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: playing Fantunes|pg||
nt|larrymori: is it 16 x 4 boards in this match?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: tu all 4 ur company 2X16 sets to go cu soon|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|loganrun: He could open 2C but he is a little too good|pg||
nt|newart:  arj might get put off by the H cue|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: don't ask me -- i can't tell|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: natural i think Braithwaite certainly explained 5@c as a key card response|pg||
nt|newart:  after the 3NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: van Jole's 4@D made it easier |pg||
nt|newart:  yes having a strong jump avail makes it much easier|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, you can't have 5422 when you open 2@C|pg||
nt|serhat: yes but if Q@C was side, it would have been different|pg||
nt|serhat: on side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we think not so much NT range as North's decision to stretch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: been a long time since i've seen someone bid 1@S in this sequence with 4-bagger|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: seems a bit inconsistent to do that then bid 4N instead of direct keycard ask  or  follow-up cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no harm|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: they are negotiating a claim |pg||
nt|newart:  if i couldn't bid 3D strong i would bid 4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: thanks Wayne     |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in 40 minutes|pg||

nt|dan_hohor: yep, ty Frank and all |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: 10-13 with 5+ clubs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dan_hohor: this set might be rememberd for the 6NT well played by declarers and missed opportunity by the defenders |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
