nt|hackenbush: full results at http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/MicroSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|hackenbush: there may even be live scores for all matches soon|pg||
nt|kareno: Looking at the two e/w hands, this is a slam depending on a finesse (and Benito Garozzo advises against).  Black suits need to break as well.  |pg||
nt|kareno: Really, that ninth trump makes a huge difference for slam purposes.|pg||
nt|kareno: We'll have to wait and see if they bid it :)|pg||
nt|kareno: They are supposed to start on the hour.  Our Vugraph operator was very prompt to set up for us.|pg||
nt|kareno: Question from a spec.  Which 9th trump am I referring to?  Answer: the one they don't have on this hand :)|pg||
nt|kareno: We should be starting in a few minutes.  Be patient!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Does anyone know which age group this group is?  Under 26?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|minimeck: it is most likely the players began as scheduled about 30 minutes ago, and the operator will simpy enter the scores for these first few hands|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kareno: Yes, this is the Under 26 group|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|minimeck: Dwyer and Lien are a very long term partnership here, play a strong club, strong & variable nt's |pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: So e/w using new minor forcing.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Apparently 2@d is forcing checkback.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d seems to be GF checkback|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kareno: 3nt doesn't look natural.  East thinking|pg||
nt|kareno: East showed four hearts first, then raised spades.|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kareno: 3nt some sort of slam try |pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|mb|6S|nt|kareno: Blackwood and east shows 2 keycards without the queen.  And they are in slam.|pg||

nt|hackenbush: these partial swings can definitely add up|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ritong: i would agree matt|pg||
nt|minimeck: The reasoning behind openign one diamond is that you might need to get your suits in before the opponents pre-empt|pg||
nt|ritong: superb 6/4 plus three @ss, reducing preempting possibilities|pg||
mb|2H|nt|minimeck: but it's going to be very tough to show this hand strenght from an 11-15 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 5@s worked well|pg||

nt|1can1:  1@S-3@S (or even 4@S) makes it much tougher on NS|pg||
nt|MolvaM: rite|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: over precision diamond 2@d is frequently natural and 2@h michaels, but not here it seems|pg||
nt|minimeck: any votes for 4@s over 1@d?|pg||

nt|MolvaM: china was caught on the last board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3c was an unnecessary bid|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if east had passed, south would probably bid 3D|pg||
nt|1can1:  That is the other reason I don't like the 2@D call by South, partner will rightfully expect at least a King more. It didn't matter on this deal but it could be a disaster.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: east tried to save himsef but there was no guarantee that west holds 4 clubs|pg||
