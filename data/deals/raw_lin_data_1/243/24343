mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  a close decision South is facing|pg||

nt|malipivo:  A diamond suit is a challenger.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bridgegoth: Luckily every suit behaves, the K@C can take care of the @D loser|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: he can try that right away and get the good news, @hs are unexpectedly 3-3, even better news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and hearts are 3-3, so hearts are behaving|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: OH! that's the BEST news yet!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ticha-Spangenberg played great in the last tournament.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were winning 70% in pairs for some time and winning it later.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: in the unlikely even A@D is doubleton, a @H pitch is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if she can go wrong.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't see how, even if you experiment in the other suits, you always have multiple entries|pg||
