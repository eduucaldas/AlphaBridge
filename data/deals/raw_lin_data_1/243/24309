mb|p|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
pc|d9|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: how guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi guys|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting hand to start the set here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|reisig: Nice to start w a nothing hand :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only lead to set 6D here would be a spade lead from 2 small|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  on spade lead, if declarer ducks queen clubs, Katz must play heart to break up squeeze|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but then again, he can then cash 3 hearts, ruff to hand and ruff club|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very fortunate layout for the declarer here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with one hand holding the AK clubs and the 4th heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@d is cold isnt it?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  and the hearts splitting 43|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: on @s lead you play @c|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  so yes slam is "cold"  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and south must play back both a heart to break up squeeze and a trump to stop ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  right; he only gets to lead once a trick :(|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tough decision here for zimmerman|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW system: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|barnets: no lead gives dec any problems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Lots of laughter when dummy came down|pg||
pc|c2|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Welcome back all|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  huge pickup in other oom by meckwell|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|barnets: in open room north passed south opened 2@H and it went all pass|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nice quiet board to start|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Swiss after 7 matches: 1 - Lynch, 2 - Diamondm 3 - Meltzer, 4 - Schreiber, 5 - Jacob. Top 10 with complete team names will be on Bridge Winners in a few minutes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: this resulted in a surprising swing to Monaco right off the bat|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, not sure if there are comentators|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H natursl GF|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: West had a good 17 points but elected not to bid|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
nt|warrens:  once S won the K of @Cs (the normal play), it seemed likely that Levin would guess the @S's correctly|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That whirring noise you hear is Harold Berlin spinning in his grave.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||
pc|hK|nt|leo lasota:  +920, -490 for Nickell team = win 10 imps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|reisig: 490|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: same contract in open room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  back to 5 imp difference|pg||
nt|barnets: Hi all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|barnets: 2@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|warrens:  also, there's an inference when North doesn't lead a @S that he might have the Ace.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again, ken|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Harold was a fanatic about "Never lead dummy's long suit!"|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@H will drift down a few|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: perhaps Nickell hoped his partner would reopen|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  South should just concede now :)|pg||

pc|h5|nt|dburn: could win in a number of ways - East might have four spades, or five hearts - but some of those times 1NT will be down anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if the opponents have a lot of club tricks and partner does have a major, double might lead to a making contract at both tables|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no entries suggests @S|pg||
nt|dburn: unless of course...|pg||
nt|dburn: ...maybe he can make from here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since @C 33 and Nunes on more @H   he's endplayed on @S|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  precision 2C opener in other room for Meckwell here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick down 1 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT trumpQ +1 king|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pass-pass-dbl-pass-2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  likely down 2 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "I Know you like me to bid 3 on these hands"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6@C should be gran slam interest asking about @C holding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein checks that the lead is 3rd and 5th - it is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting lead prob for West, but jack clubs seems right on auction|pg||
nt|reisig: May just bid 3@c|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  N's double shows @D's and @H tolerance, so it's easy for Berkowitz to bid 3@D vulnerable|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: closed room lineup is the same as the 2nd session|pg||
nt|warrens:  this can't be beaten if declarer reads the cards right.  has to hold up once in @H's and finesse the @C 10|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
nt|kit: difficult opening lead for Levin here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4th from longest and strongest works well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin checking about the DBL of 1@s - showed 3 @hs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky heart split for declarer gives him a chance to make|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3343 shape argues against bidding 3C; and he is still not sure how much the other way may make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin will likely do just that Warren|pg||
nt|kit: He found the winning lead -- now declarer will have to guess which finesse to take for  8|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|leo lasota:  switch the king clubs in dummy with a working card in the majors and 4 major may be cold|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: 4@S just down 1|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|dT|nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy has 3 discs to make 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|barnets: dec will then KO @DA cash a black AK and uess his finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: guess|pg||
nt|barnets: his finesse|pg||
nt|kit: Note the play of the 9 of hearts -- Now Levin is afraid that declarer started with 109xx|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||
nt|ritong: when this will go down 2 effortless|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sT|pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher should view this as a +5 or a +8 plus position|pg||
nt|phil: hi |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3 rounds hearts here to get count on hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Phil|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kit: of course Weinstein has a problem exiting -- he may be afraid that a diamond shift will guess the diamonds for declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: but a spade is safe|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ruff exit 3rd heart works as well|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  reopeated endplays by Katz here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: NS in 1N next door -- going 1 off|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, something went weird and they went x, -1 instead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|barnets: as it turns out|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done by katz|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hasnt made it yet|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if zimmerman shows all those HCP, Multon is marked king spade|pg||
nt|reisig: He'll get the @s right|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  win ace cash heart then low diamond only losing option presented|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  likely 4 imps for Nickell here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  unless Zimmerman gives the losing option and Katz falls for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: if he makes its 5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  160 is 4..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: indeed it is but the difference will be 210|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  oops vul of course :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||
nt|phil: well, its not like -2 is a great possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: so i presume south overcalled|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but now declarer will be able to take the spade finesse safely, and when it loses he can still fall back on the club guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|santyclz2:  A slight hint that n has the @c q as if he were xxx in both suits he might have exited a @c.  Very slight.|pg||
nt|barnets: so a great shift if South had Qx spade giving dec a losing option|pg||
nt|barnets: were he originally to cash the @SAK before taking club fin|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ok no losing opeiton|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tie match|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  I think Levin will cash all the @S's to get a better count.  in the end he'll finesse|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  With Berk marked with just the KQ hearts and jack clubs thusfar, Levin will know that the only other HCP are the Q diamonds; Berk has overcalled and taken free 3D bid; therefore he will play for 55 shape in Berk's hand rather than 1543|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|phil: oh|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  4S makes here with the 33 hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein asked Levin about shape - 4333 with 4 @ss. "Didn't want to bid 3@s with 4333" |pg||

nt|psyck: NS CC: http://usbf.org/images/conventioncards/cayne-seamon.jpg|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
nt|ritong: guess multon will opt for 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
nt|reisig: This looks like 4@s X|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Funny comment by Levin there... Not sure if any bridge player could ever play too fast for Sontag :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4 imps fo Nickell when thy made 3@D in othe room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  64 bid more..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: even 3NT makes on this layout ;)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  playing strength wotrth 3S call|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
nt|warrens:  this might go down 800 if the defense stays off of @C's|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w just have 2 aces |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin alerted 1NT, Weinstein didn't; probably just that can have 4 card Majors|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a powerhouse opp his partners opener|pg||
nt|pelu:  http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2011veldhoven/bermudabowl/usa%201/levin-weinstein.pdf|pg||
mb|4D|nt|warrens:  500 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does Nickell give a raise?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  queen diamonds value is sketchy at best|pg||
nt|barnets: ask for aces somehow would work|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin concerned about possibly missing vul slam here if he passes|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@d seems kinda "normal"|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@C bid is somewhat conservative as Levin doesn't need much to make a game.|pg||
nt|barnets: but unsuccessfull|pg||
mb|4H|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will correct 34|pg||
nt|reisig: @c will NOT be led|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  But in the end, he makes good decision to pass and take the plus score|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Weinstein will high low in trump here, to show his @H king |pg||
nt|barnets: maybe a quantitative raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT also reasonable, and also unsuccessful|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  good result in other room by Meckwell escaping for 200|pg||
nt|sybarra: obviously these guys know what they are doing,  pretty good 6 @D here  (7 actually makes bt who would want to be there??)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  5D down 1 is certainly better for N/S than 3nt down 5|pg||
nt|reisig: So - 1 IMP|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  -1 or a push|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D starts a gameforce|pg||
nt|barnets: South shows good clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  although the 41 club break is unfortunate for N/S, at least the ace of spades is not in the west hand; therefore 4nt is no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: 6NT by East is cold and actually makes 7 as the cards lie since E has to play to keep N off lead. |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
mb|5N|an|choice of slams|nt|kit: Well, somebody can make 3NT ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  I believe this will be a push now|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Zimmerman may be thinking of layouts to set 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  and therefore may switch to heart whwne in with club rather than trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: katz is asking about his opponents methods|pg||
nt|barnets: If the @SA was with west the heart suit is blocked as well|pg||
nt|barnets: now the quant raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to admit i would have accepted the invite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and would have been wrong on this hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or Multon may win club and lead jack hearts for same reason (try to set 2)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +800 for E/W here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Having bid 1NT - I's avoid bidding 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 15-17 as far as i know|pg||
nt|warrens:  he wants his partner to know it's safe to shift to @H's from the King|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, went for 800 at the other table.  likely same thing here.|pg||
nt|barnets: who said no double bo trouble|pg||
nt|barnets: no trouble|pg||
nt|kit: Give West the ace of hearts, and 3NT is the winner.|pg||
nt|barnets: so well done danger was lurking there|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes barnet, but only information Levin will know for sure pretty quickly is the clubs do not break :)|pg||
nt|barnets: of slam off 2 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but N is way better than 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
nt|reisig: 800 as expected -  is a push |pg||
nt|sybarra: debate among the kibbers talking to me,  whether @S or @D safer |pg||
nt|dinos1: problem is stop in 6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
nt|reisig: Would E bid 3@h with no @h ace?|pg||
nt|kit: Heart shift will be trivial to find, and Weinstein will go up king as only chance to make|pg||
nt|barnets: he rates to have the @HA yes |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Sergey :)  welcome|pg||
nt|dinos1: hello)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K&R = 16.55|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spot cards are huge here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes little more than the @DQ onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Rodwell almost ready to play...|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer might play @Cs now, hoping for Hx in East|pg||
pc|s8|nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Multon gets it right and plays the trump for 1 imp gain; well done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin will be holding his breath after trick 3|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
nt|warrens:  that was his only entry to dummy, so he had to try right away|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
nt|sybarra: should we say "gin" now |pg||
pc|d6|nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||
pc|d7|nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||
nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|leo lasota:  relieved of course that ace spades did not show on his left there|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|nt|ritong: it is clear for him that declarer would never find the @hs by himself|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 5@D is a better contract|pg||
mc|13|nt|barnets: 51D in the open |pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D will be a swing t Monaco|pg||
nt|barnets: of 5 imps|pg||
nt|kit: not a big swing though|pg||

nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a bit surrised|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  3 imps to Nickell|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control ask|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ controls|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
nt|reisig: Does 87xx in @s qualify as a suit?|pg||
nt|kit: Helness will be thinking about slam, having opened 1@S on a hand he might have opened 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3! shows 1-18 with 3=2=3=5|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
pc|hK|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
nt|barnets: he didnt think for too long and made a simple bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not see enough tricks   maybe 1 short    |pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick 650 on that lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|warrens:  down on a @C lead, since the defense can get 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz will win diamond ace play spade for making 3|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now 3D patterns out for Levin and Weinstein has easy 3nt|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not get the @D away  if club shift now |pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play prob here|pg||
nt|warrens:  and a @D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "I showed spades and clubs - INV+ - 3@c said willing to play 3@c if was inviting; 3@d showed @h shortness and 3N to play|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4 = RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 2 w/o Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but since Sontag holds the key 9 spades, the defense prevails|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  likely 11 tricks here for +660 if queen played|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  actually, diamond lead dbl dummy|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helgemo: counting to thirteen is too tough|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a surprise from dec|pg||
nt|barnets: bidding to 5@C which is down 1|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  rather friendly layout for N/S here; 4H makes|pg||
nt|barnets: so N/s have gained a nice swing playing in 4n|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "you had the KQ10?" Weinstein: "KQ109" laughter|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
nt|kit: Even the best players get careless and sometimes don't pay proper attention to discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural NF|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  game requires a couple of things to work|pg||
nt|barnets: only 18 imps margin now|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 6@h is OK?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz HCP are all slow|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  which implies pass of 1nt may be best|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  however|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@H as the @C Ace is onside for a @S pitch|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
nt|bigtrain: east's pass is almost always exactly a doubleton n support|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade ace onside, or diamonds qj onside, or king clubs onside, or trumps for one loser|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  needs two of these to make|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with one of them being the trump loser = 1 or club king on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "biggest overbid of my life ... just telling you ... prepare yourself ... too many 10's"|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  W is showing a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|reisig: another "wonderful" X :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  double by Spntag greatly improves slam prospects|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will just tell everyone that weinstein kept a heart and declarer rightfully cashed ace to not risk contract :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  in this case, both the club king is on and trumops can be held to one loser if play for honor x in front of the AJxxx|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club lead is gold for weinstein|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now open book how to play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i absolutely dont believe the part about biggest overbid|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  helness marked with club short|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  therefore, % is tio play helgemo for the short trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin said to me: "don't tell them I said it was the biggest overbid of my life ... guess they already saw me bid 4@s on board 1 though"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there is some merit to the argument that you pass 1nt on 5332 hands with 9-10 HCP and rebid your 5 card suit on 5-8|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  so 5233 aceless 8 count is a borderline choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
nt|reisig: Have to worry abt partner w 1@s too|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  additionally, the double allows extra bidding space for levin/weinstein|pg||
nt|warrens:  the X tells East the Ace is onside and also gives E/W extra room|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised, as is one of the voice commentators, that W bid 4@H and not 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: Me too!|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass of 4@c X = maybe slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  everyone is surprised, but perhaps they have a different understanding of Levin's 4H call than we expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag leaves table...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: after asking Weinstein if he'll be a while|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..but in my bidding 4@h = no void in @c and no @d cue|pg||
nt|warrens:  exact same start at the other table, but West bid 4@D, not 4@H, after the X-p-p|pg||
nt|reisig: That's what I'd do|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Since Levin had 3 choices at or below game here... redbl, 4D, & 4H, I am sure they have agreements that we are unaware of|pg||
nt|reisig: Wanna bet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Weinstein alone at the table now as Levin and Berkowitz chat on the other side of the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Betting is out Rich... casino night was already held at the nationals :)|pg||
nt|kit: I think this 3@S call should show 6, so Helness should have no problem raising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: tempo wasnt as shown|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 losers at first glance|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand "flops" well |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
nt|dinos1: asks @h lead?|pg||
nt|dburn: double based on length in both red suits, but declarer has spade tricks instead...|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he puts up the ace, unblocks spades, crosses to a heart and so forth...|pg||
nt|dinos1: @hA, @sAK, @c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
nt|ritong: unkind @d|pg||
nt|reisig: No problem making this one|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ritong: i think franck is realizing just now that a @c might have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvonunda yaptýgý tam ipnelik bu 2 oldu bana|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  claim 4 soon|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
nt|barnets: all well for dec |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: soon (west coast for next)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low diamond exit?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  cash ace trump, trump to 10, claim|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe a club is OK also|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine East won 8 of clubs on 3rd round, continues hearts, and goes down some|pg||
pc|h8|nt|leo lasota:  diamond exit creates problem for declarer here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only up to 6 so far|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  win diamond in hand, then diasmond to king|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 spades, then run 10 hearts into east|pg||
nt|reisig: Can even play low @h from hand :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low diamond by Multon would have been better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not if partner held 83 instead of 93|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer exits low heart, defense wins queen and plays another diamond|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: but, surprisingly enough, the trump layout was such that his @h6 was a big card|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  next...|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfv: i cant see the club 3 in disa's hand. odd|pg||
nt|phil: 800|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he has analyzed that in a flash  i know he s extremely fast minded|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low heart to queen|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein: "no redouble?" Helness: "I thought you had the @d A, I thought I needed hearts 5-1"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "I needed you to have the J of spades" Weinstein: "I needed you to have the J of spades" |pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: actually i can see why|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kit: that really happened for sure?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he played hand that way|pg||
nt|dburn: well, neither of them has the jack of spades on this board either - let's hope that isn't a premonition of disaster|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 suiters fun to bid,  whre to start?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Then a discussion of he club suit and Weinstein said "I knew I didn't want him to lead that ... unless he led it after I doubled"|pg||
nt|dburn: awkward for Helgemo, who suspects that Weinstein may be about to bid a lot of hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if 2 @D is forcing or not  |pg||
nt|dinos1: do they play TRF in comp?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Vugraphzfv: yes. |pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: lots of laughter at the table after it|pg||
nt|grebrof: Martel and Helness are getting old|pg||
nt|kit: Martel will likely bid 3@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is mixed so must use the single raise here|pg||
mb|3H!|an|mixed raise|mb|3N|nt|ritong: if so, the hand is borderline|pg||
nt|ritong: strict minimum for a constructive raise imho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Rarely 5-7 HCP"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mixed raise is 8-9 dummy points with 4+card support|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@d makes on heart guess|pg||
nt|dburn: I very much doubt it - although this pair have added one or two things such as Stayman and Blackwood, they are still two of the most natural bidders in the world|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny asked molson what X means. molson shrugged and pointed at the 3D |pg||
nt|bigtrain: its an offensive type hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes 5D here for N/S nice spot|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Effective -- E-W haven't found the heart fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any bid by south is only possible after peeking|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3D likely final spot here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  dbl by weinstein?|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  spotlight on levin now|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pass = likely 200, or 500 on misdeclare|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: disa bids at the same time as patapon. lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Fleisher: "We should make easier bids for them"|pg||
nt|barnets: easy 7 tricks to start|pg||
nt|dburn: 3NT would have made - a triumph for natural bidding - so Levin has done pretty well|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: they can win this board|pg||
nt|grebrof: not now thou|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how about spade ace, diamond to queen, spade king and diamonds (in your dreams)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H lead directing with diamond fit, a treatment possible by a passed hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3S is the limit of the hand here|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  this one is worse :)|pg||
nt|kit: Levin has adequate heart support to raise, but he decided his hand was too weak|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 spades lead works wonders here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade lead is actually very reasonable with Katz hand|pg||
nt|reisig: Poor choices for a lead|pg||
nt|reisig: So - @s might be best|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but levin has nothing so will bid 4d|pg||
nt|barnets: x was a game try in @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein's DBL asked for a spade stopper for 3NT, wasn't penalty at all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: West might have tried 5@D, leaving it to Zia to find a low club lead!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  that is my lead too|pg||
nt|reisig: NICE JOB!!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  even not seeiing all the hands :)|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s may or may not make - depends on whethe Weinstein believes in Rule One|pg||
nt|dinos1: now make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: you'll see the 3nt and pass cards hit table at same time :) she's really fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be something else on this auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin passed the 2C as he had nothing extra in terms of HCP, now Weinstein balances with his 5 card diamond suit|pg||
nt|dburn: "never lead partner's suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: there goes the club loser |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Well, in the real world, he was never going to lead anything else :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: another rule we will all need to remember |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N by east makes if south leads a heart to the ace|pg||
nt|barnets: intersting tks|pg||
nt|barnets: so game try and spade stop|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein explains that 3@s asked for a stopper and 4@d said Levin didn't like his hand, could have bid 5@d or 4@c if he did|pg||
nt|dinos1: rule   ? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, indeed - the world is not yet ready for Rule One; it is fiddling around leading major-suit doubletons against 3NT at the moment|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H9 is a standard signal after the lead showing the AK|pg||
nt|kit: Defense may have to be tough to beat this|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ???????????|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: problem was 1@D on three card suit, given that would have rebid 2nt with disa's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now Levin backs into 3D|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|grebrof: Helness maybe should have dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice auction for E/W|pg||
nt|reisig: Dull hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: @sT may prove costly|pg||
nt|barnets: swing on bd 4 when Versace down in 3@D|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 to Monaco off|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c was quite makeable|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  need to confirm that was trick 1...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  wow|pg||
nt|reisig: I have no words :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very costly mistake by Nickell|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond to 9, queen clubs now|pg||
nt|sybarra: they may crash the spades? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin had his hand on the @c queen|pg||
nt|dinos1: Levin now knows 7-5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: now the @c 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|leo lasota:  even got 3D right sided!|pg||
nt|warrens:  more interesting after a @S lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ace, low trump off board|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  duck second spade, then club shift still gets it set|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: off|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: this is one route to down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D would have been no better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: east fingered many cards in turn before shaking her head and playing the D2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 down, but 3@H would have made|pg||
nt|bigtrain: being able to bid 4@S/4@H is too important to risk a TOX vs overcall|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: of|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but the other table bid 3@H which makes the TOX better as itsmore flexible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: either way...  i strongly dislike saving here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  levin signaling he has clubs for weinstein; |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|leo lasota:  low heart to king now...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  weinstein will get this right I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|reisig: Now @h position is easy :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3@s a good sac in any case, especialloy if it makes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck can save a bit here by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but beyond that the 5L save at the other table is the big loser as it rated to be|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 clubs upside down att pitch from sontag here, and low heart shift|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  make your opponents pay for their mistakes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: you mean ethically?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: ones.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it does but i dont know many who deliberately avoid leading a suit for that reason|pg||

nt|fabsayc: yes Henry on vugraph, and my questions are directed to him|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, only the head of the tournament conditions committee|pg||

nt|reisig: hi Kit :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  I'm going to switch to written. Being the only voice is a lonely job|pg||
nt|barnets: Schneider|pg||
nt|kit: maybe low spade to king and heart up is better, but risks a ruff when the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with king clubs marked onside, heart suit is marked; ace cannot be in helgwemo hand|pg||

nt|barnets: most unusual|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt is likely going down here with the diamonds 41 and spade king off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein: "lucky this one too - making 5"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|3for3: 'standard' off shape nt by zia|pg||

mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: oh you mean if they try for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think 3@d can include three keys, anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so precisely the hand to bid slam on since sure to create a swing|pg||
nt|kit: Therefore, continuing diamonds can never be superior|pg||
nt|kit: Nice hand for 4-card overcall, and really strikes gold.|pg||
nt|reisig: Aceless - no so easy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tough to know from South's hand, but 500 available against 4S dbled|pg||
nt|kit: 5@H will make on likely spade lead, I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course the hand can also make 5H from South|pg||
nt|reisig: Zero chance - they bid it :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very true rich|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do they void showing bid by passed hand|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|dinos1: 98%? hmm :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: That's exactly what Helness said!!|pg||
nt|sybarra: dealer certainly having fun tonight |pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: 3@H looks a bit strange here?|pg||
nt|dburn: Helgemo might bid 4@d, I guess|pg||
nt|dburn: would be a good time to do that|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfv: willard waved her x card to attract valerie's attention. it means 4 spades |pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what east is thinking about.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2nt invite-3nt accept|pg||
nt|kit: Levin can't like the thought of defending 4@S with a spade void|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt ideal contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  5H here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: not any more ? :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|barnets: I see he played the @s 10 at trick1 , his 7th winner|pg||
nt|warrens:  a pushy game try opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: bids by southwest will start to x perhaps if south bids|pg||
nt|dburn: good man|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin asks about 4@d and Helgemo said something I couldn't quite hear|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see 5 @s from somone like S?|pg||
nt|dburn: still, Levin may press on regardless, though that isn't completely clear|pg||
mb|5S|nt|xenya: W in doubt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does Levin bid 5H if 5C is dbled?|pg||
nt|barnets: that interprets as West may X |pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  2nt by west with Kx hearts, 3nt by East reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: levin asked molson to take some time. cos she wants to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson is like "going..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  "the whole hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  QJ doubleton downgrade for the hand but two 10's upgrade|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  excellent pass of 2nt by Berk|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: the program auto plays singletons, zia was thinking|pg||
nt|3for3: as he is entitled to, but at this point he doesnt know a whole lot|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting that Zia gave up on the legit chance of stiff king of clubs |pg||
nt|warrens:  I see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kit: North will bid 5@C (having already shown hearts), and now Levin will have to guess which suit to play.|pg||
nt|reisig: They may find 5@c|pg||
nt|dinos1: good bid 4@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but Zimmerman elects to rebid moth eaten 6 card diamond suit instead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt now all pass?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  huge decision here|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this is "the 5 level belongs to opps" |pg||
nt|dburn: good bid 5@s also - as Eric Rodwell is fond of saying, "that's bridge, mister"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein, putting the spades down: "I'll get the good news out of the way"|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfv: and there. she played. |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps 12 if seamon ducks the second @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  pretty good chances for 8|pg||
nt|kit: But only 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he plays spades I think he'll go down. losing 2 @S, 2@D and 2@C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight back on levin here...|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Levin run?|pg||
nt|kit: Big decision here|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w willbe delighted n/s bid as they will now go plus|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch saying better 1 bird in hand than 10 in air|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  oops|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|kit: East should perhaps have cashed the king of diamonds first -- now West has a problem.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @C lead would be a real killer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer decides to play spade here, 2nt is down; diamond here, 2nt is in|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  great decision by weinstein!|pg||
nt|reisig: Now 5@h?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes rich now 5H|pg||
nt|kit: Only if Levin bids 5@H -- but will he work that out?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein has announced that he has nothing in clubs|pg||
nt|cc469: why 5@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should have redoubled (assuming that is takeout) rather than show diamond support he doesn't have.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  therefore, Levin can expect decent hearts and should probably get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: Doubling the only contract you can beat - is often wrong|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: club shift|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont make but 2@H was making|pg||
nt|psyck: strange defense|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual opening lead yes|pg||
nt|psyck: @hk would have been more standard|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer cannot affordably cash the hearts as this sets up Levin's extra heart|pg||
nt|kit: I think he had to play spades, since playing a diamond wouldn't tell him anything and he would still have to take the spade finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: This way he also gets Jx of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Kit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond lead from Katz hand stand out|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  entice the double by weinstein|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|barnets: this is not an e/w success|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nice poker bluff by Weinstein here|pg||
nt|reisig: This match is about even now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein explains that if Levin had bid 3NT over the DBL it would show some defense, so 4@h showed he didn't have defense. Then they discuss whether "defense" means 1 trick or ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 1-1/2 tricks - I think agreed on 1-1/2 :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: if so, perhaps zim will try to avoid the dangerous hand, though|pg||
nt|ritong: and miss the @cs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  jack diamond here obligatory false card|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or actually 10 may be better|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  earned the stripe tailed double; well done|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  helness/helgemo knows what is happening now; both cringing at the dummy|pg||
pc|h8|nt|leo lasota:  or if he plays confident, levin may duck the king :)|pg||
nt|kit: At other table Meckwell got to 3NT .....|pg||
nt|kit: But it looks like they will make it!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb:  That is a common treatment in Europe: transfer doubles over 1-level overcalls rather than negative|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if you're forced to level getting there fast shows the worst hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, Meckstroth ran the 10 of @S at trick 2, so will make the game|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  outstanding |pg||
pc|s3|nt|ritong: but this move is even better|pg||
nt|ritong: bien joué, pierre|pg||
nt|ritong: it caters for @c Qxxx with south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: slow shows interest in bigger things|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nickell should work this out|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  consider that if Katz has 3 diamonds, hand not beatable|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  plus Katz would not likely lead the rebid diamond suit on 3 little|pg||
nt|reisig: Also - would never lead @d from 10xx|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: I think Helgemo's double of 5@C is clear -- he has no reason to expect the opponents have a place to run when they chose clubs with their eyes open.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Very well deserved score for N/S|pg||
nt|barnets: looks down 1 |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Easy 11 tricks |pg||

nt|ahollan1: World Championships start on Aug 09    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event |pg||
nt|kit: rodwell worried about various 4-1 heart splits -- we can see that nothing bad can happen, but he doesn't know that.|pg||

nt|henryb:  200 for E-W|pg||
nt|grebrof: already correctedd|pg||
nt|psyck: those may not be the exact cards played, but -1 normall enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can I pull out the red card yet?" - Seamon|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s shuffle around looking for their defense card|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: a gazzilli hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the 3 nt X cost 9 imps, and we are back close to even |pg||
mb|2D!|an|transfer|nt|Vugraphzfv: they're exact to the spots, i may have switch a 9 to and 8 or reversed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *an 8|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks Ken|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: who's at the other table playing it?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the thng is about all the old bridge players is they had to be great declarers since they were such terrible bidders|pg||
nt|warrens:  a big score for Nickell|pg||
nt|barnets: @SA lead and low heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick 4S here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: We'll be taking a short break after this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: my idea is 2@c should cover some fit hands|pg||
mb|2H|nt|fabsayc: 1@H has lots going for it|pg||
nt|ritong: which do not completely match standard treatments|pg||
nt|kit: old fashioned defesne -- cover an honor, win the queen with the king.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they started 2@S 3@S (hearts and a minor) in open room, which is much tougher|pg||
nt|reisig: Based on the last 2 hands - he may bid 3NT|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, played 2@s|pg||
nt|dburn: 9 IMPs came to Monaco for 3NT doubled, so the past 54 boards have been almost a complete waste of time|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they seem to have had a misunderstanding, ending in 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne does not like his partners or teammates to make tight Xs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  Momentum at this table certainly on the side of Levin/Weinstein with 2 good results in a row|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pass and take plus seems right|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  Also lots against it if partner rebids 1@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if nothing else if gives partner a lead|pg||
nt|3for3: 4 losers for declarer, but defense get get them all|pg||
nt|barnets: especially when they make|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  this will make 5 on any defense|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzfv: is this lead by westheimer too large?|pg||
nt|3for3: here the spade loser disappears|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all players annoyed that director took away boards|pg||
nt|barnets: yes a spec points out helgy tthinking @CA club ruff @SA club ruff|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strange with only 4@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice result for Nickell in other room on board 6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: I believe its in their contracts when they sign on|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer always wins the race|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: leads are 2/4th for n/s|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3rd means (I have a difficult lead P)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6H is down, 6@D could make|pg||
nt|psyck: yes you will not see them make agressive partial doubles|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect lead to grow for nickell with board 7|pg||
nt|reisig: Levin wants this hand to end :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so in the end perhaps Helgy should not have X 5@C|pg||
nt|dburn: although not necessarily of effort, of course|pg||
nt|sybarra: the X actually only cost 3 imps  since 3 nt was not bid  |pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: not yet|pg||
nt|barnets: which was down |pg||
pc|h7|nt|warrens:  he's only going to allow them to play all the boards if they catch up|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  another 2nt contract requiring some work|pg||
nt|kit: Some work looks like an understatement|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: westheimer has been ahead the three times she lost the final|pg||
nt|barnets: and they would have played there|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  great play jack cl;ubs there|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: said only partially as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Let's see if I can make something here, very unlikely" - Helness|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N & 4@s make as cards are, this is better|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  to encourage incorrect club continuation by Weinstein|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  claim|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  60 imps with 11 to score. The lead is very big but not yet insurmountable|pg||
nt|kit: The spade spots on this hand could prove to be interesting|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  strong play by levin weinstein here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: short break - just in time for me to tell you the current standings in the Swiss|pg||
nt|barnets: Zimmerman guessed right and will make 5@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on 38 Multon in 5@D with spade lead and heart shift guessed correctly|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  once again, as is customary practice, the table takes a break halfway through the quarter|pg||
nt|barnets: he has played well in this event bringing in imps|pg||
nt|barnets: for his team|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Thank you to everyone involved in running the Philadelphia nationals|pg||
nt|barnets: on 39 bidding started same way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: After 5 matches in the Swiss: 1 - Diamond, 2 - Lynch, 3 - Amoils, 4 - Bjarnarsson, 5 - Schreiber, 6 - Fleisher|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 4N over 4@H by south|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: I have a list with victory points through 20th, but it's hard to type everything. The rosters are available in today's Daily Bulletin, which you can find by going to www.acbl.org ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and clicking on the logo of the Philadelphia NABC and then on "Daily Bulletins" in the left hand column|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: back soon - they're smoking, I'm going to the bathroom :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Back|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: so nerves may be a factor still|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is only 49|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice small diamond shift by katz|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  although from honor 97x(x)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: establishing @c tricks for partner looks better to me|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  switching to the 9 is a consideration|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club switch would have jsut led to 120|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfv: rare for sponsor to play last segment. |pg||
nt|ritong: i will be suspected of bad faith, but here i perso play 2@c by west, basically good hand with no clear bid, and over the 90% of the time 2@d, 4@d showing void and @s fit|pg||
nt|ritong: when direct splinter is singleton|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Sontag's 7 clubs beating the 6 in Levin's hand could be critical as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: declarer still has spades stopped i assume|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz is looking at 4 card heart holding|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|sJ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: When Helgemo called for the club 7, Helness said "keep an entry to your hand?" Helgemo said hes"|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|leo lasota:  club shift here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tangles the suit for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|leo lasota:  so not so concermed about the establishment of the long heart suit|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  making 5 now; well done|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  Maybe she kept losing when sitting out|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  In the Fantunes system opening 1 bids usually show 14+ hcp so if s opens it would be at the 2 level and the auction would be very different.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  plus this gave the losing option to declareer and he took it... spade finesse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|leo lasota:  however...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now they are up to 7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|leo lasota:  typo sry|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  or a teammate is tired or not feeling well|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s2|nt|xenya: that quick @H discard by E looks ominous -- would he have done it holding Qxxx and knowing S is likely to have 4? |pg||
mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfv: short break|pg||
nt|dburn: thanks to Jan for relaying the table talk - good to see the players having fun in the midst of a deadly serious match|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think at this level,  the respect and fun comes thru |pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, I would not put it past East-West at the other table to bid and make 3NT on this - they've been doing it all their lives|pg||
nt|sybarra: I have operated for other matches and I find them most interesting |pg||
nt|dburn: of course, they might get to 4@h instead, but I don't see how they would make that|pg||
nt|dburn: but some game I think they will bid, after West opens a strong club|pg||
nt|dburn: and they might need to bid the right one, given developments on 54 where Monaco picked up another 13 to take the lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and n/s here will be unhappy they did not beat 4 @S when they see that score |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Swiss final results: 1 - Diamond; 2 - Lynch; 3 - Fleisher; 4 - Tulin; 5 - Bjarnarsson; 6 - Meltzer; 7 - Amoils; 8 - O'Rourke; 9 - Schreiber; 10 - Bramley; |pg||
nt|dburn: well, they could hardly beat 4@s in reality - they probably would not have beaten it at the other table had Rodwell passed it, but (understandably) he did not|pg||
nt|sybarra: BTW, the youth teams leave today or tomorrow for china  for the international tourney |pg||
nt|sybarra: we will have vugraph later in the week |pg||
nt|sybarra: USA has 2 teams |pg||

nt|ritong: pierre is trying to find a way to fill in his name, poor thing  forget about it, buddy  not a real problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry about the delay, players stepped out to the restroom|pg||
nt|bigtrain: LTT is much more then just number of trump... you always have to adjust things with bad trump breaks and minor honors in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  7C here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: We're back|pg||
nt|dburn: lots of bridge happening in China these days - great opportunity for Europeans and Americans to be involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: And our Youth players did very well in the Youth NABC here this weekend getting ready for China :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher whispered it to multon, hopefully i will catch it when kamil alerts it|pg||
nt|rimbus: OK sorry - just call me Rimbus !|pg||
mb|3H|nt|barnets: 4 imps fot Cayne when 2@S made 3 down here|pg||
nt|ritong: yes  bienvenue man|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@S 5 spades and 4 card minor, popular in Europe in conjunction with multi 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think their card says sound weak 2's, but i'm unsure|pg||
nt|kit: This is transfer to 3NT I believe|pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT - not so easy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt has no play here; Levin has a hand that wants to get 3nt from partner to possibly protect Qx hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Tand was an orange powdered drink invented for the Astronauts in the 60s|pg||
nt|kit: Martel is wondering where everybody is getting their bids from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok bad guess by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just 8 boards left|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i love this bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: rosenberg is eyeing the 7@D sac|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real question is will he forcing pass if willenken sacs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but the effective defense takes away the mentality from E/W that they are in control at this table after 23, 24|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  22, 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: usually you doubt the player who is white vs red|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its not simplisitic...  there is always adjustments occurring|pg||
nt|sybarra: indeed,   won the flight C :) |pg||
nt|sybarra: won the flight C of grand Nats |pg||
nt|dburn: impressive - good luck to them|pg||
nt|sybarra: we look forward to the broadcasts from China    |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Yes, in addition to doing well in the Youth NABC, 3 of the players going to China won Flight C of the GNT|pg||
nt|sybarra: all around the world|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfv: not sure what 3H means but jmeyers made a cutting her throat gesture|pg||
nt|kit: Since if West had passed, he probably would have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a bad guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jxxxx @S popular overcall tonight|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: yes good contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi RR :)  |pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: henry comment on 1@S nicely please|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 tricks after @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: This could be the third consecutive 2NT contract -- very rare|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: when jenny doubled, molson was like "drats!" (silently though only jenny could see)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness asks about the j@D lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: chip replies "may not be normal, but standard"|pg||
nt|ritong: other room did not find 7@s either|pg||
nt|barnets: that is an interesting bid asking partner to bid 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: I like the treatment|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 hearts lead very useful for weinstein|pg||
nt|kit: Puts overcaller on lead.  3@C is chosen for the bid (rather than 3@H), so partner of overcaller can't make (or not make) lead-directeing double.|pg||
nt|reisig: Might actually make now|pg||
nt|kit: This lead allows declarer to set up third heart trick and get up to 8, but he needs to knock out ace of diamonds first.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he figures out order of play here, he can take 2 diamonds, 3 hearts, 1 club, and 3 spades :)|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 3 hear tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: If he gets that far, he can eventually squeeze-endplay West.|pg||
nt|barnets: so the treatment has gained a trick |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight is on weinstein|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to bid grand after opps opened the bidding|pg||
nt|reisig: I bet on 6@c|pg||
nt|barnets: if tey do it will be very well done|pg||
nt|dinos1: hi Richie :)|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: certaintly not my idea of a weak two bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann-multon must play one of the last two sets|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (they sat out the first set)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: molson jotting down some notes to herself...think she wants to discuss with jill meyers later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like he has the first 8 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Thanks for the confidence, pard"|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, I thought N would go with 5 @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk/Sontag with 3 excellent decisions to not go to 3nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  important for partnerships to have ways of differentiating strong 2 suiters versus distributional 2 suiters here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  I would not bet against Helgemo/Helness finding 7|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  we will see|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfv: oh nvm she showed jenny wolpert|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe Helness should have worked out that jack of hearts not likely to be in dummy, since no need to transfer to 3NT if it were -- thus led low heart.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  agree Kit|pg||
nt|kit: But that inference isn't totally clear.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: or even better 7@c|pg||
nt|rimbus: I think 7 @s better than 7 @c|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the players on the team was the young guy I played with for 3+ years starting when he was 9  |pg||
nt|reisig: Might make - w @d finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: anyways, a thin ice contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nevertheless|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Rich wins the bet :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: this is wagar finals, so the table is screened.|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a quiet one -- matter of overtricks perhaps|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +100 still for N/S|pg||
nt|reisig: 1st one in about 2 years :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin asked about the auction and I think that Helgemo said cue bids and nothing special|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  See if Meckwell shine their way to 7C; huge swing possibility|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Now Helgemo says "I have no side suits" Levin: "so 3@d is naturalish?" Helness: "no, shows a strong hand and no side suits"|pg||
nt|barnets: very hard to bid grand I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Now Levin asking Helgemo something more and Helgemo shakes his head - I think it was whether Helness might have a partial diamond stopper|pg||
nt|sybarra: do I sound like a proud auntie mame?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: partners can't see each other.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert finally gets to declare|pg||
nt|bigtrain: jeff rubens calls that "in and out" evaluation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: great book|pg||
nt|bigtrain: secrets of winning bridge|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course, the play in 3nt may have gone differently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin: I'm not thinking at trick 1 anymore|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as he would still make eafter the opening lead if he won the first diamond|pg||
nt|warrens:  best is for E to overtake and shift back to @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can see 3@H's and 2@C's and 1@D|pg||
nt|barnets: east can duck twice|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Weinstein can time this right.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he plays east for honor doubleton in clubs he can get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: May take a while to play this|pg||
nt|kit: Although he can set up a club trick on power also, though that involves losing 2 club tricks.  So maybe he can.|pg||
nt|dburn: back at the ranch, Helness needs to put his faith in diamonds and not the black suits here|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  instead of 130 in clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or 110..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: isnt it 200?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  heart ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (assuming ruff now)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club heart ruff, diamond|pg||
nt|reisig: It ain't over - til it's over :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: u thk @d? not try @s one?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness asks about discard: "if it's count, it's standard count and if it's attitude, it's upside down"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bigtrain: the number one book i recommend|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i wonder if he will give me a kickback for the free advertising :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny's like :i'm still i shock|pg||
nt|psyck: yes more interesting after say passive @h lead|pg||
nt|ritong: and ultra tough to bid when the key is xxx facing void|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  after heart ruff, club to ace, heart ruff, then diamond = d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  Of course I have nothing nice to say about South's double either|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: contract the same in open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: kind of 3NT ew :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nickell signals for diamond|pg||
pc|s8|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very true Warren|pg||
pc|sT|nt|reisig: @s seemed easy here|pg||
nt|dinos1: wont make @d fin :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: you crack me up andrew|pg||
nt|warrens:  impossible for N to know he had to win the @D and play on @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack trick 3 was the winning play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness, as dummy came down: "you should bid 5@d" Weinstein: "I'm just thinking about the hand" Helness: "it doesn't matter"|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|reisig: Now - a @c play|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein basically playing this way in case East has Ax of diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|warrens:  not the % play|pg||
nt|reisig: and a @c :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s6|nt|kit: or diamonds 3-3.  I think he is playing it correctly, although unsuccessfully on this layout.  He doesn't think East has 4 diamonds when East known to have 6 hearts|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  instead of 6C|pg||
nt|dburn: well, @cK was not all that likely - maybe Levin should underlead the setting trick, but maybe he would not as a practical matter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rimbus: or 2 NT :)|pg||

nt|barnets: an they bid and make 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: ?|pg||
nt|psyck: very difficult|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  routine 3nt here for E/W|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as was commented earlier, excellent break called by Katz after two straight bad bopards for team nickell|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  and they have been solid on the two boards since|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  simple 6D slam here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  alot of possibilities for 12th trick|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  setting up 5 card club suit, spades 33, heart finesse|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  therefore great slam|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd say - not "simple"|pg||
mb|r|nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack is ok if diamonds 33, or 4 in helness hand, and still has possibilities for extra trick if helness had dblton ace originally|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@C easy, 6@S superficially down|pg||
nt|sybarra: E hand better for poker maybe |pg||
nt|reisig: XX for them = cards w 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "you do that again?" Weinstein: "last time you went for 1400" Levin: "I think last time we went for 1400; you're a little confused"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: reality check|pg||
nt|henryb:  I really dislike that opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@c not that easy|pg||
nt|ritong: esp doubled|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right, might be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: kamil has wondered for a moment if he was good enough for 4@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sounds like you're here watching it with me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H can be bid on 0 points (at least most play that way) so south can not afford to force to game|pg||
nt|ritong: i think like him, nope   because no source of tricks apart trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surprise 7 imps to fleischer when 7D went four down in open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: up up and away|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers asked jill levin - big hand? <nod>|pg||
nt|3for3: this should be a dull 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: idec needs say 8 trumps 2@H 2@D makes 12|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  At the other table, Nunes (n) opened a weak nt and Katz (e) led a small @h.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree not simple to bid with confidence|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamonds already right sided now as not played by North with heart lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is a 3 or 4 problem  rather 4 or 6  south does not want to lure his pard into a slam without goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: just 5 levels lower than we hoped for|pg||
nt|ritong: guess this shows @d shortage|pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Meckwell have been known to make many 21 point 3nts, but just not here :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|fabsayc: i only 2 points and 1 quick tricks short of a roth opener|pg||
nt|rimbus: lead problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: bidding 3x would show shortness|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (against 3nt)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  trump trump shift|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  weinstein has a hand that appears safe at the 4 level|pg||
nt|dburn: redouble looks like "snapdragon" - values with a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein asks about 1N and first Helness makes a fist (it's strong), then says "I take it back" - now thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N by W is virtually hopeless on likely @H lead -- might be quite different now...|pg||
nt|barnets: seamon has never passed before with those trump spots|pg||
nt|rimbus: waow|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  we proceed differently this side of the ocean|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  holds to 4|pg||
nt|dburn: but maybe North's redouble was Rosenkranz - values with a high spade|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd never Pass (as opener)|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I love all these XX;s  ugh |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: I should know what Weinstein's RDBL is, but I can't remember, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: West's redouble, on the other hand, looks like Jabberwocky - "beware the Jubjub bird, my son"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: I don't think it was alerted though|pg||
nt|reisig: 1@d was not exactly lead directional :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 2@S is showing some form of @S stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: or real 4+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: most of the time 4+@S, any shape|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i missed that|pg||
nt|dinos1: ag 3N? why not? :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes! |pg||
nt|reisig: A test of guts :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "humph" - asks Helgemo about the RDBL - not sure what he said|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I would have expected a 2NT rebid instead of 3@C, but won't affect the final contract.|pg||
nt|kit: North does not have an easy lead|pg||
nt|3for3: id bet on 5/7@S|pg||
nt|kit: I'll bet on heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: any other takers? :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  W has indicates 5 card @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 beers on @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: fantoni opened their "strong" weak two that struck again|pg||
nt|reisig: Makes very little diff - in the score|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "who knows"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu:  not taken :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  u were right Kit :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must be difficult being zimmermann, hiding that grin. |pg||
nt|barnets: I guarantee that|pg||
nt|reisig: A nice calm board :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done here they go...|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1000|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: pay up!|pg||
nt|ritong: full hit, this lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes this will result in same 130|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  weinstein shows 2 with queen|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  based on 7 card trump length|pg||
nt|warrens:  is it clear that S will win this?|pg||
nt|reisig: Wow - to swing (maybe) the whole match on this?|pg||
nt|dburn: not entirely, no|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think it's very reasonable for Levin to duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein asks: "am I allowed to know what you thought RDBL was, Helgy?" Helgemo: "takeout for sure" Helness: "I had shown my hand by passing 1@s"|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: odd that kamil did not bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his team led comfortably|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we say " tempête sous un crâne"|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne will not be so pleased when he may make slam|pg||
nt|kit: It looks that way from our point of view, but not to declarer who doesn't know everything is behaving well.|pg||
nt|kit: It is not obvious at all how to play this hand I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Probably go for the heart ruff, planning on taking 6 spade tricks, 3 club tricks, 1 diamond trick.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  since overruff dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|dinos1: 400|pg||
nt|dburn: am I bid any less?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|3for3: i thought the idea was to try to lead our 5 card suits, not theirs :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||
nt|kit: also giving the opponents headaches|pg||
nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer just trying to set up long heart for tenth trick -- no risk involved|pg||
nt|rimbus: a great choice, for sure|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: on the other hand, he is threatened with long @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag: I have to think...leaves table|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  wonder what the decision will be on throwing out boards this set and if there will be a penalty, which side will it go towards?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Certainly, Sontag is not known for receiving slow play penalties :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Sontag has to think????   Yikes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin spills coffee on a few of the remaining boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
pc|dT|nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|reisig: See?   Easy :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now for the play|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|henryb:  the duck (quack-quack) doubleton is not an endearing feature|pg||
nt|3for3: helgemo knows he is making this.  martel not so sure|pg||
nt|3for3: this would be a good hand for the rubber bridge variation, no overtricks.  |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  good lead!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  win in North duck club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein puts down the diamonds and Levin says "almost with" (he had explained that 5@d showed 2 with the Queen)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|leo lasota:  and if they win club in east and fire heart, win it start ruffing out clubs using trump entries|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bigtrain: back finally|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: i think his choice might be different vs 1NT 3NT|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will then see the long club establish and not need to worry about any squeeze or 33 spade break|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "hum" again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rimbus: will he play a SMLA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: when AJxx is very low on the opening leads quality scale|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2 rds trumps then start diamonds seems right|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes - but 400 is GREAT|pg||
nt|dburn: not entirely impossible for there to be a huge accident here|pg||
nt|warrens:  not easy for N to discard.  |pg||
nt|warrens:  can't afford a @H and if he pitches a @D they can't cash 7 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein: "sorry"|pg||
nt|dinos1: Helgemo said "t/o for sure" so ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and cashing more spades will only squeeze N |pg||
nt|dburn: the defenders need to cash diamonds, and neither of them knows it yet|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|leo lasota:  ace, club ruff highj, diamond to hand club ruff high, diamond to hand club ruff high claim|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@CX went down 3|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: quack is shorthand for queen-jack|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Nunes went down 2 at the other table and Nickell gained 2 more imps.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  19 imp lead through 26 boards for Monaco|pg||
nt|bobholl: m ainly mistakes by nickel (22 and 23)|pg||
nt|reisig: 25|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 imps Monaco here sry|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  25 imp lead :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  As was noted earlier, Zimmerman/Multon will be playing 3rd quarter, while Nickell/Katz will be done after this quarter|pg||
nt|sybarra: no clue how they would know it |pg||
nt|dinos1: if XX was t/o - could West have 3 diamonds?|pg||
nt|reisig: Well - if Weinstein shows bad @hs - Levin will know'|pg||
nt|dburn: North can actually afford a heart, but he doesn't know it|pg||
nt|dinos1: Levin can play @s3 to show @c's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin had the @s7 out and now put it back and thinking some more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what if Helgemo had the @dA?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|barnets: the late and great Edgar Kaplan said takeout Xs are meant to be taken out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Just 1 for me"|pg||
nt|reisig: NEXT|pg||
nt|barnets: for 800 dec could not handle trumps after ruff and discard|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rimbus: i meant a SMALL heart ?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dinos1: then doesnt have @cK|pg||
nt|reisig: To me -- it's over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Now Levin should know, shouldn't he? If H has @h K and @c K|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: so it looks like 3 off|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  high trump|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: 6@c, even after trump lead, you can make with 7@c, 2@h via fin, 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: This line works fine when both spades and diamonds are 3-2, but I'm not convinced it is right (not convinced it is wrong either)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  see if either team gains the momentum heading into the break based on the last 6 boards of the set here|pg||
nt|dinos1: then North wd disc @h earlier|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|barnets: that was 6 imps for nickell|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|reisig: Oops|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|dburn: @cK may be moot - what would North pitch from @cKJ109?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|barnets: but east ruffs the third @D though|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|psyck: you can draw E's 2nd trump after 3 ruff|pg||
nt|psyck: there is enough communication|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Cayne "That'll teach you about overcalling"|pg||
nt|barnets: yes their may be|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: not xruffing|pg||
nt|psyck: yes Barnet|pg||
nt|barnets: that works|pg||
nt|barnets: but if he tries a x ruff it does not work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Seems like I'm still making the mistakes" -Helness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: quick restroom break for seamon|pg||
nt|psyck: that is one 'mistake' he won't regret|pg||
nt|barnets: the last board should be a swing for monaco but we will see|pg||

nt|psyck: yes 3rd seat & @h suit are generally more suitable to a preemtive bid|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is constructive raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness asks Weinstein his shape: "2434"|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sxxx *|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin asks Helgemo what his hearts were "kj10 4th?" Helgemo: "kj 4th, he had the 10"|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but if Fleisher is balanced selling out  looks better - maybe even x'd|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand was yucky for any choice of bids|pg||
nt|ritong: with their microNT, they need a good scrambling system|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a pretty bad spot compared to 4@H|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  the old 4333 shape 18 point downgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: "Spades were so good, I'll try it again"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C on 42 with diamond lead in open room|pg||
nt|barnets: had North opened 4@H East probably would bid 4N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|leo lasota:  frequent at non vul, but usually not vul at imps|pg||
nt|barnets: you are watching for sure 2 of the best 4 teams in the world playing here|pg||
nt|barnets: a privilege for the specs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: prudent fold by tor|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@HX down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: gold medal to passing 4@S?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Knowing the opening bid is behing his cards, Weinstein slowed down and took the low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "so this is attitude or 4th?" Helgemo: "3rd & 5th" Levin: "I was close" :)|pg||
mb|3H|an|good 3!s bid|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: was willing to play 43 if it came to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||
nt|rimbus: Anyway, Duboin chosed a spade lead : who is right ?|pg||
nt|ritong: the scoreboard is|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  obviously lucky layout for N/S; or unlucky for Levin/Weinstein as they did not bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, this is a little dangerous|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 diamonds anyone?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  these intermediate hands with 45 in the majors are never easy with standard bidding methods|pg||
nt|barnets: the other two are the italian team and in my opinioin the Dutch world champions|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder what 3@H showed /|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond lead would be quite reasonable -- by far best chance of finding partner's 5-card sut.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some pairs, including Helness and Helgemo use 3@h for no 5 card major rather than 3nt.|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe its no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think thats right barnet|pg||
nt|kit: I think no 4 or 5-card major.  3NT = 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: This lets partner bid 3@S over 3@H with 5 spades and 4 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nickell correctly passes 3C and will certainly go plus here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: which is a problem distribution if playing Puppet (which I guess they are)|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  3C may have pushed them up a level, but declarer will duck here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  correct play by Levin here of quickly establishing the 2nd club trick|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will still have many possibilities to bring contract in if hearts turn out not to break|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin of course hoping for unfav layouts in the red suits here|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
nt|reisig: Down 1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|ritong: guess he would raise that pot under different circumstances|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: 3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: careful with those predictions|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dinos1: ruffs here and there for def|pg||
nt|reisig: Nahh|pg||
nt|reisig: @h 8 = @d|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d - @h ruff, then @c ruff - @h ruff|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|leo lasota:  heart to queen and ace here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  claim|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  does he bring this in with only one diamond ?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: now he just draws trumps and plays a club|pg||
nt|reisig: Wow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|phil: Kamil cannot lead clubs however|pg||
nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher is marked with the @sK|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|nt|leo lasota:  at best, E/W will score 3 additional trump tricks here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think all the players from wagar finals are often on bbo. team captain for westheimer, vdoubleu, is familiar to many bboers, especially the juniors. she's involved in organizing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: special programs for kids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry i can't give technical analyses. maybe an expert will like to be commentator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers is very well accessorized. i think she has 3 necklaces on. very cool looking. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD ken van cleef just walked in. not sure what he wants. think he's just observing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh he came to drink some water :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that americans can raise on three cards has importance, too|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|xenya: actually S can even play a @D now|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he can power it home with the trump spots|pg||
pc|s9|nt|barnets: only prob using 3N to show 5@H , you dont have a 3@S slam try and have to use 4@C as atry over 3N|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|3for3: helness needed to lead club thru to break endplay|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|barnets: as 4@D is a transfer back|pg||

nt|bobholl: @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia said he was playing helgemo for the k|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that always seems to happen|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the problem with passing W hand, should have opened & got it off his chest|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk was caught on opening lead in losing situation of winning king clubs on air or ducking and not winning the king later|pg||
nt|barnets: on 41 Meckwell have started 1@D 2@C overcall 2@D 2@H 2@S 3@D 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: East thinking|pg||
nt|reisig: I never expected this much|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a hair raising experience|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: also depends if they open 1@C with 5-5 blacks or 1@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  7nt easy here|pg||
nt|dburn: I did warn you :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzfv: how often have we held a good hand, only to have partner preempt. then we dont know what to bid cos only singleton in p's suit|pg||
nt|phil: no dull hands here :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and raised to 4N|pg||
nt|sybarra: expensive 1 nt XX |pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
nt|dinos1: 58 - 1N by EW - 7 tricks, 1N by NS in OR - 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like correct bid is pass :)|pg||
nt|cc469: Zia met the challenge with flying colours :)|pg||
nt|rimbus: Helness just lost one @d and... the 3 of @s !|pg||
nt|ritong: swing coming|pg||
nt|ritong: @c slam for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: not that it is a great spot, but difficult to avoid it|pg||
nt|rimbus: or no trump ?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with 14 top tricks (and a 4th in clubs if it was needed)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS seem to be contributing a lot too|pg||
nt|psyck: 65 is probably a 1@s opening even for those opening 1@c with 55 like NS do|pg||
nt|warrens:  that will be an important result if Pepsi-Kweicien go to game|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  4H makes here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|grebrof: its not that a preempt like that has to be leaddirecting|pg||
nt|kit: This will be dull 3NT or 4@S -- will have to wait for another board for excitement|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Decision to directly raise spades here with 2 aces and dblton|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S using precision?|pg||
nt|warrens:  thought that promised 4|pg||
nt|kit: apparently it is permissable with them.|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe they've modified it|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice fitting cards here and favorable breaks result in 4 spades making for N/S|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is a 4 card heart raise|pg||
nt|reisig: Surely - 4@s here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice 2S call here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  may get in the way of reaching the 7nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  grand was bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry our internet died and the access code didn't work. we lost 59 and losing 60 since i just returned.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by val?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we lost internet. these are approximation. i think contract is right though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: because val is declarer right now.|pg||
nt|ritong: this won t take ages|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  so a chance for Monaco pickup here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: always 11 regardless of @dQ|pg||
nt|phil: but they had an 1100 for the taking in 5@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: offering 1100 atm - but insufficent compensation for what NS can make|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 6@C bid so flat board|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as soon as he draws trumps, declarer will be claiming|pg||
pc|sT|nt|leo lasota:  5H certainly an encouraging bid from Nickell, see what Katz does now|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  makes 5 ion that lead|pg||
nt|barnets: too digff to bid 7|pg||
nt|barnets: dificult|pg||
nt|barnets: so 41 is a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards over really quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s seem to always ask for it|pg||
nt|rimbus: in NT you cannot try a double finesse in @d, missing the 7 !|pg||
nt|ritong: now zim might dislike @h KJx|pg||
nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||
nt|ritong: at worst K10x|pg||
nt|kit: seems like pretty clear 4@S bid.  Slam impossible, and no reason anything else should be better.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  play will go quickly here; making 4|pg||
nt|barnets: we are going to have a close match today|pg||
nt|dburn: crumbs - is that an overcall?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|phil: a treatment I like, but have not implemented over 4@c: |pg||
nt|phil: 4@s and 4@h are FORCING|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d is a puppet to a signoff in either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only making four?|pg||
nt|mayors:  450?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: corrected|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nickell has a gold mine now|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Thanks Kit.|pg||
nt|reisig: This match will go to the wire|pg||
nt|barnets: like the open championship in England|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: that one extra level made the difference|pg||
nt|barnets: no hope here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz cannot bid the grand; Nickell is the one looking at the ace spade, ak diamond, k club|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 tricks for the defense to 6S dbled|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass must be @s ace plus stuff|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  1700|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 11 imps to zimmermann if this is doubled|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|3for3: but!  this will be down a lot so all is well for Fleisher|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice job- Ralph!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  7S and then 7nt ?  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Neither Multon or Zimmerman has anything resembling a defensive trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rimbus: As I said, I fear a double finesse....|pg||
nt|ritong: ugliest possible dummy for francky|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only chance of 5 is leading low club to king at some point and defense duck and not take their ace clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  5@S by Zimmermann on his first turn might have been more successful|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as said -p- p - 7nt!!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  next...|pg||
nt|dburn: unless they take the wire away, of course, as they did yesterday|pg||
nt|barnets: tell us what happened david|pg||
pc|c8|nt|reisig: It's a "style" thing|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: notthat europeans never do that, but americans certainly do it way more frequently|pg||
nt|barnets: low scoring set so far|pg||
nt|barnets: yesterday Nickell beat gordon 81-73|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Particularly considering only 2 push boards to date.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  -5 or push based on nickell's decision here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: if hes willing to bid 6@s why not bid THAT the first time?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|grebrof: 8 imps for Monaco?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whose ghost arises if you do it in France|pg||
nt|ritong: none|pg||
nt|ritong: but brigidda is awake|pg||
nt|barnets: which is one of the lwest scoring matches i have seen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: can get 1400 if they can promote k@D|pg||
nt|grebrof: as someone says, Rosenbergs 1@s can be only 3, but still...|pg||
nt|kit: Zia may have to be guessing which black 10 to play his partner for|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|leo lasota:  68-38|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  good pressure from Multon|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|ritong: we just rebid 1NT more easily|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  Well done by Rod to lead a heart although dummy showed shortness. Any other lead and it makes|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  absolutely Roland|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: he didn't know about the @S9|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@s?|pg||
nt|barnets: I was out|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: 4 more boards. insurmountable odds against team joel|pg||
nt|grebrof: well, it was 8|pg||
nt|kit: A chance for Fleisher to get some IMPs back if they can somehow diagonse this slam|pg||
nt|barnets: many open 1@H here|pg||
nt|rimbus: because when you have 10 7 3 you (ritong) play the 7|pg||
nt|ritong: i think seamon got it double bluffing|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  friendly layout for 4S here|pg||
nt|reisig: OK :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Rich; many times it is ok to open 7 card suit at the 2 level|pg||
mb|2C|an|FG, may not have !c length|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: reverse reverse psychology?|pg||
nt|kit: Very think game -- not likely to be reached.|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: at the other table I think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|grebrof: here explained as weakish|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe the problem will be even getting to game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: explained as weak, but how weak based off vul|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has been looking at the CC - its a jumpfit, but weakish then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: saved by the 2N|pg||
nt|psyck: they show feature here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  especially vul|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: those who really want to have commentary, try to go to new bbo version at www.bridgebase.com . there is audio commentary there|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think many nowadays just bid at the 1 level when they have no fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D nat GF|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3D natural non forcing?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  helness/helgemo do well to stay in 2S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: a 64-board match became a 63-board match because it had been played at funereal pace at one table|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: N may have decided his hand is featureless|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2S, 4D the limit on the hand againmst accurate defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: forcing for one round|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ok|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: chance to stop low now?|pg||
nt|barnets: a good vul game|pg||
nt|psyck: probably needed a better @c suit to show a non min feature for them|pg||
nt|barnets: likely make with @HK onside|pg||
nt|kit: With no Drury, Levin is done.|pg||
nt|reisig: This lots like -100|pg||
nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  dbl of 3D would be nice for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: welcome to mike edwards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: typed commentator :)|pg||
nt|xenya: nope|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: did anything happen on the 64th board at the othe table|pg||
nt|reisig: This maybe -1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness asks if 3@s instead of 4 is a slam try. Weinstein: "no, 4@s would show good clubs"|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "i'm not allowed to redouble, i'm banned from it"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the fastest site for scores is bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if puts in 9, then down 1|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|barnets: that could have been  a swing ?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Helgemo had tough call here; tough to make a double on A52|pg||
nt|dburn: no - the directors did not allow the non-glacial table to play it until the glacial one had finished 63|pg||
nt|dburn: and then they didn't allow it to be played at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: tough choice of lead for E|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H shows extra @H length without 6@S|pg||
nt|barnets: well thats better than having a result in 1 room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done by helness|pg||
nt|dburn: very much so - thought they handled it pretty well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|medwards: OK|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: welcome. i can't see/hear the voice commentary. thought this table was operating in silence lol|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT would show a strong @D rebid|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  soon to claim down 1|pg||
nt|barnets: on a club lead ded may make|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nickell should cash king clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  in case of faint hope QJ dblton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: should zimmermann then drop @cJ for down two?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  umm NO|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  no double; did not think so :)|pg||
nt|reisig: You kidding?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kit: what a disaster -- 4@S down when cold for 6@D|pg||
nt|kit: Assuming Helness believes the lead as a singleton|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfv: Sorry, I was answering someone's question and must have typed a "D" accidentally - he thought about it but didn't dobule|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: fantunes table has finished play!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|medwards: Off to good lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: audio commentators - experts pelu and swanson|pg||
nt|medwards: seems like heart lead now is best looking at east hand|pg||
nt|barnets: he can win and duck a diamond|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  a quick 5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Although very unlikely that the game will be bid, potential pickup for the Gordon team if they push to the 4S here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  they'd have to be very pushy|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: now clubs|pg||
nt|rimbus: I would play the jack of @c frpom dummy...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Multon has sure 5 tricks in sight|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: now even i could make it|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  duck spade lead here by helness|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  no reason to create additional trick in the spade suit for declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe the meaning of the double of 2nt should be more precise|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  however|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  looking at Jxx clubs may get him to reconsider ducking|pg||
nt|dburn: this would have been doubled at matchpoints or BAM, I'm fairly sure, but you hate to bring back -670 on the rare occasions that it makes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: About last night - the only problem was that the players in the "fast" room didn't realize there was a chance they might be able to play board 64 if the other table caught up ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (which they pretty much did), so one of the players (no, I don't know which one) looked at the score on the Vugraph operator's computer and then of course they couldn't play the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: last board since you're not supposed to know the score|pg||
nt|dburn: while you aren't ashamed of bringing back plus 200 or 300 on a partscore deal|pg||
nt|reisig: I think - that 1NTXX swung the match|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: Monaco got to the good 6@d on 42|pg||
nt|barnets: so that will be flat|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  alot of problems remain here for Levin|pg||
nt|barnets: asesion where 2 slams were bid after opps opened the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness thought and thought and thought ... Levin: "all that and you threw a spade" Helness: "I was thinking about the whole hand" laughter|pg||
pc|d5|nt|3for3: 13 more for Monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i retract -- some communication problems|pg||
nt|barnets: very unusual|pg||
nt|barnets: the bidding dd not stop at 6@D|pg||
nt|barnets: and they bid to 6N |pg||
nt|barnets: which was not well done|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|medwards: not best|pg||
nt|barnets: then @SA  and two more diamonds pitchin a heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|barnets: now west has to lead a club to beat it|pg||
nt|dburn: they may survive, if no one leads a club from (respectively) KJx and AQxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "interesting" Levin: "a club looks best" Helness: "right!" then "a club is the only switch of course :)"|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: yes game would have been ok single dummy i suppose|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco won the recent European Championship an will be one of the favorites in the upcoming world Championships next month|pg||
nt|barnets: this team was put toghether specially by Pierre Zimmerman a Swiss national|pg||
nt|barnets: it does not ,matter whther west or east ruffs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  4th rd hearts here|pg||
nt|barnets: def lose a trick|pg||

pc|s3|nt|leo lasota:  -3 here |pg||

nt|ritong: some relaxation after the stressing slam|pg||

mb|1C|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  and the defense didnt take so many :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll probably get to interview mildred breed from the other room soon. very nice lady|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  1H-P-P-dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West might have bid some clubs there -- would have made things even more exciting|pg||
nt|phil: EW play weak NT's? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: not without an overbidder's lisence, hard to get in PA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||

nt|barnets: new leader|pg||
nt|barnets: is Nickelll|pg||
nt|reisig: That's special - find that lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  second dbl shows extras, usually 2 spades|pg||

mb|3N|nt|3for3: big result for monaco in OR|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  Does anyone know if Sontag has ever been issued a slow play penalty?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Looks normal to me|pg||

nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 4@S should be the fits that weren't good enough to raise directly |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  From Helness perspective, partner may have either 5 clubs or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: Never got the @h suit involved|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The dread "do something intelligent" x.  One of the best ways to find your 3-3 fits.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or...|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  may result in +50 :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or 100..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick 110 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness asks about leads: "attitude" Helness: "so from 4 or 5 might lead lowest?" Weinstein: "yes, and it's based on the suit and the whole hand"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
nt|kit: canape style potentially.  South doesn't know which suit is longer.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showing 4+ in both suits, either 54++ or 45++|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  up for partnership discussion what 2nt would mean on this auction by East|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect this to go down 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  1 imp to Nickell|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as always, Pepsi as dummy opens a thick book in Polish|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure I understand the 2@D call|pg||
nt|warrens:  nor I|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt is a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, North might have bid 3@C over 1NT, which is highly invitational.|pg||
nt|kit: The fact the South is thinking indicates that perhaps North has shown a very strong hand.|pg||
nt|kit: But he better pass, as a diamond lead defeats 3NT I believe.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but as expected, E/W had the mwethods to uncover the 8 card fit; well done|pg||
nt|reisig: Good job|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  easy for defense to hold the declarer to 5 trump tricks and 2 aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness asks about the @h9: "if he thinks I need count, it's count, otherwise it's normal Smith"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, 3NT likely to go down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|d4|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
nt|barnets: Tiger just holed a 50 ft put !|pg||

nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||

nt|barnets: so rodwell play a second club and slam is down 2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  eventually having to break the cdlub suit himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very short break|pg||
nt|barnets: tha was 17 imps for Nickell a huge swing|pg||
nt|barnets: now up by 10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: East can comfortably discard 2 hearts and 1 spade on the run of the clubs, so nothing bad should happen.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  easy 140 here|pg||

nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||
nt|ritong: when, in states, it is the contrary|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't we find a closer match ?  :) :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there will certainly be alot of talk about that hand after the match if Gordon should lose|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +100 for Monaco in other room here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  though really no mental effect on d2 versus d3 undled non vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S didn't make at other table, so match is tied!|pg||
nt|barnets: 45  v11 Nickell this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
nt|kit: on board 59|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
nt|ritong: both work well, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this being played wrong way|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz has fair hand with 4 card support, 14 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You did not claim|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  undouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
nt|kit: Light neg double -- Levin will surely bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein wanting to find 44 heart fit if there; plans to smolen then show 6th spade if needed; Helness/Helgemo ruin his plans somewhat but he still knows that they do not have 44 heart fit as Levin passed 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "Oh, 2 spades"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Something to discuss with your partner, would a bid of 3 of a major be Smolen here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@s was alerted by levin|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he took such a low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin's hand has gotten much better on the auction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: weinstein declarer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice 3C call here, nice pass by Katz|pg||
nt|reisig: Congrats to Monaco Team - well done!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
nt|dburn: Fantoni and Nunes did bid and make 4@s on 60, so this match is over - well done Monaco|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes - but the alert meant something else :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: levin clearly felt this was a smolen situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he thought 3@s showed 5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (i think)|pg||
nt|reisig: Right!|pg||
nt|barnets: this may be stronger than 2@C-2@D 4@H|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play problem here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might get to game in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Perhaps it went 1D-2C-p-p-dbl-p-2h?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice lead by katz|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: katz can picture trump length with partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: so he sets out to force declarer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer can only come down to Kx hearts after taking all the pitches|pg||
pc|d8|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Surprised if Levin/Weinstein do not have solid understanding here after opponents bid 2D-3D|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||
nt|kit: how can Weinstein be declarer?|pg||
nt|barnets: whch is 6-4|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ace duck club|pg||
nt|reisig: New leader|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: weinstein thinks that it shouldnt be smolen situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: levin says he sees his point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (something to do with how they bid spade hands|pg||
nt|reisig: and - I think board 14 will be 3@s by NS|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade continue as good as anything else here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but jack spade best|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer gets enough ruffs in he might score 4 trump tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rimbus: level of five belongs to opponents, they say|pg||
nt|barnets: yes 3@S made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The kibs mostly agreed with Weinstein.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  give no losing choice to nickell|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: ok now to make it |pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo has to keep @D5|pg||
nt|barnets: just needs a fin i think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|medwards: heart lead would cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there's a stopclock in the room counting down available time. only 17 min left to play|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|leo lasota:  140 here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil: I don't think 3@h was getting hurt too badly|pg||
nt|psyck: yes this will not trouble him|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a made slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play mixed raise here rather than weak'|pg||
nt|kit: is board turned around maybe?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  duck|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: or 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: well done e/w|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: both tables responded 1N   thought Berk-Sonty might play 1@S-3@S preempt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kit: would be a good time to test one round of diamonds now -- far from obvious|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Multon unaware trumps 41|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but will still scramble 7 here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if the made a weak direct raise partner may bid game|pg||
nt|dburn: possibly 170 until he did that|pg||
nt|dinos1: this segment 46-0 so far, really wd|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry i mean did Monaco also win in 2011 :)|pg||
nt|psyck: so only 11 push boards this set now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very impressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they dominated the European Championships|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|dinos1: 6 imps more|pg||

nt|barnets: unheard of|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: thanks martin. sorry about the disruptions everyone. they limit the   of internet connections and i dont have a pw |pg||
nt|phil: I'm going to give the charge to the opening lead in teh other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: almost played the boards in the wrong direciton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board of this set, thanks to our operator Kendrick, tough job if players dont cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: my pleasure, sorry about some missed action. |pg||
nt|ritong: last bullet for this stanza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: more banter after that hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt normal contract for N/S here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: table has been played in extremely friendly spirit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Multon asked the vugraoh operator to treplay 3C :)|pg||
nt|barnets: last board this set|pg||
nt|barnets: open room few boards behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "last board ... for the whole tournament"|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: and partially to NS's system that doesn't allow North to play 3N :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing things up|pg||
nt|barnets: last board you can all go to the open room after this and watch board 10|pg||
nt|barnets: stuck on 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher has made some very quirky preempts immediately after bad boards this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: and congratulations to westheimer for a well deserved win, they played very solidly in every match|pg||
nt|psyck: specs of Cayne BBO matches will be falimial with the acronym SDAM|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but there is alot of work to the play|pg||
nt|dburn: curious deal, really - East-West at one table opened the bidding and defended a game; North-South at the other opened the bidding and defended a part score|pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzfv: 2c is something that i couldnt hear|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is quirky²|pg||
nt|xenya: and this one might make things tough for EW?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing their things during zimmermann's tank|pg||
nt|phil: is quirky squared "quarky"? |pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: that introduces too much physics into bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
nt|ritong: well we didn t mention black holes yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann floats the pass card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to my cocommentator Henri, and everybody else that makes this all possible and enjoyable|pg||
nt|ritong: pleased to be your coco|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alert means not bid on total junk|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: next set should starts 10-15 after both vugraphs go down|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s bid with extras...hmm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry about that|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +200 another fine result for Monaco in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  np|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: forgot to enter the claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: these women must play each other a lot. they talk in nods and meaningful glances. |pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|phil: I have one between my ears|pg||
nt|ritong: extras, yes  4@s bid, debatable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when club jack played helgemo would have to insert queen to hold to 3 |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3S limit of the hand here |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a very old american treatment|pg||
nt|psyck: routine 4M here probably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  redouble shows 9+ HCP with 2 spades I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  E/W to play a level lower in here...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Not sure|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  we shall see'|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will bid 4@s imo|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is 5332 is not superincentive|pg||
nt|ritong: i would quietly single raise and await|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: 5! D a good save|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c  P  3nT?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  seems reasonable rich|pg||
nt|dburn: funny game, bridge, even though it is probably not supposed to be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "well done, guys, we gave it to you" Helness: "I'm not sure about that ... I think it is very close"|pg||
nt|dinos1: unpredictable game)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: this is last of 4 sessions, so I dont think Fleisher has given up yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *first|pg||
nt|grebrof: first, sorry :D|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and cue|pg||
nt|phil: surprised he didn't bd 4@s initially|pg||
nt|ritong: even stronger than pass and pull:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or pass the double|pg||
nt|phil: that shows a moose |pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: I count 5 for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: results at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes had nice auction to 6@D|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very surprised helgemo defended that way on last hand; seemed like he would work out to exit diamond, then cover club jack with queen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein asking about Helgemo's hand - 11-13 and possible to have a stiff spade|pg||
pc|d2|nt|phil: Oo|pg||
nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: now that's a cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S would be without the club king|pg||
nt|psyck: (Six Diamonds Always Makes)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes tx for your many humorous and sometimes helpful comments|pg||
nt|rimbus: A great segment for Hel2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very friendly spade position will result in 3nt making for Weinstein with some ease|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  question is what are the agreements for the passed hand 3D call?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  makes 2nt on that lead|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|dburn: possible not to, of course, but the lead may not work too badly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helness: "i had to talk him into leading a spade! ... he's so easy ... and he's a poker player"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: pass and jump cue|pg||
nt|phil: whatever 5@s shows - he doesn't have it|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: with Multon's I would want to bid 8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again Kendrick and Henri|pg||
nt|psyck: after their attempts at 6@c failed, they found the correct stratefy...|pg||
nt|barnets: well done by north|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pretty much an open book for the declarer play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Levin: "sorry, I picked the wrong hand to revoke" Weinstein: "it's okay there will be lots more events"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: I need a coffee - my screen is not often this blue :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  lol|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu:  spec tx to our opereator u hacve done a superb job - spec with all the informations from the table TX!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers finally got to declare! molson says "i cant let you go a whole sgment without declaring"|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C in open worth watching|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 45  Monaco leads Cayne by 76|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: ty ty see all later|pg||
nt|grebrof: its just as good as 4@s - choice of slam with a void - I have everything|pg||
nt|psyck: is that the strongest bid ever made?|pg||
nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe this will scare off a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: thanks for watching this segment and bearing with me. |pg||
nt|rimbus: and zimmul were close to put a last nail in the coffin|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with spade queen being discovered to be onside, west is marked with ace heart and king club |pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: doesnt look like this has a chance :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bye for now|pg||
nt|ritong: no swing anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one told him that spades are 8-1|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is he will duplicate rosenberg's line|pg||
nt|phil: some perceptive commentators tell me 7N makes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: multon asks if double is 100% penalty, fleisher, does an air "knock-on-wood"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play continues with semi-finals tomorrow at 7am PST, 10am east coast|pg||
nt|barnets: another miserable slam here not worth watching I am afraid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 5@C didn't deter them from slam, unfortunately|pg||
nt|barnets: unless of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that was Sementa-Duboin bidding to 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  At least one overbid here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  see if Katz/Nickell can accurately defend for a good finish|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Westis excused cos he has the money|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: south bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and a phantom sacrifice...|pg||
nt|barnets: oh my G|pg||
nt|dinos1: thx all and congr Monaco team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein shook their hands on the way out - "well done"|pg||
pg||
