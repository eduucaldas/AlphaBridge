nt|malipivo:  7@s in cold heart, any voters?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching astonishing bridge!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I might just try Blackwood with W hand, not ideal, but then again, what is?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: PM me your suggestions, if I like it i'll post it!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, it would work perfectly.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Gotten a suggestion for a blast off to 6@S, thats possible, if there is a killing lead, harder for them to find.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: and rather 6@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d would be cheap for N-S if they find slam in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The agressive 1S overcall by Isha is not really her style, but is on target on this hand.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It will get Taylor off to the best lead of a S versus a NT contract.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think she's becoming a little more aggressive to compensate|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||

pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||

nt|malipivo:  if @cQ is coverting @c98 they might be in trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north could have led the @h king asking for unblock|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but that would still be 4 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  an impressive board, one way or the other|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can declarer find the club play?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or will he duck a diamond hoping that the hearts are blocked|pg||

nt|moonbeam42:  The Netherlands are currently 30 VPs ahead of second place|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The Dutch girls are always tough.  Bridge is encouraged in the schools in the Netherlands.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bridgegoth: Luckily every suit behaves, the K@C can take care of the @D loser|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: he can try that right away and get the good news, @hs are unexpectedly 3-3, even better news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and hearts are 3-3, so hearts are behaving|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: This is one of those hands we all wish we could tap them on the shoulder and just say "making 4, everything works" but we of course can't do that.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: in the unlikely even A@D is doubleton, a @H pitch is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if she can go wrong.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't see how, even if you experiment in the other suits, you always have multiple entries|pg||

nt|johnjones:  I'm predicting 2C when it gets sorted out.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: vugraph software may allow "illegal" auctions like this since in real life, insufficient bids can be accepted. I have a similar BBO screenshot saved from an earlier vugraph|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is nothing illegal about 2@H. Unwise perhaps but not illegal|pg||
nt|hackenbush: I mean the 2nd 2@h, by east|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Obviously 13 tricks in NT, hearts or clubs are easy, but grands with exactly 13 tricks are tough.|pg||
