nt|thak: there are some suggestions abt dbling 3@D, I think it is wrong on multiple counts|pg||
nt|nkgupt: if not 35 at least 25 even counting + positions|pg||
nt|thak: a) if opps are heading towards a slam, you want them to bid it|pg||
nt|richardt: Vic would have done MUCH better to double 4@h in OR :(|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|thak: and hope that atleast one black ace is in dummy|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kaapo2:  1@S is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: b) if you dbl, 3N may not be the contract|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kaapo2:  Oh, East found an off-shape double|pg||

mb|p|nt|bebechira1: and thats good...because they are the best state team |pg||
mb|2N|nt|richardt: lived and played there for 18 yeard|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  North's 1@S is either 14+ or 11+ with 4+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo2:  So South knows either 21+ HCPs or a double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira1: only Charles neutral lol|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  I guess thath might explain 2NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|richardt: the Blackout convention after opener reverses...lower of 4th suit or 2NT indicates poor hand...all other bids GF|pg||
nt|kaapo2:  Rahi had decent clubs so rebidding 2@C looked much better here|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|henryb:  One of the pitfalls of 4th best is that this lead tells opener it is safe to knock out the @dA|pg||
