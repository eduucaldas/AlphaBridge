nt|joecritter:  Hello all. looks like we got a late start here|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome everyone! :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Compared to the previous two days, 5 minutes late is heavenly |pg||
nt|joecritter:  Tell me about it :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Sitting E/W are Sean Gannon and Stephen Drodge, while Owen Lien and Kevin Dwyer sit N/S|pg||
nt|minimeck: A nice third seat 3@d by dwyer, max pressure to start out a match like this|pg||
nt|minimeck: very very light balance by drodge :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  At the other table, Zizhuo and Jimmy Wang sit N/S, while Roger Lee and Rajkumar sit E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to play agst your "other half"?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  Drodge has cloned himself so I'm sure he's aware of the double|pg||
nt|minimeck: I think playing bridge with oneself is a frightening proposition :)|pg||

nt|joecritter:  East likes everything about this except the colors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|coolbeans:  He doesn't want to miss vulnerable game, but he ends up trusting in his defense|pg||
pc|d3|nt|coolbeans:  This might not be that bad of a board for USA 1, considering that E/W are ice cold for 7NT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: I would suspect they won't bid the grand off the king of clubs :p|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I don't think they will either, especially with the overcall|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  But if Dwyer scores one trick here, it may be a 1 IMP swing|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Swing in quotation marks, obviously|pg||
nt|minimeck: Specs commenting on the 1@s overcall, this is a situation where the overcall really serves no purpose, other than to pour gas on the fire and try and push around the opponents|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|minimeck: I predict dwyer would not have made this overcall in a different match :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|coolbeans:  That beats all of the people who would never make this overcall :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|joecritter:  Many moons ago I had a partner (Drodge's partner from Zagreb I want to say) make such an overcall and got himself booted from the 299er room at a NABC|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|minimeck: I don't think there's any debate about the merit of the bid, just playin a bit of poker at the bridge table :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|minimeck: but you bring up an important point, I don't agree with how "novice" games frown upon psyches or semi-psyches, every player should want to improve against the toughest competition ...|pg||
nt|minimeck: possible |pg||
nt|joecritter:  Hey, when the opponents are cold for 7NT and youre at favorable, what else can you do? :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Dwyer's poker face beats mine here. I would be laughing as I lose 12 or 13 tricks|pg||
nt|joecritter:  They shouldnt frown on it. They told him it was okay, but "if he wanted to bid like that, take it outside"|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like Dwyer, scores 1 trick |pg||
nt|sybarra: if not 2 |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  2 tricks would be a good board for him|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c8|nt|joecritter:  Ah, youth.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  8 IMPs for USA 1 if that happened|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  1 or 2 IMPs for USA 1|pg||
nt|joecritter:  Sure. let me find my dartboard.|pg||
nt|minimeck: people asking if bidding has been so agressive due to usa vs usa, I think there is no question of that. |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  We saw this last night in the Youngsters series|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  In the minds of both teams, this has a little more fun aspect to it than other matches|pg||
nt|galallie:  Lots of wasted strength in clubs for Kevin Dwyer|pg||

nt|minimeck: The scores from the other table do not appear to be linked here, to follow the live scores may need to use the results link|pg||

pc|s4|nt|minimeck: 3nt certainly the practical choice :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Gannon continues to lead partner's suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: Has some work to do here certainly, |pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: something to be said about leading other suit, when opp is prepared for @S lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: running diamonds right away not really an option, will likely work on hearts i suppose|pg||
nt|galallie:  Dwyer now should lose a heart.|pg||
nt|minimeck: Drodge should certainly put in the jack here, rising ace rates to be a give up play|pg||
nt|minimeck: the 10 i mean* of course :)|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  If Drodge doesn't go up, best option is to win the K of @S and then lose the @H. Gannon may not, but probably will, play Dwyer for the Queen then|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|coolbeans:  The opening lead is the one reason why I like to bid more. I play a college football defense|pg||
nt|minimeck: current score is 3-1 USA 1, with 6 or 8 more for usa1 on board 4|pg||
nt|joecritter:  you block punts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  No, I give up yards and points, but I play a mean special teams :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|minimeck: dwyer here might be tempted to try 3@c oposite the "ambiguous" 1@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  He follows your order|pg||
nt|galallie:  Lien understandably corrects|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Do they open 1D with 4@D and 5@C?|pg||
nt|minimeck: these competative minor hands can be a bit awkard, but in situations like these can always cater to the hand with 2@d and 3 -5 clubs|pg||
nt|joecritter:  down one on board 4|pg||
nt|minimeck: with both minors yes open 1@d and rebid clubs, either 4/5|pg||
nt|galallie:  Drodge needs play his two aces then another heart to get his ruff|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Down one is 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That will hold it to 3|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  I mean set it|pg||

nt|agumperz:  with both finesses onside, this looks like clear sailing|pg||
nt|kit: Not immediately obvious which contract is better, but on this layout both make easily|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jlall: seems reasonable, usually north would be 5332 |pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: From his point of view it is legitimate, as his partner could have Qx of spades.|pg||
nt|jlall: i think declarer should go right, ace and a spade caters to east having Kxx of spades|pg||
nt|jlall: but with that, west would have 2 spades and 1 diamond, and passed over 2S..he likely would compete with 5-5|pg||
nt|kit: But if declarer thinks West has ace of hearts for overcall, then he may conclude that ace and a spade is safest play|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, there is some reason why East didn't lead a heart, and that reason might be the ace.|pg||

nt|kit: 5@C call reasonable based on the secondary spade fit.|pg||

nt|kit: But North might shift to a spade now!|pg||
nt|agumperz:  into the spade bidder?|pg||
nt|kit: Still, the defense would barely survive|pg||
nt|jlall: I have the agreement in this auction that with 5 spades and 6 clubs, west must jump to 4S. This stops a guess with the east hand about whether or not to bid 4S. If you would always ...|pg||
nt|jlall: make a negative X instead of raising clubs then you could argue that east could bid 4S showing 3, catering to partner being 5-6|pg||
nt|kit: why not?  Partner has one of the black aces, and it could be spades.  I don't think it can cost.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jlall: many would play suit preference at trick 1|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jlall: all kidding aside, i think juniors frequently play far too fast...there is a lot of time, so it's good so see some that don't |pg||
nt|kit: He probably figures North for king of spades, but this is his only play to make.|pg||
nt|jlall: it's not a race and you're playing in a world championship, no need to play super fast|pg||
nt|kit: Now he might play queen of diamonds and ruff a diamond high, then king of clubs, hoping clubs 2-2.|pg||
nt|jlall: that wouldn't work though, right? since they can tap dummy after winning the CA|pg||
nt|kit: no -- pitch heart on queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|jlall: ah yes|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|jlall: his line catered to south having 3 clubs or 3 spades which is pretty good but playing on diamonds was 100 % as south could not play clubs effectively|pg||
