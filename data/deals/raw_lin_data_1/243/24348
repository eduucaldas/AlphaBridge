nt|minimeck: One interesting aspect of this event, and bridge on the world scale with the new "Monaco" team, many players have switched nationalities |pg||
nt|minimeck: Ragu on the americans, for example, played for india previously|pg||
nt|san_d_go: a club lead by west,can damage even 6@S|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: would you X with N cards?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|minimeck: 2nt here is an unspecified game try. |pg||

nt|jron: A good pass by S, N wont have enough points for game and he wont have a penalty dbl w AJxx in spades|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jron: I would; I believe in showing values immediately|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: S is a sure pass but N can X with 4-4 minors and 2 kings|pg||
pc|dA|nt|minimeck: singleton club but garbage values, no interest from lien :)|pg||

nt|ron_sc2002: If N Dbl 1@S .. S will pass for a great score|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|johnjones:  Many expert US pairs use 2NT there as Spiral, asking for the   of trumps and the strength of opener's hand|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|minimeck: Dwyer Lien follow the meckwellian raise style in their club structure, thus don't play that method but yes is very common|pg||
nt|kfay: A spectator was wondering why the US gets to send 2 teams in the first place.  Country participation is set by the WBF and is dependent mostly on membership in each country's NBO, ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|kfay: Meaning you don't have a strong opinion?|pg||
nt|jchiu: 2@C though i like to open one often|pg||
nt|kit: the auction doesn't figure to go very smoothly if you open 1@H|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|jchiu: right, drury or a truly nonforcing notrump can be hard to navigate|pg||
mb|p|nt|thorvald: 4@C must be Cue, as Bilde did bid 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jepsen will be reluctant to cuebid 4@S with a singleton diamond, provided that 4@H is a cuebid and not RKC|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they are in the way to slam|pg||
nt|thorvald: Anything else than 5@d will bring them to slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is there a risk that he passes this?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North will be happy to pass if West does|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: And if partner has a yarb, so you get to a bad game -- sometimes they make|pg||
nt|jchiu: surely keycard would have been easier here|pg||
nt|jchiu: or a 4@D cuebid|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure trying to cue bid this one out here would be my choice, is he looking 4 7 by cue bidding, otherwise why not just bid rkc? |pg||
nt|kfay: The control sequence is very poor after the 2@H-3@H start.  I remember I used to play it in a former partnership and we had to have some discussions about opener's rebid when he ...|pg||
nt|kfay: actually held hearts.  I seem to recall that we thought a jump to 4@H should be forcing, but I can't say I remember much about it now.|pg||

pc|cT|nt|kit: I guess not so easy after all|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|kfay: Perhaps he should have splintered 5@C over 3@H, W could bid 5@D, and then E maybe could bid slam.  Alternatively I think E could probably just bid keycard over 3@H if he knew ...|pg||
nt|kfay: things were going to be ambiguous.|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jepsen would have loved to cue 4@S but he thought he owed partner a trump so decided against|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: Do we know what the meaning of 2@H was?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One can understand that|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jchiu: when i played, France, Israel and the United States were among those teams who played naturally and well|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Kevin, but most players don't like splintering above 4 of the trump suit.|pg||
mc|12|nt|jchiu: and juniors today are overly preoccupied with artificiality at the expense of these situations under pressure|pg||
nt|thorvald: Agree, and its not a slam you want to be in, looking at only EW hands|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: he should have bid 4@S on the way... no other words|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: East might have tried 3@S, figuring that if West had nothing in spades then 3NT not so good|pg||

nt|jchiu: did Dwyer really duck that?|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, perhaps dwyer could not invision this holding with no double of 2@s, but still shocking|pg||
nt|kfay: Maybe West might have bid something other than 2@H at his 2nd turn.  2@s or 3@H, although 2@S probably would have led to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he won the ace|pg||

nt|minimeck: as kfay mentioned at the start of the match, these are accomplished french players, they will need to go back to the drawing board. |pg||
nt|jchiu: yeah he's catching up after that, rather than taking the room to show his mild extras with 3@C or 3@H|pg||
nt|jchiu: i would not count the French out, one bad set in a long tournament is fine|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kfay: For anyone wondering about the format it's a complete round robin between the 17 teams followed by an 8-team knockout.|pg||
nt|jchiu: 20 teams|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he tried passing the jack of hearts to explain the extra undertrick|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, losing the first match by such a margin by no means seals any fate, it simply increases the average vp's you will need to q in that 8 spot, with 20 teams will be tough. |pg||
nt|jchiu: this may dent their seeding rights, but i'll bet anyone a raki they'll qualify|pg||
nt|minimeck: Thanks again all, see everyone in 90 minutes :)|pg||
