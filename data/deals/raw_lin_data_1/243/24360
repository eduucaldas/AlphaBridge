nt|malipivo:  We are going to have a beautiful day here as it is a bridge day. I am going to cross my fingers to all the teams wishing them all the best (esp. bid, play and defend all the slams)! Also we wish good luck to our Vugraph operator!|pg||

nt|malipivo:  In the Junior and Youngsters series, a qualifier will be played first, in the form of a single round robin of 16-board matches. The top eight teams in each series will advance to the knockout stage. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are still in early stages of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching Youngsters, round 4, according to this plan:|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  England currently standing 3rd, Poland currently standing 4th. We are watching Youngsters.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
mb|6D|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
mb|6S|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||
mb|7D|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
mb|d|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|d3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|dK|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Possible 8-imp swing coming.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|johnjones:  On a lucky day 4H might make an overtrick, but not today.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d7|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|malipivo:  They were down in 5@d and 6@d, so it is strange way of calling it an opportunity (to bid slam).|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|ianmcc: and no values!|pg||
mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is in 4@s after 2@s-p-4@s-all pass.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, maybe it was an opportunity to display superb judgement by stopping in 5@d by South or 4@d by North|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I see slams everywhere, I am sorry about that.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  of course!|pg||

nt|dburn: will have to revise my appraisal - East-West can almost make a slam here|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  sure, after a non-spade lead :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am kidding.|pg||
nt|dburn: they can also make a couple of overtricks in 3NT redoubled, which scores more than a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh yes, that's a missed opportunity|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@sX would be -3, I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  or more likely 4@hX|pg||

nt|keylime:  That we have John.|pg||
nt|keylime:  And I think the 3NT was influenced by the club slam.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Yes, although maybe that is a lesson to be learned not to compund your difficulties.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The 6C slam was pretty.|pg||

nt|johnjones:  I'm curious how 5D was allowed to make at the other table on this last hand.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Appears that the heart was never allowed to be cashed. Declarer won the trump ace and played a club. Spade return and that's that.|pg||
