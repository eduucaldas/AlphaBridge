nt|malipivo:  Brief information about the format:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In the Girls series, the qualifier will be played as a double round robin of 16-board matches, producing the top four teams. The knockout stage consists of the semifinals and the final and playoff for third place. There is no Bye round.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 4: a push.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And a non-slam deal on this one.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Partscore battle is upon us.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We can see it easily (not even 3!n), as E-W are holding diamonds and N-S hearts.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  To be exact: major versus minor suits battle.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|malipivo:  Slam zone!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I believe that 4@s will be found here.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  major suit shall win this, but @sA is onside, so who knows?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|malipivo:  7@c, perhaps, let's see!|pg||

pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  Board 4: 6 imps to Netherlands, as they finished in 2!n=.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  But this is crucial deal!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Bidding is going the same way, so far.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: and 3!n it is!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  What an opportunity to Polish team.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Sitting out for the two teams are Arjun Dhir and Murphy Green for USA 2 and Zach and Adam Grossack for USA 1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|malipivo:  a crucial moment is coming|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|malipivo:  Netherlands shall be little more offensive, there shall be no winning strategy letting play 1!n.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  3@dX would be -1 for 200 and an imp to Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Would we double 3@d, so it might be -1 for 100 and 2 imps to Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Wow!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And double heart finesse is on, so it might even make.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hawaii in trumps is not nice for the declarer, to be honest.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another battle is ahead of us. We have got a nice Dealer.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  The defense must be tough if they dislike 4@s N-S.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Did I say my morning praying, didn't I?|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  In my opinion, 4S should show a 3S or 3NT response to 2NT without the interference, while a pass should show a 4S response|pg||

mb|p|nt|joecritter:  If you were going to do something like that 1@H I think is the wrong first move|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A slam zone, any voters?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sK is onside for finessing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Diamonds are our friend today: breaking 2-3.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  but hearts are not|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joecritter:  Lucky they stayed out of 6...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sTxx is key to slam (ruffing finesse against @sK)|pg||
mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Well, the 4-4 fit here plays better than the 5-3|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This can only make 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 1NT seems normal enough here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We shall see what level of risk is Netherlands undertaking.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: looks like 120|pg||
pc|s4|nt|johnjones:  South should double 1NT if she trusts that her partner has payched the opening 1D bid.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but lack of entries is a major problem on this deal if in a diamond slam|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|coolbeans:  W needs to lead a low H|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Very strange to see an auction end so easily when one hand is 6 - 6.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridgegoth: Looks like E/W in the open room used XYZ to arrive in a 5-2@H fit instead of 1NT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A low heart to !9 is powerful here.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  I think this contract is down since W made S ruff a H|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  free finesse and declarer is not buying it, still Tx opposite Q provides a stopper.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Another expected push.|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|joecritter:  Unless something bizzare happens like the J@H being lead, ruffed, and a spade pitched|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Neither Jeng would fall for that|pg||
nt|joecritter:  Good result for USA1 on board 9|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That probably will be the swing board of the night'|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Yes, slam is risky here, but desperate teams will require desperate measures.|pg||

nt|joecritter:  4-6-10 one way, 6 the other. That's either one swing or 3 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|joecritter:  The 5 Spades making 6 we thought would be a swing was muted by a sacrifice|pg||
nt|joecritter:  scuse me. wrong board. that has yet to be played, so yes 2 swings|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And I also mean winning teams. :)|pg||

mb|5D|nt|malipivo:  And MagdalÃ©na TichÃ¡ in offense!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: When both sides have a fit, low level Xs so rarely work, even at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And Czech fans are standing and waiting for big hit. :)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I would be very surprised if W gives up here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even small slam is a plus score for Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  7@s in cold heart, any voters?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching astonishing bridge!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I might just try Blackwood with W hand, not ideal, but then again, what is?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: PM me your suggestions, if I like it i'll post it!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, it would work perfectly.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Gotten a suggestion for a blast off to 6@S, thats possible, if there is a killing lead, harder for them to find.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I don't see a killing lead.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: as a very good raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so he do|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: and rather 6@d|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: but still not very clear|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And this is going to be expensive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d would be cheap for N-S if they find slam in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
mb|d|nt|johnjones:  The agressive 1S overcall by Isha is not really her style, but is on target on this hand.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It will get Taylor off to the best lead of a S versus a NT contract.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think she's becoming a little more aggressive to compensate|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h shall go down.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  even two if hearts are misguessed|pg||
mb|6C|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
nt|joecritter:  A second lie to make up for the first one?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Two wrongs make a right :)?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  The bridge gods like this it apparently. 2-2 trump break and the King is onside.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  OR is buying 5@c, soon doubled.|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Chaugny needs to win this in hand|pg||
nt|malipivo:  oh my!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  It is 21-9 VP, let's in a minute...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  but it saves that club ruffing potential|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  the change is coming.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|coolbeans:  Sadly, there is no way to capture the whole Spade suit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well bid laydown slam with only 23 hcp|pg||
pc|d2|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing Board 14.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: but that would still be 4 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  an impressive board, one way or the other|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can declarer find the club play?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or will he duck a diamond hoping that the hearts are blocked|pg||

nt|johnjones:  2C would be fine also.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  even 2@d would be better :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Compton asked for an undo. After some consideration she thought 2@H was a wee bit wet :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  we believe so.  The operator did an "undo", but then put 2H back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not 2@H again :)|pg||
nt|ritong: internet is magic, but we are demanding:) when it goes somewhat wrong we get ceazy|pg||

nt|ritong: this is a pure creation lol|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm predicting 2C when it gets sorted out.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: vugraph software may allow "illegal" auctions like this since in real life, insufficient bids can be accepted. I have a similar BBO screenshot saved from an earlier vugraph|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is nothing illegal about 2@H. Unwise perhaps but not illegal|pg||
nt|hackenbush: I mean the 2nd 2@h, by east|pg||
