mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfu: Levin decided he didn't want Sontag to be able to bid at the speed of light, so he took the Pass card out of the box and held it, showing it to Sontag, to delay things before ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfv: Welcome back everyone. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi ken  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: to the 2nd segment of Cayne-Zimmermann|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|3S|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
mb|5C|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
mb|5N|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Welcome back all|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
mb|7H|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nice quiet board to start|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@H natursl GF|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT trumpQ +1 king|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6@C should be gran slam interest asking about @C holding|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: closed room lineup is the same as the 2nd session|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfu: he might have 5 hearts and they've said there's no way to tell about that - Weinstein could have bid 3@c to ask for 5 card Major, but didn't|pg||

nt|phil: yeah, 6@d is definitely possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against a very weak nt, after norths double transfer bids by south give more options|pg||

nt|ritong: cayne does not open these hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: ew might sniff around at slam here|pg||

nt|psyck: NS CC: http://usbf.org/images/conventioncards/cayne-seamon.jpg|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: for sure|pg||
nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
nt|ritong: guess multon will opt for 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will correct 34|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to admit i would have accepted the invite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and would have been wrong on this hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bigtrain: 15-17 as far as i know|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but N is way better than 15|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
pc|c5|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K&R = 16.55|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spot cards are huge here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes little more than the @DQ onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Rodwell almost ready to play...|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||
nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: it is clear for him that declarer would never find the @hs by himself|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|s7|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
nt|barnets: note Cayne played low on club without a flicker|pg||
nt|barnets: you might ask why helness crossed to dummy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|1C|nt|barnets: to lead @CJ|pg||
nt|psyck: he was prepared to play low during the bidding itself|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: maybe cayne had not his morning coffee yet|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: (anticipating the upgrde) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm  - roddy could have also chosen 3@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a bit surrised|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control ask|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C would have shown some solid suit with 7+ tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ controls|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3! shows 1-18 with 3=2=3=5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 17-18|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i anticapte grnd as the fiinal contract from here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4 = RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 2 w/o Q|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 5! asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: shows grand interest so meck will force the issue with "solid" clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7@C as choice maybe|pg||
mb|7D|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: obviously 7@H is the better theorical contract but 7NT will suceed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2nd grand in 1st 4 boards!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no one will ever lead a @D on this auction|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: without W actually exposing the @DA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: a super grovesnor!|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well was better to start the spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: of course Zia couldn't duck, but if he had .....|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: and even then i'd imagine you would have to clean your glasses and ask for a second peek|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then if necessary could have ruffed the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
nt|3for3: helness 'knows' south cant duck that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: Now will take spade finesse and be down 3.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to jack, club ace and club ruff seems a simpler approach and makes 6 on layout|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|3for3: meanwhile 3nt came in at other table so big swing to monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: W is sort of sqaueezed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead was good again|pg||
nt|kit: either red suit would have been effective lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if clubs not breaking you still have the cross ruff line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry to make 5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S is NOT a transfer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they use replacement bids to better utilize the space|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|osvaill83: makes now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzfv: lost track sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D now and made :)|pg||
nt|osvaill83: could have endplayed helgemo|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but Zia couldn't possibly read the position I don't think.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its actually fairly random which partner plays the contract in  Precision|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: Helness probably had aheartattack when that @h ( fell :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 8|pg||
nt|kit: he can still do the end-play|pg||
nt|grebrof: @h 8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|kit: Helgemo obviously fooled by the low heart shift, although it seems like he should have figured it out since declarer known to have 5 spades from auction.|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K and endplay dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Zia knows opponents have made a mistake somewhere -- he just has to figure out where.|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, Rosenberg opened 1@H as E (3rd seat), W bid spades, and that was that |pg||
nt|grebrof: o, than K of !@d and small to 9|pg||
nt|kit: actually he can't make -- Helgemo can win diamond and exit low diamond.|pg||
nt|3for3: and he does know the whole hand at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 9@D covers|pg||
nt|kit: this looked like it would be a relatively dull hand, but things sure got interesting.|pg||
nt|grebrof: after watching Willenken and Rosenberg yesterday, I never thought they would ever be ahead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it does seem as though Helgemo should have kept his heart.  I don't see how that could ever have been wrong whatever the hand is.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|kit: Key was East's spade discard -- I can't imagine East would have pitched spade if he had an honor -- and if declarer has AK of spades then East must have king of hearts or we are ...|pg||
nt|kit: wasting our time.|pg||
nt|m_ozden: @h Ýzmir Kemalpaþa Briç Turnuvasý 29 Temmuz@s Detaylar için týklayýnýz http://www.karsiyakabric.org/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: mumbling Zia: "What could it possibly be?"|pg||
nt|xenya: no imps ar stake|pg||
nt|3for3: at least 1 at stake|pg||
nt|kit: I can see Zia reading the position.  If so, he will win ace of spades, and lead jack of diamonds throwing the 9 -- hoping West has K108x.  And the West underleads and East claims|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be neat ending|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting point -- West led 5 of diamonds, so apparently they lead 3/5 vs. NT.  Thus, the end-play can't work.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even they dont lead 8 from KT85|pg||
nt|kit: And West isn't likely to be making a falsecard on lead on this kind of auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Zia still wondering if it is possible that spade finesse is onside|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: IF roddy bids 3@C initially W would end playing all grands - one of the reasons i was surprised about the lack of the bid|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Disa is very very fast. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: that hand wont come up again this year, are they discussing meaning of 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
mb|2C|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural NF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
nt|bigtrain: east's pass is almost always exactly a doubleton n support|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 losers at first glance|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
nt|ritong: unkind @d|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|ritong: i think franck is realizing just now that a @c might have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvonunda yaptýgý tam ipnelik bu 2 oldu bana|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine East won 8 of clubs on 3rd round, continues hearts, and goes down some|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|ritong: but, surprisingly enough, the trump layout was such that his @h6 was a big card|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|d9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|vugraphzfv: i cant see the club 3 in disa's hand. odd|pg||

nt|ritong: perhaps he has analyzed that in a flash  i know he s extremely fast minded|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: disa very pleased with herself for the transfer squeeze.|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what really happened|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 2@C was won by the 3@C, for sure|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: actually i can see why|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: that really happened for sure?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he played hand that way|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzfv: yes. |pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: lots of laughter at the table after it|pg||
nt|grebrof: Martel and Helness are getting old|pg||
nt|kit: Martel will likely bid 3@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is mixed so must use the single raise here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|ritong: if so, the hand is borderline|pg||
nt|ritong: strict minimum for a constructive raise imho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Rarely 5-7 HCP"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mixed raise is 8-9 dummy points with 4+card support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny asked molson what X means. molson shrugged and pointed at the 3D |pg||
nt|bigtrain: its an offensive type hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: Effective -- E-W haven't found the heart fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any bid by south is only possible after peeking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: disa bids at the same time as patapon. lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Fleisher: "We should make easier bids for them"|pg||
nt|barnets: easy 7 tricks to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: they can win this board|pg||
nt|grebrof: not now thou|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how about spade ace, diamond to queen, spade king and diamonds (in your dreams)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H lead directing with diamond fit, a treatment possible by a passed hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: West might have tried 5@D, leaving it to Zia to find a low club lead!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: you'll see the 3nt and pass cards hit table at same time :) she's really fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be something else on this auction|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H9 is a standard signal after the lead showing the AK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: problem was 1@D on three card suit, given that would have rebid 2nt with disa's hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|grebrof: Helness maybe should have dbl 3@s|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: @sT may prove costly|pg||
nt|barnets: swing on bd 4 when Versace down in 3@D|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 to Monaco off|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c was quite makeable|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|barnets: off|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: this is one route to down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D would have been no better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: east fingered many cards in turn before shaking her head and playing the D2|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 down, but 3@H would have made|pg||
nt|bigtrain: being able to bid 4@S/4@H is too important to risk a TOX vs overcall|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: of|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but the other table bid 3@H which makes the TOX better as itsmore flexible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: either way...  i strongly dislike saving here|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3@s a good sac in any case, especialloy if it makes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck can save a bit here by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but beyond that the 5L save at the other table is the big loser as it rated to be|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: you mean ethically?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: vugraph watchers, if you have time, go ahead to www.bridgebase.com and try the new bridge  base version please. that way you can listen to voice commentary in addition to typed ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ones.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it does but i dont know many who deliberately avoid leading a suit for that reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I believe Henry Bethe is providing it at this table, and he's the new USA bridge federation chairman :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes Henry on vugraph, and my questions are directed to him|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, only the head of the tournament conditions committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: right. i wouldnt have been able to answer anyways :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: "only" the head. henry is cool. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're still waiting for patapon to play. she keeps shaking her head.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb:  I'm going to switch to written. Being the only voice is a lonely job|pg||
nt|barnets: Schneider|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzfv: lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  And the earphones are too hot|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S10 is reverse smith...  thus saying i don't want a @H back|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes easier for the spectators to understand as well|pg||

nt|warrens:  hi Richie.  hi all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfu: Hi Warren, welcome! And congratulations on the GNT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|runnerup:  2 level looks home level here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|reisig: Warren won GNT -- easy!|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Warren, last quarter the director pulled the last board of the set because they were so slow|pg||
mb|2C!|an|checkback|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|warrens:  is S worth an invite?  I think he will with 2@C-2@D-2@H|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@c is great -- forces 2@d|pg||
nt|reisig: END|pg||
nt|warrens:  if 2@D denied 3@H's he might pass, if it was forced, I expect 2@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: I think 2@c is just non-forcing checkback, only forces 2@d if N doesn't have 3 @hs - at least from the gestures from Sontag and Levin|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2@s  ew still winning level |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|warrens:  his @H's are so good, he tried anyway|pg||
nt|reisig: I think 2@d was forced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Levin busy looking at a hand from a previous board and Sontag said something and Levin said "I know ... wanted to see the spots"|pg||
nt|warrens:  his hand is particularly good if partner has a @D honor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Levin will say -- no thanks to @hs|pg||
nt|reisig: or - Just Pass - and say this is your problem!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: No, 2@c was checkback - 2@d denied 3 @hs, could still have 4 @ss (Sontag asked, Levin explained)|pg||
nt|warrens:  starting @C's is obviously best here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|warrens:  gets the tap going for the defense and avoid him pitching on the @S's|pg||
nt|reisig: Hard to understand that 2@h bid - but what do I know?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Levin: "should have just opened a spade ... bidding 2@c with this hand is really sick"|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so a chance for partial swing at least in teoria -but best lead found so this will fail|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Weinstein: "I've never seen you bid this way, I must say ... I'm just glad I'm allowed to do it that way now"|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Levin: "didn't want to pass out a game"|pg||

nt|psyck: Helness just wanted to live up to his earlier comment that he was making all the mistakes|pg||
nt|barnets: Ihe had 7 I looked away and now hes down |pg||
nt|barnets: most unusual|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3: 'standard' off shape nt by zia|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: missing two keys|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: for the @h slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oh you mean if they try for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think 3@d can include three keys, anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so precisely the hand to bid slam on since sure to create a swing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: 3@H looks a bit strange here?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: willard waved her x card to attract valerie's attention. it means 4 spades |pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what east is thinking about.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not any more ? :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|barnets: I see he played the @s 10 at trick1 , his 7th winner|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: W in doubt|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: levin asked molson to take some time. cos she wants to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson is like "going..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  "the whole hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: the program auto plays singletons, zia was thinking|pg||
nt|3for3: as he is entitled to, but at this point he doesnt know a whole lot|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting that Zia gave up on the legit chance of stiff king of clubs |pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: and there. she played. |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps 12 if seamon ducks the second @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: East should perhaps have cashed the king of diamonds first -- now West has a problem.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @C lead would be a real killer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: club shift|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont make but 2@H was making|pg||
nt|psyck: strange defense|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual opening lead yes|pg||
nt|psyck: @hk would have been more standard|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: if so, perhaps zim will try to avoid the dangerous hand, though|pg||
nt|ritong: and miss the @cs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  That is a common treatment in Europe: transfer doubles over 1-level overcalls rather than negative|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if you're forced to level getting there fast shows the worst hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: but this move is even better|pg||
nt|ritong: bien joué, pierre|pg||
nt|ritong: it caters for @c Qxxx with south|pg||

nt|psyck: those may not be the exact cards played, but -1 normall enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can I pull out the red card yet?" - Seamon|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s shuffle around looking for their defense card|pg||
nt|ritong: ah|pg||
nt|ritong: a gazzilli hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzfv: they're exact to the spots, i may have switch a 9 to and 8 or reversed|pg||

nt|psyck: thanks Ken|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: who's at the other table playing it?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the thng is about all the old bridge players is they had to be great declarers since they were such terrible bidders|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: my idea is 2@c should cover some fit hands|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: 1@H has lots going for it|pg||
nt|ritong: which do not completely match standard treatments|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they started 2@S 3@S (hearts and a minor) in open room, which is much tougher|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they seem to have had a misunderstanding, ending in 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne does not like his partners or teammates to make tight Xs|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Also lots against it if partner rebids 1@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if nothing else if gives partner a lead|pg||
nt|3for3: 4 losers for declarer, but defense get get them all|pg||
nt|barnets: especially when they make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is this lead by westheimer too large?|pg||
nt|3for3: here the spade loser disappears|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I believe its in their contracts when they sign on|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: seems like declarer always wins the race|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: leads are 2/4th for n/s|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3rd means (I have a difficult lead P)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6H is down, 6@D could make|pg||
nt|psyck: yes you will not see them make agressive partial doubles|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: not yet|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: westheimer has been ahead the three times she lost the final|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: said only partially as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Let's see if I can make something here, very unlikely" - Helness|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N & 4@s make as cards are, this is better|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  60 imps with 11 to score. The lead is very big but not yet insurmountable|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: so nerves may be a factor still|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is only 49|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfv: rare for sponsor to play last segment. |pg||
nt|ritong: i will be suspected of bad faith, but here i perso play 2@c by west, basically good hand with no clear bid, and over the 90% of the time 2@d, 4@d showing void and @s fit|pg||

nt|warrens:  Weinstein close to a 4@H bid |pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h seems clear - to me|pg||
nt|warrens:  he knows they have a 9-card fit and hopes partner has no wasted values in @S's.  also, they might bid 4@S and get X'ed|pg||
mb|3C!|an|NAT game try|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ok 4 @h needs either @h guess or ruffing @s king down in time for @c discard|pg||

mb|4H|nt|reisig: See ?   :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  I think the alert is that 3@C was forcing|pg||

nt|ritong: yes  bienvenue man|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: 2@S 5 spades and 4 card minor, popular in Europe in conjunction with multi 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think their card says sound weak 2's, but i'm unsure|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  Tand was an orange powdered drink invented for the Astronauts in the 60s|pg||
nt|kit: Martel is wondering where everybody is getting their bids from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok bad guess by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just 8 boards left|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i love this bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: rosenberg is eyeing the 7@D sac|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real question is will he forcing pass if willenken sacs|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: usually you doubt the player who is white vs red|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its not simplisitic...  there is always adjustments occurring|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfv: not sure what 3H means but jmeyers made a cutting her throat gesture|pg||
nt|kit: Since if West had passed, he probably would have tried 2NT|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Jxxxx @S popular overcall tonight|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: henry comment on 1@S nicely please|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 tricks after @s lead|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfv: when jenny doubled, molson was like "drats!" (silently though only jenny could see)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness asks about the j@D lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: chip replies "may not be normal, but standard"|pg||
nt|ritong: other room did not find 7@s either|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: certaintly not my idea of a weak two bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: molson jotting down some notes to herself...think she wants to discuss with jill meyers later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like he has the first 8 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Thanks for the confidence, pard"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: oh nvm she showed jenny wolpert|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: or even better 7@c|pg||
nt|rimbus: I think 7 @s better than 7 @c|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: anyways, a thin ice contract|pg||

nt|barnets: ?|pg||
nt|psyck: very difficult|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 6@C easy, 6@S superficially down|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: reality check|pg||
nt|henryb:  I really dislike that opening bid|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@c not that easy|pg||
nt|ritong: esp doubled|pg||
nt|fabsayc: right, might be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: kamil has wondered for a moment if he was good enough for 4@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sounds like you're here watching it with me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H can be bid on 0 points (at least most play that way) so south can not afford to force to game|pg||
nt|ritong: i think like him, nope   because no source of tricks apart trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surprise 7 imps to fleischer when 7D went four down in open room|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfv: up up and away|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers asked jill levin - big hand? <nod>|pg||
nt|3for3: this should be a dull 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: idec needs say 8 trumps 2@H 2@D makes 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is a 3 or 4 problem  rather 4 or 6  south does not want to lure his pard into a slam without goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: just 5 levels lower than we hoped for|pg||
nt|ritong: guess this shows @d shortage|pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i only 2 points and 1 quick tricks short of a roth opener|pg||
nt|rimbus: lead problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: bidding 3x would show shortness|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: 3N by W is virtually hopeless on likely @H lead -- might be quite different now...|pg||
nt|barnets: seamon has never passed before with those trump spots|pg||
nt|rimbus: waow|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  we proceed differently this side of the ocean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 2@S is showing some form of @S stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: or real 4+@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: most of the time 4+@S, any shape|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i missed that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: I would have expected a 2NT rebid instead of 3@C, but won't affect the final contract.|pg||
nt|kit: North does not have an easy lead|pg||
nt|3for3: id bet on 5/7@S|pg||
nt|kit: I'll bet on heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: any other takers? :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  W has indicates 5 card @h|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 beers on @S|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu:  not taken :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|pelu:  u were right Kit :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must be difficult being zimmermann, hiding that grin. |pg||
nt|barnets: I guarantee that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kit: pay up!|pg||
nt|ritong: full hit, this lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: odd that kamil did not bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his team led comfortably|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we say " tempête sous un crâne"|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne will not be so pleased when he may make slam|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|3for3: i thought the idea was to try to lead our 5 card suits, not theirs :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||
nt|kit: also giving the opponents headaches|pg||
nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer just trying to set up long heart for tenth trick -- no risk involved|pg||
nt|rimbus: a great choice, for sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: on the other hand, he is threatened with long @cs|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  the duck (quack-quack) doubleton is not an endearing feature|pg||
nt|3for3: helgemo knows he is making this.  martel not so sure|pg||
nt|3for3: this would be a good hand for the rubber bridge variation, no overtricks.  |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bigtrain: back finally|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: i think his choice might be different vs 1NT 3NT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rimbus: will he play a SMLA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: when AJxx is very low on the opening leads quality scale|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: quack is shorthand for queen-jack|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: the late and great Edgar Kaplan said takeout Xs are meant to be taken out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Just 1 for me"|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rimbus: i meant a SMALL heart ?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|xenya: so it looks like 3 off|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

mb|1S|nt|xenya: is E worth 2@H here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: yes, sorry, i was trying to read their alert sheet|pg||
nt|phil: the question is will NS compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne could bid 2@s or something with a 2 loser hand & @s void, & of couse S need not have passed with that hand|pg||
nt|barnets: opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: if Fleisher has @d's, great|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 2@S as West|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3rd seat & @h suit are generally more suitable to a preemtive bid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: but if Fleisher is balanced selling out  looks better - maybe even x'd|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand was yucky for any choice of bids|pg||
nt|ritong: with their microNT, they need a good scrambling system|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a pretty bad spot compared to 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfv: "Spades were so good, I'll try it again"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C on 42 with diamond lead in open room|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: prudent fold by tor|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@HX down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: gold medal to passing 4@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||

pc|sK|pg||

nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|reisig: @h K now -- seems OK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Guess he's thinking about whether there's any way to make it if hearts aren't 3-2?|pg||

nt|reisig: Went down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: I"m sorry - I knew I didn't see his pitch on the spade K and I thought it was a club, but it must have been a diamond and now he's leading a club and Sontag ruffed with the 8 and ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: he overruffed with the 9 and then led the @s J and ruffed with the 6 of trumps and claimed making 4|pg||

nt|3for3: he got it right though, well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia said he was playing helgemo for the k|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that always seems to happen|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the problem with passing W hand, should have opened & got it off his chest|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a hair raising experience|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: also depends if they open 1@C with 5-5 blacks or 1@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: how often have we held a good hand, only to have partner preempt. then we dont know what to bid cos only singleton in p's suit|pg||
nt|phil: no dull hands here :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like correct bid is pass :)|pg||
nt|cc469: Zia met the challenge with flying colours :)|pg||
nt|rimbus: Helness just lost one @d and... the 3 of @s !|pg||
nt|ritong: swing coming|pg||
nt|ritong: @c slam for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: not that it is a great spot, but difficult to avoid it|pg||
nt|rimbus: or no trump ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS seem to be contributing a lot too|pg||
nt|psyck: 65 is probably a 1@s opening even for those opening 1@c with 55 like NS do|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|grebrof: its not that a preempt like that has to be leaddirecting|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry our internet died and the access code didn't work. we lost 59 and losing 60 since i just returned.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by val?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we lost internet. these are approximation. i think contract is right though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: because val is declarer right now.|pg||
nt|ritong: this won t take ages|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: always 11 regardless of @dQ|pg||
nt|phil: but they had an 1100 for the taking in 5@c|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards over really quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s seem to always ask for it|pg||
nt|rimbus: in NT you cannot try a double finesse in @d, missing the 7 !|pg||
nt|ritong: now zim might dislike @h KJx|pg||
nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||
nt|ritong: at worst K10x|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|phil: a treatment I like, but have not implemented over 4@c: |pg||
nt|phil: 4@s and 4@h are FORCING|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d is a puppet to a signoff in either|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only making four?|pg||
nt|mayors:  450?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: corrected|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: insta-claim|pg||

nt|ritong: none|pg||
nt|ritong: but brigidda is awake|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfv: some of jill meyers discards were wrong|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: scores are correct but not the play/bidding obviously :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfv: those who really want to have commentary, try to go to new bbo version at www.bridgebase.com . there is audio commentary there|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: Seamon "I practice those all the time"|pg||
nt|ritong: some relaxation after the stressing slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu:  and the defense didnt take so many :)|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|kit: West might have bid some clubs there -- would have made things even more exciting|pg||
nt|phil: EW play weak NT's? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not without an overbidder's lisence, hard to get in PA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||

nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 4@S should be the fits that weren't good enough to raise directly |pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as always, Pepsi as dummy opens a thick book in Polish|pg||

pc|hA|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||

pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||

nt|fabsayc: maybe it confused zimmerman also|pg||
nt|ritong: not good for multon's stomach ulcer, this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher threw a card in anger, so that may have hinted at zimmermann that it was down|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||

nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might get to game in the other room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Helgemo has to keep @D5|pg||

nt|phil: I don't think 3@h was getting hurt too badly|pg||
nt|psyck: yes this will not trouble him|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a made slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play mixed raise here rather than weak'|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: or 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: well done e/w|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: both tables responded 1N   thought Berk-Sonty might play 1@S-3@S preempt|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||

mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfv: ty ty see all later|pg||
nt|grebrof: its just as good as 4@s - choice of slam with a void - I have everything|pg||
nt|psyck: is that the strongest bid ever made?|pg||
nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe this will scare off a double|pg||

nt|ritong: my guess is he will duplicate rosenberg's line|pg||
nt|phil: some perceptive commentators tell me 7N makes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: multon asks if double is 100% penalty, fleisher, does an air "knock-on-wood"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play continues with semi-finals tomorrow at 7am PST, 10am east coast|pg||
nt|barnets: another miserable slam here not worth watching I am afraid|pg||
