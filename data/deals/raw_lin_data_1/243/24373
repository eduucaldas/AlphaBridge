mb|2N|nt|gsper:  Ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|gsper:  Many pairs do not use 2NT for minors on this kind of medium strength hand|pg||
nt|1can1:  true, I prefer to show my distribution and work the rest out later|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|1can1:  Not sure what West is doing here, but North should be thinking of doubling if that is indeed his actual bid|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He'll play HA, and a H|pg||

nt|hackenbush: Lee takes his time. In the last World University Bridge Championship, he took 10 minutes for a play decision in a slam|pg||

nt|malipivo:  What a nice slam morning we are having!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Welcome to all the newcomers!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: curious bidding at the other table, where North cue-bid six diamonds, got six spades from partner and bid seven anyway|pg||
nt|malipivo:  good morning|pg||
nt|dburn: but it makes sense - since partner did not bid six hearts, maybe everything he had was in clubs|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Please see the ongoing results for all three series here:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/TaiCang.12/microSite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|malipivo:  England currently standing 3rd, Poland currently standing 4th. We are watching Youngsters.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not going to be so easy for England after North opened with an artificial bid instead of a natural one|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is not risking and passes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not that I blame him|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We see 6 fast winners and some will be done for the 7th.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *work|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 6 card suits in 1NT so it always pleases me when it gets punished|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse is possible in clubs, but there is not enough transportation.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|keylime:  I always have a good feeling when after pard opens a 1 bid, I have possibly more points than them. There's a certain comfort that goes with it.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
nt|malipivo:  West didn't buy it and didn't cover with queen.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe it should have done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  fast winner counting: 1-2 hearts, 6 diamonds and two 2 ruffs|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|keylime:  And the T too. Both prime cards here.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|h6|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|johnjones:  He'll be happy to not lose a trump trick though.|pg||
nt|keylime:  16 board segments for the Youth Teams in the RR.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  without a D lead it will make 5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is hard to get East on trump endplay.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1NT overcall very agressive here with just 14hcp, no real suit and only Qxx in @h |pg||
pc|hK|nt|keylime:  Playing under Cat 3 of the WBF regs, so no Brown Stickers or HUMs (Highly Unusual Methods).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: Poland clearly have a game plan - overcall 4@d on every hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|hackenbush: treacherous 4@h here|pg||

mb|2S|nt|malipivo:  5@s might be on as double finessing in clubs is working|pg||
mb|p|nt|keylime:  They got an overtrick there so tied after 5. This room is two boards behind now; how much time are they allocated - 8.5 min/board?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: SRY,the network is too poor.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 8 imps for israel on bd 5 as 2@c went 3 off|pg||

nt|malipivo:  any voters for slam?|pg||

nt|malipivo:  This would be a risky one, but we may expect to see it at some tables.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|uni_dennis: in the open room padon made a take-out dbl over 3@d lifting NS to 4@d, but that was still an easy make|pg||
pc|d7|nt|malipivo:  On this deal a low heart from West to @hT is working.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  A diamond lead wouldn't be nice as it also kills one transport to West hand.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Another sensible decision by North this time.  The H values aren't working, so he stayed off a direct raise.|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So nice bids here|pg||
nt|keylime:  Their teammates going two off red in the other room, makes this important to make +140 to cover some of the loss.|pg||
nt|keylime:  In the other room, South overcalled a strong NT with a multi 2@d overcall, which drove W/E into 3NT.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The other room was down 2 in 3NT, which definately doesn't get the "sensible" award, although Multi is tough to deal with|pg||
nt|keylime:  Ten tricks are available here for South. The heart will jettison a club and the K@s is in the slot.|pg||
nt|keylime:  I suspect that N/S in the other room maybe playing Multi-Landy or something similar.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|johnjones:  For American  (ACBL) spectators, there is no written defense allowed in this competition|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  South might bid 4@d, just to say he is having support, leading from KJT is not easy.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|keylime:  That's right, so unlike here in the US, where certain items played permit the opponents of that treatment to have written defenses, on site it is all in the brain.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|keylime:  There was a hand a few years ago, if memory serves Freeman-Nickwell were defending against the Multi 2@d opening. They had 15 pages (!) of notes for the Multi they were allowed to use to get to an excellent slam.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h9|pc|dQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|malipivo:  From our perspective it is easy to see everything.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: It helps when you have everything in writing. Pathetic|pg||
nt|keylime:  And Roland, in our mid-chart events, we can play any defense over 1NT, without any disclosed defenses.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The ACBL is ridiculous in its treatment of Multi defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Outside the US you have to remember stuff. We call bridge a mind game|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|malipivo:  and thank you to the vugraph operators, you are doing an excellent job!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  well, the other room is down in 3NT|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Summary of the first half in this match:|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  We have a football score.  6-3 one field goal to two field goals.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The symmetry in North-South hand is killing all the possibilities.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: helmich not interested with this hand of course|pg||
mb|2S|nt|johnjones:  A quick down 1|pg||
nt|dburn: here, you would like it if North had a real negative available|pg||
mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  Dbl showed 4+@s and 1@s showed 2-3 @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In a balanced 11-13?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  NS opens all bal hand 12-14/18-19 with 1@c and then play trf and relays after that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Micke is usually North and Ida South, right Johan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room in 4@h, but I am afraid it is going down.|pg||
nt|dburn: but 4@c is... well, it is not clear that it is even a cue bid|pg||
nt|malipivo:  South is just happy he is having strong hand, who wouldn't be? |pg||
nt|dburn: and even if it is, Huber should not be looking at a slam|pg||
nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 5@d doomed on a @s lead|pg||
nt|malipivo:  3-imp difference, 16-14 in favor of Argentina|pg||
pc|dT|nt|malipivo:  aj aj|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gronkvist:  studying 17 and 19 y brother and sister ;)|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wants to raise to 4@h no one would crime him, but 4@c shows clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|dburn: and Illingworth has raised those "clubs", as well he should|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East in Open Room leads @sK.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: other room 1@d pass 4@h !! by van Lankveld, all pass|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|dburn: East in Closed Room may be of the same mind|pg||
pc|s4|nt|malipivo:  3 imps for Poland waveing.|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Overtaking?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defense is cooperating, even low and a spade return works for time being.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or overtaking and a spade return with overruffing potential.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *diamond return|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But club return is also a nice option. :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Much|pg||
nt|keylime:  Can North in the relays ask for controls?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the mirrored cards in @s are horrible for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South might not do all that much battling|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We see fast four losers (@s, @h! 2x@c).|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|dburn: but South might well have led a trump, not a spade|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse in spades is being slowly developed.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c4|nt|johnjones:  6C makes on the actual layout, but declarer would find a trump lead nasty.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: now hop will make this|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 9 4@h -1, so another push|pg||

pc|c5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|keylime:  2@d would be fourth suit forcing.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
pc|h2|nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|johnjones:  best lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is an overbid, 1 is enough|pg||
pc|dA|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
nt|malipivo:  @sJxx is providing a safety trick for declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||

pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  5@d-all pass, so a likely push and a missed opportunity for both teams.|pg||

pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||
