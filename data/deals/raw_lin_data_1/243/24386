mb|p|nt|hackenbush: I'm sure Roger didn't keep a spade loser|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kit: since down 1, clearly he kept the club winner|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: Not clear what South should rebid, but all roads will lead to 4@H|pg||
nt|muppe: and EW: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012YouthChampionships/Systems/Juniors/USAJuniors/lee-rajkumar.pdf|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Declarer will need a friendly red suit lead to have a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  roger has a tough hand to lead from|pg||
nt|agumperz:  any lead is risky and the diamonds have been concealed in the auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Even on a diamond lead I don't think it will make|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|agumperz:  have to guess hearts|pg||
nt|kit: But if declarer reads the lead, he can cross to king of hearts and lead diamond from dummy|pg||
nt|kit: And that will get him 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: but if declarer plays ace of diamonds now, he is down|pg||
nt|kit: Best play might be to play a spade first to cut defensive communication|pg||
nt|agumperz:  if they play 3/5 leads, it may not be too hard to read the lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hackenbush: would be wrong if lead is stiff with trumps 2-2, though then West would have 10 cards in the black suits|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|kit: It looks like he is following that line -- cashing ace of clubs first to make it more difficult for opponents -- nice play|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|nt|kit: Playing the spade first prevented East from getting in with ace of spades and leading the second round of hearts through|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|kit: oh noooo|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: It looked like he was doing so well|pg||
nt|hackenbush: now needs to guess trumps|pg||
nt|kit: He can still survive though, |pg||
nt|agumperz:  3 IMPs to USA 1 on bd 1, I am informed|pg||
nt|kit: And he should -- if West has a doubleton heart, a heart lead now would defeat the contract|pg||
nt|kit: So when East doesn't lead a heart, there is a reason|pg||
nt|kit: East has to know the whole hand by now|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Thus, East can be assumed to have started with 3 hearts, and odds are he has the queen|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: Any black suit play by West hands declarer the contract, so he will continue diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: and now the test|pg||
nt|3for3: :)|pg||
nt|3for3: oops, sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has to work out the inference that East could always have defeated the contract with a trump return if the hearts were 2-2|pg||
nt|kit: after ruffing the ace of diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|kit: looks like he is going right|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: E-W have a nice grand in diamonds here -- let's see how good their methods are|pg||
mb|2D|nt|agumperz:  its nice when u hold a strong club opener and your partner opens 1@C in fromt of you!|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kit: There will be some nervous moments in 7@D when both major suits split badly, but the last ditch club finesse will make it.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|agumperz:  Kit wd u have acted with the North hand over 1@C?|pg||
nt|kit: sure, why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  you heard it here ladies and gentlemen :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  so 1@s or 2@S?|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S is a bit much -- not so much danger of going for a number there, but the third opponent might bid too many spades.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  right. CHO needs to be handled.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: North has gone for 1400 in 1@s at the other table|pg||
nt|kit: so if they get to 6@D making 7 it will just be a routine push|pg||
nt|agumperz:  declarer did well to scramble 1 trick :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  well if the grand slam is bid, -1400 will be a bargain|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kit: 4@H may be RKC here|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: looks like it from 5@C response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: proper response would be 5@D -- so they may have had a mixup|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they're a new partnership. I recall they just started talking about their system near the end of the Philadelphia NABC|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly East thought it was RKC, as otherwise he wouldn't have quit so soon|pg||

pc|d2|nt|agumperz:  I have been asked if I know anything about these players. Other than Roger Lee, unfortunately I do not.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|kit: defense has to get to work on a black suit, else declarer will have 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 spade|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|agumperz:  For those who don't know Roger, he is one of the finest young players in the country|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|nt|agumperz:  He played on the Hinze team in the Spingold|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: Now spade shift is necessary -- clbu shift is too late|pg||
nt|agumperz:  which created some stir with an upset of the  23 seed I believe...|pg||
nt|kit: East discarded encouraging in spades, so West has the info he needs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  Raghu Rajkumar recently finished 3rd in the Fast Pairs|pg||
nt|agumperz:  The Wang's I do not know, but apparently one attends Stanford|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: I guess he can shift to a club also -- but not this.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: hmm -- didn't unblock queen of hearts.  Now spade shift might still work.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: for profile on USA1, see http://www.acbl.org/nabc/2012/01/bulletins/db6.pdf, page 11|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|kit: if declarer wins ace, defense gets 2 spade tricks|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|agumperz:  zizhuo wang just graduated from stanford with a PhD in operations research... will be teaching in Minnesota next year; he is a Chinese citizen, originally from Beijing. His partner Jimmy is a studet at UPenn|pg||
nt|kit: And now, locked out of spades and hearts|pg||
nt|agumperz:  with thx to Sam Lichtenstein for the information|pg||
nt|hackenbush: USA2 profile: page 10 of http://www.acbl.org/nabc/2012/01/bulletins/db7.pdf|pg||

mb|r|nt|kit: This is probably a 1-suited runout|pg||
nt|kit: If West passes, then we know that it is :)|pg||
nt|agumperz:  roger will be happy to be out of this auction|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kit: I don't agree -- West has to bid his hand now while he can at the 2-level|pg||
mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: they may have had a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so|pg||
nt|kit: East simply has a very good hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|kit: Well done to get to a decent contract|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: However, there are serious entry problems -- but the opponents will have to play something after taking the first 2 heart tricks.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|agumperz:  NS were making 2@H, so 3@C down 1 is a decent result from their POV.|pg||
nt|kit: who says they are going down?|pg||
nt|kit: This is North's best shift|pg||
nt|agumperz:  true, they might make.|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer finesses it loses, but 10 of clubs comes down so 9 of clubs is entry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kit: Then must take spade finesse first, since if he takes diamond finesses he can get locked in dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: this unfortunately is not the right idea|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|hackenbush: if he had to guess spades later he'd probably get it right. After South shows up with @hA and @cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|hackenbush: 1nt 13-16|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|kit: It seems to me that if he is going to play for the queen of clubs onside, he should have just taken the finesse right away|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kit: If he thought queen of clubs off, then just play AK and a club|pg||
mc|8|nt|kit: But guaranteeing losing 2 spade tricks doesn't make sense|pg||
