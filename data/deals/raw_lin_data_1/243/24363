nt|malipivo:  So spade finesse is almost certain thing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is playing 2@s, so a great opportunity to get imps for Poland.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As we can see, spades are 2-2, so third diamond is going away on ruffing.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If you are writing a textbook about pretty deals, this is one of them.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East-West cannot take their chances in diamonds, it would be costly.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I almost feel the fear of bidding it, but it is understandable.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If Polish girls are thinking of medal, they have to take some risk.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Would we double 3@d, so it might be -1 for 100 and 2 imps to Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Wow!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And double heart finesse is on, so it might even make.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Hawaii in trumps is not nice for the declarer, to be honest.|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  The Jengs reinvent the Rule of 20 :)|pg||

mb|3S|nt|malipivo:  And MagdalÃ©na TichÃ¡ in offense!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: When both sides have a fit, low level Xs so rarely work, even at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And Czech fans are standing and waiting for big hit. :)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I would be very surprised if W gives up here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even small slam is a plus score for Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  7@s in cold heart, any voters?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching astonishing bridge!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I might just try Blackwood with W hand, not ideal, but then again, what is?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: PM me your suggestions, if I like it i'll post it!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, it would work perfectly.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Gotten a suggestion for a blast off to 6@S, thats possible, if there is a killing lead, harder for them to find.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I don't see a killing lead.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||

nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
nt|joecritter:  A second lie to make up for the first one?|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Ticha-Spangenberg played great in the last tournament.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were winning 70% in pairs for some time and winning it later.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: This is one of those hands we all wish we could tap them on the shoulder and just say "making 4, everything works" but we of course can't do that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Yes, not today.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is an edge deal, it means a lot.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: you almost can't go down, she doesn't know that however|pg||

nt|malipivo:  if it would be her desire|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I might wait, maybe a Discovery play, surely you will get to the board again|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: in the unlikely even A@D is doubleton, a @H pitch is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if she can go wrong.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't see how, even if you experiment in the other suits, you always have multiple entries|pg||
nt|malipivo:  She is afraid of hearts, I assume.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: defence was clever not to continue the heart attack|pg||

nt|MolvaM: @dQ nice play to catch a possible singleton @dJ with declarer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or a club to @cA and @sA to squeeze North|pg||
pc|d6|nt|malipivo:  it would be interesting to let @cJ win.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|malipivo:  She might have played a low club from North's hand.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: she has to now, @H is a 0% play|pg||
nt|malipivo:  nicely bluffed with @hT|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: @H works as they fall, but if 3-3 she was always making|pg||

nt|malipivo:  :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|MolvaM: last 2 hands, the defence slipped in the last few tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and a club attack from East|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarers could have gone down but the defence let the contracts thru|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  What a hand|pg||
nt|joecritter:  South passed this at the other table. I think Hakan just broke his partner's heart|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bridgegoth: Polish or precision @C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: good to remember that you must be alert until the last trick|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That makes the Club lead a lot easier to find|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Precision apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding is probably different than what we can see other room|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This can go down on perfect defense|pg||

mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  Does E now bid 6?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Does S now sacrifice in 5@D, giving them another chance to find slam?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|bridgegoth: looks like 300 if passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I expect... yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mlodygda83: 2@d is art relay 18+|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: usually with 3+@h, but he decided that it would be better to find out what partner has|pg||
mb|6C|nt|malipivo:  5@d|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: 3@d I think 4@h 5@d and maksimum which is 10-11 with passed hand|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Does S sacrifice again?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  This is like the end of a batman episode.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  More like a soap opera, with all of the plot twists|pg||

mb|p|nt|mlodygda83: he has only 9, but this hand looks like 10-11 for me|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 6 NT?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: just ask for the keycards now no?|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: 4@h cue bid, now blackwood and some slam|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: it will be hard to play 6@c now, so he will probably decide to 6nt|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a grand if partner has spade ace and @dKQxxx|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: 6@c might be better if partner does not have @d J and @d 4-1|pg||
nt|henryb:  41-2|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Making the score 80-8. Is that a blitz?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  That's going to translate to quite a few VP's|pg||
nt|henryb:  Yes. 25-5 starts at 43 imps, I believe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  and a heart|pg||
