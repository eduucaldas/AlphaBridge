mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it will be very tough to bid this slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 3@D say anything about @S length?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: although there is an inference that it is <3 since a shapely hand with 3 has offer tracks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes on second look a @S lead will beat slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary via  browser login OR  without login via [bookmark this]  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|ritong: needs Xray specs with@c AK though|pg||
nt|ritong: but perhaps fantoni has them on|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: seems like a squeeze vs S is possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|barnets: no sure spade lead beats slam|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure|pg||
nt|bigtrain: after they cash 1 @C squeeze works|pg||
nt|barnets: east runs his trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: but on an initial @S lead it doesnt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: im talking myself into believing it always makes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Nunes asking what 4@H would have been over 3@D -- answer RKC|pg||
mb|6D|nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: ok  so now, fantoni has a lot of informations|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: agreement by all the 4@H was slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zimmermann also thinking over 3N rebid in other room|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D says nothing about suit solidity|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows dummy has @c shortage|pg||
nt|ritong: and at least a trump|pg||
nt|ritong: 5521 or 6511|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|barnets: now dec can set up long heart in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: so he carefully avoids a top @c lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|rimbus: nice effort|pg||
nt|barnets: by ruffing and using @SA as entry|pg||
nt|psyck: @s lead would have been more interesting, but South cannot guard rounded suits|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ritong: i think @s lead does not beat it anyways|pg||
nt|ritong: for the reason CK just mentioned|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say dec cashes 7 diamonds|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: south keeps the @CA and 4 hearts|pg||

nt|xenya: Here we go|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: Hello!|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzfv: Welcome back everyone. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi ken  hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: to the 2nd segment of Cayne-Zimmermann|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Just what s wanted to hear.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
mb|3H|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: how guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi guys|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting hand to start the set here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|reisig: Nice to start w a nothing hand :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only lead to set 6D here would be a spade lead from 2 small|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  on spade lead, if declarer ducks queen clubs, Katz must play heart to break up squeeze|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but then again, he can then cash 3 hearts, ruff to hand and ruff club|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very fortunate layout for the declarer here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with one hand holding the AK clubs and the 4th heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@d is cold isnt it?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  and the hearts splitting 43|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: on @s lead you play @c|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  so yes slam is "cold"  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and south must play back both a heart to break up squeeze and a trump to stop ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  right; he only gets to lead once a trick :(|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tough decision here for zimmerman|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW system: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|barnets: no lead gives dec any problems|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Welcome back all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  huge pickup in other oom by meckwell|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  room|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|barnets: in open room north passed south opened 2@H and it went all pass|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|s8|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nice quiet board to start|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|barnets: this resulted in a surprising swing to Monaco right off the bat|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, not sure if there are comentators|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H natursl GF|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: West had a good 17 points but elected not to bid|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
nt|warrens:  once S won the K of @Cs (the normal play), it seemed likely that Levin would guess the @S's correctly|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That whirring noise you hear is Harold Berlin spinning in his grave.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||
pc|s5|nt|leo lasota:  +920, -490 for Nickell team = win 10 imps|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|reisig: 490|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: same contract in open room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  back to 5 imp difference|pg||
pc|s6|nt|barnets: 2@H|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, there's an inference when North doesn't lead a @S that he might have the Ace.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again, ken|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Harold was a fanatic about "Never lead dummy's long suit!"|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@H will drift down a few|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|barnets: perhaps Nickell hoped his partner would reopen|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  South should just concede now :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|barnets: but that seemed unlikely taking into account his strenght|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cK|mc|12|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Monaco|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there we go|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  precision 2C opener in other room for Meckwell here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT trumpQ +1 king|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|an|forcing|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pass-pass-dbl-pass-2S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|d|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6@C should be gran slam interest asking about @C holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting lead prob for West, but jack clubs seems right on auction|pg||
nt|reisig: May just bid 3@c|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  N's double shows @D's and @H tolerance, so it's easy for Berkowitz to bid 3@D vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: closed room lineup is the same as the 2nd session|pg||
nt|warrens:  this can't be beaten if declarer reads the cards right.  has to hold up once in @H's and finesse the @C 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
nt|kit: difficult opening lead for Levin here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4th from longest and strongest works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky heart split for declarer gives him a chance to make|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3343 shape argues against bidding 3C; and he is still not sure how much the other way may make|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin will likely do just that Warren|pg||
nt|kit: He found the winning lead -- now declarer will have to guess which finesse to take for  8|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  switch the king clubs in dummy with a working card in the majors and 4 major may be cold|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy has 3 discs to make 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|barnets: dec will then KO @DA cash a black AK and uess his finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: guess|pg||
nt|barnets: his finesse|pg||
nt|kit: Note the play of the 9 of hearts -- Now Levin is afraid that declarer started with 109xx|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||
nt|ritong: when this will go down 2 effortless|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher should view this as a +5 or a +8 plus position|pg||
nt|phil: hi |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3 rounds hearts here to get count on hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Phil|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: of course Weinstein has a problem exiting -- he may be afraid that a diamond shift will guess the diamonds for declarer|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|barnets: but a spade is safe|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|leo lasota:  ruff exit 3rd heart works as well|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  reopeated endplays by Katz here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: NS in 1N next door -- going 1 off|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, something went weird and they went x, -1 instead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|barnets: as it turns out|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done by katz|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hasnt made it yet|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if zimmerman shows all those HCP, Multon is marked king spade|pg||
nt|reisig: He'll get the @s right|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  win ace cash heart then low diamond only losing option presented|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  likely 4 imps for Nickell here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  unless Zimmerman gives the losing option and Katz falls for it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: if he makes its 5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  160 is 4..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: indeed it is but the difference will be 210|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  oops vul of course :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||
nt|phil: well, its not like -2 is a great possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: so i presume south overcalled|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but now declarer will be able to take the spade finesse safely, and when it loses he can still fall back on the club guess|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A slight hint that n has the @c q as if he were xxx in both suits he might have exited a @c.  Very slight.|pg||
nt|barnets: so a great shift if South had Qx spade giving dec a losing option|pg||
nt|barnets: were he originally to cash the @SAK before taking club fin|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ok no losing opeiton|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tie match|pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  I think Levin will cash all the @S's to get a better count.  in the end he'll finesse|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  With Berk marked with just the KQ hearts and jack clubs thusfar, Levin will know that the only other HCP are the Q diamonds; Berk has overcalled and taken free 3D bid; therefore he will play for 55 shape in Berk's hand rather than 1543|pg||
pc|d7|nt|reisig: Any bets?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: The 10 of spades shift might convince declarer that North has 109x, and he may try the spade finesse unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|barnets: as he was planning to do|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|dT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond pitch then diamon|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|sK|pc|h7|pg||

nt|phil: *gave|pg||
nt|ritong: guess multon will opt for 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|r|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
nt|reisig: This looks like 4@s X|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Funny comment by Levin there... Not sure if any bridge player could ever play too fast for Sontag :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4 imps fo Nickell when thy made 3@D in othe room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  64 bid more..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: even 3NT makes on this layout ;)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  playing strength wotrth 3S call|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
nt|warrens:  this might go down 800 if the defense stays off of @C's|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  500 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does Nickell give a raise?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  queen diamonds value is sketchy at best|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin concerned about possibly missing vul slam here if he passes|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@d seems kinda "normal"|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@C bid is somewhat conservative as Levin doesn't need much to make a game.|pg||
nt|barnets: but unsuccessfull|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will correct 34|pg||
nt|reisig: @c will NOT be led|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  But in the end, he makes good decision to pass and take the plus score|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Weinstein will high low in trump here, to show his @H king |pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT also reasonable, and also unsuccessful|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  good result in other room by Meckwell escaping for 200|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  5D down 1 is certainly better for N/S than 3nt down 5|pg||
nt|reisig: So - 1 IMP|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  -1 or a push|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Well, somebody can make 3NT ...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  I believe this will be a push now|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Zimmerman may be thinking of layouts to set 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  and therefore may switch to heart whwne in with club rather than trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: katz is asking about his opponents methods|pg||
pc|c4|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to admit i would have accepted the invite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and would have been wrong on this hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or Multon may win club and lead jack hearts for same reason (try to set 2)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +800 for E/W here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Having bid 1NT - I's avoid bidding 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bigtrain: 15-17 as far as i know|pg||
nt|warrens:  he wants his partner to know it's safe to shift to @H's from the King|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, went for 800 at the other table.  likely same thing here.|pg||
nt|barnets: who said no double bo trouble|pg||
nt|barnets: no trouble|pg||
nt|kit: Give West the ace of hearts, and 3NT is the winner.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but N is way better than 15|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
nt|reisig: 800 as expected -  is a push |pg||
pc|s7|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
nt|reisig: Would E bid 3@h with no @h ace?|pg||
nt|kit: Heart shift will be trivial to find, and Weinstein will go up king as only chance to make|pg||
nt|barnets: he rates to have the @HA yes |pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K&R = 16.55|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spot cards are huge here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes little more than the @DQ onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Rodwell almost ready to play...|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer might play @Cs now, hoping for Hx in East|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|leo lasota:  Multon gets it right and plays the trump for 1 imp gain; well done|pg||
pc|cK|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
nt|warrens:  that was his only entry to dummy, so he had to try right away|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|s6|nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||
nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|sT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: it is clear for him that declarer would never find the @hs by himself|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 5@D is a better contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: 51D in the open |pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D will be a swing t Monaco|pg||
nt|barnets: of 5 imps|pg||
nt|kit: not a big swing though|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ritong: so his lead was not as neutral as it looked|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|barnets: so he followed the pecentage|pg||

mb|3D|nt|barnets: to lead @CJ|pg||
nt|psyck: he was prepared to play low during the bidding itself|pg||
nt|reisig: Law???|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  matter of partnership agreement whether or not to preempt 3D at red all with just the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann did a thumbs down to katz to describe his pre-empt|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control ask|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ controls|pg||

pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
nt|reisig: Does 87xx in @s qualify as a suit?|pg||
nt|kit: Helness will be thinking about slam, having opened 1@S on a hand he might have opened 2@c|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||

pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
nt|barnets: he didnt think for too long and made a simple bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick 650 on that lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  down on a @C lead, since the defense can get 3 trump tricks|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz will win diamond ace play spade for making 3|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play prob here|pg||
nt|warrens:  and a @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4 = RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 2 w/o Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but since Sontag holds the key 9 spades, the defense prevails|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5! asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: shows grand interest so meck will force the issue with "solid" clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7@C as choice maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||

nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||

nt|barnets: even had west held the @SJ slam was terrible|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|bigtrain: obviously 7@H is the better theorical contract but 7NT will suceed|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Disa is very very fast. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: that hand wont come up again this year, are they discussing meaning of 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helgemo: counting to thirteen is too tough|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a surprise from dec|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
nt|kit: Even the best players get careless and sometimes don't pay proper attention to discards|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural NF|pg||
mb|1N|nt|reisig: 6@h is OK?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz HCP are all slow|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  which implies pass of 1nt may be best|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  however|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@H as the @C Ace is onside for a @S pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
nt|bigtrain: east's pass is almost always exactly a doubleton n support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  W is showing a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|reisig: another "wonderful" X :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  double by Spntag greatly improves slam prospects|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will just tell everyone that weinstein kept a heart and declarer rightfully cashed ace to not risk contract :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there is some merit to the argument that you pass 1nt on 5332 hands with 9-10 HCP and rebid your 5 card suit on 5-8|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  so 5233 aceless 8 count is a borderline choice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
nt|reisig: Have to worry abt partner w 1@s too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  additionally, the double allows extra bidding space for levin/weinstein|pg||
nt|warrens:  the X tells East the Ace is onside and also gives E/W extra room|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised, as is one of the voice commentators, that W bid 4@H and not 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: Me too!|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass of 4@c X = maybe slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  everyone is surprised, but perhaps they have a different understanding of Levin's 4H call than we expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag leaves table...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: after asking Weinstein if he'll be a while|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..but in my bidding 4@h = no void in @c and no @d cue|pg||
nt|warrens:  exact same start at the other table, but West bid 4@D, not 4@H, after the X-p-p|pg||
nt|reisig: That's what I'd do|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Since Levin had 3 choices at or below game here... redbl, 4D, & 4H, I am sure they have agreements that we are unaware of|pg||
nt|reisig: Wanna bet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Weinstein alone at the table now as Levin and Berkowitz chat on the other side of the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Betting is out Rich... casino night was already held at the nationals :)|pg||
nt|kit: I think this 3@S call should show 6, so Helness should have no problem raising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: tempo wasnt as shown|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 losers at first glance|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
nt|ritong: unkind @d|pg||
nt|reisig: No problem making this one|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ritong: i think franck is realizing just now that a @c might have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvonunda yaptýgý tam ipnelik bu 2 oldu bana|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low diamond exit?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine East won 8 of clubs on 3rd round, continues hearts, and goes down some|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|leo lasota:  diamond exit creates problem for declarer here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only up to 6 so far|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  win diamond in hand, then diasmond to king|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 spades, then run 10 hearts into east|pg||
nt|reisig: Can even play low @h from hand :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low diamond by Multon would have been better|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not if partner held 83 instead of 93|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer exits low heart, defense wins queen and plays another diamond|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: but, surprisingly enough, the trump layout was such that his @h6 was a big card|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: i cant see the club 3 in disa's hand. odd|pg||
nt|phil: 800|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he has analyzed that in a flash  i know he s extremely fast minded|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  low heart to queen|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: lots of laughter at the table after it|pg||
nt|grebrof: Martel and Helness are getting old|pg||
nt|kit: Martel will likely bid 3@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is mixed so must use the single raise here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ritong: if so, the hand is borderline|pg||
nt|ritong: strict minimum for a constructive raise imho|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny asked molson what X means. molson shrugged and pointed at the 3D |pg||
nt|bigtrain: its an offensive type hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kit: Effective -- E-W haven't found the heart fit.|pg||

nt|grebrof: not now thou|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how about spade ace, diamond to queen, spade king and diamonds (in your dreams)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H lead directing with diamond fit, a treatment possible by a passed hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3S is the limit of the hand here|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  this one is worse :)|pg||
nt|kit: Levin has adequate heart support to raise, but he decided his hand was too weak|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 spades lead works wonders here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade lead is actually very reasonable with Katz hand|pg||
nt|reisig: Poor choices for a lead|pg||
nt|reisig: So - @s might be best|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: West might have tried 5@D, leaving it to Zia to find a low club lead!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  that is my lead too|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  even not seeiing all the hands :)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it could be something else on this auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin passed the 2C as he had nothing extra in terms of HCP, now Weinstein balances with his 5 card diamond suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N by east makes if south leads a heart to the ace|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|fabsayc: it does but i dont know many who deliberately avoid leading a suit for that reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I believe Henry Bethe is providing it at this table, and he's the new USA bridge federation chairman :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes Henry on vugraph, and my questions are directed to him|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, only the head of the tournament conditions committee|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  therefore, 3 or 4 clubs|pg||
pc|s9|nt|leo lasota:  well done by weinstein|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  but that is way against the odds|pg||
nt|reisig: Could he think Nickell has @h and 2@c left?|pg||

nt|psyck: Helness just wanted to live up to his earlier comment that he was making all the mistakes|pg||
nt|barnets: Ihe had 7 I looked away and now hes down |pg||
nt|barnets: most unusual|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt is likely going down here with the diamonds 41 and spade king off|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|3for3: 'standard' off shape nt by zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Director says both tables are too slow|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice job setting 4S in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: missing two keys|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: for the @h slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: oh you mean if they try for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think 3@d can include three keys, anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so precisely the hand to bid slam on since sure to create a swing|pg||
nt|kit: Therefore, continuing diamonds can never be superior|pg||
nt|kit: Nice hand for 4-card overcall, and really strikes gold.|pg||
nt|reisig: Aceless - no so easy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tough to know from South's hand, but 500 available against 4S dbled|pg||
nt|kit: 5@H will make on likely spade lead, I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course the hand can also make 5H from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H looks a bit strange here?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfv: willard waved her x card to attract valerie's attention. it means 4 spades |pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what east is thinking about.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2nt invite-3nt accept|pg||
nt|kit: Levin can't like the thought of defending 4@S with a spade void|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt ideal contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not any more ? :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|barnets: I see he played the @s 10 at trick1 , his 7th winner|pg||
nt|warrens:  a pushy game try opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: bids by southwest will start to x perhaps if south bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: W in doubt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does Levin bid 5H if 5C is dbled?|pg||
nt|barnets: that interprets as West may X |pg||
mb|3D|nt|leo lasota:  2nt by west with Kx hearts, 3nt by East reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: levin asked molson to take some time. cos she wants to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson is like "going..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  "the whole hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  QJ doubleton downgrade for the hand but two 10's upgrade|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  excellent pass of 2nt by Berk|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfv: the program auto plays singletons, zia was thinking|pg||
nt|3for3: as he is entitled to, but at this point he doesnt know a whole lot|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting that Zia gave up on the legit chance of stiff king of clubs |pg||
nt|warrens:  I see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kit: North will bid 5@C (having already shown hearts), and now Levin will have to guess which suit to play.|pg||
nt|reisig: They may find 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but Zimmerman elects to rebid moth eaten 6 card diamond suit instead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt now all pass?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  huge decision here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfv: and there. she played. |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps 12 if seamon ducks the second @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  pretty good chances for 8|pg||
nt|kit: But only 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he plays spades I think he'll go down. losing 2 @S, 2@D and 2@C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight back on levin here...|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Levin run?|pg||
nt|kit: Big decision here|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w willbe delighted n/s bid as they will now go plus|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch saying better 1 bird in hand than 10 in air|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  oops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: East should perhaps have cashed the king of diamonds first -- now West has a problem.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @C lead would be a real killer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer decides to play spade here, 2nt is down; diamond here, 2nt is in|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  great decision by weinstein!|pg||
nt|reisig: Now 5@h?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes rich now 5H|pg||
nt|kit: Only if Levin bids 5@H -- but will he work that out?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein has announced that he has nothing in clubs|pg||
nt|cc469: why 5@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should have redoubled (assuming that is takeout) rather than show diamond support he doesn't have.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  therefore, Levin can expect decent hearts and should probably get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: Doubling the only contract you can beat - is often wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: club shift|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont make but 2@H was making|pg||
nt|psyck: strange defense|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual opening lead yes|pg||
nt|psyck: @hk would have been more standard|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer cannot affordably cash the hearts as this sets up Levin's extra heart|pg||
nt|kit: I think he had to play spades, since playing a diamond wouldn't tell him anything and he would still have to take the spade finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: This way he also gets Jx of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Kit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond lead from Katz hand stand out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: if so, perhaps zim will try to avoid the dangerous hand, though|pg||
nt|ritong: and miss the @cs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  jack diamond here obligatory false card|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or actually 10 may be better|pg||
pc|d2|nt|leo lasota:  or if he plays confident, levin may duck the king :)|pg||
nt|kit: At other table Meckwell got to 3NT .....|pg||
nt|kit: But it looks like they will make it!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  That is a common treatment in Europe: transfer doubles over 1-level overcalls rather than negative|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if you're forced to level getting there fast shows the worst hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, Meckstroth ran the 10 of @S at trick 2, so will make the game|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  outstanding |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ritong: but this move is even better|pg||
nt|ritong: bien joué, pierre|pg||
nt|ritong: it caters for @c Qxxx with south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: slow shows interest in bigger things|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nickell should work this out|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  consider that if Katz has 3 diamonds, hand not beatable|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  plus Katz would not likely lead the rebid diamond suit on 3 little|pg||
nt|reisig: Also - would never lead @d from 10xx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I think Helgemo's double of 5@C is clear -- he has no reason to expect the opponents have a place to run when they chose clubs with their eyes open.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Very well deserved score for N/S|pg||
nt|barnets: looks down 1 |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Easy 11 tricks |pg||
nt|barnets: not on that lead though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|leo lasota:  too bad|pg||

pc|s2|nt|barnets: try a spade lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|kit: This lead doesn't hurt declarer.  And on a spade lead he would have the entries to ruff 2 spades and score 6 trump tricks and 5 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|baskanb: battýk|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  exactly as kit says|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure thats right kit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Qx hearts onside allowed for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|reisig: Even I can make this now :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|baskanb: sry|pg||
nt|luffe12:  to lead from 3 in rebid suit - strange...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2 straight costly mistakes by Nickell|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: I could be wrong, but I think only a diamond lead would defeat 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: katz asks for a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: back in a bit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very tough to overcome double digit mistakes against team Monaco|pg||

mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: 1@H has lots going for it|pg||
nt|ritong: which do not completely match standard treatments|pg||
nt|kit: old fashioned defesne -- cover an honor, win the queen with the king.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they started 2@S 3@S (hearts and a minor) in open room, which is much tougher|pg||
nt|reisig: Based on the last 2 hands - he may bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they seem to have had a misunderstanding, ending in 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne does not like his partners or teammates to make tight Xs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  Momentum at this table certainly on the side of Levin/Weinstein with 2 good results in a row|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  expect lead to grow for nickell with board 7|pg||

nt|barnets: which was down |pg||

nt|psyck: 3N & 4@s make as cards are, this is better|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  to encourage incorrect club continuation by Weinstein|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  60 imps with 11 to score. The lead is very big but not yet insurmountable|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  nice small diamond shift by katz|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  although from honor 97x(x)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: establishing @c tricks for partner looks better to me|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  switching to the 9 is a consideration|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club switch would have jsut led to 120|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzfv: rare for sponsor to play last segment. |pg||
nt|ritong: i will be suspected of bad faith, but here i perso play 2@c by west, basically good hand with no clear bid, and over the 90% of the time 2@d, 4@d showing void and @s fit|pg||
nt|ritong: when direct splinter is singleton|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Sontag's 7 clubs beating the 6 in Levin's hand could be critical as well|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  not sure why nickell discarded 8 clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  heart here creates further work|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, East pitched a heart earlier|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  outstanding defense by Katz|pg||
nt|reisig: Rule of thumb - play the card closest to your thumb|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  though personally i would exit 8 hearts not 6|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfv: lost play there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: but 9 tricks agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players are taking a break|pg||
nt|reisig: Commentators too :)|pg||
nt|barnets: tks Michael|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very common with 16 board quarters to take a break halfway through, so the table is taking a rest after board 8|pg||
nt|barnets: some of these players like to smoke|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe to calm the nerves|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 I think|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  And, in fact, at the other table the auction (on 7) started with 2@d by s and w had nothing to say over that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: but west has doubled 3@s on the second round of the bidding so EW may yet bid 4@s|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway on board 7 n/s playing only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They ended in 4@h by n.|pg||
nt|barnets: so only e few imps away|pg||
nt|reisig: 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|reisig: or 5 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They didn't play 3 rounds of @cs off the bat so they made 5 anyway and it's only 5 imps.|pg||

nt|reisig: even if - 1 IMP at a time :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nickell-katz will only play these 8 more boards|pg||

nt|ritong: pierre is trying to find a way to fill in his name, poor thing  forget about it, buddy  not a real problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry about the delay, players stepped out to the restroom|pg||
nt|bigtrain: LTT is much more then just number of trump... you always have to adjust things with bad trump breaks and minor honors in the opponents suits|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher whispered it to multon, hopefully i will catch it when kamil alerts it|pg||
nt|rimbus: OK sorry - just call me Rimbus !|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 4 imps fot Cayne when 2@S made 3 down here|pg||
nt|ritong: yes  bienvenue man|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: 2@S 5 spades and 4 card minor, popular in Europe in conjunction with multi 2@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think their card says sound weak 2's, but i'm unsure|pg||
nt|kit: This is transfer to 3NT I believe|pg||
nt|reisig: 3NT - not so easy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt has no play here; Levin has a hand that wants to get 3nt from partner to possibly protect Qx hearts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  Tand was an orange powdered drink invented for the Astronauts in the 60s|pg||
nt|kit: Martel is wondering where everybody is getting their bids from|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok bad guess by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just 8 boards left|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i love this bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: rosenberg is eyeing the 7@D sac|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real question is will he forcing pass if willenken sacs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but the effective defense takes away the mentality from E/W that they are in control at this table after 23, 24|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  22, 23|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: usually you doubt the player who is white vs red|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its not simplisitic...  there is always adjustments occurring|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfv: not sure what 3H means but jmeyers made a cutting her throat gesture|pg||
nt|kit: Since if West had passed, he probably would have tried 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a bad guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jxxxx @S popular overcall tonight|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: henry comment on 1@S nicely please|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 tricks after @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: This could be the third consecutive 2NT contract -- very rare|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: when jenny doubled, molson was like "drats!" (silently though only jenny could see)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness asks about the j@D lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: chip replies "may not be normal, but standard"|pg||
nt|ritong: other room did not find 7@s either|pg||
nt|barnets: that is an interesting bid asking partner to bid 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: I like the treatment|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 hearts lead very useful for weinstein|pg||
nt|kit: Puts overcaller on lead.  3@C is chosen for the bid (rather than 3@H), so partner of overcaller can't make (or not make) lead-directeing double.|pg||
nt|reisig: Might actually make now|pg||
nt|kit: This lead allows declarer to set up third heart trick and get up to 8, but he needs to knock out ace of diamonds first.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he figures out order of play here, he can take 2 diamonds, 3 hearts, 1 club, and 3 spades :)|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 3 hear tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: If he gets that far, he can eventually squeeze-endplay West.|pg||
nt|barnets: so the treatment has gained a trick |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight is on weinstein|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: certaintly not my idea of a weak two bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann-multon must play one of the last two sets|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (they sat out the first set)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzfv: molson jotting down some notes to herself...think she wants to discuss with jill meyers later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like he has the first 8 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Thanks for the confidence, pard"|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, I thought N would go with 5 @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk/Sontag with 3 excellent decisions to not go to 3nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  important for partnerships to have ways of differentiating strong 2 suiters versus distributional 2 suiters here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzfv: oh nvm she showed jenny wolpert|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe Helness should have worked out that jack of hearts not likely to be in dummy, since no need to transfer to 3NT if it were -- thus led low heart.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  agree Kit|pg||
nt|kit: But that inference isn't totally clear.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ritong: or even better 7@c|pg||
nt|rimbus: I think 7 @s better than 7 @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ritong: anyways, a thin ice contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nevertheless|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfv: this is wagar finals, so the table is screened.|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a quiet one -- matter of overtricks perhaps|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +100 still for N/S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: partners can't see each other.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert finally gets to declare|pg||
nt|bigtrain: jeff rubens calls that "in and out" evaluation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: great book|pg||
nt|bigtrain: secrets of winning bridge|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course, the play in 3nt may have gone differently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin: I'm not thinking at trick 1 anymore|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as he would still make eafter the opening lead if he won the first diamond|pg||
nt|warrens:  best is for E to overtake and shift back to @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can see 3@H's and 2@C's and 1@D|pg||
nt|barnets: east can duck twice|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Weinstein can time this right.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he plays east for honor doubleton in clubs he can get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: May take a while to play this|pg||
nt|kit: Although he can set up a club trick on power also, though that involves losing 2 club tricks.  So maybe he can.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  instead of 130 in clubs|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or 110..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: isnt it 200?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  heart ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (assuming ruff now)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club heart ruff, diamond|pg||
nt|reisig: It ain't over - til it's over :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bigtrain: the number one book i recommend|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i wonder if he will give me a kickback for the free advertising :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny's like :i'm still i shock|pg||
nt|psyck: yes more interesting after say passive @h lead|pg||
nt|ritong: and ultra tough to bid when the key is xxx facing void|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  after heart ruff, club to ace, heart ruff, then diamond = d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  Of course I have nothing nice to say about South's double either|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: contract the same in open room|pg||

pc|d6|pc|cT|nt|bigtrain: you crack me up andrew|pg||
nt|warrens:  impossible for N to know he had to win the @D and play on @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack trick 3 was the winning play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|reisig: Now - a @c play|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein basically playing this way in case East has Ax of diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|warrens:  not the % play|pg||
nt|reisig: and a @c :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|kit: or diamonds 3-3.  I think he is playing it correctly, although unsuccessfully on this layout.  He doesn't think East has 4 diamonds when East known to have 6 hearts|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: famous for mission impossible production|pg||
pc|h5|nt|agumperz:  Here is the book I mentioned: http://www.amazon.com/Bridge-Probability-Information-Robert-MacKinnon/dp/189710653X|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s3|nt|barnets: looks down1|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  and they have been solid on the two boards since|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack is ok if diamonds 33, or 4 in helness hand, and still has possibilities for extra trick if helness had dblton ace originally|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: sounds like you're here watching it with me|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is a 3 or 4 problem  rather 4 or 6  south does not want to lure his pard into a slam without goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: just 5 levels lower than we hoped for|pg||
nt|ritong: guess this shows @d shortage|pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Meckwell have been known to make many 21 point 3nts, but just not here :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: i only 2 points and 1 quick tricks short of a roth opener|pg||

pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: odd that kamil did not bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his team led comfortably|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we say " tempête sous un crâne"|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne will not be so pleased when he may make slam|pg||
nt|kit: It looks that way from our point of view, but not to declarer who doesn't know everything is behaving well.|pg||
nt|kit: It is not obvious at all how to play this hand I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Probably go for the heart ruff, planning on taking 6 spade tricks, 3 club tricks, 1 diamond trick.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  since overruff dummy in clubs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|3for3: i thought the idea was to try to lead our 5 card suits, not theirs :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||
nt|kit: also giving the opponents headaches|pg||
nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer just trying to set up long heart for tenth trick -- no risk involved|pg||
nt|rimbus: a great choice, for sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: on the other hand, he is threatened with long @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag: I have to think...leaves table|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  wonder what the decision will be on throwing out boards this set and if there will be a penalty, which side will it go towards?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Certainly, Sontag is not known for receiving slow play penalties :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Sontag has to think????   Yikes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin spills coffee on a few of the remaining boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|henryb:  the duck (quack-quack) doubleton is not an endearing feature|pg||
nt|3for3: helgemo knows he is making this.  martel not so sure|pg||
nt|3for3: this would be a good hand for the rubber bridge variation, no overtricks.  |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|bigtrain: back finally|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: i think his choice might be different vs 1NT 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rimbus: will he play a SMLA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: when AJxx is very low on the opening leads quality scale|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2 rds trumps then start diamonds seems right|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: quack is shorthand for queen-jack|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Nunes went down 2 at the other table and Nickell gained 2 more imps.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  19 imp lead through 26 boards for Monaco|pg||
nt|bobholl: m ainly mistakes by nickel (22 and 23)|pg||
nt|reisig: 25|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 imps Monaco here sry|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  25 imp lead :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  As was noted earlier, Zimmerman/Multon will be playing 3rd quarter, while Nickell/Katz will be done after this quarter|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: the late and great Edgar Kaplan said takeout Xs are meant to be taken out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Just 1 for me"|pg||
nt|reisig: NEXT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rimbus: i meant a SMALL heart ?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|xenya: so it looks like 3 off|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  high trump|pg||
mc|10|nt|psyck: 6@c, even after trump lead, you can make with 7@c, 2@h via fin, 3@d|pg||
nt|kit: This line works fine when both spades and diamonds are 3-2, but I'm not convinced it is right (not convinced it is wrong either)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  see if either team gains the momentum heading into the break based on the last 6 boards of the set here|pg||

nt|fabsayc: ok now i am declaring lead may be too large|pg||
nt|henryb:  which hand is too large?|pg||
nt|henryb:  which lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the lead in this match|pg||
nt|xenya: actually could have been 4 if S had discarded a club and a diamond|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: we resume|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: cayne didn't look too happy seeing that pass. |pg||
nt|psyck: neither the x nor the pass were pretty|pg||

nt|warrens:  but only if they play it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: here we go|pg||

mb|1H|nt|phil: re|pg||
nt|phil: I think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: is E worth 2@H here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: yes, sorry, i was trying to read their alert sheet|pg||
nt|phil: the question is will NS compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne could bid 2@s or something with a 2 loser hand & @s void, & of couse S need not have passed with that hand|pg||
nt|barnets: opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|1N|nt|phil: if Fleisher has @d's, great|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 2@S as West|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3rd seat & @h suit are generally more suitable to a preemtive bid|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is constructive raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: but if Fleisher is balanced selling out  looks better - maybe even x'd|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand was yucky for any choice of bids|pg||
nt|ritong: with their microNT, they need a good scrambling system|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a pretty bad spot compared to 4@H|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfv: "Spades were so good, I'll try it again"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C on 42 with diamond lead in open room|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ritong: prudent fold by tor|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@HX down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: gold medal to passing 4@S?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Knowing the opening bid is behing his cards, Weinstein slowed down and took the low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: was willing to play 43 if it came to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||
nt|rimbus: Anyway, Duboin chosed a spade lead : who is right ?|pg||
nt|ritong: the scoreboard is|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, this is a little dangerous|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 diamonds anyone?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  these intermediate hands with 45 in the majors are never easy with standard bidding methods|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder what 3@H showed /|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond lead would be quite reasonable -- by far best chance of finding partner's 5-card sut.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some pairs, including Helness and Helgemo use 3@h for no 5 card major rather than 3nt.|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe its no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think thats right barnet|pg||
nt|kit: I think no 4 or 5-card major.  3NT = 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: This lets partner bid 3@S over 3@H with 5 spades and 4 hearts.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nickell correctly passes 3C and will certainly go plus here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: which is a problem distribution if playing Puppet (which I guess they are)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3C may have pushed them up a level, but declarer will duck here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
pc|d2|nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|ritong: guess he would raise that pot under different circumstances|pg||
pc|d7|nt|barnets: 3|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|leo lasota:  heart to queen and ace here|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  does he bring this in with only one diamond ?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: now he just draws trumps and plays a club|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: Kamil cannot lead clubs however|pg||
nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher is marked with the @sK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  at best, E/W will score 3 additional trump tricks here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think all the players from wagar finals are often on bbo. team captain for westheimer, vdoubleu, is familiar to many bboers, especially the juniors. she's involved in organizing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: special programs for kids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry i can't give technical analyses. maybe an expert will like to be commentator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers is very well accessorized. i think she has 3 necklaces on. very cool looking. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD ken van cleef just walked in. not sure what he wants. think he's just observing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh he came to drink some water :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that americans can raise on three cards has importance, too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d9|nt|xenya: actually S can even play a @D now|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he can power it home with the trump spots|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|barnets: only prob using 3N to show 5@H , you dont have a 3@S slam try and have to use 4@C as atry over 3N|pg||
pc|h2|nt|3for3: helness needed to lead club thru to break endplay|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c4|nt|barnets: as 4@D is a transfer back|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|phil: yeah I guess he can|pg||
pc|dK|pc|cJ|nt|leo lasota:  club here|pg||
nt|kit: trump looks more threatening, but I don't see how anything matters|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  would a trump shift after winning diamond have worked any better?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|3for3: he still needs to guess who to endplay tho|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobholl: S doesn't know who has !K :)|pg||
nt|phil: clubs are blocked with no reentry|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't think so, since it would leave dummy with 2 high clubs|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  +110 for a push|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  Berk was caught on opening lead in losing situation of winning king clubs on air or ducking and not winning the king later|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  with 14 top tricks (and a 4th in clubs if it was needed)|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  so a chance for Monaco pickup here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: always 11 regardless of @dQ|pg||
nt|phil: but they had an 1100 for the taking in 5@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: offering 1100 atm - but insufficent compensation for what NS can make|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  5H certainly an encouraging bid from Nickell, see what Katz does now|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards over really quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s seem to always ask for it|pg||
nt|rimbus: in NT you cannot try a double finesse in @d, missing the 7 !|pg||
nt|ritong: now zim might dislike @h KJx|pg||
nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||
nt|ritong: at worst K10x|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  play will go quickly here; making 4|pg||
mb|6S|nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|phil: a treatment I like, but have not implemented over 4@c: |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Nice job- Ralph!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  7S and then 7nt ?  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Neither Multon or Zimmerman has anything resembling a defensive trick|pg||
mb|7S|nt|rimbus: As I said, I fear a double finesse....|pg||
nt|ritong: ugliest possible dummy for francky|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only chance of 5 is leading low club to king at some point and defense duck and not take their ace clubs|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||
nt|grebrof: not even a fitjump|pg||

mb|3H|nt|leo lasota:  second dbl shows extras, usually 2 spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|3for3: big result for monaco in OR|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  Does anyone know if Sontag has ever been issued a slow play penalty?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Looks normal to me|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but the moth eaten suit may just telegraph the play for N/S |pg||

nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 4@S should be the fits that weren't good enough to raise directly |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  From Helness perspective, partner may have either 5 clubs or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: Never got the @h suit involved|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The dread "do something intelligent" x.  One of the best ways to find your 3-3 fits.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  may result in +50 :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  or 100..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
pc|hA|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||

nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
nt|kit: canape style potentially.  South doesn't know which suit is longer.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showing 4+ in both suits, either 54++ or 45++|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  up for partnership discussion what 2nt would mean on this auction by East|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect this to go down 2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  1 imp to Nickell|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as always, Pepsi as dummy opens a thick book in Polish|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure I understand the 2@D call|pg||
nt|warrens:  nor I|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt is a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, North might have bid 3@C over 1NT, which is highly invitational.|pg||
nt|kit: The fact the South is thinking indicates that perhaps North has shown a very strong hand.|pg||
nt|kit: But he better pass, as a diamond lead defeats 3NT I believe.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but as expected, E/W had the mwethods to uncover the 8 card fit; well done|pg||
nt|reisig: Good job|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  easy for defense to hold the declarer to 5 trump tricks and 2 aces|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|hK|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, 3NT likely to go down|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||

nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  eventually having to break the cdlub suit himself|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: East can comfortably discard 2 hearts and 1 spade on the run of the clubs, so nothing bad should happen.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|leo lasota:  easy 140 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: some very friendly banter at the table|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  plenty of exit cards for East here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|barnets: anyway board 10 coming in open when they played 1@SX here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  West should win spade fire diamond through|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but defense still succeeds on spade continuation|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|ahollan1: don't try Meckstroth's DBL unless you're allowed to correct @C response to @D without showing extras|pg||
nt|barnets: in this room MECkwell passed throughout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@SX on 28|pg||
nt|barnets: 7@S was xd and will be a swing for Monaco|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  you're ready to PASS  partner's @C bids|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||
nt|ritong: when, in states, it is the contrary|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't we find a closer match ?  :) :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there will certainly be alot of talk about that hand after the match if Gordon should lose|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +100 for Monaco in other room here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  though really no mental effect on d2 versus d3 undled non vul|pg||
mb|1H|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S didn't make at other table, so match is tied!|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
nt|kit: on board 59|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
nt|ritong: both work well, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this being played wrong way|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Katz has fair hand with 4 card support, 14 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You did not claim|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  undouble|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
nt|kit: Light neg double -- Levin will surely bid 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein wanting to find 44 heart fit if there; plans to smolen then show 6th spade if needed; Helness/Helgemo ruin his plans somewhat but he still knows that they do not have 44 heart fit as Levin passed 2D|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Something to discuss with your partner, would a bid of 3 of a major be Smolen here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@s was alerted by levin|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he took such a low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin's hand has gotten much better on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: weinstein declarer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice 3C call here, nice pass by Katz|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes - but the alert meant something else :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: levin clearly felt this was a smolen situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he thought 3@s showed 5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (i think)|pg||
nt|reisig: Right!|pg||
nt|barnets: this may be stronger than 2@C-2@D 4@H|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play problem here|pg||
mc|6|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might get to game in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Perhaps it went 1D-2C-p-p-dbl-p-2h?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice lead by katz|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: katz can picture trump length with partner|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: so he sets out to force declarer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer can only come down to Kx hearts after taking all the pitches|pg||

nt|barnets: make a lot|pg||
nt|kit: am I?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: more banter after that hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt normal contract for N/S here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: table has been played in extremely friendly spirit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Multon asked the vugraoh operator to treplay 3C :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: and partially to NS's system that doesn't allow North to play 3N :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing things up|pg||
nt|barnets: last board you can all go to the open room after this and watch board 10|pg||
nt|barnets: stuck on 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher has made some very quirky preempts immediately after bad boards this set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: and congratulations to westheimer for a well deserved win, they played very solidly in every match|pg||
nt|psyck: specs of Cayne BBO matches will be falimial with the acronym SDAM|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but there is alot of work to the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: 2c is something that i couldnt hear|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is quirky²|pg||
nt|xenya: and this one might make things tough for EW?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing their things during zimmermann's tank|pg||
nt|phil: is quirky squared "quarky"? |pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: that introduces too much physics into bridge|pg||

nt|ritong: extras, yes  4@s bid, debatable|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: a very old american treatment|pg||
nt|psyck: routine 4M here probably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  redouble shows 9+ HCP with 2 spades I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  E/W to play a level lower in here...|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Not sure|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  we shall see'|pg||
mb|3H|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will bid 4@s imo|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is 5332 is not superincentive|pg||
nt|ritong: i would quietly single raise and await|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: 5! D a good save|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c  P  3nT?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  seems reasonable rich|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: this is last of 4 sessions, so I dont think Fleisher has given up yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *first|pg||
nt|grebrof: first, sorry :D|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and cue|pg||
nt|phil: surprised he didn't bd 4@s initially|pg||
nt|ritong: even stronger than pass and pull:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or pass the double|pg||
nt|phil: that shows a moose |pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: I count 5 for NS|pg||

mb|4C|nt|phil: Oo|pg||
nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: now that's a cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S would be without the club king|pg||
nt|psyck: (Six Diamonds Always Makes)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes tx for your many humorous and sometimes helpful comments|pg||
nt|rimbus: A great segment for Hel2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very friendly spade position will result in 3nt making for Weinstein with some ease|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  question is what are the agreements for the passed hand 3D call?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: pass and jump cue|pg||
nt|phil: whatever 5@s shows - he doesn't have it|pg||
mb|5D|nt|phil: with Multon's I would want to bid 8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again Kendrick and Henri|pg||
nt|psyck: after their attempts at 6@c failed, they found the correct stratefy...|pg||
nt|barnets: well done by north|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pretty much an open book for the declarer play|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I need a coffee - my screen is not often this blue :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  spec tx to our opereator u hacve done a superb job - spec with all the informations from the table TX!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers finally got to declare! molson says "i cant let you go a whole sgment without declaring"|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C in open worth watching|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 45  Monaco leads Cayne by 76|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: ty ty see all later|pg||
nt|grebrof: its just as good as 4@s - choice of slam with a void - I have everything|pg||
nt|psyck: is that the strongest bid ever made?|pg||
nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe this will scare off a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: thanks for watching this segment and bearing with me. |pg||
nt|rimbus: and zimmul were close to put a last nail in the coffin|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with spade queen being discovered to be onside, west is marked with ace heart and king club |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzfv: doesnt look like this has a chance :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bye for now|pg||
nt|ritong: no swing anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one told him that spades are 8-1|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is he will duplicate rosenberg's line|pg||
nt|phil: some perceptive commentators tell me 7N makes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: multon asks if double is 100% penalty, fleisher, does an air "knock-on-wood"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play continues with semi-finals tomorrow at 7am PST, 10am east coast|pg||
nt|barnets: another miserable slam here not worth watching I am afraid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 5@C didn't deter them from slam, unfortunately|pg||
nt|barnets: unless of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that was Sementa-Duboin bidding to 6@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  At least one overbid here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  see if Katz/Nickell can accurately defend for a good finish|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Westis excused cos he has the money|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: south bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and a phantom sacrifice...|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 7:15 eastern|pg||
nt|barnets: of course 2@HX by west would have been no fun at all for e/w|pg||
nt|barnets: played by east of course|pg||
nt|barnets: vul v not|pg||
nt|barnets: had south found some kind of X and north passed|pg||
nt|barnets: not entirely unreasonable I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  He can do what he likes|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we pity the people who don't listen to voice commentary -- you missed some great stories from John Swanson|pg||

nt|psyck: DD 6@c would make on any lead on deal 10...lets see what happens in practice|pg||
