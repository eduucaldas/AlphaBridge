mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: how guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi guys|pg||
pc|s6|nt|reisig: Nice to start w a nothing hand :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW system: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|barnets: no lead gives dec any problems|pg||
pc|h6|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Welcome back all|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|barnets: in open room north passed south opened 2@H and it went all pass|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|d5|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nice quiet board to start|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: this resulted in a surprising swing to Monaco right off the bat|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, not sure if there are comentators|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H natursl GF|pg||
pc|d6|nt|barnets: West had a good 17 points but elected not to bid|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
nt|warrens:  once S won the K of @Cs (the normal play), it seemed likely that Levin would guess the @S's correctly|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  That whirring noise you hear is Harold Berlin spinning in his grave.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: same contract in open room|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: 2@H|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, there's an inference when North doesn't lead a @S that he might have the Ace.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again, ken|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Harold was a fanatic about "Never lead dummy's long suit!"|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@H will drift down a few|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|nt|barnets: perhaps Nickell hoped his partner would reopen|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: but that seemed unlikely taking into account his strenght|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|mc|10|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Monaco|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ady: may play some sort of reverse dummy here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: dummy reversal -- ruff with long trump rather than usual line of trying to ruff in hand with short trump|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT trumpQ +1 king|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6@C should be gran slam interest asking about @C holding|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  N's double shows @D's and @H tolerance, so it's easy for Berkowitz to bid 3@D vulnerable|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: closed room lineup is the same as the 2nd session|pg||
nt|warrens:  this can't be beaten if declarer reads the cards right.  has to hold up once in @H's and finesse the @C 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
nt|kit: difficult opening lead for Levin here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4th from longest and strongest works well|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky heart split for declarer gives him a chance to make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin will likely do just that Warren|pg||
nt|kit: He found the winning lead -- now declarer will have to guess which finesse to take for  8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
nt|barnets: dummy has 3 discs to make 2 spades and a club|pg||
nt|barnets: dec will then KO @DA cash a black AK and uess his finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: guess|pg||
nt|barnets: his finesse|pg||
nt|kit: Note the play of the 9 of hearts -- Now Levin is afraid that declarer started with 109xx|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||
nt|ritong: when this will go down 2 effortless|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher should view this as a +5 or a +8 plus position|pg||
nt|phil: hi |pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Phil|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: of course Weinstein has a problem exiting -- he may be afraid that a diamond shift will guess the diamonds for declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: but a spade is safe|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: NS in 1N next door -- going 1 off|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, something went weird and they went x, -1 instead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: as it turns out|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||
nt|phil: well, its not like -2 is a great possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: so i presume south overcalled|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but now declarer will be able to take the spade finesse safely, and when it loses he can still fall back on the club guess|pg||
pc|d6|nt|santyclz2:  A slight hint that n has the @c q as if he were xxx in both suits he might have exited a @c.  Very slight.|pg||
nt|barnets: so a great shift if South had Qx spade giving dec a losing option|pg||
nt|barnets: were he originally to cash the @SAK before taking club fin|pg||
pc|d8|nt|warrens:  I think Levin will cash all the @S's to get a better count.  in the end he'll finesse|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  With Berk marked with just the KQ hearts and jack clubs thusfar, Levin will know that the only other HCP are the Q diamonds; Berk has overcalled and taken free 3D bid; therefore he will play for 55 shape in Berk's hand rather than 1543|pg||
pc|d5|nt|reisig: Any bets?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kit: The 10 of spades shift might convince declarer that North has 109x, and he may try the spade finesse unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|barnets: as he was planning to do|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

nt|barnets: wrong|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|warrens:  Kwiecen misguessed the @S's on the last hand because rodwell only bid 2@S, not 3@H,so the match is tight once again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin in the tank|pg||
nt|warrens:  Levin is a terrific declarer, but he's going to put us to sleep.  A card, PLEASE.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Head in his hands...cards on the table|pg||
nt|warrens:  same line at the other table.  Declarer did get it right by finessing in @C's.|pg||

nt|phil: as I said before you arrived - Multon's 5@d have his opps a tough guess - and they might have guessed wrongly|pg||
nt|phil: *gave|pg||
nt|ritong: guess multon will opt for 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
nt|reisig: This looks like 4@s X|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Funny comment by Levin there... Not sure if any bridge player could ever play too fast for Sontag :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 4 imps fo Nickell when thy made 3@D in othe room|pg||
mb|3C|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
nt|warrens:  this might go down 800 if the defense stays off of @C's|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  500 on a @C lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin concerned about possibly missing vul slam here if he passes|pg||
nt|reisig: 5@d seems kinda "normal"|pg||
nt|kit: The 3@C bid is somewhat conservative as Levin doesn't need much to make a game.|pg||
nt|barnets: but unsuccessfull|pg||
mb|3H|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will correct 34|pg||
nt|reisig: @c will NOT be led|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  But in the end, he makes good decision to pass and take the plus score|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Weinstein will high low in trump here, to show his @H king |pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT also reasonable, and also unsuccessful|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  5D down 1 is certainly better for N/S than 3nt down 5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Well, somebody can make 3NT ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to admit i would have accepted the invite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and would have been wrong on this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +800 for E/W here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Having bid 1NT - I's avoid bidding 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bigtrain: 15-17 as far as i know|pg||
nt|warrens:  he wants his partner to know it's safe to shift to @H's from the King|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, went for 800 at the other table.  likely same thing here.|pg||
nt|barnets: who said no double bo trouble|pg||
nt|barnets: no trouble|pg||
nt|kit: Give West the ace of hearts, and 3NT is the winner.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bigtrain: but N is way better than 15|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
nt|reisig: 800 as expected -  is a push |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
nt|reisig: Would E bid 3@h with no @h ace?|pg||
nt|kit: Heart shift will be trivial to find, and Weinstein will go up king as only chance to make|pg||
nt|barnets: he rates to have the @HA yes |pg||
pc|h9|nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K&R = 16.55|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spot cards are huge here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes little more than the @DQ onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Rodwell almost ready to play...|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer might play @Cs now, hoping for Hx in East|pg||
pc|hK|nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
nt|warrens:  that was his only entry to dummy, so he had to try right away|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|phil: now the hand falls apart|pg||
nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|nt|ritong: it is clear for him that declarer would never find the @hs by himself|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe 5@D is a better contract|pg||
mc|4|nt|barnets: 51D in the open |pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D will be a swing t Monaco|pg||
nt|barnets: of 5 imps|pg||
nt|kit: not a big swing though|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
nt|barnets: note Cayne played low on club without a flicker|pg||
nt|barnets: you might ask why helness crossed to dummy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|warrens:  Larry Cohen is on his way (I hope to this table).  the 4@S bid violated the law of total tricks and cost 4 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: to lead @CJ|pg||
nt|psyck: he was prepared to play low during the bidding itself|pg||
nt|reisig: Law???|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: maybe cayne had not his morning coffee yet|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: (anticipating the upgrde) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm  - roddy could have also chosen 3@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a bit surrised|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control ask|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C would have shown some solid suit with 7+ tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ controls|pg||
nt|warrens:  Weinstein will force to game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
nt|reisig: Does 87xx in @s qualify as a suit?|pg||
nt|kit: Helness will be thinking about slam, having opened 1@S on a hand he might have opened 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3! shows 1-18 with 3=2=3=5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 17-18|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i anticapte grnd as the fiinal contract from here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
nt|barnets: he didnt think for too long and made a simple bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick 650 on that lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|warrens:  down on a @C lead, since the defense can get 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play prob here|pg||
nt|warrens:  and a @D|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4 = RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 2 w/o Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but since Sontag holds the key 9 spades, the defense prevails|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|bigtrain: 5! asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: shows grand interest so meck will force the issue with "solid" clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7@C as choice maybe|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||
nt|kit: Heart lead would have given declarer quite a bit of headaches, but on the lie of the cards it wouldn't matter.|pg||
nt|barnets: even had west held the @SJ slam was terrible|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bigtrain: obviously 7@H is the better theorical contract but 7NT will suceed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2nd grand in 1st 4 boards!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no one will ever lead a @D on this auction|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bigtrain: without W actually exposing the @DA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|3for3: a super grovesnor!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well was better to start the spades|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: of course Zia couldn't duck, but if he had .....|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|bigtrain: and even then i'd imagine you would have to clean your glasses and ask for a second peek|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then if necessary could have ruffed the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
nt|3for3: helness 'knows' south cant duck that|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kit: Now will take spade finesse and be down 3.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to jack, club ace and club ruff seems a simpler approach and makes 6 on layout|pg||
nt|warrens:  down whether or not S ruffs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|warrens:  as long as he plays a @C when he gets in |pg||
pc|h7|nt|3for3: meanwhile 3nt came in at other table so big swing to monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: W is sort of sqaueezed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead was good again|pg||
nt|kit: either red suit would have been effective lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if clubs not breaking you still have the cross ruff line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry to make 5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S is NOT a transfer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they use replacement bids to better utilize the space|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  levin can keep Kx diamonds and declarer will just cash out for 10 and not risk contract|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|osvaill83: makes now|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzfv: lost track sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D now and made :)|pg||
nt|osvaill83: could have endplayed helgemo|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but Zia couldn't possibly read the position I don't think.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its actually fairly random which partner plays the contract in  Precision|pg||
pc|c4|nt|grebrof: Helness probably had aheartattack when that @h ( fell :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 8|pg||
nt|kit: he can still do the end-play|pg||
nt|grebrof: @h 8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|kit: Helgemo obviously fooled by the low heart shift, although it seems like he should have figured it out since declarer known to have 5 spades from auction.|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K and endplay dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Zia knows opponents have made a mistake somewhere -- he just has to figure out where.|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, Rosenberg opened 1@H as E (3rd seat), W bid spades, and that was that |pg||
nt|grebrof: o, than K of !@d and small to 9|pg||
nt|kit: actually he can't make -- Helgemo can win diamond and exit low diamond.|pg||
nt|3for3: and he does know the whole hand at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 9@D covers|pg||
nt|kit: this looked like it would be a relatively dull hand, but things sure got interesting.|pg||
nt|grebrof: after watching Willenken and Rosenberg yesterday, I never thought they would ever be ahead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it does seem as though Helgemo should have kept his heart.  I don't see how that could ever have been wrong whatever the hand is.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|kit: Key was East's spade discard -- I can't imagine East would have pitched spade if he had an honor -- and if declarer has AK of spades then East must have king of hearts or we are ...|pg||
nt|kit: wasting our time.|pg||
nt|m_ozden: @h Ýzmir Kemalpaþa Briç Turnuvasý 29 Temmuz@s Detaylar için týklayýnýz http://www.karsiyakabric.org/|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: mumbling Zia: "What could it possibly be?"|pg||
nt|xenya: no imps ar stake|pg||
nt|3for3: at least 1 at stake|pg||
nt|kit: I can see Zia reading the position.  If so, he will win ace of spades, and lead jack of diamonds throwing the 9 -- hoping West has K108x.  And the West underleads and East claims|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be neat ending|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting point -- West led 5 of diamonds, so apparently they lead 3/5 vs. NT.  Thus, the end-play can't work.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even they dont lead 8 from KT85|pg||
nt|kit: And West isn't likely to be making a falsecard on lead on this kind of auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Zia still wondering if it is possible that spade finesse is onside|pg||
nt|kit: Now North will discard down to a stiff diamond, and declarer won't be able to afford to take the diamond finesse|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bigtrain: IF roddy bids 3@C initially W would end playing all grands - one of the reasons i was surprised about the lack of the bid|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|h6|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: Of course everybody knows that North wouldn't blank the king because declarer can't afford to take the finesse, so maybe he should take it -- but if North does blank the king ...|pg||
nt|kit: North mis-discarded -- now 100% safe to finesse|pg||
nt|kit: If he was watching the discards, that is.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness wasnt sure if there was one left|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  surprised weinstein made the discarding error there|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Disa is very very fast. |pg||
nt|fabsayc: that hand wont come up again this year, are they discussing meaning of 2@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: garbage stayman|pg||
nt|xenya: prosaic, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia should stop playing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia: "I knew I could make it, I Just didn't know which chance you gave me"|pg||
nt|phil: but there's always that sequence where there's a little fuzziness|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@D was preemptive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not constructive|pg||
nt|phil: they play transfers there kendrick? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in what sequence?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||
nt|phil: after the overcall - pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helgemo: counting to thirteen is too tough|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a surprise from dec|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: I wonder how they'd show a constructive raise then? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: they possibly could, but I'm unsure|pg||
nt|phil: no worries|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6+@C 10-15|pg||
nt|kit: Even the best players get careless and sometimes don't pay proper attention to discards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|1S|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 6@h is OK?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@H as the @C Ace is onside for a @S pitch|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
nt|bigtrain: east's pass is almost always exactly a doubleton n support|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  W is showing a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|reisig: another "wonderful" X :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  double by Spntag greatly improves slam prospects|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will just tell everyone that weinstein kept a heart and declarer rightfully cashed ace to not risk contract :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: with 12 boards to go...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny has to use the restroom. the rest are waiting for her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson left with her|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers started reading the newspaper|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  additionally, the double allows extra bidding space for levin/weinstein|pg||
nt|warrens:  the X tells East the Ace is onside and also gives E/W extra room|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised, as is one of the voice commentators, that W bid 4@H and not 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: Me too!|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass of 4@c X = maybe slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  everyone is surprised, but perhaps they have a different understanding of Levin's 4H call than we expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag leaves table...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: after asking Weinstein if he'll be a while|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..but in my bidding 4@h = no void in @c and no @d cue|pg||
nt|warrens:  exact same start at the other table, but West bid 4@D, not 4@H, after the X-p-p|pg||
nt|reisig: That's what I'd do|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Since Levin had 3 choices at or below game here... redbl, 4D, & 4H, I am sure they have agreements that we are unaware of|pg||
nt|reisig: Wanna bet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Weinstein alone at the table now as Levin and Berkowitz chat on the other side of the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in that case why not 3nt by rosenberg|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Betting is out Rich... casino night was already held at the nationals :)|pg||
nt|kit: I think this 3@S call should show 6, so Helness should have no problem raising|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: tempo wasnt as shown|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil: a quick -2|pg||
nt|phil: Kamil will also rip 6@h|pg||
nt|ritong: 6 losers at first glance|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: good point Danny -- I forgot about initial pass|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil knows Fleisher is ruffing the heart, so his lead is suit preference|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: So here we have another close 3NT contract|pg||
nt|3for3: entry problems for the 9th trick, even if the clubs are 33.|pg||
nt|phil: don't they lose a diamond too? |pg||
nt|fabsayc: ending in 2nt has no upside|pg||
nt|ritong: are you absolutely sure to want to lecture rosenberg about imps tactics?:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: i always bid 6nt if close|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and here danger of a bad spade break makes 6nt my choice|pg||
pc|c5|nt|grebrof: @d to 10?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i do think if your going to swing you need to start early, and 3nt is the best contract for that tactic|pg||
nt|ritong: ok ok|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: they are guessing contract in our room (with no success)|pg||
nt|ritong: unkind @d|pg||
nt|reisig: No problem making this one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: i think franck is realizing just now that a @c might have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvonunda yaptýgý tam ipnelik bu 2 oldu bana|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: looks like down 2 from here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: might ruff honor, and finesse the J@S?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: @Cs offer a better chance|pg||
nt|kit: if clubs 3-3, opponents can't cash 4 tricks |pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 3 off -- there's a @D to lose as well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|grebrof: the 3 wins, npp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: it was correct|pg||
nt|kit: East didn't squander 8 of clubs on 2nd round of clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: S can exit in trumps again when in with @sa, but ewill be endplayed again, but that will still be 8th trick only|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: almost certainly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I assume this is operator error with the club spots|pg||
nt|grebrof: for me, the operator is god - I dont know what happened :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, after the 2@C fuss, i might have gotten lost|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure @c 10 8 left in East|pg||
nt|grebrof: Helness in the tank now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he 100% led the 2@C|pg||
nt|kit: I imagine East won 8 of clubs on 3rd round, continues hearts, and goes down some|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: but, surprisingly enough, the trump layout was such that his @h6 was a big card|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|s8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i cant see the club 3 in disa's hand. odd|pg||
nt|phil: 800|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps he has analyzed that in a flash  i know he s extremely fast minded|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|h5|nt|phil: hopefully not a push with -790 :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, i have huge respect for his talent in general|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|phil: as predicted, H and H bid 3N on 20|pg||
nt|phil: sorry, 500 (NV)|pg||
nt|phil: Willenken could not handle 4@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: quick restroom break for N/S|pg||
nt|phil: the diamond lead seemed to change the timing a little|pg||
nt|phil: but still 10 to Fleisher|pg||
nt|xenya: well, at least NS didn't get to 4@S there|pg||
nt|phil: have to run to the pharmacy - be back in a little|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: disa very pleased with herself for the transfer squeeze.|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what really happened|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: the 2@C was won by the 3@C, for sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabsayc: actually i can see why|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: that really happened for sure?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfv: yes. |pg||
nt|kit: wow!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: lots of laughter at the table after it|pg||
nt|grebrof: Martel and Helness are getting old|pg||
nt|kit: Martel will likely bid 3@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@H is mixed so must use the single raise here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ritong: if so, the hand is borderline|pg||
nt|ritong: strict minimum for a constructive raise imho|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Rarely 5-7 HCP"|pg||
nt|bigtrain: mixed raise is 8-9 dummy points with 4+card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny asked molson what X means. molson shrugged and pointed at the 3D |pg||
nt|bigtrain: its an offensive type hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: Effective -- E-W haven't found the heart fit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any bid by south is only possible after peeking|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3D likely final spot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: disa bids at the same time as patapon. lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Fleisher: "We should make easier bids for them"|pg||
nt|barnets: easy 7 tricks to start|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: they can win this board|pg||
nt|grebrof: not now thou|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but how about spade ace, diamond to queen, spade king and diamonds (in your dreams)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H lead directing with diamond fit, a treatment possible by a passed hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3S is the limit of the hand here|pg||
nt|osvaill83:  this one is worse :)|pg||
nt|kit: Levin has adequate heart support to raise, but he decided his hand was too weak|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: West might have tried 5@D, leaving it to Zia to find a low club lead!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzfv: you'll see the 3nt and pass cards hit table at same time :) she's really fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be something else on this auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin passed the 2C as he had nothing extra in terms of HCP, now Weinstein balances with his 5 card diamond suit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N by east makes if south leads a heart to the ace|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @H9 is a standard signal after the lead showing the AK|pg||
nt|kit: Defense may have to be tough to beat this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: problem was 1@D on three card suit, given that would have rebid 2nt with disa's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now Levin backs into 3D|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|grebrof: Helness maybe should have dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice auction for E/W|pg||
nt|reisig: Dull hand|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: @sT may prove costly|pg||
nt|barnets: swing on bd 4 when Versace down in 3@D|pg||
nt|barnets: 5 to Monaco off|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@c was quite makeable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|leo lasota:  even got 3D right sided!|pg||
nt|warrens:  more interesting after a @S lead|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ace, low trump off board|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  duck second spade, then club shift still gets it set|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: off|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: this is one route to down 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D would have been no better|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: east fingered many cards in turn before shaking her head and playing the D2|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 down, but 3@H would have made|pg||
nt|bigtrain: being able to bid 4@S/4@H is too important to risk a TOX vs overcall|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: of|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but the other table bid 3@H which makes the TOX better as itsmore flexible|pg||
nt|bigtrain: either way...  i strongly dislike saving here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  levin signaling he has clubs for weinstein; |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|nt|leo lasota:  low heart to king now...|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  weinstein will get this right I believe|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: so 3@s a good sac in any case, especialloy if it makes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck can save a bit here by giving a @D ruff|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but beyond that the 5L save at the other table is the big loser as it rated to be|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 clubs upside down att pitch from sontag here, and low heart shift|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: you mean ethically?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: vugraph watchers, if you have time, go ahead to www.bridgebase.com and try the new bridge  base version please. that way you can listen to voice commentary in addition to typed ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ones.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it does but i dont know many who deliberately avoid leading a suit for that reason|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I believe Henry Bethe is providing it at this table, and he's the new USA bridge federation chairman :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes Henry on vugraph, and my questions are directed to him|pg||
nt|henryb:  No, only the head of the tournament conditions committee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: right. i wouldnt have been able to answer anyways :)|pg||

nt|reisig: hi Kit :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|henryb:  I'm going to switch to written. Being the only voice is a lonely job|pg||
nt|barnets: Schneider|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  3nt is likely going down here with the diamonds 41 and spade king off|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|3for3: 'standard' off shape nt by zia|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Director says both tables are too slow|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: missing two keys|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: for the @h slam|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: oh you mean if they try for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think 3@d can include three keys, anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so precisely the hand to bid slam on since sure to create a swing|pg||
nt|kit: Therefore, continuing diamonds can never be superior|pg||
nt|kit: Nice hand for 4-card overcall, and really strikes gold.|pg||
nt|reisig: Aceless - no so easy here|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  tough to know from South's hand, but 500 available against 4S dbled|pg||
nt|kit: 5@H will make on likely spade lead, I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course the hand can also make 5H from South|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3@H looks a bit strange here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: willard waved her x card to attract valerie's attention. it means 4 spades |pg||
nt|3for3: not sure what east is thinking about.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2nt invite-3nt accept|pg||
nt|kit: Levin can't like the thought of defending 4@S with a spade void|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: not any more ? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I see he played the @s 10 at trick1 , his 7th winner|pg||
nt|warrens:  a pushy game try opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: bids by southwest will start to x perhaps if south bids|pg||
mb|4N|nt|xenya: W in doubt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does Levin bid 5H if 5C is dbled?|pg||
nt|barnets: that interprets as West may X |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|vugraphzfv: levin asked molson to take some time. cos she wants to think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson is like "going..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  "the whole hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  QJ doubleton downgrade for the hand but two 10's upgrade|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  excellent pass of 2nt by Berk|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: the program auto plays singletons, zia was thinking|pg||
nt|3for3: as he is entitled to, but at this point he doesnt know a whole lot|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting that Zia gave up on the legit chance of stiff king of clubs |pg||
nt|warrens:  I see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|kit: North will bid 5@C (having already shown hearts), and now Levin will have to guess which suit to play.|pg||
nt|reisig: They may find 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 11 tricks|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: and there. she played. |pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps 12 if seamon ducks the second @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  pretty good chances for 8|pg||
nt|kit: But only 5 tricks for the defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he plays spades I think he'll go down. losing 2 @S, 2@D and 2@C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight back on levin here...|pg||
nt|kit: Now, will Levin run?|pg||
nt|kit: Big decision here|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w willbe delighted n/s bid as they will now go plus|pg||
nt|bobholl: dutch saying better 1 bird in hand than 10 in air|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: East should perhaps have cashed the king of diamonds first -- now West has a problem.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @C lead would be a real killer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer decides to play spade here, 2nt is down; diamond here, 2nt is in|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  great decision by weinstein!|pg||
nt|reisig: Now 5@h?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes rich now 5H|pg||
nt|kit: Only if Levin bids 5@H -- but will he work that out?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein has announced that he has nothing in clubs|pg||
nt|cc469: why 5@H?|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should have redoubled (assuming that is takeout) rather than show diamond support he doesn't have.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  therefore, Levin can expect decent hearts and should probably get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: Doubling the only contract you can beat - is often wrong|pg||
mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: club shift|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont make but 2@H was making|pg||
nt|psyck: strange defense|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual opening lead yes|pg||
nt|psyck: @hk would have been more standard|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer cannot affordably cash the hearts as this sets up Levin's extra heart|pg||
nt|kit: I think he had to play spades, since playing a diamond wouldn't tell him anything and he would still have to take the spade finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: This way he also gets Jx of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Kit|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: if so, perhaps zim will try to avoid the dangerous hand, though|pg||
nt|ritong: and miss the @cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  or if he plays confident, levin may duck the king :)|pg||
nt|kit: At other table Meckwell got to 3NT .....|pg||
nt|kit: But it looks like they will make it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  That is a common treatment in Europe: transfer doubles over 1-level overcalls rather than negative|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if you're forced to level getting there fast shows the worst hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, Meckstroth ran the 10 of @S at trick 2, so will make the game|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  outstanding |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but this move is even better|pg||
nt|ritong: bien joué, pierre|pg||
nt|ritong: it caters for @c Qxxx with south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: slow shows interest in bigger things|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: I think Helgemo's double of 5@C is clear -- he has no reason to expect the opponents have a place to run when they chose clubs with their eyes open.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Very well deserved score for N/S|pg||
nt|barnets: looks down 1 |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Easy 11 tricks |pg||
nt|barnets: not on that lead though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|barnets: try a spade lead|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|h2|nt|kit: This lead doesn't hurt declarer.  And on a spade lead he would have the entries to ruff 2 spades and score 6 trump tricks and 5 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  exactly as kit says|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure thats right kit|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Qx hearts onside allowed for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|reisig: Even I can make this now :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|nt|kit: I could be wrong, but I think only a diamond lead would defeat 5@H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu:  W exp @sA by S - so @D was normal|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but not in france|pg||
nt|barnets: would like to see souths reaction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just a chuckle|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|barnets: @SA ruffed @DA  @S ruff @HJ covered @H 10|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: when the @DA and @DJ was played|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i strongly disagree andrew]|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|bigtrain: LTT is the critical decision tree|pg||
nt|barnets: how does he get to dummy to draw the last trump ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|kit: ace of diamonds is final entry.  That's why I think a diamond lead is killer.|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe if he plays a heart at trick 2|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway @CA very bad lead for sure|pg||
nt|kit: which would never be found, of course|pg||
nt|reisig: Anyway - I give Levin a lot of credit|pg||

nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: who's at the other table playing it?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the thng is about all the old bridge players is they had to be great declarers since they were such terrible bidders|pg||
nt|warrens:  a big score for Nickell|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: my idea is 2@c should cover some fit hands|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: 1@H has lots going for it|pg||
nt|ritong: which do not completely match standard treatments|pg||
nt|kit: old fashioned defesne -- cover an honor, win the queen with the king.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they started 2@S 3@S (hearts and a minor) in open room, which is much tougher|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they seem to have had a misunderstanding, ending in 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne does not like his partners or teammates to make tight Xs|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  Momentum at this table certainly on the side of Levin/Weinstein with 2 good results in a row|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  Also lots against it if partner rebids 1@s|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if nothing else if gives partner a lead|pg||
nt|3for3: 4 losers for declarer, but defense get get them all|pg||
nt|barnets: especially when they make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzfv: is this lead by westheimer too large?|pg||
nt|3for3: here the spade loser disappears|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all players annoyed that director took away boards|pg||
nt|barnets: yes a spec points out helgy tthinking @CA club ruff @SA club ruff|pg||
nt|bobholl: not strange with only 4@S|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice result for Nickell in other room on board 6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: I believe its in their contracts when they sign on|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kit: seems like declarer always wins the race|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: leads are 2/4th for n/s|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3rd means (I have a difficult lead P)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6H is down, 6@D could make|pg||
nt|psyck: yes you will not see them make agressive partial doubles|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect lead to grow for nickell with board 7|pg||
nt|reisig: Levin wants this hand to end :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so in the end perhaps Helgy should not have X 5@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: not yet|pg||
nt|barnets: which was down |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  he's only going to allow them to play all the boards if they catch up|pg||

nt|kit: Some work looks like an understatement|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: westheimer has been ahead the three times she lost the final|pg||

pc|s3|nt|barnets: said only partially as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Let's see if I can make something here, very unlikely" - Helness|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N & 4@s make as cards are, this is better|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  to encourage incorrect club continuation by Weinstein|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  60 imps with 11 to score. The lead is very big but not yet insurmountable|pg||
nt|kit: The spade spots on this hand could prove to be interesting|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: so nerves may be a factor still|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is only 49|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfv: rare for sponsor to play last segment. |pg||
nt|ritong: i will be suspected of bad faith, but here i perso play 2@c by west, basically good hand with no clear bid, and over the 90% of the time 2@d, 4@d showing void and @s fit|pg||
nt|ritong: when direct splinter is singleton|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Sontag's 7 clubs beating the 6 in Levin's hand could be critical as well|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: declarer still has spades stopped i assume|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  making 5 now; well done|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  Maybe she kept losing when sitting out|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  In the Fantunes system opening 1 bids usually show 14+ hcp so if s opens it would be at the 2 level and the auction would be very different.|pg||

nt|henryb:  Certainly Benedicte does|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: players are taking a break|pg||
nt|reisig: Commentators too :)|pg||
nt|barnets: tks Michael|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very common with 16 board quarters to take a break halfway through, so the table is taking a rest after board 8|pg||
nt|barnets: some of these players like to smoke|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe to calm the nerves|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 I think|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  And, in fact, at the other table the auction (on 7) started with 2@d by s and w had nothing to say over that.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: but west has doubled 3@s on the second round of the bidding so EW may yet bid 4@s|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway on board 7 n/s playing only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They ended in 4@h by n.|pg||
nt|barnets: so only e few imps away|pg||
nt|reisig: 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|reisig: or 5 :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They didn't play 3 rounds of @cs off the bat so they made 5 anyway and it's only 5 imps.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: not a bad guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jxxxx @S popular overcall tonight|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: henry comment on 1@S nicely please|pg||
nt|psyck: 8 tricks after @s lead|pg||
nt|kit: This could be the third consecutive 2NT contract -- very rare|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzfv: when jenny doubled, molson was like "drats!" (silently though only jenny could see)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness asks about the j@D lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: chip replies "may not be normal, but standard"|pg||
nt|ritong: other room did not find 7@s either|pg||
nt|barnets: that is an interesting bid asking partner to bid 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: I like the treatment|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  10 hearts lead very useful for weinstein|pg||
nt|kit: Puts overcaller on lead.  3@C is chosen for the bid (rather than 3@H), so partner of overcaller can't make (or not make) lead-directeing double.|pg||
nt|reisig: Might actually make now|pg||
nt|kit: This lead allows declarer to set up third heart trick and get up to 8, but he needs to knock out ace of diamonds first.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he figures out order of play here, he can take 2 diamonds, 3 hearts, 1 club, and 3 spades :)|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has 3 hear tricks now|pg||
nt|kit: If he gets that far, he can eventually squeeze-endplay West.|pg||
nt|barnets: so the treatment has gained a trick |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spotlight is on weinstein|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: certaintly not my idea of a weak two bid|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfv: molson jotting down some notes to herself...think she wants to discuss with jill meyers later|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she wrote "when shifting to singleton against preempts..."|pg||
nt|henryb:  Since I can't say anything nice, I won't say anything|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well this hand is as close to ideal if your ever going to do it|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will make life easier for declarer, as he will prefer to finesse the clubs rather than try to guess the hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I must admit I don't understand making deceptive leads in the blind like this.  Seems too likely that they will cause partner to misjudge the hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like he has the first 8 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Thanks for the confidence, pard"|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, I thought N would go with 5 @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk/Sontag with 3 excellent decisions to not go to 3nt|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nvm she showed jenny wolpert|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe Helness should have worked out that jack of hearts not likely to be in dummy, since no need to transfer to 3NT if it were -- thus led low heart.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  agree Kit|pg||
nt|kit: But that inference isn't totally clear.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: or even better 7@c|pg||
nt|rimbus: I think 7 @s better than 7 @c|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: anyways, a thin ice contract|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzfv: this is wagar finals, so the table is screened.|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a quiet one -- matter of overtricks perhaps|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|bigtrain: jeff rubens calls that "in and out" evaluation|pg||
nt|bigtrain: great book|pg||
nt|bigtrain: secrets of winning bridge|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  of course, the play in 3nt may have gone differently|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin: I'm not thinking at trick 1 anymore|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  as he would still make eafter the opening lead if he won the first diamond|pg||
nt|warrens:  best is for E to overtake and shift back to @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can see 3@H's and 2@C's and 1@D|pg||
nt|barnets: east can duck twice|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think Weinstein can time this right.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if he plays east for honor doubleton in clubs he can get this right|pg||
nt|reisig: May take a while to play this|pg||
nt|kit: Although he can set up a club trick on power also, though that involves losing 2 club tricks.  So maybe he can.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|bigtrain: the number one book i recommend|pg||

nt|bigtrain: you crack me up andrew|pg||
nt|warrens:  impossible for N to know he had to win the @D and play on @C's|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack trick 3 was the winning play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|reisig: Now - a @c play|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein basically playing this way in case East has Ax of diamonds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  not the % play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: or diamonds 3-3.  I think he is playing it correctly, although unsuccessfully on this layout.  He doesn't think East has 4 diamonds when East known to have 6 hearts|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  routine 3nt here for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  diamond to jack is ok if diamonds 33, or 4 in helness hand, and still has possibilities for extra trick if helness had dblton ace originally|pg||

mb|3S|nt|ritong: kamil has wondered for a moment if he was good enough for 4@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sounds like you're here watching it with me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H can be bid on 0 points (at least most play that way) so south can not afford to force to game|pg||
nt|ritong: i think like him, nope   because no source of tricks apart trumps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: surprise 7 imps to fleischer when 7D went four down in open room|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think it is a 3 or 4 problem  rather 4 or 6  south does not want to lure his pard into a slam without goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: just 5 levels lower than we hoped for|pg||
nt|ritong: guess this shows @d shortage|pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: i only 2 points and 1 quick tricks short of a roth opener|pg||
nt|rimbus: lead problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: bidding 3x would show shortness|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (against 3nt)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 3N by W is virtually hopeless on likely @H lead -- might be quite different now...|pg||
nt|barnets: seamon has never passed before with those trump spots|pg||
nt|rimbus: waow|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  we proceed differently this side of the ocean|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: same|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 2@S is showing some form of @S stopper|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: most of the time 4+@S, any shape|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i missed that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I would have expected a 2NT rebid instead of 3@C, but won't affect the final contract.|pg||
nt|kit: North does not have an easy lead|pg||
nt|3for3: id bet on 5/7@S|pg||

nt|reisig: A nice calm board :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: pay up!|pg||
nt|ritong: full hit, this lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: odd that kamil did not bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, his team led comfortably|pg||
nt|ritong: in french we say " tempête sous un crâne"|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne will not be so pleased when he may make slam|pg||
nt|kit: It looks that way from our point of view, but not to declarer who doesn't know everything is behaving well.|pg||
nt|kit: It is not obvious at all how to play this hand I don't think.|pg||
nt|kit: Probably go for the heart ruff, planning on taking 6 spade tricks, 3 club tricks, 1 diamond trick.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|3for3: i thought the idea was to try to lead our 5 card suits, not theirs :)|pg||
nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||
nt|kit: also giving the opponents headaches|pg||
nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer just trying to set up long heart for tenth trick -- no risk involved|pg||
nt|rimbus: a great choice, for sure|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: on the other hand, he is threatened with long @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag: I have to think...leaves table|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  wonder what the decision will be on throwing out boards this set and if there will be a penalty, which side will it go towards?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Certainly, Sontag is not known for receiving slow play penalties :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Sontag has to think????   Yikes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Levin spills coffee on a few of the remaining boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|henryb:  the duck (quack-quack) doubleton is not an endearing feature|pg||
nt|3for3: helgemo knows he is making this.  martel not so sure|pg||
nt|3for3: this would be a good hand for the rubber bridge variation, no overtricks.  |pg||

pc|d9|nt|ritong: when AJxx is very low on the opening leads quality scale|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  2 rds trumps then start diamonds seems right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: quack is shorthand for queen-jack|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Nunes went down 2 at the other table and Nickell gained 2 more imps.|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  Knowing the opening bid is behing his cards, Weinstein slowed down and took the low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: was willing to play 43 if it came to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||
nt|rimbus: Anyway, Duboin chosed a spade lead : who is right ?|pg||
nt|ritong: the scoreboard is|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, this is a little dangerous|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 diamonds anyone?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wonder what 3@H showed /|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond lead would be quite reasonable -- by far best chance of finding partner's 5-card sut.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Some pairs, including Helness and Helgemo use 3@h for no 5 card major rather than 3nt.|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe its no 4 or 5 card major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think thats right barnet|pg||
nt|kit: I think no 4 or 5-card major.  3NT = 5 hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: This lets partner bid 3@S over 3@H with 5 spades and 4 hearts.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|kit: which is a problem distribution if playing Puppet (which I guess they are)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|leo lasota:  3C may have pushed them up a level, but declarer will duck here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
pc|s4|nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|ritong: guess he would raise that pot under different circumstances|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  heart to queen and ace here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  does he bring this in with only one diamond ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: now he just draws trumps and plays a club|pg||
pc|cA|nt|phil: Kamil cannot lead clubs however|pg||
nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think all the players from wagar finals are often on bbo. team captain for westheimer, vdoubleu, is familiar to many bboers, especially the juniors. she's involved in organizing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: special programs for kids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry i can't give technical analyses. maybe an expert will like to be commentator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers is very well accessorized. i think she has 3 necklaces on. very cool looking. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD ken van cleef just walked in. not sure what he wants. think he's just observing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh he came to drink some water :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that americans can raise on three cards has importance, too|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|xenya: actually S can even play a @D now|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he can power it home with the trump spots|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: only prob using 3N to show 5@H , you dont have a 3@S slam try and have to use 4@C as atry over 3N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|3for3: helness needed to lead club thru to break endplay|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|barnets: as 4@D is a transfer back|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|nt|phil: yeah I guess he can|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  club here|pg||
nt|kit: trump looks more threatening, but I don't see how anything matters|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  would a trump shift after winning diamond have worked any better?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|3for3: he still needs to guess who to endplay tho|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|bobholl: S doesn't know who has !K :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia said he was playing helgemo for the k|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that always seems to happen|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the problem with passing W hand, should have opened & got it off his chest|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk was caught on opening lead in losing situation of winning king clubs on air or ducking and not winning the king later|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a hair raising experience|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: also depends if they open 1@C with 5-5 blacks or 1@S|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzfv: how often have we held a good hand, only to have partner preempt. then we dont know what to bid cos only singleton in p's suit|pg||
nt|phil: no dull hands here :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like correct bid is pass :)|pg||

nt|ritong: swing coming|pg||
nt|ritong: @c slam for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: not that it is a great spot, but difficult to avoid it|pg||
nt|rimbus: or no trump ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS seem to be contributing a lot too|pg||
nt|psyck: 65 is probably a 1@s opening even for those opening 1@c with 55 like NS do|pg||
nt|warrens:  that will be an important result if Pepsi-Kweicien go to game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|grebrof: its not that a preempt like that has to be leaddirecting|pg||
nt|kit: This will be dull 3NT or 4@S -- will have to wait for another board for excitement|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Decision to directly raise spades here with 2 aces and dblton|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S using precision?|pg||
nt|warrens:  thought that promised 4|pg||
nt|kit: apparently it is permissable with them.|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe they've modified it|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  nice fitting cards here and favorable breaks result in 4 spades making for N/S|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is a 4 card heart raise|pg||
nt|reisig: Surely - 4@s here|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry our internet died and the access code didn't work. we lost 59 and losing 60 since i just returned.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by val?|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: because val is declarer right now.|pg||
nt|ritong: this won t take ages|pg||

nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||
nt|ritong: at worst K10x|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  play will go quickly here; making 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|phil: a treatment I like, but have not implemented over 4@c: |pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|rimbus: As I said, I fear a double finesse....|pg||
nt|ritong: ugliest possible dummy for francky|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: notthat europeans never do that, but americans certainly do it way more frequently|pg||

nt|grebrof: I dont think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now that casual diamond king play not looking so good|pg||
nt|barnets: an contains 2 Italians, one from france and of course 2 from norway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Cayne "Good lead"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Seamon "I practice those all the time"|pg||
nt|ritong: some relaxation after the stressing slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no time pressure at this table now|pg||
nt|barnets: so east found the killing opening lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu:  and the defense didnt take so many :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll probably get to interview mildred breed from the other room soon. very nice lady|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: check out bbo news for updates :) yep pelu lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: 3 boards to go in this set. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: well this definitely proves they're not playing Polish Club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: West might have bid some clubs there -- would have made things even more exciting|pg||
nt|phil: EW play weak NT's? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: not without an overbidder's lisence, hard to get in PA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||
nt|grebrof: not even a fitjump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: n/s described their system as 2/1 with some modifications|pg||
mb|p|nt|leo lasota:  second dbl shows extras, usually 2 spades|pg||
mb|3C|nt|3for3: big result for monaco in OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: ew do not play forcing nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does anyone know if Sontag has ever been issued a slow play penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: the ecats site notes 10-13 unvul|pg||
nt|phil: looks like a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *nonvul|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|phil: ah ha thanks|pg||
nt|ritong: north it will be, then|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfv: I played live bridge for the 2nd time ever yesterday. overbid like crazy. it was fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'll go and het coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 4@S should be the fits that weren't good enough to raise directly |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  From Helness perspective, partner may have either 5 clubs or 5 hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: Never got the @h suit involved|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The dread "do something intelligent" x.  One of the best ways to find your 3-3 fits.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
nt|kit: canape style potentially.  South doesn't know which suit is longer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showing 4+ in both suits, either 54++ or 45++|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  up for partnership discussion what 2nt would mean on this auction by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as always, Pepsi as dummy opens a thick book in Polish|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure I understand the 2@D call|pg||
nt|warrens:  nor I|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt is a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, North might have bid 3@C over 1NT, which is highly invitational.|pg||
nt|kit: The fact the South is thinking indicates that perhaps North has shown a very strong hand.|pg||
nt|kit: But he better pass, as a diamond lead defeats 3NT I believe.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but as expected, E/W had the mwethods to uncover the 8 card fit; well done|pg||
nt|reisig: Good job|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, 3NT likely to go down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
pc|h8|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
nt|barnets: Tiger just holed a 50 ft put !|pg||
nt|psyck: these players a bit faster than Fantoni etc in other room|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kit: East can comfortably discard 2 hearts and 1 spade on the run of the clubs, so nothing bad should happen.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  easy 140 here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: some very friendly banter at the table|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|barnets: anyway board 10 coming in open when they played 1@SX here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: diamond discard?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nah after patapon won the CA. next trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose it is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: diamond from dummy :)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but nowadays its likely to be bboers kibbing via their mobile apps. smartphones, tablets :)|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, now he is home|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: rosenberg has shown the @h singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: @sJ, then trump echo, showing ability to ruff|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: the heart queen play may pay dividends |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|psyck: this table may finish before they finish that board|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco only 11 down |pg||
pc|h7|nt|bigtrain: i call those time capsule conclaves|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|leo lasota:  no squeeze threat on levin here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: well...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: we do not have 13 solutions up to that point, do we?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe it confused zimmerman also|pg||
nt|ritong: not good for multon's stomach ulcer, this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher threw a card in anger, so that may have hinted at zimmermann that it was down|pg||
nt|ritong: confused or not, dummy is high|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: well, fNT is not part of basic western european bridge culture|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: when dummy came down helgemo and levin were sharing a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helness: what did i do wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: helgemo: nothing yet|pg||

nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||
nt|ritong: when, in states, it is the contrary|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't we find a closer match ?  :) :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there will certainly be alot of talk about that hand after the match if Gordon should lose|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S didn't make at other table, so match is tied!|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
nt|kit: on board 59|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
nt|ritong: both work well, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this being played wrong way|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
nt|kit: Light neg double -- Levin will surely bid 4@H|pg||
mb|3D|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Weinstein wanting to find 44 heart fit if there; plans to smolen then show 6th spade if needed; Helness/Helgemo ruin his plans somewhat but he still knows that they do not have 44 heart fit as Levin passed 2D|pg||
mb|3S|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Something to discuss with your partner, would a bid of 3 of a major be Smolen here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@s was alerted by levin|pg||
mb|3N|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he took such a low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin's hand has gotten much better on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: weinstein declarer|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes - but the alert meant something else :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: levin clearly felt this was a smolen situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: he thought 3@s showed 5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (i think)|pg||
nt|reisig: Right!|pg||
nt|barnets: this may be stronger than 2@C-2@D 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might get to game in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Perhaps it went 1D-2C-p-p-dbl-p-2h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Surprised if Levin/Weinstein do not have solid understanding here after opponents bid 2D-3D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||
nt|kit: how can Weinstein be declarer?|pg||
nt|barnets: whch is 6-4|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ace duck club|pg||
nt|reisig: New leader|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: weinstein thinks that it shouldnt be smolen situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: levin says he sees his point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: (something to do with how they bid spade hands|pg||
nt|reisig: and - I think board 14 will be 3@s by NS|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rimbus: level of five belongs to opponents, they say|pg||
nt|barnets: yes 3@S made on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  The kibs mostly agreed with Weinstein.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|barnets: ok now to make it |pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo has to keep @D5|pg||
nt|barnets: just needs a fin i think|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|medwards: heart lead would cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there's a stopclock in the room counting down available time. only 17 min left to play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|phil: I don't think 3@h was getting hurt too badly|pg||
nt|psyck: yes this will not trouble him|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a made slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play mixed raise here rather than weak'|pg||
nt|kit: is board turned around maybe?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ritong: or 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: well done e/w|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: both tables responded 1N   thought Berk-Sonty might play 1@S-3@S preempt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: would be a good time to test one round of diamonds now -- far from obvious|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if the made a weak direct raise partner may bid game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: down now|pg||
nt|phil: when dummy gets tapped he cannot avoid a loss of four tricks that I can see|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told that a ruling is possible on board 18 -- seems there was a wrong explanation by H-H in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  undo|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzfv: but only this + 1 other board so they should be fine.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and yep this board likely to increase westheimer's lead i think :)|pg||
nt|phil: I think he can lead his shoe and its down|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|kit: might as well strip the clubs and see if there is anything to be learned|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  sure q clubs was led, then spade to ten = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're not playing bd 64|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  peculiar decision to throw out bd 64... and idea if there will be an assigned penalty to either team?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: time issue at the other table...we will not play bd 64|pg||
nt|kit: no penalty -- other table is slow, so delaying board 64 -- avoid problem of playing it at one table and then throwing it out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so are we going to sit here and wait with possibility board will get played?|pg||
nt|kit: but if this match remains this close, as it might well, there is going to be a lot of discussion about pulling a board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all players have left the closed room...I don't know anything else|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Any idea what would be the deciding factor on pulling the last board or not if the match remains close Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: closeness of match doesn't matter.  It is a quesiton of if other table is too slow or not.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is an irony to this since GNT was won on last board|pg||
nt|kit: I think that is the right thing to do, assuming they might pull a board.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Is there a clock in the room with the allowtted time remaining?  Or has the board been officially pulled as the players left the table?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Match may well be decided on board 62|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on 62 they are in the same 3nt that could have made at this table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pepsi unblocked diamond king which sort of looks right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now has blanked the heart ace also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is going to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no board 64 as far as we can tell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess nickell caught up too fast for the storyline|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pepsi in 4h on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so if he makes gordon will win|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rodwell finds killing shift immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the legend continues|pg||
nt|fabsayc: go back to normal life folks, 7am PST tomorrow for the final|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 976 of you, match is over, 63 boards only|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: thanks martin. sorry about the disruptions everyone. they limit the   of internet connections and i dont have a pw |pg||
nt|phil: I'm going to give the charge to the opening lead in teh other room |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: almost played the boards in the wrong direciton|pg||
nt|fabsayc: last board of this set, thanks to our operator Kendrick, tough job if players dont cooperate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: my pleasure, sorry about some missed action. |pg||
nt|ritong: last bullet for this stanza|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: more banter after that hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  3nt normal contract for N/S here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: table has been played in extremely friendly spirit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|phil: and partially to NS's system that doesn't allow North to play 3N :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing things up|pg||
nt|barnets: last board you can all go to the open room after this and watch board 10|pg||
nt|barnets: stuck on 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher has made some very quirky preempts immediately after bad boards this set|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: and congratulations to westheimer for a well deserved win, they played very solidly in every match|pg||
nt|psyck: specs of Cayne BBO matches will be falimial with the acronym SDAM|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but there is alot of work to the play|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: 2c is something that i couldnt hear|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is quirky²|pg||
nt|xenya: and this one might make things tough for EW?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: packing their things during zimmermann's tank|pg||
nt|phil: is quirky squared "quarky"? |pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: that introduces too much physics into bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|phil: heh|pg||
nt|ritong: well we didn t mention black holes yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann floats the pass card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and to my cocommentator Henri, and everybody else that makes this all possible and enjoyable|pg||
nt|ritong: pleased to be your coco|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the alert means not bid on total junk|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: next set should starts 10-15 after both vugraphs go down|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s bid with extras...hmm|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: these women must play each other a lot. they talk in nods and meaningful glances. |pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|phil: I have one between my ears|pg||
nt|ritong: extras, yes  4@s bid, debatable|pg||
mb|r|an|good hand 2!s|nt|fabsayc: a very old american treatment|pg||
nt|psyck: routine 4M here probably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  redouble shows 9+ HCP with 2 spades I believe|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|phil: Zimmerman conducting a pass and pull sequence? I play 3@d as GF - wonder if they do too?|pg||
nt|agumperz:  i have often felt like i fell into one at the slower vugraph tables...|pg||
nt|ritong: he will bid 4@s imo|pg||
nt|ritong: my point is 5332 is not superincentive|pg||
nt|ritong: i would quietly single raise and await|pg||
nt|psyck: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|barnets: 5! D a good save|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c  P  3nT?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  seems reasonable rich|pg||
mb|3C|nt|grebrof: this is last of 4 sessions, so I dont think Fleisher has given up yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *first|pg||
nt|grebrof: first, sorry :D|pg||
nt|ritong: pass and cue|pg||
nt|phil: surprised he didn't bd 4@s initially|pg||
nt|ritong: even stronger than pass and pull:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or pass the double|pg||
nt|phil: that shows a moose |pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
nt|phil: I count 5 for NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: results at http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2012/02/spingold/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fantunes had nice auction to 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Oo|pg||
nt|ritong: oole|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: now that's a cue|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@S would be without the club king|pg||
nt|psyck: (Six Diamonds Always Makes)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes tx for your many humorous and sometimes helpful comments|pg||
nt|rimbus: A great segment for Hel2|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very friendly spade position will result in 3nt making for Weinstein with some ease|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: pass and jump cue|pg||
nt|phil: whatever 5@s shows - he doesn't have it|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: with Multon's I would want to bid 8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again Kendrick and Henri|pg||
nt|psyck: after their attempts at 6@c failed, they found the correct stratefy...|pg||
nt|barnets: well done by north|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  pretty much an open book for the declarer play|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I need a coffee - my screen is not often this blue :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  spec tx to our opereator u hacve done a superb job - spec with all the informations from the table TX!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers finally got to declare! molson says "i cant let you go a whole sgment without declaring"|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C in open worth watching|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 45  Monaco leads Cayne by 76|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzfv: ty ty see all later|pg||
nt|grebrof: its just as good as 4@s - choice of slam with a void - I have everything|pg||
nt|psyck: is that the strongest bid ever made?|pg||
nt|ritong: might be|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe this will scare off a double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: thanks for watching this segment and bearing with me. |pg||
nt|rimbus: and zimmul were close to put a last nail in the coffin|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  with spade queen being discovered to be onside, west is marked with ace heart and king club |pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfv: doesnt look like this has a chance :(|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bye for now|pg||
nt|ritong: no swing anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He has not made it yet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No-one told him that spades are 8-1|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is he will duplicate rosenberg's line|pg||
nt|phil: some perceptive commentators tell me 7N makes |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: multon asks if double is 100% penalty, fleisher, does an air "knock-on-wood"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: play continues with semi-finals tomorrow at 7am PST, 10am east coast|pg||
nt|barnets: another miserable slam here not worth watching I am afraid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 5@C didn't deter them from slam, unfortunately|pg||
nt|barnets: unless of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry that was Sementa-Duboin bidding to 6@D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: south bids|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: and a phantom sacrifice...|pg||
nt|barnets: oh my G|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|medwards: Hopr I was useful|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: of cos mikes. you stepped up to comment. its always nice to have commentators add flavor to the match. if only we can also have cameras :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7:15 eastern|pg||
nt|barnets: of course 2@HX by west would have been no fun at all for e/w|pg||
nt|barnets: played by east of course|pg||
nt|barnets: vul v not|pg||
nt|barnets: had south found some kind of X and north passed|pg||
nt|barnets: not entirely unreasonable I think|pg||
nt|reisig: For me - X = I have a real hand - and not one of my usual overcalls at fav Vul :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|psyck: yes play in 6@c deal 10 would be interesting|pg||
nt|psyck: but we have a 7@c to watch here instead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I know you wont double this one" (Lays down 7@D) -Cayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we pity the people who don't listen to voice commentary -- you missed some great stories from John Swanson|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|medwards: probaby will happen in the future|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: next segment will start in a bit....dont go too far :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|psyck: so open two windows kibs :)|pg||
nt|barnets: Helgemo must know his customers , I say|pg||

nt|phil: I think a club wrecks it|pg||
nt|ritong: as the @h Q falls during the process, 13|pg||
nt|reisig: round suit squ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: kills the split menace|pg||
nt|barnets: well its 800|pg||
nt|ritong: so, can cayne save a downtrick?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room bidding final board|pg||
nt|bigtrain: bidding slam it looks like|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule says restart in 7 minutes but   don't expect it to begin that soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein might be playing 6@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: looks like 6@C at the other table|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: at least some tables will have voice commentary|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade exit best for the defense at this point|pg||
nt|barnets: will be short break after this hand tx all specs Michael , our operator,Rich, Leo and Joe|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|barnets: instead of 200 other way|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: other table hasn't finishe dyet|pg||
nt|grebrof: they on the last board now|pg||
nt|grebrof: bbo is also available as an app now|pg||
nt|grebrof: btw|pg||
nt|grebrof: an app is an application for a telephone - its at least available for andriod - maybe also for iPhone|pg||
nt|ritong: i think yes|pg||
pc|d3|nt|psyck: DD 6@c would make on any lead on deal 10...lets see what happens in practice|pg||
nt|barnets: South playing 6@C on spade lead |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Helgemo can pretty much see all 4 hands, and regrets that there is no way to set the hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|barnets: open room playing 2@DX here so worth watching|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  dist is marked|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  heart to king, club to 10, cash q, cash heart heart spade to bd|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  430|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s found a way to get the penalty in open after same start|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  At the other table Nickell (w) opened 1@d rather than 1@c and ended in 2@dx'd.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|ritong: guess we wxill have the hel's angels for the last stanza|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous|pg||
nt|rimbus: Bye all and see you soon|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: final table of other match on 47|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when both matches playing same boards, vugraph can't restart until BOTH matches ready|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin-Weinstein did indeed stop in 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will probably have different matchups for the final set|pg||
