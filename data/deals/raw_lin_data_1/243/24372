nt|malipivo:  Hawaii in trumps is not nice for the declarer, to be honest.|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  this is preempting partner, but we shall see how it turns out|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nic by im nie pomóg³ jak widaæ|pg||
mb|3C|nt|coolbeans:  This is a highlight match for the Youngsters series. USA 1 and USA 2 are title hopefuls|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Not too much|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Just some fast forwarding through boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  double will help Norway, so pass is expected|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: wychodzimy na prowadzenie|pg||
nt|malipivo:  this cannot be make as far as I can see|pg||
mb|p|nt|deltadash: why did we do that, do you know?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Good pass by North.  We so frequently see high card doubles on 4333 hands.  I dislike that style.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|malipivo:  what a match we are watching!|pg||
nt|deltadash: do you know all these guys?|pg||
nt|joecritter:  I joke that I take credit for creating the Soukup Berk monster. Berk's father was competing in the GNT's so I got to teach him the last part of 2/1 he needed. A day later he played with Soukup, slaughtering me and his father in the process|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I make those doubles on occasion.  Mostly depends on my mood :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  And defense didn't slipped.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  North's pass will leave little clue to the location of the high cards.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|malipivo:  6@s would be down as well, a club and a trump.|pg||
nt|deltadash: that'll teach you, Joe :)|pg||
nt|joecritter:  Lets just say the punchline was down 5 doubled vul, then David goes, "You revoked on trick 3"|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  They are fast-rising Juniors. I remember when I first met them, and they have made incredible progress since then|pg||

nt|joecritter:  they can be up to 26. Please dont call them girls for crying out loud|pg||
nt|deltadash: ROFL!!!|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  The other person, Alexander Prairie, will be probably be on one of these teams in the next Congress|pg||
nt|joecritter:  I was truly surprised he wasn't this time. |pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Well, with the firepower you see in this match, you can see why|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  A lot of talent left off of the teams|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joecritter:  When I was GNT-C in 2010, I ran into the Jeng brothers. Beat them, but it was their teammates fault|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Yes, the Jeng team|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  They are missing one person|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Zandy Rizzo|pg||
