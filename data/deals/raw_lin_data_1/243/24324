nt|kfay: When I look up Lorenzini/Coudert CC on google it pulls up an article on Cholangiocarcinoma.... I get too much of that during school I came here for a break.|pg||
nt|minimeck: I am informed that this is a new partnership, some of these cue bid sequences can get pretty ambiguous|pg||
nt|jchiu: it could have come a bit earlier as top American player suggests "what else could 3@C be but a transfer?"|pg||
nt|minimeck: My sources also tell me 3@c was some sort of artifical ask of some kind, still|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably there is a director at the table after all.  |pg||
nt|minimeck: It would be very unlike Kevin to think this long on a lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: I would agree with that guess :)|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|jchiu: i generally have the rule if you upgrade a 19 count, partner transfers into your five card major, i superaccept|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I don't agree -- the length value of your 5-card suit is now duplicated|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: if for nothing else than to keep pace with those who opened 1@H, or a precision club, and got to game opposite a shapely yarb|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Well, almost routine 4@H anyway|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|kfay: I think the French generally play that they only accept a transfer here with a fit.  On this pair's CC it reads "Transfer and rectification with fit."  I'm not sure if that means ...|pg||
nt|kfay: they play this way or not.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jchiu: but at these colours, you are betting partner is effectively mirrored for the shortness around not to work better|pg||
nt|minimeck: Seems people are stretching to play 3nt with major suit fits much more these days, does this seem a bit much with a 10 carder?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|minimeck: 1nt semiforcing here, easy pass for cedric with 11 5332|pg||

nt|minimeck: :) as i tell my partners kit, then you play semiforcing, but exactly|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|kit: of course|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|kfay: True.  Lorenzini might've made a more careful bid of 3@H.|pg||

mb|2C|nt|minimeck: surely if he starts 2@c and bids hearts east will be off to the races|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@H 2 controls maybe?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|kfay: Kit do you think this is a 2@C opener or a 1@H opener?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: 2@C looks fine to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|kfay: Meaning you don't have a strong opinion?|pg||
nt|jchiu: 2@C though i like to open one often|pg||
nt|kit: the auction doesn't figure to go very smoothly if you open 1@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jchiu: right, drury or a truly nonforcing notrump can be hard to navigate|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kit: And if partner has a yarb, so you get to a bad game -- sometimes they make|pg||
nt|jchiu: surely keycard would have been easier here|pg||
nt|jchiu: or a 4@D cuebid|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure trying to cue bid this one out here would be my choice, is he looking 4 7 by cue bidding, otherwise why not just bid rkc? |pg||
nt|kfay: The control sequence is very poor after the 2@H-3@H start.  I remember I used to play it in a former partnership and we had to have some discussions about opener's rebid when he ...|pg||
nt|kfay: actually held hearts.  I seem to recall that we thought a jump to 4@H should be forcing, but I can't say I remember much about it now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|kit: I guess not so easy after all|pg||
nt|kfay: It's hard to believe that 4@H here specifically agrees hearts, but perhaps that's what they've come up with.  Obviously it still led to some confusion here as to the power of the E ...|pg||
nt|kfay: hand.|pg||
nt|minimeck: the french nightmare continues, |pg||
pc|sK|nt|jchiu: another disaster for system. i have long advocated the best juniors are those who play a natural system well|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|kfay: Perhaps he should have splintered 5@C over 3@H, W could bid 5@D, and then E maybe could bid slam.  Alternatively I think E could probably just bid keycard over 3@H if he knew ...|pg||
nt|kfay: things were going to be ambiguous.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Do we know what the meaning of 2@H was?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jchiu: when i played, France, Israel and the United States were among those teams who played naturally and well|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Kevin, but most players don't like splintering above 4 of the trump suit.|pg||
mc|12|nt|jchiu: and juniors today are overly preoccupied with artificiality at the expense of these situations under pressure|pg||

nt|jchiu: except on rare hands as this ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|jchiu: well, maybe after the last couple hands, they remembered about keycard|pg||

mb|p|nt|minimeck: once again wrong-sided :)|pg||
nt|kfay: East was more endplayed into bidding 3NT on this hand than in the previous instance.|pg||
nt|minimeck: maybe 4@h here the winner?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: East might have tried 3@S, figuring that if West had nothing in spades then 3NT not so good|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jchiu: that would work, but they are unfortunately past the point of no rreturn now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|minimeck: an extra 100 here not likely to cost that much|pg||

nt|kit: Really?????|pg||
nt|jchiu: did Dwyer really duck that?|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, perhaps dwyer could not invision this holding with no double of 2@s, but still shocking|pg||
nt|kfay: Maybe West might have bid something other than 2@H at his 2nd turn.  2@s or 3@H, although 2@S probably would have led to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he won the ace|pg||
nt|jchiu: phew|pg||
nt|kfay: Actually 2@H seems a little strange.|pg||
nt|kfay: Well not strange, but... something :P|pg||
nt|minimeck: as kfay mentioned at the start of the match, these are accomplished french players, they will need to go back to the drawing board. |pg||
nt|jchiu: yeah he's catching up after that, rather than taking the room to show his mild extras with 3@C or 3@H|pg||
nt|jchiu: i would not count the French out, one bad set in a long tournament is fine|pg||
mc|6|nt|kfay: For anyone wondering about the format it's a complete round robin between the 17 teams followed by an 8-team knockout.|pg||
nt|jchiu: 20 teams|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he tried passing the jack of hearts to explain the extra undertrick|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, losing the first match by such a margin by no means seals any fate, it simply increases the average vp's you will need to q in that 8 spot, with 20 teams will be tough. |pg||
nt|jchiu: this may dent their seeding rights, but i'll bet anyone a raki they'll qualify|pg||
nt|minimeck: Thanks again all, see everyone in 90 minutes :)|pg||
nt|jchiu: barring a couple quite weak teams, you only need 16 odd to qualify, this raises that about 60bp|pg||
