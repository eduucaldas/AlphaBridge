nt|minimeck: Surely Cedric could not be thinking of bidding, he has a decent hand but his pard is passed?|pg||

nt|minimeck: The score for board two has now been fixed :) we should be up to date now|pg||
nt|jchiu: they're certainly on the brink of getting too high, barring what we used to call hippopotamus (not to be confused with our keycard accidents)|pg||

nt|kfay: I would be surprised if there weren't a director at the table right now.|pg||
nt|minimeck: can any of our french kibs inform us as to the partnership of EW |pg||
nt|kfay: When I look up Lorenzini/Coudert CC on google it pulls up an article on Cholangiocarcinoma.... I get too much of that during school I came here for a break.|pg||
nt|minimeck: I am informed that this is a new partnership, some of these cue bid sequences can get pretty ambiguous|pg||
nt|jchiu: it could have come a bit earlier as top American player suggests "what else could 3@C be but a transfer?"|pg||
nt|minimeck: My sources also tell me 3@c was some sort of artifical ask of some kind, still|pg||
nt|kfay: Probably there is a director at the table after all.  |pg||
nt|minimeck: It would be very unlike Kevin to think this long on a lead|pg||

nt|minimeck: do these defenses use some sort of lebensohl variant?|pg||
nt|jchiu: i read  2 from the 20 page pamphalet, it does; Martel-Stansby from the 50 page tome also does|pg||

nt|kit: the auction doesn't figure to go very smoothly if you open 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: right, drury or a truly nonforcing notrump can be hard to navigate|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|kit: And if partner has a yarb, so you get to a bad game -- sometimes they make|pg||
nt|jchiu: surely keycard would have been easier here|pg||
nt|jchiu: or a 4@D cuebid|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure trying to cue bid this one out here would be my choice, is he looking 4 7 by cue bidding, otherwise why not just bid rkc? |pg||
nt|kfay: The control sequence is very poor after the 2@H-3@H start.  I remember I used to play it in a former partnership and we had to have some discussions about opener's rebid when he ...|pg||

pc|s5|nt|kit: I guess not so easy after all|pg||
nt|kfay: It's hard to believe that 4@H here specifically agrees hearts, but perhaps that's what they've come up with.  Obviously it still led to some confusion here as to the power of the E ...|pg||
nt|kfay: hand.|pg||
nt|minimeck: the french nightmare continues, |pg||

pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|kfay: Perhaps he should have splintered 5@C over 3@H, W could bid 5@D, and then E maybe could bid slam.  Alternatively I think E could probably just bid keycard over 3@H if he knew ...|pg||
nt|kfay: things were going to be ambiguous.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|kit: Do we know what the meaning of 2@H was?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jchiu: when i played, France, Israel and the United States were among those teams who played naturally and well|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Kevin, but most players don't like splintering above 4 of the trump suit.|pg||

nt|minimeck: maybe 4@h here the winner?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: East might have tried 3@S, figuring that if West had nothing in spades then 3NT not so good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|nt|jchiu: that would work, but they are unfortunately past the point of no rreturn now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|minimeck: an extra 100 here not likely to cost that much|pg||

nt|jchiu: did Dwyer really duck that?|pg||
nt|minimeck: wow, perhaps dwyer could not invision this holding with no double of 2@s, but still shocking|pg||
nt|kfay: Maybe West might have bid something other than 2@H at his 2nd turn.  2@s or 3@H, although 2@S probably would have led to the same contract.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure he won the ace|pg||
nt|jchiu: phew|pg||

nt|kfay: Well not strange, but... something :P|pg||
nt|minimeck: as kfay mentioned at the start of the match, these are accomplished french players, they will need to go back to the drawing board. |pg||
nt|jchiu: yeah he's catching up after that, rather than taking the room to show his mild extras with 3@C or 3@H|pg||
nt|jchiu: i would not count the French out, one bad set in a long tournament is fine|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kfay: For anyone wondering about the format it's a complete round robin between the 17 teams followed by an 8-team knockout.|pg||
nt|jchiu: 20 teams|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he tried passing the jack of hearts to explain the extra undertrick|pg||
nt|minimeck: Indeed, losing the first match by such a margin by no means seals any fate, it simply increases the average vp's you will need to q in that 8 spot, with 20 teams will be tough. |pg||
nt|jchiu: this may dent their seeding rights, but i'll bet anyone a raki they'll qualify|pg||
nt|minimeck: Thanks again all, see everyone in 90 minutes :)|pg||
