nt|jchiu: good evening Howard|pg||
nt|hackenbush: good evening Jason|pg||
nt|hackenbush: these are the junior girls from USA and France|pg||
nt|hackenbush: some of them have boyfriends also playing in China|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Kevin Dwyer and Cedric Lorenzini for Ortega and Thizy respectively|pg||
nt|jchiu: so that's how they're spending the off day (01 aug) ?|pg||
nt|jchiu: Ortega played for Venezuela as recently as March 2011|pg||
nt|jchiu: and has since emigrated to central florida|pg||
nt|hackenbush: well both the US and France junior teams are favored to make it to the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|hackenbush: yes, she played in the last Venice Cup for Venezuela|pg||
nt|jchiu: a mutual friend of ours recently informed me they are qualifying only four|pg||
nt|hackenbush: ah, change in conditions|pg||
nt|jchiu: but even after that, the juniors in amsterdam|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Hi all|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|hackenbush: enough gossip, these ladies are here to play some bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jchiu: and a routine enough four spade hand|pg||
nt|johnjones:  The girls Round Robin will cut to four teams yes|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jchiu: likely coming in with twelve tricks when nothing works|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|hackenbush: a lucky make for 6 but they won't venture that far|pg||
nt|jchiu: this should be a quick chance for all of us waking up in europe, staying awake in the states to grab another coffee|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|joecritter:  Given Ortega just coming to the US and Shi being a relative newcomer to competitive bridge (ACBL 2011 Rookie of the Year), how established of a partnership is this?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jchiu: Ortega looking for a bit of magic, but with only a 4@H cuebid available to Shi, there should be no further action|pg||
nt|hackenbush: they formed their partnership this year, for this event|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|johnjones:  Luz likes her C holding given Sylvia's 1C opening bid|pg||
nt|jchiu: having played thrice for the united states, in officially sponsored junior internationals, and formed a partnership the month of the qualifier each time, this is not surprising|pg||
nt|jchiu: still very rosy with 5.5 nearly six losers|pg||
pc|d4|nt|johnjones:  This partnership was pretty solid during the selection process and practice events|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hackenbush: an aggressive drive to slam off of a diamond control|pg||
nt|jchiu: as it is, it requires two favourable breaks, and a diamond finesse ... about 25%|pg||
nt|jchiu: well Ortega had one|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|malipivo:  In the Girls series, the qualifier will be played as a double round robin of 16-board matches, producing the top four teams. The knockout stage consists of the semifinals and the final and playoff for third place.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The Open Room is in 4@sS.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  We are in the early stages of the round robin playing 16 boards.|pg||

nt|jchiu: east west rate to bid spades, north south find their club fit and find it a level too high|pg||
nt|jchiu: one is clear|pg||
nt|jchiu: not a whole lot texture, a bit of defence, and four spades can cause partner to overcompete|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hackenbush: yes, 4@s would be more attractive with @h and @c reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jchiu: and QJ109xxx of spades ... that way you dont know you're beating 4@H|pg||
nt|hackenbush: though opposite a passed hand, one could make more wide-ranging preempts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jchiu: a bit surprisng Canonne did not try 3N or 4@C|pg||
nt|johnjones:  1S would probably be her choice if partner wasn't  PH|pg||

nt|joecritter:  I resemble that remark...|pg||
nt|jchiu: hands fit a bit poorly, and the club is off, so eleven tricks except on a such a lead|pg||
nt|hackenbush: some pairs use another bid (3NT) to show a better raise to 4@h, such as north's hand, 5 trumps and an outside card|pg||

nt|malipivo:  21-9 VP for Netherlands at the moment.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridgegoth: I have a wonderful track record of horrible predictions, no matter how basic they may seem. If I say you will make a hand, be worried.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Of course! :)|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Well, with the eastern coast being past midnight, it is now time for the Olympics :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|coolbeans:  I am surprised W did not open 3S at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  As clubs are 3-3 this is a piece of cake. I am wishing them to bid it!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I know 1 thing... i wouldn't pass 3@Hx|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Shall we see 6@sX?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or just 5@d|pg||
mb|2H|nt|malipivo:  And MagdalÃ©na TichÃ¡ in offense!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: When both sides have a fit, low level Xs so rarely work, even at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  And Czech fans are standing and waiting for big hit. :)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I would be very surprised if W gives up here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Even small slam is a plus score for Netherlands!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  7@s in cold heart, any voters?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We are watching astonishing bridge!|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I might just try Blackwood with W hand, not ideal, but then again, what is?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: PM me your suggestions, if I like it i'll post it!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, it would work perfectly.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Gotten a suggestion for a blast off to 6@S, thats possible, if there is a killing lead, harder for them to find.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I don't see a killing lead.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Right we of course know there isn't one, but they don't|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Well, even diamonds behave.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: as a very good raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so he do|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: and rather 6@d|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: but still not very clear|pg||
mb|2N|nt|malipivo:  5@d would be cheap for N-S if they find slam in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|johnjones:  The agressive 1S overcall by Isha is not really her style, but is on target on this hand.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  It will get Taylor off to the best lead of a S versus a NT contract.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I think she's becoming a little more aggressive to compensate|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|coolbeans:  W goes to game after E makes a non-forcing 3S bid after W has already described his hand. Gotta love IMPs|pg||
mb|p|pc|s9|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
nt|joecritter:  A second lie to make up for the first one?|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Two wrongs make a right :)?|pg||

pc|s7|nt|coolbeans:  Sadly, there is no way to capture the whole Spade suit|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||
nt|MolvaM: well bid laydown slam with only 23 hcp|pg||

nt|johnjones:  Our training programs for junior international teams could be upgraded.  Amd we could adverise our junior programs better.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|MolvaM: last 2 hands, the defence slipped in the last few tricks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  and a club attack from East|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarers could have gone down but the defence let the contracts thru|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  What a hand|pg||

nt|johnjones:  It looks like we are having technical problems again|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, it was very unpleasant other room too|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bridgegoth: Polish or precision @C?|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Surely 2H wasn't bid|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I would assume not|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 2@S more likely|pg||
nt|johnjones:  2C would be fine also.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  even 2@d would be better :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Compton asked for an undo. After some consideration she thought 2@H was a wee bit wet :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  we believe so.  The operator did an "undo", but then put 2H back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not 2@H again :)|pg||
nt|ritong: internet is magic, but we are demanding:) when it goes somewhat wrong we get ceazy|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  You better believe it!|pg||
nt|ritong: this is a pure creation lol|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I'm predicting 2C when it gets sorted out.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: vugraph software may allow "illegal" auctions like this since in real life, insufficient bids can be accepted. I have a similar BBO screenshot saved from an earlier vugraph|pg||
nt|ritong: pity, because this hand is interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is nothing illegal about 2@H. Unwise perhaps but not illegal|pg||
nt|hackenbush: I mean the 2nd 2@h, by east|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Obviously 13 tricks in NT, hearts or clubs are easy, but grands with exactly 13 tricks are tough.|pg||
nt|ritong: that was exactly our comment other room|pg||
nt|ritong: great minds drink alike, they say|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Even a small slam requires a decent auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: good to remember that you must be alert until the last trick|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  That makes the Club lead a lot easier to find|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NL juniors bid 7NT against Israel after the Israelis saved in 7@S over 7@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Precision apparently|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the bidding is probably different than what we can see other room|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  This can go down on perfect defense|pg||
nt|joecritter:  There's the David Soukup I know|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Does E find the K of H lead?|pg||
pc|sK|mc|13|nt|malipivo:  even a diamond lead is dangerous|pg||
