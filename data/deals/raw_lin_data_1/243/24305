mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: Welcome back everyone. |pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|3for3: Hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good day all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|osvaill83: probably start with a routine 3nt :)|pg||
nt|kit: hi Danny|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi everyone, sorry for earlier snafu. :) the ladies are ready and alert.|pg||
nt|psyck: not likely to bid much higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: only (sort of) surprise yesterday was 3rd seed Diamond being beaten by Levine - allthou they also have a strong team - this event  surely has a lot of strong players|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: how guys|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi guys|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thought a long time before making her 2S bid.|pg||
nt|kit: So much for the routine 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H not at all forward going|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: ok, 1st prediction down the drain, EW go for blood|pg||
nt|phil: hi everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|phil: same lead in OR|pg||
nt|psyck: didn't expect 2@s from S|pg||
nt|ritong: the contract does not present any choice|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|psyck: that seems to have helped EW find the game|pg||
nt|barnets: and 4@H is a good contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Welcome back all|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfv: all the way up?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfv: This segment will have 16 boards. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Jenny looks gorgeous when she is deep in thought. Hopefully gavin (of bridgewinners.com) can share a pic of them soon.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: this will take a lot of good guessing to make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil: Rosenberg ducked, diamond returned...not that anything really matters on this layout|pg||
nt|barnets: making most of the time when opener has @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: East really had a 3@H bid countng @SK as a trick|pg||
pc|c4|nt|3for3: Might it be a good message to go for blood on first board?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: Declarer has 4 trump tricks and a spade trick.  The sixth trick will depend on the spade guess.|pg||
nt|riccho:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|xenya: can get out for -2|pg||
nt|ritong: so first blood to zimboum|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nice quiet board to start|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: and he is likely to get spades right|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzfv: darn i actually have the seating all wrong |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh nevermind its corect|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead often right on low-level double partial, and even though it may have cost a trump trick the trick comes back from preventing ruffs.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|grebrof: lead perfect|pg||
nt|pelu:  CC for EW: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012europeanteams-dublin/openteams/monaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, not sure if there are comentators|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H natursl GF|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|barnets: in fact in other room east cued an raised to 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: doubling and bidding over a minimum response already showed a big hand...|pg||
nt|warrens:  once S won the K of @Cs (the normal play), it seemed likely that Levin would guess the @S's correctly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|kit: Now declarer has to read the spade position.  East has shown up with king of clubs, and didn't open the bidding.  |pg||
nt|kit: Also, even if he gets it right, danger of being forced in hearts and not able to enjoy the second spade trick.|pg||
nt|3for3: still leaves 7/8 points in his hand somewhere|pg||
nt|3for3: win 4/ lose 2 depending on that 6th trick|pg||
nt|barnets: a big diff in valuation |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: same contract in open room|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, there's an inference when North doesn't lead a @S that he might have the Ace.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: Zia has chosen to not play spades and hope the opponents have to break the suit.  But I don't think they will have to do so.|pg||
nt|3for3: cant he ruff this and exit heart?|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I guess he can -- or ruff this, ruff heart, exit with diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: hi again, ken|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|hT|nt|kit: Or he can just keep discarding -- both lines work.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much to go on here, club and diamond queens might be switched|pg||
nt|warrens:  N/S missed the chance to sacrifice in 4@S|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: players now discussing the board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: now they've picked up their cards.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: levin says "we should just play open notes"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: catch up board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hello. only score is accurate cos we started late|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: hi|pg||
nt|psyck: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: players cracking jokes about their no trump overcalls|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria cued and bid 3@H closer to the valuation I think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@C = 1-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D asks Q|pg||
mb|1C|nt|phil: so what to open on an 8-4 :)? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil: you don't see these hands in textbooks|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: west hand not ideal for 2nt overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually its cos this table has to connect after the other table, and our players started playing way before the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: multon will find this weird, but...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann thinking about a major lead, asks if 1N can contain a 5cM|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5NT trumpQ +1 king|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: so 4@H in open also|pg||
mb|2S|nt|fabsayc: shape ok, but a lot of defense|pg||
mb|3D|nt|phil: Zimmerman had to be tempted to bid 6@d here|pg||
nt|phil: it cant be that expensive, and who knows who makes what? |pg||
nt|phil: yet, partner's 5@d made them guess|pg||
nt|phil: maybe East should x 5@h?  he has some surprise defense|pg||
nt|phil: although I'm not really clear what a w/w 5m opening is supposed to show|pg||
nt|phil: but definitely not KQTx in a side major :)|pg||
nt|phil: NS appear to have four losers, but it seems like they would have a hard time taking all four|pg||
nt|phil: give east Axxx of clubs, and 6@d actually makes - but so does 6M (probably)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: do we know what fleischer's double shows|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: if defense cashes out, declarer down 1.  if they dont, declarer will try diamond hook and go off 2|pg||
nt|kit: After spade and a spade, East can't really play to set up diamonds by ruffing since 2 of hearts is dummy's third heart|pg||
nt|kit: So he might take diamond finesse and go down 2.|pg||
nt|kit: On the other hand, if Martel doesn't have the king of diamonds it seems like he should find the club shift.|pg||
nt|3for3: with it, no reason to, unless declarer has KQx@S|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, declarer could be KQx, AQJxxxx, --, xxx.|pg||
nt|grebrof: ruffing out the K of @d i clearly a better chance than the cut with @s switch|pg||
nt|grebrof: continuance I mean|pg||
nt|kit: This shows the danger of the ambiguous 10 of spades lead when it might be interior sequence and might be top -- partner often doesn't know which to play for.|pg||
nt|phil: this will compress one of the losers|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 6@C should be gran slam interest asking about @C holding|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: those interested in voice commentary pls go to www.bridgebase.com and use the new bbo version. henry bethe is commenting|pg||
nt|ritong: there is room for one jack in multon's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: I don't think W can try 3N, will likely bid on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: at that point, nothing makes|pg||
nt|warrens:  N's double shows @D's and @H tolerance, so it's easy for Berkowitz to bid 3@D vulnerable|pg||
pc|h9|nt|barnets: he does not know partner has just 1 club|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to stop in a @d partial after 2@c anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: closed room lineup is the same as the 2nd session|pg||
nt|warrens:  this can't be beaten if declarer reads the cards right.  has to hold up once in @H's and finesse the @C 10|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kit: I think Martel will just come back a spade -- bigger danger declarer has ace of clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: just penalty worth hand|pg||
nt|ritong: your lead, michael|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fell asleep|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: must've not caught the 1@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: and is hoping clubs run|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: zimmerman double was either brave or foolhardy|pg||
nt|ritong: a small swing to fleisher, presumably|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin will likely do just that Warren|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: south might pass other room, 1NT west swish  @s lead 90|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: wrong again|pg||
nt|phil: so an undoubled vulnerable save against a making 5@d'|pg||
pc|s5|nt|3for3: even playing 0/2 leads, wouldn't know if his honor was Q or K|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kit: Anyway, this speeds things up.|pg||
nt|ritong: when this will go down 2 effortless|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry, something went weird and they went x, -1 instead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|xenya: i'm really surprised W didn't bid 6@D|pg||
nt|phil: my daughter was getting her wisdom teeth out during the 1Q - looks like I missed some interesting boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: very interesting boards on the 1Q|pg||
nt|phil: well, its not like -2 is a great possibility|pg||
nt|ritong: so i presume south overcalled|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Levin will cash all the @S's to get a better count.  in the end he'll finesse|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  With Berk marked with just the KQ hearts and jack clubs thusfar, Levin will know that the only other HCP are the Q diamonds; Berk has overcalled and taken free 3D bid; therefore he will play for 55 shape in Berk's hand rather than 1543|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: Levin in the tank|pg||
nt|warrens:  Levin is a terrific declarer, but he's going to put us to sleep.  A card, PLEASE.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Head in his hands...cards on the table|pg||
nt|warrens:  same line at the other table.  Declarer did get it right by finessing in @C's.|pg||

nt|ritong: his game prospects are thin|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: They have a lot of high cards for sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *just -1|pg||
nt|ritong: nonetheless...|pg||
nt|reisig: This looks like 4@s X|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Funny comment by Levin there... Not sure if any bridge player could ever play too fast for Sontag :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Kamil bid 5@d (and why shouldn't he?) the spades would have been buried|pg||
nt|phil: now Zimmerman can pattern out|pg||
nt|warrens:  this might go down 800 if the defense stays off of @C's|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  500 on a @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: they like their 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: The 2@C overcall will keep them out of any slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin concerned about possibly missing vul slam here if he passes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: true, but from helgemo's POV cant east hace a stiff club?|pg||
nt|barnets: this a better 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: will correct 34|pg||
nt|reisig: @c will NOT be led|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  But in the end, he makes good decision to pass and take the plus score|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Weinstein will high low in trump here, to show his @H king |pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he though partner had heart support I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 5@H was a bold bid, in the jaws of unfavourable vulnurability |pg||
nt|phil: yeah - along with some nice defense too|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: solo|pg||
nt|xenya: all in all well done by both sides on the last hand|pg||
nt|phil: agree|pg||
nt|phil: 4@h does not handle well|pg||
nt|phil: he's tapped down to parity at T1|pg||
nt|xenya: unlike 4@S?|pg||
nt|phil: if hearts break OK, he can manage 4H + 5S + 1C and doesn't need the club hook|pg||
nt|phil: in spades can't you take 5S in hand, 3 ruffs in dummy plus two aces? |pg||
nt|xenya: unless they lead a trump|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N didn't get in -- still, S found a @C lead against 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: he can, but even then there might not be 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|phil: yes that may cause difficulties - but maybe declarer can make something out of the heart suit then|pg||
nt|ritong: awful hand to lead from|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|3for3: q of clubs was the q of hearts, and slam is laydown|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "We have some bad news" - Cayne|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to admit i would have accepted the invite|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and would have been wrong on this hand|pg||
pc|s4|nt|barnets: 6@C poor contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  +800 for E/W here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 15-17 as far as i know|pg||
nt|warrens:  he wants his partner to know it's safe to shift to @H's from the King|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, went for 800 at the other table.  likely same thing here.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bigtrain: but N is way better than 15|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: needs to guess the spades|pg||
nt|kit: I don't really see What Helgemo can bid but 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are in sync with open room, almost equivalent auctions|pg||
nt|reisig: 800 as expected -  is a push |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|3for3: of course east has some other big assets too; like the 5th trump|pg||
nt|grebrof: or the @C Q was the @c A ;)|pg||
nt|kit: A Q-bid would presumably be searching for best strain, so that won't help|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe 5@S, focusing attention on club control at the slight risk of going down there.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: K&R = 16.55|pg||
nt|bigtrain: spot cards are huge here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: takes little more than the @DQ onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Rodwell almost ready to play...|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer might play @Cs now, hoping for Hx in East|pg||
pc|h3|nt|psyck: but the finesses are in :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|phil: so there may be some counters - hard to say who comes out on top|pg||
nt|phil: but overall 4@s looks worlds better than 4@h|pg||
nt|phil: ruffing looks a little better here - the diamond suit is tied up if he does|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ritong: in reality, zia passed the 12 count as east, south opened 1NT, was left there and apprently made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, they |pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead needs a red king guess and club guess|pg||
nt|psyck: likely down as may not take @c fin|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfv: 1 less finesse needed|pg||
nt|barnets: the percentage in clubs is from the top|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: in any case, i wholly agree with what you said about the 2N bid, Phil -- E's hand just doesn't qualify|pg||
nt|warrens:  that was his only entry to dummy, so he had to try right away|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|phil: but if he draws the last trump, what does he pitch from dummy? |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|psyck: excellent, then went up from 25 % to 50 % :)|pg||
nt|ritong: cayne: "ow"|pg||

nt|xenya: W"S rather|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|s8|pg||

nt|3for3: the danger of 3d round overruff if partner has xx of clubs and no jack of spades is quite real tho|pg||
nt|barnets: note Cayne played low on club without a flicker|pg||
nt|barnets: you might ask why helness crossed to dummy|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
nt|warrens:  Larry Cohen is on his way (I hope to this table).  the 4@S bid violated the law of total tricks and cost 4 imps|pg||
mb|1D|nt|barnets: to lead @CJ|pg||
nt|psyck: he was prepared to play low during the bidding itself|pg||
nt|reisig: Law???|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: maybe cayne had not his morning coffee yet|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphzfv: no superfluous conversation in this room.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all very focused|pg||
nt|phil: in the other room in 4@s, declarer started to finesse in clubs, and then chickened out - South ruffed, returned a trump, and that was that|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@S in the other room, Rosenberg opted for a very unfortunate line|pg||
nt|phil: but he will be pleased to learn he won 3|pg||
nt|bigtrain: (anticipating the upgrde) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|osvaill83: undo|pg||
nt|3for3: missing a pass|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry Phil :)|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: 3N is excellent NS|pg||
nt|fabsayc: many possible bids by south|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hmmm  - roddy could have also chosen 3@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: I agree -- that's why I think he has to just bid 4@S and hope that if East has a stiff club he can make a move.|pg||
nt|phil: but 3@h is in 800 country|pg||
nt|xenya: yeah|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a bit surrised|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: both 3NT and 5@d make here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@C by helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: they should have learnt from deal 2 not to trust their 7 card suits headed by AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "I'm the one making all of the mistakes" - Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is control ask|pg||
mb|2D|nt|phil: wow Multon doesn't even consider 4@c|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT having the advantage to score 630 if they do not cash @ss|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wow, this works but is risking missing a game|pg||
nt|psyck: My pd's rarely say that to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C would have shown some solid suit with 7+ tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H = 5+ controls|pg||
nt|warrens:  Weinstein will force to game here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzfv: hmm not sure if 2h or 2c should be alerted as garbage stayman. just happy i made out what she wrote.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but that Kx looks very bad for slam|pg||
nt|barnets: first blood to Cayne 2 imps with 5@D down1 against 3n here down2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "Can't believe you didn't even try 3N w/ that hand" - Seamon|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: jokes all across the table|pg||
nt|psyck: ruffing a couple of @c's would work here, not clear what is best|pg||
nt|reisig: Does 87xx in @s qualify as a suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N is not concerned about hearts here, rather about the quality of the 1D suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3! shows 1-18 with 3=2=3=5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 17-18|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i anticapte grnd as the fiinal contract from here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: just a spade doubleton and some aces|pg||
nt|phil: maybe some confusion over the x? |pg||
nt|phil: double these days generally means anything but penalty|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s= " i need help in that suit buddy"|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria- versace did well to stop in 4N on last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: a variation of 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: going beyond 3N looking for slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny says "i dont have much help" as she laid downdumy|pg||
nt|psyck: @s shift could have fetched 1@s, 3@d, 1@c to def, but now declarer has a chance again|pg||
nt|barnets: he is not cold in even  4N though as misguessed the clubs|pg||
nt|psyck: he still has to guess @h fin to get rid of @s loser|pg||
nt|barnets: and needs heart fin to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: 4@c= "get lost"|pg||
nt|ritong: or something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a "buddy" bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  down on a @C lead, since the defense can get 3 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfv: but molson says "you have trumps!"|pg||
nt|phil: well thats sad|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: double was a @H stopper ask|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  interesting play prob here|pg||
nt|warrens:  and a @D|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: Declarer has problems here.  Even with the clubs coming in, there are only 8 winners.|pg||
nt|phil: and 3N must have meant a partial stopper|pg||
nt|phil: so he wasn't far off|pg||
nt|psyck: @h fin needed this deal & in 4NT other room :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so first big swing for Cayne|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|phil: so why 5@d??|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|ritong: french word is " coopératif"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or we use to call it a west coast cue bid (asking for half stopper)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4 = RKC|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@D = 2 w/o Q|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but since Sontag holds the key 9 spades, the defense prevails|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|bigtrain: 5! asks   of kings|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 5@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: shows grand interest so meck will force the issue with "solid" clubs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 7@C as choice maybe|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: obviously a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|3for3: quite thin game.  needs clubs to behave, 44 diamonds for starters|pg||
nt|3for3: and 9th trick to come from spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: !k and switch to @ds?|pg||
nt|grebrof: @H K|pg||
nt|kit: If East does shift to king of hearts, declarer will definitely win the trick|pg||
nt|kit: Since he is looking at down 1 if he ducks.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes. but it will make the defense easy|pg||
nt|phil: NS work very hard on ther agreemenets|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: can power out the hand|pg||
nt|kit: oh my!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bigtrain: obviously 7@H is the better theorical contract but 7NT will suceed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 2nd grand in 1st 4 boards!|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no one will ever lead a @D on this auction|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bigtrain: without W actually exposing the @DA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|3for3: a super grovesnor!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well was better to start the spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: of course Zia couldn't duck, but if he had .....|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|bigtrain: and even then i'd imagine you would have to clean your glasses and ask for a second peek|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then if necessary could have ruffed the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
nt|3for3: helness 'knows' south cant duck that|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kit: Now will take spade finesse and be down 3.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: heart to jack, club ace and club ruff seems a simpler approach and makes 6 on layout|pg||
nt|warrens:  down whether or not S ruffs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|warrens:  as long as he plays a @C when he gets in |pg||
pc|c9|nt|3for3: meanwhile 3nt came in at other table so big swing to monaco|pg||
nt|xenya: W is sort of sqaueezed|pg||
nt|grebrof: the lead was good again|pg||
nt|kit: either red suit would have been effective lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if clubs not breaking you still have the cross ruff line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry to make 5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S is NOT a transfer|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they use replacement bids to better utilize the space|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|osvaill83: makes now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzfv: lost track sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: now he can make it|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D now and made :)|pg||
nt|osvaill83: could have endplayed helgemo|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but Zia couldn't possibly read the position I don't think.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: its actually fairly random which partner plays the contract in  Precision|pg||
pc|s9|nt|grebrof: Helness probably had aheartattack when that @h ( fell :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: 8|pg||
nt|kit: he can still do the end-play|pg||
nt|grebrof: @h 8|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think he will make it|pg||
nt|kit: Helgemo obviously fooled by the low heart shift, although it seems like he should have figured it out since declarer known to have 5 spades from auction.|pg||
nt|grebrof: @d K and endplay dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Zia knows opponents have made a mistake somewhere -- he just has to figure out where.|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, Rosenberg opened 1@H as E (3rd seat), W bid spades, and that was that |pg||
nt|grebrof: o, than K of !@d and small to 9|pg||
nt|kit: actually he can't make -- Helgemo can win diamond and exit low diamond.|pg||
nt|3for3: and he does know the whole hand at this point|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 9@D covers|pg||
nt|kit: this looked like it would be a relatively dull hand, but things sure got interesting.|pg||
nt|grebrof: after watching Willenken and Rosenberg yesterday, I never thought they would ever be ahead|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it does seem as though Helgemo should have kept his heart.  I don't see how that could ever have been wrong whatever the hand is.|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|kit: Key was East's spade discard -- I can't imagine East would have pitched spade if he had an honor -- and if declarer has AK of spades then East must have king of hearts or we are ...|pg||
nt|kit: wasting our time.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: mumbling Zia: "What could it possibly be?"|pg||
nt|xenya: no imps ar stake|pg||
nt|3for3: at least 1 at stake|pg||
nt|kit: I can see Zia reading the position.  If so, he will win ace of spades, and lead jack of diamonds throwing the 9 -- hoping West has K108x.  And the West underleads and East claims|pg||
nt|3for3: that would be neat ending|pg||
nt|kit: Interesting point -- West led 5 of diamonds, so apparently they lead 3/5 vs. NT.  Thus, the end-play can't work.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even they dont lead 8 from KT85|pg||
nt|kit: And West isn't likely to be making a falsecard on lead on this kind of auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Zia still wondering if it is possible that spade finesse is onside|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: the 3@S?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: not that I know of|pg||
nt|barnets: the specs have a treat today with almost certainly 3 of the world's best teams in the semi-final|pg||
nt|barnets: an unusual occurence|pg||

mb|1H|nt|phil: I thought NS played Flannery....I'm confused now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: i think, multi|pg||
nt|phil: ok|pg||
nt|phil: kind of a wacky multi opener red/white - maybe trying to create a little early action|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: the "lost track" part may occur a lot, unfortunately, as these ladies at times play with supersonic gusto|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jenny wolpert thinking|pg||
nt|phil: 4@c is generally 'transfer me' and 4@d is 'you bid it' - which Kamil will do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it will work out|pg||
nt|phil: looks like he wanted to protect any diamond cards in Marty's hand|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman has the world's fair on this auction|pg||
nt|phil: now - Zimmerman should be less excited about playing hearts now|pg||
nt|phil: 4@d advertises length in both|pg||
nt|xenya: if he bids 4@H, he will make it|pg||
nt|phil: NS can make a lot of sapdes however|pg||
nt|phil: I think they bid 4@s over 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: assuming it gets passed out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Zimmermann in the tank. |pg||
nt|phil: 4@h is a little awkward to play - but I think South has the option of losing one of his trump tricks or allowing the diamond pitch to be taken, right? |pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C doesn't look too bad either -- until you see the whole layout|pg||
nt|phil: yeah, hearts that are "Hawaii" (5-0) is very bad for both|pg||
nt|phil: perhaps just an interesting, how do you stop 4@s? |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|kit: Interesting -- so Zia didn't work out that West could dodge the end-play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Helgemo embarassed he threw his @H away|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is natural NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 6@h is OK?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil: I would take dbl of 4@d as 'cards' and a subsequent x of 4@s as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: now 5NT or 4nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades are shakey, i think 4 enough|pg||
nt|3for3: 2@D seems a tad conservative with that fine 46|pg||
nt|phil: Multon not excited about defending 4@s with his paucity of defense|pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@H as the @C Ace is onside for a @S pitch|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Vugraphzfv: action!|pg||
nt|phil: aieee|pg||
nt|xenya: no wonder Zimmermann was in the tank -- the whole auction looks crazy, from his perspective|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all purpose DSI double (do something intelligent)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H seems right for north on that basis|pg||
nt|bigtrain: east's pass is almost always exactly a doubleton n support|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: he might be afraid North has just hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  W is showing a mini-splinter|pg||
nt|reisig: another "wonderful" X :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  double by Spntag greatly improves slam prospects|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: no oops here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the downside of the upgrading craze occurs on hands like this|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well 3 is down a lot but a deep position|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, imps do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|ritong: down 40 or so|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: real news, not bridge news. hope she doesn't get distracted by all the crazy stuff happening today :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: actually i think she's doing the puzzles. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: molson seems a very friendly chatty person. she's back now.|pg||
nt|kit: now this bid I don't understand -- seems like clear 3NT call by Zia|pg||
nt|xenya: N might pass  now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, north is a PH, so with just hearts he can just bid them, either a weak 2, or 2@H at second turn|pg||
nt|phil: Lightner from Fleisher now? |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  additionally, the double allows extra bidding space for levin/weinstein|pg||
nt|warrens:  the X tells East the Ace is onside and also gives E/W extra room|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm surprised, as is one of the voice commentators, that W bid 4@H and not 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: Me too!|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass of 4@c X = maybe slam|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  everyone is surprised, but perhaps they have a different understanding of Levin's 4H call than we expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag leaves table...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: after asking Weinstein if he'll be a while|pg||
nt|reisig: OK ..but in my bidding 4@h = no void in @c and no @d cue|pg||
nt|warrens:  exact same start at the other table, but West bid 4@D, not 4@H, after the X-p-p|pg||
nt|reisig: That's what I'd do|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Since Levin had 3 choices at or below game here... redbl, 4D, & 4H, I am sure they have agreements that we are unaware of|pg||
nt|reisig: Wanna bet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Weinstein alone at the table now as Levin and Berkowitz chat on the other side of the room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Sontag returns|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: granted this is not a normal situation|pg||

mc|12|nt|grebrof: what to bid than 2@d?|pg||

mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfv: jenny asked molson what X means. molson shrugged and pointed at the 3D |pg||

nt|fabsayc: 3@H lead directing with diamond fit, a treatment possible by a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: West might have tried 5@D, leaving it to Zia to find a low club lead!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzfv: you'll see the 3nt and pass cards hit table at same time :) she's really fast|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it could be something else on this auction|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Levin passed the 2C as he had nothing extra in terms of HCP, now Weinstein balances with his 5 card diamond suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: @H9 is a standard signal after the lead showing the AK|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: problem was 1@D on three card suit, given that would have rebid 2nt with disa's hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  now Levin backs into 3D|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: 1 down, but 3@H would have made|pg||
nt|bigtrain: being able to bid 4@S/4@H is too important to risk a TOX vs overcall|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: of|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but the other table bid 3@H which makes the TOX better as itsmore flexible|pg||

nt|bigtrain: meck can save a bit here by giving a @D ruff|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|3for3: 'standard' off shape nt by zia|pg||

nt|ritong: perhaps 12 if seamon ducks the second @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  pretty good chances for 8|pg||

nt|warrens:  if he plays spades I think he'll go down. losing 2 @S, 2@D and 2@C's|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|kit: East should perhaps have cashed the king of diamonds first -- now West has a problem.|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, @C lead would be a real killer|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  if declarer decides to play spade here, 2nt is down; diamond here, 2nt is in|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: club shift|pg||
nt|barnets: this wont make but 2@H was making|pg||
nt|psyck: strange defense|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual opening lead yes|pg||
nt|psyck: @hk would have been more standard|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  declarer cannot affordably cash the hearts as this sets up Levin's extra heart|pg||
nt|kit: I think he had to play spades, since playing a diamond wouldn't tell him anything and he would still have to take the spade finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: This way he also gets Jx of spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Kit|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: if so, perhaps zim will try to avoid the dangerous hand, though|pg||
nt|ritong: and miss the @cs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|leo lasota:  or if he plays confident, levin may duck the king :)|pg||
nt|kit: At other table Meckwell got to 3NT .....|pg||
nt|kit: But it looks like they will make it!|pg||
mc|8|nt|henryb:  That is a common treatment in Europe: transfer doubles over 1-level overcalls rather than negative|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: 1@H has lots going for it|pg||
nt|ritong: which do not completely match standard treatments|pg||
nt|kit: old fashioned defesne -- cover an honor, win the queen with the king.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they started 2@S 3@S (hearts and a minor) in open room, which is much tougher|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: they seem to have had a misunderstanding, ending in 3nt|pg||
nt|barnets: Cayne does not like his partners or teammates to make tight Xs|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: btw internet connection here is a bit slow.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: 6@C unclear here|pg||
nt|ritong: multon does not double 6@c|pg||
nt|ritong: his pard likely knows about his @s void anyways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: sorry i was lost in another auction, yes 5@S denying queen, so now 6@C has to be offer to play|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, a ruff is not enough to beat a slam|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu:  sure :)|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps zim is trying to get them in 6@s|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: looks like it|pg||

nt|xenya: note the Q, not a small card -- pinning the 9 |pg||

nt|kit: the 10 of hearts play, that is|pg||

nt|warrens:  but only if they play it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: here we go|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  1D opening may slow Levin/Weinstein down and keep them from bidding a game that would likely go down|pg||
mb|1D|nt|3for3: try for game opp 20-21 2nt?|pg||
nt|ritong: to morrow, west will have 5 @hs and it will work|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|phil: re|pg||
nt|phil: I think so|pg||
mb|2H|nt|xenya: is E worth 2@H here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: yes, sorry, i was trying to read their alert sheet|pg||
nt|phil: the question is will NS compete to 3@d|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: Cayne could bid 2@s or something with a 2 loser hand & @s void, & of couse S need not have passed with that hand|pg||
nt|barnets: opposite a passed partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if Fleisher has @d's, great|pg||
nt|barnets: some may open 2@S as West|pg||
nt|psyck: yes 3rd seat & @h suit are generally more suitable to a preemtive bid|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is constructive raise|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil: but if Fleisher is balanced selling out  looks better - maybe even x'd|pg||
nt|psyck: W hand was yucky for any choice of bids|pg||
nt|ritong: with their microNT, they need a good scrambling system|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3NT is a pretty bad spot compared to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfv: "Spades were so good, I'll try it again"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C on 42 with diamond lead in open room|pg||
nt|barnets: had North opened 4@H East probably would bid 4N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ritong: prudent fold by tor|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@HX down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: gold medal to passing 4@S?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Knowing the opening bid is behing his cards, Weinstein slowed down and took the low road|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  behind|pg||
mb|3H|nt|3for3: zia showed '5' hearts|pg||
nt|3for3: was willing to play 43 if it came to that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "i know you like a good challenge, zia"|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 4-4 spade fit was not considered, so martel did not have the clue available here|pg||
nt|rimbus: Anyway, Duboin chosed a spade lead : who is right ?|pg||
nt|ritong: the scoreboard is|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: not a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: what was 3@D from the other table?|pg||
nt|warrens:  hmm, this is a little dangerous|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil: important to unblock a club honor perhaps|pg||
nt|phil: big danger of a losing spade getting ditched on the @dK|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: no gold medal today|pg||
nt|barnets: whose mistake was this ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 4@S seemed like some sort of shortness bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: wonder what line jill levin will choose. |pg||
nt|ritong: @c hook basically ensures it, doesn t it?|pg||
nt|rimbus: 10 of clubs from hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|leo lasota:  3C may have pushed them up a level, but declarer will duck here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|grebrof: @c 6 from Helness?|pg||
nt|psyck: surely Helness will take the blame, whoever made the mistake|pg||
pc|cK|nt|3for3: perfectly legal for zia to do what he did.  his partner will play him for 5 hearts, and raise to 4 with 3 card support.|pg||
nt|ritong: guess he would raise that pot under different circumstances|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  heart to queen and ace here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: can Kamil block the club suit by playing the Q??|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: 6@H should convince helness to throw a @S |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  does he bring this in with only one diamond ?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c9|nt|phil: which prevents the entry|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: now he just draws trumps and plays a club|pg||
pc|h2|nt|phil: Kamil cannot lead clubs however|pg||
nt|phil: well I guess he can cash spades|pg||
nt|phil: and then a club over for Fleisher to cash |pg||
nt|xenya: that @D was wrong -- on this layout|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher is marked with the @sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfv: jill levin thinking hard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think all the players from wagar finals are often on bbo. team captain for westheimer, vdoubleu, is familiar to many bboers, especially the juniors. she's involved in organizing ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: special programs for kids|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sorry i can't give technical analyses. maybe an expert will like to be commentator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: jill meyers is very well accessorized. i think she has 3 necklaces on. very cool looking. |pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: TD ken van cleef just walked in. not sure what he wants. think he's just observing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: oh he came to drink some water :p|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: I met a bunch of bboers at this national. one gave us a very good idea for vugraph - audience participation. how cool would that be?|pg||
nt|ritong: the fact that americans can raise on three cards has importance, too|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: actually S can even play a @D now|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he can power it home with the trump spots|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|3for3: helness needed to lead club thru to break endplay|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  would a trump shift after winning diamond have worked any better?|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|bobholl: @C K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: zia said he was playing helgemo for the k|pg||
nt|barnets: yes that always seems to happen|pg||
nt|psyck: that was the problem with passing W hand, should have opened & got it off his chest|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Berk was caught on opening lead in losing situation of winning king clubs on air or ducking and not winning the king later|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Fleisher putting together a nice surge this quarter - they'd be perfect except for that 5@d earlier|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a hair raising experience|pg||
nt|barnets: I agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: also depends if they open 1@C with 5-5 blacks or 1@S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzfv: how often have we held a good hand, only to have partner preempt. then we dont know what to bid cos only singleton in p's suit|pg||
nt|phil: no dull hands here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed not|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzfv: looks like correct bid is pass :)|pg||
nt|cc469: Zia met the challenge with flying colours :)|pg||
nt|rimbus: Helness just lost one @d and... the 3 of @s !|pg||
nt|ritong: swing coming|pg||
nt|ritong: @c slam for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: not that it is a great spot, but difficult to avoid it|pg||
nt|rimbus: or no trump ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: another challenge, to bid slam after opponents opening|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3@d from Willenken is oldfashioned?|pg||
nt|phil: Zimmerman not in on the joke and bids 5@c|pg||
nt|xenya: and NS seem to be contributing a lot too|pg||
nt|psyck: 65 is probably a 1@s opening even for those opening 1@c with 55 like NS do|pg||
nt|warrens:  that will be an important result if Pepsi-Kweicien go to game|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|grebrof: its not that a preempt like that has to be leaddirecting|pg||
nt|kit: This will be dull 3NT or 4@S -- will have to wait for another board for excitement|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Decision to directly raise spades here with 2 aces and dblton|pg||
nt|warrens:  2@S using precision?|pg||
nt|warrens:  thought that promised 4|pg||
nt|kit: apparently it is permissable with them.|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe they've modified it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry our internet died and the access code didn't work. we lost 59 and losing 60 since i just returned.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt by val?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we lost internet. these are approximation. i think contract is right though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: because val is declarer right now.|pg||
nt|ritong: this won t take ages|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: always 11 regardless of @dQ|pg||
nt|phil: but they had an 1100 for the taking in 5@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards over really quickly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: n/s seem to always ask for it|pg||
nt|rimbus: in NT you cannot try a double finesse in @d, missing the 7 !|pg||
nt|ritong: now zim might dislike @h KJx|pg||
nt|rimbus: Sorry you HAVE 12 tricks with only THREE @d|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard denied @h control|pg||
nt|ritong: but he is basically facing 5+@cs|pg||
nt|ritong: pard raised @ds|pg||
nt|ritong: and why would he lose 2@hs directly?|pg||
nt|rimbus: The raise of @d is exactly what must warn you...|pg||
nt|rimbus: It means : at best will need a finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: in the tank|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|ritong: my reg pard has KQx to raise:)|pg||
nt|rimbus: yes, but you ask for keys, dont you ?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|xenya: that's right|pg||
nt|phil: a treatment I like, but have not implemented over 4@c: |pg||
nt|phil: 4@s and 4@h are FORCING|pg||

nt|fabsayc: only making four?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfv: insta-claim|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rimbus: As I said, I fear a double finesse....|pg||
nt|ritong: ugliest possible dummy for francky|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  only chance of 5 is leading low club to king at some point and defense duck and not take their ace clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|ritong: notthat europeans never do that, but americans certainly do it way more frequently|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: 8 imps for Monaco?|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm told they do -- so absent 2@C from Pepsi, how many hands give play for game?|pg||

nt|grebrof: I dont think it was a jumpfit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now that casual diamond king play not looking so good|pg||
nt|barnets: an contains 2 Italians, one from france and of course 2 from norway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Cayne "Good lead"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Seamon "I practice those all the time"|pg||
nt|ritong: some relaxation after the stressing slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: no time pressure at this table now|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: is weak 2s with east's hand ever okay? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: not a jump fit|pg||
nt|phil: Fleisher have had a lot of small swings by simply allowing less undertricks than Zimmerman this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  and the defense didnt take so many :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we'll probably get to interview mildred breed from the other room soon. very nice lady|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: check out bbo news for updates :) yep pelu lol|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Vugraphzfv: 3 boards to go in this set. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well this definitely proves they're not playing Polish Club|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: West might have bid some clubs there -- would have made things even more exciting|pg||
nt|phil: EW play weak NT's? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: unsure, they were only discussing multi's and their other 2 level openers at the beginning|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like it --nonvulnerable perhaps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C forcing?, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now we are in 3NT, from south or north depending upon kamil's decision to raise fsf|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not without an overbidder's lisence, hard to get in PA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: LOL|pg||
nt|grebrof: not even a fitjump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: n/s described their system as 2/1 with some modifications|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|3for3: big result for monaco in OR|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: ew do not play forcing nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Does anyone know if Sontag has ever been issued a slow play penalty?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfv: the ecats site notes 10-13 unvul|pg||
nt|phil: looks like a push|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: *nonvul|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a trick in each suit|pg||
nt|phil: ah ha thanks|pg||
nt|ritong: north it will be, then|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: I played live bridge for the 2nd time ever yesterday. overbid like crazy. it was fun :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i'll go and het coffee|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this treatment or similar is called Cole convention, part of Washington Standard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: described in Bridge World many years ago by Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|ritong: ominous|pg||
nt|ritong: is there really anything else than 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher scratching his head...|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he cannot "transfer" NTs to his pard|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south has shown a hand not worth a reverse with 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps fleisher worried about club stoppers, he could bid 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s would certainly show an other handtype|pg||
nt|ritong: although we can t be certain about their system inferences, but..|pg||
nt|bigtrain: seems like 4@S should be the fits that weren't good enough to raise directly |pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for their cc and is studying their carding |pg||
nt|phil: if they do play weak NT's, isn't 2@s plenty? |pg||
nt|barnets: Open room miles behind only on board 9 !|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bon|pg||
mb|2D|nt|grebrof: and ok result for HH here too|pg||
nt|xenya: this makes|pg||
nt|phil: maybe he's a touch too strong...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: 3@S was alerted, but kamil didn't care for an explanation|pg||
nt|kit: canape style potentially.  South doesn't know which suit is longer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Cayne appeared to take 2@c as promising @s tolerance, it is not clear to me that it should|pg||
nt|warrens:  N showing 4+ in both suits, either 54++ or 45++|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: what is the meaning of spade jack|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: as always, Pepsi as dummy opens a thick book in Polish|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: AND a big result here too|pg||
nt|kit: The good news for Fleisher here is that both pairs have a disaster on the same board|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, agree|pg||
nt|3for3: yes, that tends to compress the imps lost|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure I understand the 2@D call|pg||
nt|warrens:  nor I|pg||
nt|warrens:  3nt is a pretty good contract|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, North might have bid 3@C over 1NT, which is highly invitational.|pg||
nt|kit: The fact the South is thinking indicates that perhaps North has shown a very strong hand.|pg||
nt|kit: But he better pass, as a diamond lead defeats 3NT I believe.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: willard let down the partition now. she's whispering to valerie|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but unfortunately i can't hear them|pg||
nt|3for3: the bad news is they will still be down more than 50|pg||
mb|3N|nt|medwards: this hand should be a push i would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: multon would lead the third best with six cards|pg||
nt|ritong: thus, @c3 cannot be more than 5|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, 3NT likely to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: willard asked for diamond but patapon played heart. and so did disa. so they then redid it|pg||
nt|phil: in old KS, an early weak NT system, 3@s showed a powerhouse|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: mildred is a very nice lady. she many good stories from the old days|pg||
nt|barnets: Tiger just holed a 50 ft put !|pg||
nt|psyck: these players a bit faster than Fantoni etc in other room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfv: we'll make sure to ask her about the good ole days then :)|pg||
nt|medwards: ask hr about first acbl conv cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this looks good for EW, no? i can see a small gain?|pg||
nt|barnets: but hes just 5 under|pg||
nt|barnets: now|pg||
pc|dA|nt|grebrof: bidding a stretchy 3nt nonvul is more or less what they have so far|pg||
nt|3for3: he hasnt made this yet.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil: but their 1m openings were fairly beefy too|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: East can comfortably discard 2 hearts and 1 spade on the run of the clubs, so nothing bad should happen.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|barnets: anyway board 10 coming in open when they played 1@SX here|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond discard?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: nah after patapon won the CA. next trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i suppose it is ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: diamond from dummy :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|vugraphzfv: quite a few zzz kibitzers kibbing this table. zzz used to be those who logged in anonymously to kib|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but nowadays its likely to be bboers kibbing via their mobile apps. smartphones, tablets :)|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, now he is home|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: rosenberg has shown the @h singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: @sJ, then trump echo, showing ability to ruff|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: the heart queen play may pay dividends |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|psyck: this table may finish before they finish that board|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco only 11 down |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i call those time capsule conclaves|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: well...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: we do not have 13 solutions up to that point, do we?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe it confused zimmerman also|pg||
nt|ritong: not good for multon's stomach ulcer, this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: fleisher threw a card in anger, so that may have hinted at zimmermann that it was down|pg||
nt|ritong: confused or not, dummy is high|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ritong: well, fNT is not part of basic western european bridge culture|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: now that discard gives declarer a chance maybe|pg||
nt|kit: I don't see why he is keeping 3 spades|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  spade and spade and he sees contract come in|pg||
nt|kit: right, and that looks like what declarer will do|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: sorry about that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps all was not as we saw, else down 1 operator|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: but it got pitched back|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|dQ|nt|leo lasota:  Perhaps Berkowitz decided to not play for a "Grosvenor" defense by Weinstein|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
mc|8|pg||

nt|warrens:  Kwiecien-Pepsi need to bid game and make it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east surely knew of K@S   with west   otherwise declarer had 9 tricks     maybe tired after long day  as I am|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|kit: remarkable that both East defenders erred and came down to stiff ace of hearts|pg||
mb|3C|nt|dburn: well, they were OK even after they'd done that, as long as East led his low diamond and not his high one at the finish|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: good point -- unnatural play, but clear if you think of it.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: probbly makes 4 and maybe 5 with soft defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|dburn: once again they did what they had to do in the bidding, but the play...|pg||
nt|warrens:  with this dummy, this should be easy to beat|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bigtrain: declarer has alot to do|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Pepsi asks about J "denies a higher"|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: hope final is this boring|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|warrens:  another amazing Meckwell finish|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule for tomorrow with viewer's local timezone  http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php?order_by=event|pg||
nt|warrens:  they are so so tough down to the end|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice job by both teams!!|pg||
nt|ady: did get a bit of help  one from last hand     |pg||
nt|ady: but after so many boards    both teams must be tiring|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: We are not going to play board 64|pg||
pg||
qx|c63|st||md|1SK2H65DJ98765CJT3,S853HAQ92DAKQT3C7,SAJ96HK83DCKQ8654,SQT74HJT74D42CA92|sv|n|nt|fabsayc: well guessed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smooth duck by val would have made hand impossible to make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: she said "diamond" (so must be small diamond from the 2 in dummy). but then she claimed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when diamond to queen|pg||
nt|grebrof: if they had one board unlucky like this at two different boards, they would be down more, so lucky deal still this|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok as they have been a bit rocky here you would agree|pg||
nt|rimbus: semi forcing neither|pg||
nt|ritong: when, in states, it is the contrary|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't we find a closer match ?  :) :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  there will certainly be alot of talk about that hand after the match if Gordon should lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I am off, thx to all spex, and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|grebrof: :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree about the trump echo, not sure spade jack said anything though|pg||
nt|kit: 3@S didn't make at other table, so match is tied!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|phil: 4@s does not look cold|pg||
nt|kit: on board 59|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|vugraphzfv: if you have a smartphone or tablet, you can get the bbo app free from the appstores|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: other room passed this one out?|pg||
nt|ritong: both work well, of course|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: this being played wrong way|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: Roland tells me a @h lead gave away the contract in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: 35-17 Fleisher this segment -- the gap has narrowed down a little but is still quite big|pg||
nt|phil: Axx + Axx does not want to declarer the NT|pg||
nt|psyck: other room chose to bid 2@s instead of x as we suggested|pg||
nt|rimbus: 4@s must go down, but...|pg||
nt|kit: Light neg double -- Levin will surely bid 4@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|osvaill83: and theres more to come :)|pg||
nt|phil: but if they play 2@s promises 6 - there's little option|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: must not play 3rd seet forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: Lauria made perhaps a more sensible bid than Cayne bidding 2@S over 1@S on 10|pg||
nt|rimbus: let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 3N by North looks pretty good to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: it was Nunes who bid 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Versace Lauria sitting EW in open|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry I meant Nunes of course as north|pg||
nt|psyck: Nunes follows with 3@s over Fantoni's 3@c|pg||
nt|kit: I'm really surprised he took such a low road|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: according to 1930's authors, noone has an opening here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: laughter at the 6@D jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: weinstein declarer|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: actually culbertson would open south hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfv: even after the double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: nm|pg||
nt|ritong: ambitious pass and pull|pg||
nt|rimbus: probably a good strategy, overall, to overcall|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kit: When South shows up with stiff heart, declarer won't misguess the diamonds|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone has to have a stiff|pg||
nt|grebrof: or void|pg||
nt|kit: yes, but declarer won't be playing North for AJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|phil: :)|pg||
nt|phil: so Kamil can likely count on 6-4 on left - with a 5-5, he'd Michaels (or whatever they play to show H + C)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: "No double?" -Helness|pg||
nt|bigtrain: might get to game in the other room|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Perhaps it went 1D-2C-p-p-dbl-p-2h?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|grebrof: I think you are right|pg||
nt|grebrof: just saying|pg||
nt|ritong: also, fantunes play 1X openings differently|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: and maybe fulvio did not feel like opening south 1Nt|pg||
nt|kit: how can Weinstein be declarer?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rimbus: level of five belongs to opponents, they say|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: ok now to make it |pg||
nt|nilsland:  Helgemo has to keep @D5|pg||
nt|barnets: just needs a fin i think|pg||
pc|c4|nt|medwards: heart lead would cause problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there's a stopclock in the room counting down available time. only 17 min left to play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|phil: I don't think 3@h was getting hurt too badly|pg||
nt|psyck: yes this will not trouble him|pg||
nt|barnets: so finally a made slam|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they play mixed raise here rather than weak'|pg||
nt|kit: is board turned around maybe?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: or 2@s|pg||
nt|barnets: well done e/w|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: both tables responded 1N   thought Berk-Sonty might play 1@S-3@S preempt|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: would be a good time to test one round of diamonds now -- far from obvious|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: was the right move, though|pg||
nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i saw at least 6 boards in this set where the trailing side could generate reasonable large swings|pg||
pc|h8|nt|phil: that double gave away some gratuitous information|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfv: zimmermann flips is cards so quickly, sometimes i can't catch his spots|pg||
nt|bigtrain: if the made a weak direct raise partner may bid game|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: down now|pg||
nt|phil: when dummy gets tapped he cannot avoid a loss of four tricks that I can see|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told that a ruling is possible on board 18 -- seems there was a wrong explanation by H-H in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: deciding between club and diamond|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  undo|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but only this + 1 other board so they should be fine.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: and yep this board likely to increase westheimer's lead i think :)|pg||
nt|phil: I think he can lead his shoe and its down|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: might as well strip the clubs and see if there is anything to be learned|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  sure q clubs was led, then spade to ten = 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we're not playing bd 64|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  peculiar decision to throw out bd 64... and idea if there will be an assigned penalty to either team?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: time issue at the other table...we will not play bd 64|pg||
nt|kit: no penalty -- other table is slow, so delaying board 64 -- avoid problem of playing it at one table and then throwing it out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so are we going to sit here and wait with possibility board will get played?|pg||
nt|kit: but if this match remains this close, as it might well, there is going to be a lot of discussion about pulling a board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all players have left the closed room...I don't know anything else|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Any idea what would be the deciding factor on pulling the last board or not if the match remains close Kit?|pg||
nt|kit: closeness of match doesn't matter.  It is a quesiton of if other table is too slow or not.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  ok|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is an irony to this since GNT was won on last board|pg||
nt|kit: I think that is the right thing to do, assuming they might pull a board.|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Is there a clock in the room with the allowtted time remaining?  Or has the board been officially pulled as the players left the table?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Match may well be decided on board 62|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on 62 they are in the same 3nt that could have made at this table|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pepsi unblocked diamond king which sort of looks right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but now has blanked the heart ace also|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is going to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no board 64 as far as we can tell|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i guess nickell caught up too fast for the storyline|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pepsi in 4h on this board|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so if he makes gordon will win|pg||
nt|fabsayc: rodwell finds killing shift immediately|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the legend continues|pg||
nt|fabsayc: go back to normal life folks, 7am PST tomorrow for the final|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all 976 of you, match is over, 63 boards only|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the director pulled board 64 because other table was so slow|pg||
pg||
