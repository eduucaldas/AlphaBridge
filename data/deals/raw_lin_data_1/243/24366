pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  7@d may force N-S to 7@s|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|johnjones:  The Swedes appear to be playing that 3C would be a high level reverse and show extras.  That is a very sensible agreement.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Other table had a very lengthy, relay auction to the excellent contract of 6@d.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|johnjones:  He had a Precison 2C bid available - it would have worked better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|keylime:  I agree; bidding 3@c here if you're a pattern bidder, causes problems due to the room once takes to show a club suit. I myself would rather rebid 2@h as a waiting call here then the 3@c bid.|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it might|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but they'll get some back here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|johnjones:  A spec messages me they do play 3C as a high level reverse - thank you|pg||
nt|keylime:  North's hand should be prime now, and South with four shiny bullets might take a stab at grand here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  The 4-1 diamond break coupled with the heart position hurts the chance for grand here a bit.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A grand is excellent without a trump lead, but iffy with a trump lead|pg||
nt|keylime:  You'd need entries, which at 7 on a trump lead becomes perilous.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A spec tells me they choose a natural sequence, but had relays available|pg||
nt|johnjones:  If that is the case, that shows excellent judgement because it put weight on the KD|pg||
nt|malipivo:  we may count a lot of tricks for E-W|pg||

pc|d5|nt|keylime:  Nice natural auction here to a likely push. Well done.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Which might be found with relays, but sometimes relays run out of room to find all exact cards.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Especially with pinpointing 5-5 hands. The frequencies are not as friendly as the 5431 hands.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I like South's decision to go natural, but think he wimped a little in not bidding the grand|pg||
nt|hackenbush: a fair game here, reached after the opening instead of preempt. Needs 3-2 trumps and @hA onside, or some defensive help|pg||
pc|d7|nt|johnjones:  Good point|pg||
nt|keylime:  West has made a nice lead here.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer doesn't know clubs are 3-3 and that hearts are not 5-2. So entry management will be important.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Much|pg||
nt|keylime:  Can North in the relays ask for controls?|pg||
nt|mrdct: the mirrored cards in @s are horrible for declarer|pg||
nt|dburn: North-South might not do all that much battling|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|dburn: but South might well have led a trump, not a spade|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ruffing finesse in spades is being slowly developed.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|keylime:  Very good bidding. Now, will another trump lead come from West?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Declarer can now afford to duck a spade for communication.  That wouldn't have been possible on  a trump lead.|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer will need to be in the moment here and play carefully for the slam. It's easy to let excitement as a well bid hand get to best of you.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  This will be the first swing in the match that doesn't involve undertricks or overtricks|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: hi konstatinos|pg||
pc|s8|nt|johnjones:  We are seeing good judgement and nice card play from 4 youngsters whose combined aged is 62 (younger than many of us).|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|johnjones:  best lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is an overbid, 1 is enough|pg||
pc|hA|nt|johnjones:  Good lead, best declarer can do is -150|pg||
nt|ianmcc: Andy has embarrassment of riches|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|keylime:  Very good lead. Declarer does not have that friendly of splits here, and cards are not well placed either.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  3NT is also an overbid|pg||
nt|mrdct: on these sort of auctions there's not a lot of point leading @s as partner didn't raise and RHO surely has a robust stopper|pg||
pc|c9|nt|keylime:  Probably a result of the slam; the need to bid a close game to get imps back.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3rd and 5th leads, also against notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk4: n  missing, my fault  Konstantinos|pg||

pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Thx Johan|pg||
nt|keylime:  Declarer is going to get squeezed here possibly.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I dislike the both the 2NT and 3NT bids.  Why accept with 12 scattered HCP?  Especially NV!!!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|keylime:  I can understand if red. |pg||
nt|keylime:  but at equal white, makes no sense.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thanks Johan!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If partner can't bid over 1NT, you have not missed a game|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Now dealer is testing their bidding to 4@s.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|uni_dennis: but East is to the rescue with DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: depends on what you mean by "opportunity" - against 6@d, West would have had the opportunity to lead a low heart and get a club ruff|pg||

nt|poohbear: I think declarer will now cash the @h ace and  " endplay " West|pg||
nt|poohbear: he knows whats going on in @ss|pg||
nt|poohbear: Note how that has to be the line if West had the Q of @hs|pg||
nt|poohbear: Its a matter of whether he believes the @s count that East gave|pg||
nt|poohbear: if he thinks @ss 4-4 he will go for @h finesse|pg||
nt|poohbear: Lead was 2nd best from a worthless holding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some are not happy with the selection of matches. All I can say is that the WBF president decides which matches we get. For political reasons, I shall refrain from commenting|pg||
nt|poohbear: but later he continued 3 of spades and pitched the 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|uni_dennis: so you don't want to be in this slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjy: SOUTH didnit see his hands|pg||

pc|s7|nt|uni_dennis: 2@s on bd 13 was a(nother) push|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: unless ofcourse South decides to get creative and opens with his 11 count|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van Lankveld did open 1@h, van den Bos now relaying the hand|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: so this could be a possible swing for Netherlands|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|poohbear: Israel missed it|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: 5@H in the other room asked partner to bid 6 with a spade stopper, but Fisher could have bid 5NT|pg||
nt|poohbear: In the other room North jumped to 5@h asking for a @s control and partner might have chosen to Q bid to show the ace. But he merely raised so North was done|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I play 5NT shows the king and a different Q bid shows first round control|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|poohbear: 4@s is KC|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Padon's silence gives N-S too much room to explore|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S as bid at the other table would make it harder|pg||
nt|poohbear: one might ask how North can bid KC with no @S control. North already denied a @s control over 3@d so when partner bid 4@d he guaranteed a @s control|pg||
mb|7H|nt|poohbear: otherwise knowing there was no @s control he would sign off in 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: wd|pg||
mb|7S|nt|yanivz: good morning padon :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: new county heard from!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: also well done|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can they bid 7N?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Pass by Lankveld should show extras since @s ace is known|pg||
nt|poohbear: Does he have extras?|pg||
nt|yanivz: 1700  save few imps.....|pg||
nt|poohbear: He already showed some extras with the 3@d bid|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unbalanced 4-card supp for spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: With a balanced hand and 4-c support they go through 2@D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|johnjones:  Thank you|pg||
