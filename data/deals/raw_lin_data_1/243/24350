nt|mlodygda83: E has not enough for 6@d, so he should bid 4nt|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: as a very good raise to 5@d|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: so he do|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: now 5@c from W|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: and rather 6@d|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: but still not very clear|pg||
mb|6D|nt|malipivo:  5@d would be cheap for N-S if they find slam in the Open Room.|pg||
nt|mlodygda83: ok, this is also a way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north has good hopes to beat 6@d so he wont go 6@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|malipivo:  Well, grand was risky, I admit that.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: 6@S especially ideal given the score at the other table|pg||
nt|malipivo:  As long as South is having 3+ clubs it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Nothing more embarrassing than bieng in 7 down 1 when the other table is not even in 6|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|malipivo:  It is 21-9 VP, let's in a minute...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  the change is coming.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|mc|12|nt|malipivo:  Or even with two clubs in South's hand it is safe.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I think the best line is K@C then A@C, when all follow to 3 rounds, he'll know that N is 0733 and will know exactly what to do.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Oh yes, very right you are.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: if S ruffs the A@C, then N was 0715, that would not be a 3@H call |pg||

mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|agumperz:  awkward bid for north|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: by good hopes is paved hell:)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|bridgegoth: I really would not want to bid 7 under pressure, there is no sure thing that the other table will be in 6|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mlodygda83: 6@d a bit brave from W, but even if partner does not have @h king, there is still much % for finesse|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|MolvaM: can slams come one after the other?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And next opportunity for 6@d.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  I'd love to see it bid.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: not so good one this time but it makes |pg||
mb|d|nt|malipivo:  very true|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|nt|malipivo:  24-6 VP in favor of Netherlands|pg||
nt|malipivo:  letting to play 3@hX turned badly|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dont think it will be bid tho. reaching 5@d would still be ok|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And the Open Room is back.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south promised spades  guess, but what did nort promise 2ith his 2@s bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  it looks they are not going to bid 4@s here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  a close decision South is facing|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Lucky make, all As in the west hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  I expect 3@s, but I will happily be mistaken.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good board for norway other room but the actual bidding is probably different|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: There we go! |pg||
nt|MolvaM: can still make it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: nice @c spots|pg||
pc|s9|nt|malipivo:  And battle continues!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A diamond suit is a challenger.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  if @cQ is coverting @c98 they might be in trouble|pg||
nt|MolvaM: north could have led the @h king asking for unblock|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but that would still be 4 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  an impressive board, one way or the other|pg||
nt|MolvaM: can declarer find the club play?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or will he duck a diamond hoping that the hearts are blocked|pg||
nt|malipivo:  hard to guess, a low club from East is forcing an ace|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ¿eby to móg³ wygraæ musia³by wznieæ siê na szczyty intuicji|pg||
nt|MolvaM: agreed ryskiel :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bridgegoth: Luckily every suit behaves, the K@C can take care of the @D loser|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: he can try that right away and get the good news, @hs are unexpectedly 3-3, even better news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and hearts are 3-3, so hearts are behaving|pg||
nt|malipivo:  she, we expect :)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Oh she? who?|pg||
nt|malipivo:  all of them :)|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: OH! that's the BEST news yet!!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Ticha-Spangenberg played great in the last tournament.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  They were winning 70% in pairs for some time and winning it later.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: This is one of those hands we all wish we could tap them on the shoulder and just say "making 4, everything works" but we of course can't do that.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Yes, not today.|pg||

nt|bridgegoth: I might wait, maybe a Discovery play, surely you will get to the board again|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: in the unlikely even A@D is doubleton, a @H pitch is right|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The question is if she can go wrong.|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I don't see how, even if you experiment in the other suits, you always have multiple entries|pg||
