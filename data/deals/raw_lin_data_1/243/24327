mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|authau: re hi Kibs:)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Excellent! as I was saying, as the 1@C opening, I always play my 1st bid is ALWAYS natural, no matter what they bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|bridgegoth: Anyone here prefer 1@H with N?|pg||

nt|authau: i am with you Jay|pg||
nt|authau: seems he is 2 tricks short|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I see 5@C and 1@H to get him to 7.. i can't see much else here|pg||
nt|authau: we have the same glasses :)|pg||
mc|7|nt|bridgegoth: 5 with 3 10s... that is a lot better than some 6s and 7s i've bid with in the past|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Pass instead of 1H is quite disiplined, especially for a junior.  I am surprised.|pg||
nt|authau: lol|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: Especially in a strong club auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|authau: last board, thx KIBs for watching, Thx Operator, thx to Jay & John for commenting|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Thanks everyone, I hope to see you all again shortly|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: I was just told France had another disaster, 4NT down 4|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|authau: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridgegoth: 4@H doesn't seem wonderful either, but playable|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|johnjones:  C, S and 2 H losers|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: i only see 1@H loser John|pg||
nt|johnjones:  My bad the Q drops|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Yes, 4@H a lucky make, 5@C looks optimal|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|johnjones:  He might play low to J though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridgegoth: With A@C @C leads, i think they can set it, S won't have to ruff with his natural and N still has an entry to score the small @H|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|authau: not sure with 9876@h|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Unikely, what combinations would that pick up that AK@H won't?|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: Actually after a couple nice specs have told me, a @C underlead at trick 2 would be good for the defense|pg||
nt|bridgegoth: In another match A@S and a low @C was found for 4@H-1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|bridgegoth: This will also produce down 1|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|authau: playing AR@h is good (the best ?) with all 3-3, 4-2 with an honor dbln, 5-1 with a stiff honor|pg||
mc|9|nt|bridgegoth: I'd say thats more likely than QTxx onsides|pg||
nt|johnjones:  I think AK is best - my suggestion was wrong|pg||
nt|johnjones:  Thanks all for watching!|pg||
nt|authau: 59/19  but i don't know the result of  15|pg||
nt|johnjones:   15 was 2 IMPs to France I believe|pg||
nt|authau: thx Jason  so 59/29 to USA  well done guys|pg||
nt|jchiu: i think actually 59-23|pg||
nt|authau: next matches : France-China Hong Kong     USA2-Brazil     Costa-Rica-USA1|pg||
