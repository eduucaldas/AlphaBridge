mb|p|nt|ritong: i mean, looking at his hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Brink and Levin discussing 2@C.  It's modified Stayman of some sort.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Weinstein overcalled 2@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: hello everybody and good morning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i should have done that ... thanks Chase|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Rodwell explains their carding: Upside Down Count, Attitude & Suit Pref, Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Interesting hand to start 3rd quarter here as 7H makes E/W|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: vP asks about the signal at trick 1 - "it's upside down whatever he thinks the situation calls for"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winner of this match plays semi-final against winner of Gordon v Levine  [after Q3 Gordon +49]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cayne advances after Lynch WD     meets winner of Monaco vs Fleisher  [Monaco +45]|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Upmark trying to show he has a good hand with long @ds, @cs and single @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that match is also on vugraph with voice commentary|pg||
mb|6D|nt|april7: probably its a Stayman modification to find a possible 5-3 fit in a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think it is only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: on a diamond lead slam has not any play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees has only shown game force ALL of his bids just say  tell me more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N clarifies 4225|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: They're well on their way. |pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: van Prooijen doubletons could be weak or strong ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so Verhees on a guess  [i bet final contract will be 4@S]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D forces 4@H for signoff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, 6@H a surprise|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|nt|barnets: on another lead dec could hope|pg||
nt|barnets: to establish the 5th club|pg||
nt|barnets: which we see|pg||
nt|barnets: does not work here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: van Prooijen writing out South's exact hand for Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  sets @S  and 4@S says not interested in slam |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: yes, east has to hold both @cs and @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  5@D a better contract than 3nt.  it can make even without @D's breaking 2-2|pg||
nt|barnets: now at least he thinks he has play|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  also, won't go down as many when you do go down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nystrom says "yuck" as he puts down dummy|pg||
nt|grebrof: 5@d is realistic at least|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  well done|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: And they land on their feet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|leo lasota:  Fantoni will be claiming momentarily|pg||

pc|h3|nt|barnets: @CQJX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vP could have cooperated with better hand|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Vugraphzff: Meckstroth played his first card a little fast for me - he actually played 7-3-8 of @hs|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: turning off auto-play so we can get an idea of tempo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: *so the audience can get an idea of tempo|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: or a 4-3 split with 2 entries|pg||
nt|barnets: hes trying to get the entries|pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs were 4-3 north would have to duck|pg||
nt|barnets: or win and play hear back|pg||
nt|barnets: taking out an entry from dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW CC should be available online for the 2012 World Mind Sports Games [formerly Olympiad]|pg||

nt|psyck: detailed responses too, than just trump honors, like length in addition|pg||

mb|p|nt|warrens:  +1?|pg||
nt|grebrof: someone told me they made 12 at the other table too, so maybe its still a draw :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes - at least that is what they said - Rosenberg must have pitched a club; play went very fast in the middle|pg||
nt|barnets: so match is now tied|pg||
nt|april7: good defence denying the overtrick|pg||
nt|szalay: partscore is coming|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3-suiter short D 10-15|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can be 43 in the majors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 5+@S GF or 11-13 balanced|pg||
mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|warrens:  East is squeezed if he didn't cash the club K first|pg||
nt|grebrof: when S had bid @cs, maybe he just gave up|pg||
nt|grebrof: dont think the @c K mattered|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, we'll assume declarer cashed all his trumps, leaving dummy with @S 10 and Qx of @C|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very sharp 3nt has chances|pg||
nt|april7: could end in a 1NT byS|pg||
nt|april7: E will bid 1H |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken alerts 2@C and was writing; then realized it was not an alert|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'd rather be in 5@C, since either they don't get trumps started OR I ruff out Kxx of @H's|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with @H or @D lead 3nt most likely doomed and a black lead almost sure makes|pg||
nt|april7: might bid 1@H:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: ttrump start does not work for def|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  rather than 3NT.  but 3NT is cold on 4-3 @D's|pg||
nt|barnets: as east has only 1  trump|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is always cold warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a trump lead?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  if trump are 2-2?|pg||
nt|barnets: they are not|pg||
nt|barnets: her|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaapfr: S did pass (i would X)|pg||
nt|szalay: likely @H lead after given bidding|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S @S <3@D |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 tricks here for Sementa; 2C, 2D, 3H, 1S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: I kinda like bidding with Ss hand - double is weired for me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink asking about minor suit distributions that would open 1@D|pg||
nt|april7: so its not S who plays 1NT but E, since N showed majors E decided for 1NT,a good decision|pg||
nt|szalay: will they find @C shift by SOUTH?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: then it is too late|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to get their 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@C = strng @D rebid|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|warrens:  on this hand, 5@C is cold, but in theory it's a cold choice between 3NT and 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth led @H7  after similar auction  but 2@H dbl neg rather than controls|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X is usually anti-lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard not to think that they are having a misunderstanding though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meck wrote something that I thought said he doesn't want a heart lead, and now Brink asked something more and he wrote some more (small & light, couldn't read) and then turned the ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: page upside down :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|warrens:  close choise|pg||
nt|warrens:  close choice*|pg||
nt|april7: the very bad @D distribution will lead to the downfall of this contract,making only 1@D,1@C,2@H and 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink hasn't turned over his K@H yet.  Lots of thinking going on.|pg||
nt|april7: with a play to the 10 of @S from dummy, E might even make 7 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how many would play here X as responsive as NS?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|warrens:  this makes 4@H's if you can guess the @H's, but not easy after W's opening bid|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe dbl is both majors or @d and a major then|pg||
nt|grebrof: you risk P bidding @s|pg||
nt|barnets: you see north bid 2N in open|pg||
nt|april7: except S finds the @C switch |pg||
nt|april7: wll Levin find now the winning path?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but it may turn out to be a blessing here...  since an early @H ead alows a @S pitch|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: and Zagorin did try Stayman with west hand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = encouraging|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|warrens:  the 4-1 @D break makes this even more difficult|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nickell congratulated van Proojien on not flying with the Queen on trick 1|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rump lead seems right after the anti-heart X|pg||
nt|bigtrain: COG = choice of games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now Meck asked if 3@s was forcing and Brink wrote an answer and Meck put it on the floor - I'm going to have to explain to him about all of you wanting to know what's on the notes ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|grebrof: E must have something for his bid, but it can just as likely be and H in @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside-down count & attitude  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: ty W|pg||
nt|april7: now @C switch is easy to find,what else|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: I dont think they underbid in any case|pg||
nt|barnets: while QX is a great holding when partner has Jxx or the K or A it is not so good here|pg||
nt|barnets: Perhaps north could have tried 2@D instead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Just got confirmation of what Al said about discards and attitiude, but I missed a trick|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: in usa the major part of the top would see X as S here as d bid a suit|pg||
nt|szalay: last call for @C, done|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for EW   standard carding :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Since they are showing 2-2, South must have won 2nd diamond with K|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C gives roddy room for a bit more encouragement which he emphatically refused to do|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: pd|pg||

nt|warrens:  Fredin likes to bid, as we see here.  with 4 small @H's, he's assuming his partner has a fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: no links available?|pg||
nt|joest:  hello all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this time vP does all of the asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi Jack -- thanks for joining|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: yes a spec says hes bidding for the lead|pg||
nt|barnets: eaxcept HES leading it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Welcome Jack|pg||
nt|joest:  hi chase|pg||
nt|bigtrain: n/s play a variable NT...  this would be a mini NT, thus 1@C to start the strong NT sequence|pg||
nt|bigtrain: brb|pg||
mb|2N|nt|barnets: dec has 6 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: that is down 5|pg||
nt|barnets: or 1100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=5062|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what vP hoped for|pg||
nt|joest:  so al, while we wait for these relays to unwind, how about you and I bidding these two hands in standard?|pg||
nt|joest:  1@s-2@h seems like a good start|pg||
nt|joest:  then 3@d then what?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must confess  i'd open 1@D|pg||
nt|joest:  oops yes I agree|pg||
nt|joest:  1@d-1@h-1@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-1@H//1@S-2@C//2@S- ?|pg||
nt|joest:  btw there is some case to be made for responding 2@h, a good old fashioned jump shift|pg||
nt|joest:  so over 2@s north would bid 3@d I would think|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with shape meckwell overcall very aggressively|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Walter -- anything special for Meck's RDBL|pg||
nt|bigtrain: depends on what he was told the X showed|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I rather upgrade my 14 or 17 - allthou you did jackpot in @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meck started with 1@D in context of big club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I would open 1@S - I have a decent suit and my partners assume I don't have 5 of them if I don't open 1@S.|pg||
nt|joest:  then he is free to jump around aggressively having already lmited his hand with his failure to open 1@c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they do look down their noses at 5332 especially|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: I can't bring up N-S's card on this computer, no Adobe|pg||
nt|joest:  well back at the actual table, north has selected 4@s after his partner shows 5-6?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chase from the Steve Robinson skool  -- if you don't open 5-card major, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE|pg||
nt|joest:  i am not from that school|pg||
nt|joest:  you never get to six diamonds opposite Ax if your start with 1@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: van Prooijen wrote 3NT as 5152, but 4@S sets diamonds as trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  all of the 4-level bids artificial|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Verhees wrote 5062|pg||
nt|joest:  ic 4@s sets @ds as trumps|pg||
nt|joest:  this i didn't know|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  8 tricks the limit again here for N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C specifically asked for 4@H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: this may be down 2|pg||
nt|dinos1: -5 with trump lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right 4@C=@H 4@D=@S 4@H=@C 4@S=@D|pg||
nt|joest:  with hearts behaving, 7@d will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@S = likes slam and shows keycards  [5@D would reject]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2KC + Q and likes hand|pg||
nt|joest:  are they still relaying or have they reverted to cue bidding?|pg||
nt|joest:  ok thanks|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  play will not take long here|pg||
pc|hK|nt|clinch: Will do well to get out for -1 in 3@c|pg||
nt|ady: likely to get club wrong|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes N has implied short clubs|pg||
nt|ady: think 2NT was just competitive   but west decided 3@C better spot|pg||
nt|clinch: Declarer knows S short in @h, so may play top @cs|pg||
nt|clinch: to avoid ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S was very likely to make  so will need to restrict to 1 down for a push|pg||
nt|clinch: but then there's the matter of the third @s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: anyone understands X on 5@C in OR?|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be a fast 420, just 3 IMPs loss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|warrens:  Martel might pull to show interest in slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he did.  he wants Zia to bid 6 with short @D's for sure|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H must also deny 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i don't know what they respond with 4@H & 4@S :(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: so e/w exchange 1100 for 650|pg||
nt|dinos1: but would Zia bid 4@h with stiff @d and @cAK?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tez: only 3@d bid could prevent to opps to bid 6@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the artificial bid sort of becomes Optional RKC|pg||
pc|cK|nt|joest:  helpful for north to know he is facing a heart void since that substantially diminishes the chances of suit establishment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth in 6@D after fewer bids|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|barnets: I dont believe that for a secon|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: could give 2 heart ruffs now  and 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: oissubly 3 down  3 diamond later promoting Q@C|pg||
nt|ady: possibly|pg||
nt|ady: 3rd diamond|pg||
nt|ady: heart at this point could hardly cost|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe 2nt in French style|pg||
pc|c8|nt|szalay: 4, sry|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mci|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: N-S card - http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2012EuropeanTeams-Dublin/OpenTeams/Netherlands/Brink-Drijver.pdf|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD waqs to pin @H8x nice|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: why should e/w bid slam with absolutely no play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H for pitch then immediate @S hook?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: now spade|pg||
nt|clinch: Aggressive vul balance by Rosenberg, not going to work out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  no way to avoid -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1 round of trump -- i'm never sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: think want to preserve @DA in dummy, so guess @S to Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as it turns out   @H set up|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 5@S did indeed show 2 KC + Q@D , van Prooijen just wrote it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack  do you see a way to combine chances?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Versace made an unfortunate "lead directing" 1S call light in 3rd chair and paid dearly when N/S bid and made 3nt|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  on bd 34|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@S   since 2@D says not 4@H, maybe 4@S|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: soon Chase will trust me :)|pg||
nt|joest:  i think he is in trouble now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I believe you Al, I just like to confirm things now and then when I can :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: S is still Upmark - yes?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same play by Meckstroth|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s4|pc|h6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 9-12  15-17|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: y to make 5@C that was needed to do|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|joest:  he could recover now by a diamond to the6 but that is double dummy|pg||
nt|joest:  seems to me like south took a reasonable line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meck didn't find that play either|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|an|!h|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: 7@h looks like a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|ady: 12 soloid tricks  other than very bad heart split    13 makes with diamond finesse|pg||
nt|psyck: they are in 7@h now, though by E, it is better played by W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: @c 4-3 or @d finesse/squeeze|pg||
nt|psyck: you have @c chances & only fall back on @d fin if @c fail, played by W|pg||
mb|3C|an|!d|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|psyck: It was probably easier to find grand after strong jump shift like other room|pg||
nt|dburn: you might beat 7@h by East if you led a diamond, I guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|psyck: yes likely|pg||
nt|ady: 2 grand slams in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzfk: if they fail to bid 7 the lead will be out to 65 - not over - but getting very tough|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|psyck: the @c chances (43 or J dropping) are far higher than @d fin, so would fail obn @h lead by S if played by E|pg||
nt|ritong: the stage is set for a @d lead|pg||
nt|ritong: zim now knows @d A is on his left|pg||
nt|psyck: they right sided this room , so does not matter|pg||
nt|ady: if east plays 7@H  as in cr   diamond lead might beat it|pg||
nt|psyck: only qustion is if they can find it|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ritong: bias blinds me:)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: oh|pg||
nt|ady: in answer to kibs  I said if east played 7@H  as in closed room|pg||
nt|psyck: the auction went similar to the other room, but the crucial difference was that other room W could expect solid suit for sure & see the source of tricks for grand|pg||
nt|ritong: shocking|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: bad loss for Cayne|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: E-W card - http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems/2011WorldTeams-Netherlands/BermudaBowl/USA%201/levin-weinstein.pdf|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, the T dropped the 9, took the @H and made 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: score corrected now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=F1, a) 4+@C, (good 12/13)14+  b) 2+@C, BAL, 15+ HCP [includes 5@D(332)]|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: looks a routine 3NT e/w|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|2H|an|gf, 5+!H, 10+ HCP|nt|joest:  what would you rebid here al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm trying to decide if makes sense to play @HK at trick 3 to see if anything interesting happens in the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: This table plays much faster than Levin-Weinstein and Brink Drijver did|pg||
nt|joest:  if Ralph had ropped the heart queen under teh king it would have been very interesting|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 0-7 any|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: could be lucky the single was vs an ace in @ds, but its stretching a lot - I guess they bid games that they bid at the other table and hope for something lucky to happen|pg||
nt|barnets: so 3 hands played 3 big swings exciting stuff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5-fit  and imps -- don't worry about bypassing 3N|pg||
nt|joest:  i prefer somewhat bigger hands for 4@c and would bid 4@d, promising 5 trumps, but that is stylistic|pg||
nt|joest:  i agree about bagging 3n5|pg||
nt|joest:  3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = game force  10+ hcp, 5+suit|pg||
mb|2N|nt|warrens:  1@S=denies a 4-card Major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tx chase|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H is probably stronger @S|pg||
nt|april7: from both sides apartscore only,4@C by NS and 3@S by EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession:  i didn't think about 4@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H = 4+ forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = @H & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Seems we missed a big swing board on 17 - NS here gained 13 despite missing a slam.... in the other room they bid a doomed 7@d|pg||
nt|joest:  I taught Ralph everything he knows :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grasshopper has learned well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NOT 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = 15+ bal|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  another interesting hand here that makes 7H (as well as 7nt on the diamond finesse); |pg||
mb|3D|an|6+!H|nt|clinch: 18|pg||
nt|szalay: @H lead/switch: 1off in 4@C|pg||
nt|jaapfr: mb they only play 3@C|pg||
nt|szalay: and @D lead beats 3@S|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy thereare only 3@C and 2@S to be made, due to the possible ruffs from both sides|pg||
nt|joest:  so now Nickell needs to highlight the heart weakness unless he wants to roll the dice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you were both in chicago at same time?|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  7H of course allows for additional possibility of setting up a 4th club trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that 3@D bid doesn't match what's said in Bill Jacobs's new book, Fantunes Revealed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: might be new?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  which will come up 7s|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3fit 5-7 ART|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jaapfr: zia in 3nt?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink and Levin writing furiously, can't make it out|pg||
nt|joest:  we are both still in chicago at the same time|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nothing very fancy for NS over the big club  just Mathe  [DBL=majors  NT=minors]|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: Upmark:  "this should have chances"|pg||
nt|warrens:  a coffee hand (a good hand to get up and get a cup of coffee)|pg||
nt|joest:  nice auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i thought you migrated to florida|pg||
nt|joest:  me?  no :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some play 4@D as minorwook  [RKC in the minor]|pg||
nt|joest:  but make me an offer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: minorwood|pg||
nt|joest:  this can be more complex than it seems|pg||
nt|joest:  it is possible 4@h would have been minorwood|pg||
nt|joest:  and 4NT a heart cue|pg||
nt|joest:  so did Katz read 5@c as a command to bid on with heart control?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i call that kickback|pg||
nt|joest:  kickback too :)|pg||
nt|joest:  in other words, can Nickell 'trust' the 5@d call he just heard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would assume forced to slam if @H control|pg||
nt|joest:  i tend to agree but if it were that clear Nickell would have already sent the green pass card out there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wonder what 4@S instead of 5@C would say/ask|pg||
nt|joest:  how could that not be an offer to play|pg||
nt|joest:  if you took the king of clubs out of Nickell's hand, that's the bid we would all make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree|pg||
nt|joest:  i have a good idea what Verhees will lead if Nickell bids on|pg||
nt|joest:  it's 80% nickell will pass (imho)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 50/50   he does or he doesn't|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin did splinter|pg||
nt|joest:  when partner is 5-5 and the auction has gone this way, in your heart you just know partner has xx in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 3@D = natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could it be natural :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: wish i could ask the players|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|nt|clinch: Not sure what 3@h is here|pg||
nt|grebrof: many would have bid 2@d as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just noticed  5@C does fit RKC response|pg||
nt|joest:  last makeable spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2KC + Q|pg||
nt|joest:  i admit I would not know what was going on if I were in West's seat :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1@S-2@D//4@C-4@D//4@S-5@S|pg||
nt|joest:  so I would follow my baseline rule|pg||
nt|joest:  when in doubt...|pg||
nt|joest:  pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough hand when you're only looking at 13 cards|pg||
nt|joest:  yes let's see|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither west has passed 5@S yet|pg||
nt|joest:  if 4@d were rkcb, then 5@c is 2 with|pg||
nt|bigtrain: Pass/X shows 0-4|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck's X is takeout|pg||
nt|bigtrain: the opponents showed @S so meck's X was takeout for the miors|pg||
nt|bigtrain: minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 3nt down 2 i would say|pg||
nt|joest:  then 5@d asked and 5@s showed the spade king?|pg||
mb|4D|an|cue|nt|barnets: going to 3N all roads here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I've been told by some 1@S is a GF, others that its inv+|pg||
nt|dinos1: 1@s is relay and shows INV+ values|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: S dont want to lead|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, rather odd bidding on the face of it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: b4 zia has 52 different cards kibs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Note passed to other side of table.  Brink wanted to know difference between 2@S, Pass, and XX.|pg||
nt|joest:  i.e. if all these bids mean something else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zagorin 5N  so  great position for Nickell|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's suppose to bid his suits up the line here|pg||
mb|4S|an|cue|nt|ady: we started hand 19  ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2012Dublin/systems/OpenTeams/Sweden/fredin-fallenius.pdf|pg||
nt|szalay: I think he will go down anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 top losers and another one in "wash"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y marginal chances to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Ralph Katz makes safety play in trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  on a bad day north has Jxxx of trumps and you are punished for this transgression|pg||
nt|bigtrain: reaching the norma 4@H contract though|pg||
mb|4N|an|alert|mb|p|nt|clinch: Guess we were late to the party|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but @H play still def to find the @DK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Levin fingering @S9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have old note that says 3@C would be 5@H 4+other, 13+ HCP   so 3@D implies 10-12 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kibitzer is saying 3@H showed six hearts|pg||
mb|5N|nt|barnets: on a bad day with cards badly placed this could go down but today all friendly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3@D?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D as transfer showing 6+@H makes sense   more so than 4+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  confirmed 1@S as invitational or better.  can get out below game if partner has a minimum weak nt.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: play started before we were ready, so you missed 17 & 18|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the longer e watch this the more chances i see to make 3@S:)a|pg||
nt|joest:  i suspect another heart now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then 4@C as another transfer maybe|pg||
mb|6D|nt|warrens:  there are at least 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|joest:  which Katz will ruff in hand so that he can safety up the spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|nt|leo lasota:  cannot imagine Fantoni not placing this hand in 7H if he knows Nunes has 6 solid, unless he has ways of finding q spades, king diamonds, jack clubs!, or 7th heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice  --  hope we get some translations|pg||

nt|odysseus70: good evening all|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: remember south only sees 8 sure tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thru 54  Monaco 23-0 for the set   leads Fleisher by 68|pg||

nt|ady: trump lead   club to jack  ?|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   to king if guessing right|pg||
nt|dburn: he'd better double, because Lauria will certainly get the clubs right otherwise|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, he may be in doubt as to whether Multon's double is clubs, or takeout of hearts|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ritong: yes, thus 4NT is both minors|pg||
nt|dburn: if he thinks it's lead-directing in clubs, he will lead one, and that will be that|pg||
nt|psyck: he took it as t/o, but decided to bid on instead of x|pg||
nt|ady: well some sort of plus for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn: but he is hedging his bets - either it's clubs or it's takeout, in which case we'll play diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: Versace might as well take a shot at this - his four trumps suggest that declarer may have control problems|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: I couldn't hear.  But Steve did thank Zia just now and chuckled.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|warrens:  makes with a @H lead.  down on this lead, especially if W overtakes and continues the suit|pg||
nt|barnets: at the 3 level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but NS weren't bidding 4@H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|warrens:  a Fredinian lead here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus70: bid slam on last in open room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now @D5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H switch pretty tough|pg||
nt|april7: @C King and @H switch and then develop the @D trick, but no entry to this trick, so 2 @S will make|pg||
nt|bigtrain: @S6 = @D interest|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Who goes up with the A here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Clocl has 10 minutes left for the 5th set of 8 boards. They are behind right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Clock*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: For all of those wondering, Jeff is still thinking|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this may be the longest break in tempo i've seen from meck|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He took his hands off the cards again. We have 5 minutes to finish this board and play 39 as well as 40|pg||
nt|bigtrain: his is one of the fastest and smoothest players you'll ever watch|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|warrens:  if E shifts to a @S, W has to go up and exit a @C|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is getting difficult for the defense|pg||
nt|grebrof: can shift @hs too?|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a @H, declarer knocks out the @S ace and has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|grebrof: Zia has some inventive weak 2s sometimes|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, yes, W can win the spade Ace and shift to a @H|pg||
nt|grebrof: not if play the ace first and then shift @hs|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Willenken should have overtaken seeing the 9 in dummy and played @ds|pg||
nt|grebrof: I see you already commented on that, but I was in the office :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  that would have worked, but of course he was worried that declarer had K or QJ of @H's|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Played|pg||
pc|hK|nt|grebrof: this shift looks nice|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|jaapfr: logic defense but only @H return it could go down|pg||
nt|april7: deep finesse in @S|pg||
nt|szalay: why deep?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS have actually changed in last year -- now they play Strong NT overcall after 3rd seat opener|pg||
nt|joest:  nickell may hook the club and be disappointed to see it lose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very sensible modification from the current bermuda bowl holders|pg||
nt|joest:  but he really can't go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckstroth made overtrick in 2@S for extra pip|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on this board  Meckstroth DBL  Rodwell 2@C  --- VERY different inferences for Bathurst in 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Slight pause before Fantoni's 9@H, Sementa asks "No hearts?"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|clinch: Looks like 9 tricks as long as W doesn't rise on a club to dummy|pg||
nt|szalay: just a finesse|pg||
nt|april7: to take out both @S from N's hand|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hard work for a push|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs to score 5 trump and 3 aces...  so has to set up some ruffs in his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: can afford a club finesse|pg||

nt|ahollan1: fast arrival means -- jump to game in forcing auction = weakest action|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT e/w  may be best spot   but they may play 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus70: pushy 4S in open room|pg||
nt|april7: 14 imps|pg||
nt|szalay: its an acceptable 4@H, need 3-2 trumps and a @S hook|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink asks if always 6.  Levin - Usually yes, but if 5 a good 5 and some shape.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: as szalay said in a split second: only trump lead did beat 6@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4+fit  not as strong as limit raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: easy now for vP|pg||
nt|reisig: Slam is no terrible ..but 50% in theory|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: They have a fabulous 6@S sacrifice if that were to happen|pg||
mb|2D|nt|clinch: 10 tricks look there in @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S makes as they lay    no diamond ruff   A@C right  and 3-2 spade split|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: 2@h pass pass dbl|pg||

nt|bigtrain: 3@S = 4@H not 4@S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|tez: hmm|pg||
nt|odysseus70: may be repeated|pg||
nt|warrens:  if W bids 5@S, is a pass by N forcing? if it were, S might bid 6@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  but i don't think this is a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Sementa/Duboin landing slowly in their 9 card fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: @h lead pls|pg||
nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but hoding 4-fit in @C  Nunes will bid @C eventually|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  correct Al|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thru 22   Monaco-Fleisher  16-16 set   Monaco still leads by 53|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  indeed; Sementa/Duboin have fooled Nunes|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: I think it just show a stopper in unbid suit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D - RKC|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  quick d2; well done by N/S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well NS can only take 6 off the top|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: duboin asks if xx can have clubs, fantoni nods|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|grebrof: which indeed he hass|pg||
nt|bigtrain: even if e/w beat 6@C they still lose 5 IMPs|pg||
nt|bigtrain: this usually indicates that one partner thought it was a forcing pass and the other didn't|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i kind of think nunes did it to himself|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: bored lead:)|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sA and @c10? :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry, I left the director here while I went to the bathroom and I guess he didn't want to enter any cards or results :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  How hungry is Duboin here?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: quiet hand here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H RELAY for shortness  but vP already suspects @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH responses|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT is quasi-forcing|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D rates to be 4+|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is NF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't believe any of the Italians play Support DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: N must feel 4@s may be making|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 5@C still ok|pg||
nt|joest:  "LMH" = low-middle-high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LMH = low middle high   so step 1=short @C  step 2=short @D  step 3=short other major|pg||
nt|reisig: This is GREAT ..we have no comments :)|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S would imply 6 imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: you are watching in my opinion 2 of the world's most imaginative bridge players|pg||
nt|odysseus70: 3NT HAS no chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Found the best contract|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very nice; lets see if he plays the trumps to be 22 with Ax for overcaller..|pg||
pc|dK|nt|grebrof: bidding what you have is maybe just for the better|pg||
nt|grebrof: now its easy for N bidding 5@h|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe W should have bid 5@c instead of XX|pg||
nt|grebrof: or 3nt|pg||
nt|grebrof: if P has the @c K and an ace 3nt makes|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@H probably cue for @Cs, with @D fit he could bid 5@C|pg||
nt|szalay: 5@C isnt so easy|pg||
nt|szalay: 4/5 @D, I think|pg||
nt|jaapfr: better 5@C than 5@D to make|pg||
nt|szalay: Levin visualize void in @S by pd|pg||
nt|szalay: in that case 6@C is a good prposition|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y might go for slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: earlier set i think i described italian attitude toward support dbl as   no No NO|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  can actually make 5 now with Kxx spades also coming down|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  very friendly layout for Duboin|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i don't remember  possible 4@S = mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 10-15, 0+@D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|grebrof: the bidding at the other table was shorter and not very much to my liking :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, back now.  let me see...|pg||
nt|reisig: Warren was hiding|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm back now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it would be to your liking on this hand if you were NS :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, surely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: aha tx phil (4@S bid if W 0 @S) agree|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and not 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: In the other room, Ralph Katz opened 1@D in 3rd seat, Dan Zagorin overcalled 1NT and they reached 3NT.|pg||
nt|april7: only a @D lead might have made some problems, because W has to pull trumps and religh on a very good @H position|pg||
nt|april7: rely*|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with NS passing 5@C an easy one |pg||
nt|jaapfr: bbut with the ino W will think a lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: info|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how could he bid 1@S  and how 3@S (awful breaks ahead?|pg||
nt|april7: 5 trumps, 2@H, 3 @D and 1 @S trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yyy:) but thinking ahead|pg||
nt|april7: not vuln. you cantry a lot|pg||
nt|jaapfr: esp when S shows @DA W will become very un sure about @HK|pg||
nt|april7: can't misguess, S will not duck the K imo|pg||
nt|jaapfr: we will see (i quess in 10 minutes:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think 3@S showed a mixed raise, so that could help some.|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|szalay: may be here will a slow play penalty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: They have 5 hours to play 32 boards, but are way off pace.  This hand isn't helping obviously.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: at least W agrees with me:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very tough board to play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Brink pulled out wintermint Tic Tacs, and offered them to the table.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4@D forcing 4@H for signoff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell now 3 1-imp pickups in a row  what's the record?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|joest:  that's what I was wondering|pg||
nt|joest:  obviously north turned off by heart shortness|pg||
nt|joest:  but how does south know who much strength north has in case south wants to move on?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  N/S need to find 5@H's now or they will lose a  lot of imps|pg||
nt|clinch: In these situations often advisable to bid one more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: After long thought, Bas X's it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The other room has finished playing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 59  Monaco  over Fleisher by 52|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: As I was coming back into the room, they asked if they could tell their teammates to speed up :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|grebrof: I think they should have thinking about have the bidding has gone|pg||
nt|joest:  *how* much strength|pg||
nt|reisig: OH!  Some action now!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: we laughed we were at the "grue-speed" table |pg||
pc|h4|nt|bigtrain: this lead won't challenge declarer|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand this double.  |pg||
nt|reisig: This looks a lot like +730|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He kept asking Eric about shape|pg||
pc|h9|nt|odysseus70: good idea to pkay 3NTwhen spades are running for 6 tricks but Norts spdes not good enough|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he is lost in all permutations of distributions NS|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 38 [4@SN-2]  Cayne WON 9 imps when Multon 5@DX -500|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|jaapfr: a breath of release already coming?|pg||
nt|szalay: @S now, probably|pg||
nt|april7: now @S ofcourse kmakes problems not to overcome <i think|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  will still make 4; very fortunate|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: why not?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade ace unblock gives him extra chance of dropping the spade king third|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: a @D and everything goes fine|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be ducked, 1st one|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|clinch: As insurance|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|jaapfr: x@D to T x@Sruff @HQ @CAQ and mad|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jack - that's why i waffled about 4@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest:  ic|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|odysseus70: so chance for Fleisher here|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|joest:  well we'll see how Meckwell bids it at other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24 seems operator got claim wrong in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H-1@S//2@S-4@S//end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that wasn't a guess -- i was watching :)|pg||
nt|joest:  i guess that was an ok slam but not agreat one.  I've certainly been in worse|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: We're on break at the moment - van Prooijen left two hands ago as dummy so he's still at the table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h7|nt|szalay: now he cant make it|pg||

nt|tez: specs pls help me:)|pg||
nt|barnets: it was a tough lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: here we go...|pg||

mb|p|nt|tez: dbl or 1@s now?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: more tame, not more timid :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: nebicle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell would play this vul jump overcall as intermediate, right Walter?  or is that just red vs white?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=18-19 HCP, BAL, no 5M|pg||
mb|2S|an|alert|nt|joest:  2NT again I presume|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: Tez, and what's your choice?|pg||
nt|barnets: Zia has been straight down midle this set|pg||
nt|odysseus70: 1h is limit but cant stop there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does everyone remember what 2N shows?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bas is not happy|pg||
nt|warrens:  the best thing about Meckwell-they never seem to let the last board, if its bad, affect them|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest:  3@c relay|pg||
nt|joest:  :)|pg||
nt|joest:  3@d five trumps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Jack paying attention!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 1@s|pg||

nt|joest:  ah he breaks the relay|pg||
nt|joest:  I always wonder what kinds of hands do that and why|pg||
nt|joest:  and how|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  forgot   4@C = 5+@S with 0@D|pg||
nt|joest:  how could you forget something like that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 0@D  [following LMH structure with 4@C/@D/@H responses]|pg||
nt|reisig: Never affects me...I go to the men's room :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: X|pg||
nt|barnets: for him that is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may scrape home here|pg||

nt|ady: 2 rounds of diamonds and a club switch|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry kibs can not reply to all your nice lines tips and ideas:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sun was in my eyes??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I think will get hearts right|pg||
nt|odysseus70: can make 2 hearts now-can get a discard on 4th club|pg||
nt|jaapfr: score zia ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: X is negative...  although they have ways to show 5+card suits with GI+ values so either 4@H or weak with lomg hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no|pg||
nt|bigtrain: intermediate at unfav only|pg||
pc|s7|nt|szalay: nice lead!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sure!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 34-12 monaco tx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Levin and Brink fully discussing all the possibilities of 1@D|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he gave him to good info:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Before the lead, Brink said 4-4 Majors here would bid 1NT, and that's when Levin made his lead.|pg||
nt|joest:  one key card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S  PUPPET to 2N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: puppet forces the action without saying anything about hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest:  6@s is end|pg||
nt|dburn: 2NT presumably natural - maybe 3@d would have been game-forcing|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: unlike transfer which actually shows something|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: both south's x rather than 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like 9 or 10 tricks to me|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: in compitition they revert to normalish transfer bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Jeff debating whether to take the trick or not|pg||
nt|dburn: not all that clear to bid at all, with eight facing a maximum of 16, but Meckwell didn't get where they are today by not coming from where they were yesterday|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@h = Ilike my hand 4-3-3-3  - but 3 Aces is never bad|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|ady: will decline spade finesse if then|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: look like plus 2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Y he wil play @CT|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  AKQ hearts, 10 clubs guarantees 9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaapfr: @C6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dinos1: if he plays @d to K, @d back|pg||
nt|barnets: he may play safe|pg||
nt|barnets: for 9|pg||
nt|tez: he knows where is @d ace|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are a few inferences, since had 2@H available i believe showing spades, but main idea is to get opener as declarer|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|dinos1: but @d mb 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say east gad all the diamonds|pg||
nt|tez: in this bidding east has 18 19 balanced hand|pg||
nt|barnets: he could be trouble with your line|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 7 imps to Americans|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||

mb|2N|nt|tez: Fallenius didnt open 3@c..may be he misscounted points:)|pg||

nt|warrens:  3NT pretty odd contract with these cards, but 4@H will do fine|pg||
nt|reisig: indeed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unpassed hand  1@H alerted because usually less than game force|pg||

nt|odysseus70: dont know where this one will end -maybe 6 clubs going down-maybe 4 hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus70: South will have shown 5 diamonds 6 clubs and a strong hand|pg||
nt|odysseus70: the 7th club is compensation for modest high cardelement|pg||
nt|szalay: surprise silence by South|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wager 2@H can be 3-fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe Nickell balances 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they alert this because rarely can be 3-cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: south opened 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: yes 1@h must have been limited|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4@H  a) 12-14 BAL  b) 4@H(441), min|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  41 was opportunity for Duboin to create a good plus score for Cayne if he had played heart to the king, but when he misguessed the trump, Fantoni/Nunes quickly made him pay with precision defense for down 1|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Willenken and Rosenberg are not known for their speed|pg||
nt|dburn: but this...|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|grebrof: nah, that they are not|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@H not easy SD|pg||
pc|d9|nt|grebrof: but 99% play too fast, so they are probably right|pg||
nt|barnets: neither west nor east made a terrible bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|dburn: ..may not be the best|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|barnets: and there you are|pg||
nt|dburn: if Brink had ducked that heart....|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how many kibs expected 4nt and how many pass?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|clinch: going a few down, certainly on a trump switch|pg||
nt|ady: not easy for north to play south with KQX spades|pg||
nt|ady: place|pg||
nt|clinch: Well no, but W has already shown up with an ace and a king, can't have much more|pg||
nt|ady: true|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|warrens:  yes, down on a duck|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: DD simple but fearing @D play if would lose @C finese|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  not sure if the order of the diamonds played by nunes had suit pref implications|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer may have been playing South for @hKx and @dx, in which case he needed to play the way he did|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|warrens:  two ways to make this: 1)finesse, 2) win Ace, @D to the 8, cash K, ruff @S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but when Nunes played high, then low, Fantoni may have decided him to be playing for upside down count first round, then std suit pref second round for a club|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|hK|nt|ady: this leading to at least down 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Verhees @D plays talk vP out of @C switch|pg||

nt|barnets: all kudos to michael kamil in south|pg||
nt|szalay: North will switch to @D nowû|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weak 2@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 to play  Monaco over Fleisher by 44|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think he really ruffed the third diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he ruffed the 1st one. and dropped his clubs on them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: then claimed|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: and a heart at the end|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not great suit  but 1st seat favorable  use the tool!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Sorry.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 down   defence  came to a heart in the end|pg||

nt|dburn: what does it mean?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D - natural (usually 5+) GF|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Levin - you guys never bid?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S = 6+|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thanks Chase|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK works but how likely is that lead on the auction?|pg||
nt|joest:  which major would you lead al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you mean i can't lead @D10???|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point count and shape requirements aren't rigid in 3rd seat -- especially favorable vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: light opening from east|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession -- i lead @S|pg||
nt|joest:  BTW, there is a new book out I would recommend by David Bird on leading against NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus70: support double- mandatory tool for many|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y ok X 4@C and later 4nt is included|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even 1st/2nd  good 9 can be opened|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect accurate defense here by Fanotni/Nunes to set 3nt with ease|pg||
pc|d2|nt|grebrof: they might be slow, but how they treat every hand is better than the common player - a lot is experience thou|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest:  it is a statistical (probabilistic) analysis of what actually works what % of the time|pg||
nt|joest:  it is quite interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can i borrow your copy?|pg||
nt|joest:  on this, I think a case can be made for leading hearts, relying on the spade ace as your side entry but a spade could clearly work|pg||
nt|joest:  sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both west players opened 3@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|grebrof: 2@h +6@s to play or GF (I think)|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N = I respect you :)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 7th best leads? :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear why this went down at the other table|pg||
pc|hK|nt|clinch: 25 points NS; looks as though they may make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: at different colours 2@H would be opened|pg||
pc|h3|nt|grebrof: 3nt maybe nonserious slamtry|pg||
nt|grebrof: invitational + it was|pg||
nt|ady: 9|pg||
nt|ady: declare can make 3 club tricks  playing low to 10 or queen  and then playing the other honour from north  pinning the 98 doubleton with west|pg||
pc|h2|nt|grebrof: its kinda popular to play that now - 2@d being same with @hs I assume|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is only about finding @SQ this 3nt|pg||
nt|bigtrain: even a @S to the king will work|pg||
nt|reisig: Seems  - kinda straight forward|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a  @S too K is down imho|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Can even play @s to King - then @d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S 2@H @D 4@C|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry you right W|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Jeff sent a note to Eric while Bas is thinking, but I couldn't decipher all of it|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Fantoni to get in with heart ace and switch to j club|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|odysseus70: 3 rounds of hearts then 10 of clubs killing the jack|pg||
nt|joest:  here, the heart honor was a winner so long as west is there unblocking from the gitgo|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  from his perspective, this will work when nunes has K or Q clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the club shift does not seem that obvious to me, |pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Fantoni can virtually place declarer's distribution now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you could argue he may as well go for his own suit however since he has spades locked up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW play Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  yes Al, so Fantoni may just duck one more heart first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @H3 @H8 should say  I like my ead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or   i like my Lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for trivia buffs    on WBF list of top players    West= 1  East= 2  South =  3|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  even if Fantoni does return diamond, it will be the 4 and Nunes will work out to play Fantoni for no more diamonds; win and switch to 10 spade|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: i would like to check on 5-3 major fit if north could have one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: want to know why he's  1?   :)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  but Fantoni had virtual set in hand by switching to jack clubs, and as expected he worked it out|pg||
pc|c6|nt|grebrof: 3@s is maybe kinda strange if its to play|pg||
nt|ady: west better to have continued spades|pg||
nt|ady: was that the J@D played at trick 2 Don? from East|pg||
pc|c2|nt|reisig: I'd play @s to King - not trying to win a MP event here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now he needs to find Queen of @S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: now he needs the @SQ onside|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzff: yes it was|pg||

nt|jaapfr: hope they appreciate the joke|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|odysseus70: quickly found by Willenken|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|jaapfr: E in OR played @D first and is still regretting that|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  27  Zagorin opened that 4333 3-ace hand  1N=14-16, so he playes 3@H from west without NS entering auction|pg||
nt|joest:  north-south did bid the slam at the other table|pg||
nt|joest:  on the prior hand|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Nunes guaranteeing at least down 1, but still possible for d2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|h5|nt|jaapfr: but 3@H bid in OR made it somewhat more unclear|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|odysseus70: same thing -duck and the ace of diamonds scores- win and trump trick goes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they had quick easy exclusion rkc auction|pg||

nt|barnets: fit jump|pg||

nt|odysseus70: same book|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too   but there is a large group that bids 1@S whenever they have 4|pg||
nt|joest:  btw, when I play standard I still like strong jump shifts to hte two level.  Here I could bid 2@h then 3@c and have a lot of this hand bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Weinstein asking what hand types are shown in 1@S|pg||
nt|reisig: @h part score - seems normal|pg||
nt|dburn: well, game not much worse that a finesse|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you all confused me (my first anlysis was right the 3nt was all about finding @SQ)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest:  that works on some hands for sure but in my experience rebidding 1Nt with hands like this works on many more including ones where we 'miss' our spade fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong natural jump shift    cute toy|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a good vul game, not much more than a finesse (no quick ruffs also)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: +70??|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 2@S is a fit jump spades and hearts |pg||
nt|dinos1: yes, clear road|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 1 and void|pg||
nt|barnets: some play that as 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, it's a pretty good fit and not easy to know that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Any idea why he leads K with Rusinow?|pg||
mb|3S|an|alert|nt|tez: not important 4 card @h..but he has bad opener suit|pg||
nt|barnets: if the void was clubs 7@H may work|pg||
nt|phil: isn't 5N generally an even number and an unknown void? |pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|warrens:  interesting question whether this is RKC for @H's or @s's|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk unknown void|pg||
nt|tez: 5 NT 1/3 KC And void|pg||
nt|barnets: it is clearly hearts Warren|pg||
nt|phil: sounds like he thought it was spades - or maybe 6-ace|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3 by PH is impossible :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@S agrees hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think it should be @H's, but don't most people play 5NT shows 2 KC's + void?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they do|pg||
nt|phil: but Fredin won't lead the @cA will he? |pg||
nt|dinos1: by UPH mb|pg||
nt|tez: ýf @c void easy 7|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps Zia misbid or they play other responses|pg||
nt|phil: depends on partner's spades....|pg||
nt|barnets: their  partnership is new|pg||
nt|tez: Martel sure pd has not @s void:)|pg||
nt|phil: counting on a misbid in a new partnership seems like a reasonable possiblility |pg||
nt|odysseus70: diamond lead kills this|pg||
nt|jaapfr: time for a break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Both M & R alerted the RDBL but of course I can't read their notes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a forgone conclusion|pg||
nt|clinch: Presumably 2@s over the double confirmed at least 3|pg||
mb|4H|nt|grebrof: 9 aces|pg||
nt|ady: could lose 2 spades 1 heart and 1 club|pg||
nt|ady: thats how most play|pg||
nt|clinch: May not have the entries to take that many wrong finesses|pg||
nt|dinos1: who 6@c? guess W|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@S now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: only lead says 10 or more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of rebidding 1N with 4@S   make sure your partnership has agreement about priority over checkback when holding BOTH 3-fit and 4 other major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not rusnow|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: trump Q? or "where's your void"?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most common agreement -- 1st priority= show fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: walter   does RDBL show 3-fit or just max?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes  maybe defence will switch to a club|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jaapfr: how one find SD here @D lead is perfect but.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next thing for partnership --  do you just respond shape or do you clarify min/max|pg||
nt|joest:  i think that depends on whether the checkback can be game invitational or whether it is known to be a game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here, 2@H alert says  3@H, maybe 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: if North's stray queen were in diamonds and not spades, you might go down in two|pg||
nt|bigtrain: standard  (A from AK) leads|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, they bid drury, so there was a chance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: for me , i think zia misbid|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not easy on a new partnership, but problem avoided|pg||
nt|dinos1: hmm - 6@h is @c void? or what?|pg||
nt|barnets: and 6@C asked for trump Q|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c means..i have not idea your 5nt bid..pls help:)|pg||
nt|joest:  Katz trying to drag a diamond cue out of Nickell|pg||
nt|joest:  if this is not the worst 13 count in the world, it is close.  I guess it does have an ace in it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely essential to clarify if 1-way checkback   optional if 2-way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: better meld if @DJ rather than @SJ   [pinochle reference]|pg||
nt|joest:  opposite some folks Katz might actually let his partner out short of slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N probably says  bad hand   so not sure if obligated to cue @DA now|pg||
nt|joest:  but Nickell is conservative enough that my guess is it won't matter much what Nick does|pg||
nt|joest:  katz is headed to six|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think Jack -- is 4@D obligatory on the given auction?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  28  Zagorin did open 2@D    and Bathurst also led @S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|phil: if 6@c asked for void, then low = 1st I'd bet|pg||
nt|barnets: but maybe if he bid responded corectly |pg||
nt|dinos1: mb theyresponse by steps|pg||
nt|joest:  one kibitzer points out that a slow 4@h here creats problems of its own|pg||
nt|bigtrain: UNLESS they have promised length in the suit|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|joest:  and to answer your question Al, I am not sure that I must cue-bid a diamond control here but I would|pg||
nt|bigtrain: penalty|pg||
pc|s7|nt|grebrof: maybe can fool them to throw (what) on all the @cs|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe a fast hand?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: how he concluded that i do not know|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|grebrof: doesnt look like it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or deducted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of [many] differences with expert partnerships is discussion of when player MUST cue below game versus when allowed to bypass with bad hand|pg||
nt|joest:  3Nt was such a negative expresson one round ago that yes I would own up to the @d ace|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: now in easy street|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reverse  pauses     slow = discouraging|pg||
nt|joest:  i am not sure what is going on but worse...|pg||
nt|joest:  i'm not sure Katz and Nickell are sure either|pg||
nt|joest:  I know that I would take no action as east that would suggest I have four clubs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nickell wrote down something, but his handwriting is tiny and I can't read it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure -- blame his handwriting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm looking at his hand and still can't figure out 6@C|pg||
nt|joest:  Katz can surely picture hands where the hearts will provide a critical pitch in either diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe  @D control but not 2nd round @C or @S|pg||
nt|joest:  this is the worst of the three possible slams (6@c, 6@h 6NT)|pg||
nt|joest:  it has one further huge demerit|pg||
nt|joest:  it goes down|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|warrens:  come on Michael, claim for once in your life|pg||
nt|grebrof: hehe|pg||
pc|cA|nt|grebrof: I recommend his book thou |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@C asked for void|pg||
nt|barnets: and 6@H showed a vod diamond|pg||
nt|phil: maybe those hours in partnership bidding rooms paid off....|pg||
nt|barnets: that would be in a perfect world|pg||
nt|tez: well bid|pg||
nt|joest:  eric kokish, bidding theorist par excellence has a suggestion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: kokes is koach of Nickell partnership & team|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Katz says Nickell must have a lot of queens, thought he had 4324 shape|pg||
nt|joest:  he proposed (if I have this right) that a 2Nt rebid in response to 2@@d|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzff: some people believe in making the opponents use energy whenever possible|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d is either 4333 or 3334 so that 2@h (the call NIckell chose) would always show a ruffing value, and hence a fourth club|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Also said before the dummy went down he apologizes if Nickell is 4333 shape|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest:  simple but effective and would come to grips with the primary problem eastwest did not cope with here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: great clarification    i knew i was onto something talking about responses to checkback :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|grebrof: if you really should read some books on declarer play, Krzyztof Martens "Virtual European campionships part 1 and 2" are spectacular|pg||
nt|grebrof: Rosenberg only wrote one "Bridge - with Zia and me..."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: other table has finished|pg||
nt|grebrof: they had dinner already too?|pg||
nt|grebrof: books on play are in any way much more important than those on bidding - most end in 3nt sometimes anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Sadly, there are still 41 minutes on the clock, so the director can't hurry them up|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  AK hearts, friendkly jack trumops falls, spade ruff, ace diamond diamond ruff, high trump, claim|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest:  2NT rebid is 4333 or 3334 and 2@h = 3 hearts + a ruffing value somewhere|pg||
pc|hK|nt|leo lasota:  only down on that line if spades 42, with Noerth holding dblton and Jxx trumps|pg||

pc|s6|nt|phil: did this really happen? |pg||

nt|odysseus70: Zia nartel bid 6 clubs where 5C here|pg||
nt|joest:  in the meantime, both 6@h and 6NT looked cold to me so this is a major reversal of fortune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those who just woke up bridgewise   Eric Kokish is member of BOTH   ACBL and Canadian Hall of Fame|pg||
nt|joest:  and deservedly so|pg||
nt|joest:  Anything Eric has to say about bidding is worth listening|pg||
nt|joest:  listening to|pg||
nt|joest:  [although I don't rebid three card suits as often as he would like I'm sure]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I'm hearing that this is pretty speedy for E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: 'never say never' :)|pg||
nt|ady: easy 6NT for e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: I remember he could have taken an ace and didnt, so he has lost his mind too, but they claimed 9, so....|pg||
nt|phil: claim was +600 - quite possible there was a collective Sominex coup|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like they bid perfectly, no confusion on their part|pg||
nt|jaapfr: deduced is the correct English?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Well, Bobby Levin was the Youngest Life Master ever at the ACBL for a long time, at the age of 17 in 1973|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan you could say  something like "OH MY GOD IT DOESN'T MATTER"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only by about 5 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  so what would you bid with Katz' hand al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and he hates having the 2@C-2@D//2@H convention called Kokish  [in original writeup he called it  "Birthright"]|pg||
nt|fabsayc: about 6 boards ahead of their usual pace|pg||
mb|2N|an|3+!S, some type of raise|nt|joest:  that is a battle that Eric has lost however|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right i should say 10 board difference   5 ahead instead of 5 behind|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if in use as natural invite if hand is worth 1@H-3@D |pg||
nt|joest:  at this point Katz with nothing left to do but boost to 4@h on his stiff heart|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't know.  That is a simple and effective method, particularly for casual partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so much so that most don't even realize there IS a battle :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1nt is gf |pg||
nt|warrens:  this makes 6@C, but needs 3-2 trumps and favorable @S's|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: assuming NS don't get into auction  -- what is your rebid plan after  1@H-1N//2@C or 2@H   [if it changes when 1N not forcing please clarify]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Right!!|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  sometimes it is easy to play at a pace quicker than normal when you and your partner are rolling through the boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did i hear correctly that this match didn't finish all boards in set  2??|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: That was the "REAL" lead??|pg||
nt|grebrof: we havent had one partscore making enough tricks for game yet at this table, so they are more afraid of losing a game than bidding too hard at least|pg||
nt|odysseus70: hopeless 4H|pg||
nt|joest:  did 3@c show spades on the side?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 3@C was just pre-emptive|pg||
nt|joest:  3@s clearlysome sort of 'fit showing' then|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest:  since he will be on lead against 4@h|pg||
nt|dburn: to an extent, so does 3NT by East|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or start singing   "the party's over, it's time to call it a day"|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus70: great stop|pg||
nt|szalay: maybe P-P-X-all pass|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: yes for a new partnership good stuff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He was on the USA team with Meckwell that won in the early 80s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Verhees asked something and Rodwell said "very rare" - maybe if M could have 3 spadees?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: best lead|pg||
nt|reisig: I love tight matches :)|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D would have shown a club void|pg||
nt|szalay: 1981|pg||
nt|jaapfr: so Bobby an senior Bas:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 7 spades wrecked by the 5-2 split|pg||
nt|ady: apart from needing Queen hearts down in 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: if he ducks this diamond he can go down |pg||
nt|tez: dony play Q of @c pls|pg||

nt|szalay: I've never seen rescue to 2N|pg||
nt|jaapfr: imo W afraid for another set of half psychish bids NS|pg||
nt|joest:  ok this makes much more sense :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told final board from nickell match was pulled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: or if they're all communicating efficiently|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: they'll play faster|pg||
pc|c8|nt|grebrof: with 3 cards in Ps suit and one sure entry, it looks strange for some - maybe he wants 2 off?|pg||
nt|ady: need control asking bid with hearts agreed to find queen missing|pg||
nt|ady: 11 imps to Fleisher  on hand 28   got to 3NT and make 10 tricks    north raised south overcall of 1NT to 2NT|pg||
nt|clinch: Unfortunately don't know what the EW bidding shows or asks here.... 2@c obviously asking, but not clear after that|pg||
nt|ady: some would bid 2NT with east hand first re-bid|pg||
nt|clinch: Thank goodness for Al Hollander! 2@c= puppet to 2@d, 2@d denied some specific hands, 2NT confirmed 2@c natural and forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: no doubt Drijver's options are pass or dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3451 maybe?|pg||
nt|ni hao: hi|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can only have 3@S if 3451 exactly|pg||

nt|leo lasota:  7 spades|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: the play should be quick|pg||
nt|clinch: Safe spot... W's finessing hasn't been too successful this set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: quicker than the bidding :-)|pg||
nt|clinch: He surely won't finesse anything here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i finally got one right|pg||
nt|bigtrain: and then if you have a singleton @C honor you rebid 1NT|pg||

nt|phil: hard hand to figure out - 4621 in South is possible I guess|pg||
nt|grebrof: now those on the other table are ordering desert|pg||
nt|phil: I mean, who leads a spade from four with three of partner's suit? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: as long as declarer does not find a backwards @CJ play to pin @CT it is doomed|pg||
nt|grebrof: dessert, yes|pg||
nt|grebrof: I think you know the answer Phil|pg||
nt|grebrof: you have something called sandcakes (freely translated from norwegiand - dont know if they are international)|pg||
nt|phil: if he reads South for two clubs at most, cashing the Ace 1st doesn't hurt|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof: about the @s lead - we all get inspired at times + it earned an IMP, so....|pg||
nt|phil: there's two ways to play here - one is the 'old way' which x is hearts and 1S is a takeout. The newer way is double is takeout of  spades and 1S is Michaels|pg||

nt|ahollan1: haven't heard anything about other match in this bracket  after Q3  Gordon over Levine by 49|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  always nice to play a hand comfortably at the 3 level in 10 card fit where only 9 tricks are available|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   F1 = Forcing 1 round   so  FG = forcing to game  F2N = forcing to 2NT, etc|pg||
pc|c7|nt|warrens:  my guess is that Rosenberg raises to 2 and W passes|pg||

nt|clinch: EW reached 6NT on 30 in open room|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3rd - yes|pg||

nt|jaapfr: are EW in this 3nt?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it is scheme i learned from reading Kokish's document on how to fill out WBF Convention Card|pg||
pc|hK|nt|warrens:  Yes, spectators, I was only half right.  W decided to bid the non-vul game.  |pg||
nt|grebrof: I think W has a nice hand when P can raise to 2|pg||
nt|phil: this looks impossible even if he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|phil: he does know the major shapes of NS - he does not know the minors|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S comes under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|phil: to the specs - an endplay gets you to 8 - where's 9? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how can  he go wrong in @C?|pg||
nt|phil: by playing North for Tx|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Levine has Ekeblad-Weichsel playing same system as NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Gordon-Levine that is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think Ekeblad-Weichsel (who are at the table next to me) have 2 boards to play, and their other table just broke|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 to play   Monaco over Fleisher by 46|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1 to play Monaco +41    it's official now    but nice start for Fleisher 2012|pg||

nt|warrens:  unless declarer ducked one of the clubs completely|pg||
nt|szalay: some players play (I think Martel and Co) that 1@D if we have spl M, but 1@C with balanced|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|odysseus70: doing the right thing just when it matters|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I'm pretty sure they play 1@D with 4 almost always|pg||

nt|phil: Monaco is in to the round of 8 - Berg WD's after 3|pg||
nt|tez: neck and neck last round|pg||
nt|odysseus70: hard for declarer to believe East had so much|pg||
nt|jaapfr: new leader|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rodwell led @D - misguessed  J won  then couldn't handle 41 trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I don't have control of that table|pg||
nt|dburn: why must it? 4NT won't make without a heart lead from the king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Last board here. Thanks all. We shall resume shortly (hopefully)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rest up   those should be fun matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Last board of this segment, Final segment resumes 5-10 mins after the Open Room has concluded|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  see if Sementa/Duboin end the set bidding the good slam in 6 minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last hand of the session|pg||
nt|tez: we are here|pg||
nt|reisig: 3N is normal ..just doesn't make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Chris: good match|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the first time i saw all those abbreviations was in the Ultimate Club book, which read like an algebra text|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Outstanding set by Fantoni/Nunes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Thanks to the players of this match and the audience for watching. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: thx Peter Don and sspecks|pg||
nt|barnets: close 3n|pg||
nt|odysseus70: last board of a close encounter-|pg||
nt|joest:  ic, yes the diamond hook (of the queen) was part of the successful route to 12 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Here you can't make 4@S legitimately, but it's a tough defence|pg||
nt|phil: big board for Zia / Chip here|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1 partscore and the other 15 are games bid - not all made - thats teams all right|pg||
nt|clinch: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 4 losers in hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|clinch: Match nicely evened up again thanks to the imaginative lead on 31 in the open room|pg||
nt|ady: e/w  do well in diamonds   10 tricks|pg||
nt|phil: but easy to see how the defense can stub its toe - it almost happened in the OR|pg||
nt|jaapfr: last board of a very fine session|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S shows spades and diamonds I am informed|pg||
nt|ady: yet west supports spades   maybe thinks AX enough|pg||
nt|tez: 3@c asking 5 card major|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and tx Chase for your very fine job|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and szalay and avril for your commentating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Thank you.  The 2nd quarter will be up very shortly after this board, please come back!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he tried to play N for endplay in @S IF N had @SJxxxx|pg||
mb|2N|nt|odysseus70: this time game is very good and they should get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H, 1N or .... for you Jack|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't think Nickell is reopening |pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: dbl +4 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H too high    but will east defend|pg||
nt|joest:  i don't mind 1NT actually|pg||
mb|3D|nt|joest:  as long asyou don't mind looking foolish now and then :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have bid 1N  but wouldn't have loved it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Verhees forgot that is natural over 3rd seat opener :)|pg||
nt|joest:  Verhees has his work cut out for him|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
nt|clinch: 4@h is contract also in open room|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and lbnl tx all for your fine tips ideas info and help kibs|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: The negative DBL did show 4 @ss (at least that's what Rodwell wrote)|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  Monaco outscored Cayne by 21 thusfar in the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 4+ but not 4@D 4@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|clinch: Also by N|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  well down if defence taps declarer|pg||
nt|phil: 3@d simply denies one - it DOES NOT promise a four card major like regular puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||
nt|reisig: OOOPS|pg||
nt|tez: equal..1 down|pg||
nt|phil: wow - big tempo lost here|pg||
nt|barnets: must shift heart now|pg||
nt|dinos1: lost tempo to set @d's|pg||
nt|barnets: or it makes|pg||
nt|joest:  i think he can do it if he works clubs with this entry|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: how many slams have we had this set??|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: you can reverse the dummy somewhat but the wrong hand has the 4th club|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps to Fleisher on 31   made 3NT   when down 3 here|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to find @s switch sometime here...will test EW signalling|pg||
nt|ady: great recovery by Fleisher   in the lead  and may gain on this hand|pg||
nt|clinch: Though as Victor Silverstone points out, the 3@s bid makes it easier :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not tough to make this 4@H imo|pg||
mb|4D|nt|reisig: shift to left foot ...still makes|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h shift wont help|pg||
nt|barnets: why ?|pg||
nt|phil: and duck a heart as well - the level of difficulty just went up a few notches|pg||
nt|dinos1: coz u cant open this suit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: always make 4@S as EW?|pg||
mb|p|nt|grebrof: now one match is live at http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|barnets: well I play a heart and duck it|pg||
nt|phil: yeah but two heart tricks does him no good|pg||
nt|reisig: @d was good ..just ONE trick late :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and try and make 2 hearts and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|phil: two heart tricks....for declarer (to specs)|pg||
nt|barnets: does that work ?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i am not so sure but anyway a good safe\|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2 grands and this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again Kendrick, and Al and Leo, and the spectators who added some good points on fantunes system|pg||
mb|4H|nt|leo lasota:  2 grands by E?W|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: East cant see the the long clubs  as we can|pg||
nt|jaapfr: V-NV:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: loving any action with south hand is an overbid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: what a sneaky way to make 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|phil: the theme is "play the suit you do not want the opponents playing"|pg||
nt|odysseus70: very solid finish on last 3 boards makes it difficult to see how Rosenthal can win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems like more than the 2 grands|pg||
mb|6D|nt|phil: maybe Zia is rubbing off on him :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: not @c?|pg||
nt|joest:  did Nickell really play the spade queen?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Good luck to all in the 4th quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 8@D  told the story|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: relatively quick grands|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: new leader now|pg||
nt|barnets: tx all specs must go now|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx Barnet!|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil: the spade at T2 is so sexy....|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Spade and a test for Willenken|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck's X was negative...  in theory 4@S...  but he did the best he could|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing now   5@C = Turbo   odd   of keycards with @C cue|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaapfr: y but must find @C 3-3 AND @SQ!!|pg||
nt|jaapfr: night bye all|pg||
pc|s9|nt|clinch: Switch not found in open room|pg||
nt|ady: another swing?|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|odysseus70: problems about how to play this- worries abot 4-1 hearts and d ruffs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final board of the 1st half|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus70: lack of entries suggests that right play was ace and another heart-however no way to go down as cards lie|pg||
nt|odysseus70: this extra entry gives options with hearts -can play queen to guard against K10xx with South -losing to bare king with North-that looks right|pg||
nt|leo lasota:  expect that this will be a push or +1 for Monaco on spade lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes so duboin knew he was missing spade ace or less likely diamond king, no need to explore 7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: we're so fast   sontag table and meckwell tables only on 44|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: does not work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: about 70 minutes before Q3    expect 2 closest matches on vugraph|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: is in fact @SJ even sneakier (in stead of the 9)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ?|pg||
nt|tez: well played.i cant say any for defence:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct 5@C also denied 1st/2nd round control in @S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2:  Now it's becoming too obvious I think|pg||
nt|ady: already 25 imps recently   so will be over 30|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|ady: another 11|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|clinch: Bye and thanks!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: bye all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at score from other table   hard to believe same hands|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|joest:  thanks Al|pg||
nt|warrens:  this match isn't over, but it's getting close to over|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine NOT having our match again for 2nd half, but the other 2 matches were relatively close after Q1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|odysseus70: 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: looks like he is trying the 'legitimate' line|pg||
nt|odysseus70: thx all|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D or 5@C   always a close pick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|jaapfr: we all(most) agree 4@S likely down|pg||
nt|agumperz:  bas is playing with mirrors vwd.|pg||
