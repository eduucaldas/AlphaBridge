nt|jcmax: Hi again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Sabine Auken, Mike Kamil and Pekka Viitasalo|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: South bidding Stayman first after the strong club opener|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|bagman: WIth diamonds running N has 9 tricks without getting any extra major suit tricks|pg||
nt|mikam1: Declarer may misguess diamonds and things will get a bit tricky though|pg||
nt|mikam1: He could lead low from hand first|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikam1: Then the ten comes up and............|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|jcmax: But would he not cash the a first in case East has Q10xx?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mikam1: and to avoid East altogether|pg||
nt|mikam1: Probably right Sabine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
nt|jcmax: After all it looks like he needs all five @D tricks and cannot affford any kind of safety play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mikam1: Although perhaps more likely that West has length after the lead|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|mikam1: Queen!!!|pg||
nt|mikam1: no|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bagman: works if N A9x|pg||
nt|mikam1: Ah...he's trying to convince declarer to finesse with A9x |pg||
nt|mikam1: Not best on this hand :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|nt|mikam1: Or "might" work Pekka :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcmax: If declarer indeed had A9x, would there be any reason not to start with the A?|pg||
nt|mikam1: agreed Sabine...but sometimes as defender it's hard to see this so quickly|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, very true! And if one doesn't play the Q quickly, it will be too late anyhow.|pg||
nt|mikam1: right...Bridge is played at the table :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mikam1: in real time|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mikam1: Did he really do that?|pg||
nt|mikam1: with 9 tricks |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes he did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do you think fatigue will be a factor, Mike? Welland having played 4-handed from the word go, Diamond having a bye in the R16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 3 pairs in the team|pg||
nt|mikam1: Apparently fatigue is a factor for Platnick!|pg||
nt|bagman: That was safe with  club stopper|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mikam1: Sorry sorry.....forgot club king was still there :)|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s5|pc|d9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mikam1: In answer to your question Roland...yes...very hard to play 4 all the way through|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declare had chance to try both major suit queens|pg||
mc|9|nt|mikam1: Against very tough competition'|pg||

nt|royhughes: An exciting board for us to start with|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: welland needs to get on track early even with 60 bds to go|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|royhughes: The 1C can be as short as 2 if balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but what does the bidding mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: hi again everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi eric|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 17-18/9|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators are Geoffrey, Sigurbj√∂rn and Bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@D showed @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|bessi2: 1N presumably shows 17-18 or 17-19 bal   he would bid 1@h with 11-13 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk4: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but matches are not playing the same boards|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ty for the explanation|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2H says 6+ clubs, no side suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows diamonds as well?|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|pef: the diamond team had a big second eighth to take a substantial early lead in the match|pg||
nt|athene: i assume 2@S is something cunning|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Hello Peter, Chip and Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this may well end in 6@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1S was an artificial game force|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3! SHOWS A GOOD FIT I THINKC|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy may be tempted to explore|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: BUT bidding a grand may be the only danger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: NS I think unclear on what their bids meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is safe enough will make at least 9 maybe 10|pg||
nt|bessi2: with greco passing 1@c, and considering his @s lead I don't think welland as any reason to misguess @d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thought 2S was a relay to 2NT to show hearts and longer diamonds, Welland thought it showed hearts and clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm well i cant see why - they are playing to qualify for the BERMUDA BOWL and this is a very simple sequence|pg||
pc|d9|nt|royhughes: Yes, you don't want to be in 7 because that rates to need at least a finesse, in addition to setting up a long spade|pg||
pc|dT|nt|royhughes: 6C is easy unless clubs are horrible|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|chip: Diamond picked up 44 the previous set to turn a small deficient into a good lead.|pg||
nt|royhughes: With the Q10 of spades coming down you may make 7|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: the grand is on because of the favorable spade position|pg||
nt|royhughes: Hi William|pg||
nt|athene: NS have changed their system recently haven't they?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i thought these guys were a serious partnership|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: hi bill|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room playing in 6@C i am told|pg||
nt|royhughes: The grand is indeed on but a red-suit lead would put declarer to an early decision|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|bessi2: aren't ns a relatively new partnership ?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: with the match score in mind i dont think they will bid 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: If declarer thinks Greco wouldn't underlead a king, he would maybe go up ace and go after the spades, planning to finesse in the other red suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: But the bidding may have shown where the red aces are|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is just the sort of board Welland needs|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they need a few more hours work on their basic system|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|roswolf: welland may well pick an overtrick imp or 2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: if they get it right of course:)|pg||
nt|royhughes: ;)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bramley thinks Welland showed 7 clubs, stiff spade, and a minimum hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think he's right|pg||
nt|athene: not much for greco to go on; his partner passed up opportunities to double either red suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2 keys, no queen of clubs, and neither red king|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: may be an imp to the leaders|pg||
nt|royhughes: It may be -- or declarer may duck if more worried about Jxxx offside with the king of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|athene: it would be necessary to run this sometimes when east had the @DK but trumps were breaking 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: sorry 4-0|pg||
nt|athene: but better chances from going up with the ace i think|pg||
nt|royhughes: Neither that nor 6-1 diamonds is very likely, so maybe just go for the overtrick!|pg||
nt|royhughes: It must be very close|pg||
nt|royhughes: In fact, with spades coming I think he makes 7 even if he goes up ace|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup a horrible problem if the grand had been bid|pg||
nt|athene: if your only concern were the overtrick i still am not sure what the best chance is|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes indeed.  In 7 I think I would run the lead and get it over quickly|pg||
nt|athene: so much depends on how likely east is to lead away from the king|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pef: chip, of course is scouting to see who will be USA2.  He's part of the Fleisher team that won last|pg||
nt|pef: year and is USA1|pg||
nt|chip: Hi All.  NS play a strong club system, so a lead directing 1C wasn't an option in third seat, and 2C a bit rich.|pg||

nt|mikam1: In the past I do believe that has cost some of Roy's teams - he has played 4 handed several times|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|mikam1: This looks like 6N |pg||
nt|bagman: Here the best contract is 6NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mikam1: South knows there's a slam already|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it will not be easy to stop Diamond after a strongt club (16+)|pg||
nt|mikam1: The best news about playing 4 handed is that there's no wondering who should play, etc.|pg||
nt|mikam1: You just go in and play |pg||
nt|mikam1: Thus, you're always prepared|pg||
nt|bagman: This might end up in a quantitative sequence without ace asks; all depends if they play relays or not|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Sabine must know what it's like since she plays constantly in international events whether they are 4 or 6 in the team|pg||
nt|bagman: If N shows minimum balanced with 6 diamonds, S just bids 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Never shattered, Sabine?|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|mikam1: 5@C Gerber probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: at least South thinks it is Gerber|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: Yes, definitely Roland, actually sometimes it can be more stressful to sit out than to sit at the table yourself. One can always sleep when the whole thing is over :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: And so does North|pg||
mb|6N|nt|jcmax: It's always good when a partnership is on the smae wavelength!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: And they ARE a good partnership|pg||
nt|dburn: even if they do play Gerber|pg||
nt|mikam1: They're excellent bidders and know their system well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to David Burn|pg||
nt|dburn: hello|pg||
nt|mikam1: Hi|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: South was not willing to give up on a possible grand; he knew that at most one ace was missing|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|jcmax: I honestly don't think system matters that much, as long as one knows what one is doing and the partnership is on the same wavelength. That is really the key element.|pg||
nt|mikam1: right|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Typically that indicates that the pair is happy with their system|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now Schermer will get squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn: Diamond actually in a position to claim at trick one, but...|pg||
nt|mikam1: declarer can test diamonds - then play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|mikam1: no cost|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|dburn: ...worth playing on for an overtrick, which might have now materialized|pg||

qx|c77|st||md|3SK62HAQ4DQ9CKQJ32,SJT984HJTDT6CAT84,SAQ75HK2DAKJ72C96,S3H987653D8543C75|sv|b|nt|athene: 2@C a definite possibility i think with such a good suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: but maybe he keeps that for NV|pg||
nt|athene: no harm in heart to ace, spade just to see if the queen falls, is there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: slamtime|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|roswolf: not as i saw no|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: No, but maybe he didn't want to make a mistake!|pg||
mb|1N!|an|17-19 bal|nt|pef: many good pairs use some method to distinguish types of raises after a t/o double|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 2h there is a sound+ 2s raise|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you overbid to 4@H with north trying to induce a phantom sacrifice, but at this vulnerability opps aren't likely to bid 4@S unless they expect to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be duck soup|pg||
nt|bessi2: what system are ns playing|pg||
mb|2C!|an|relay|nt|pef: either side can easily get too high on this hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: 1D shows hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: a type of polish club |pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 3h is already too high for ns, 3s would be too high for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: unfortunate diamond position so maybe four losers here (spade, heart, two diamonds) but perhaps declarer can endplay east?|pg||
nt|athene: the idea being to just take a diamond finesse at a point when east has no trump to return|pg||
mb|3D!|an|5 diamonds|nt|bessi2: hmm....in that case sure looks like a 1@d opening to me |pg||
nt|bessi2: but maybe 1@d is limited to less than his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will power to 6nt otherwise they need to swiych to sayc|pg||
nt|roswolf: switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: michael rosenberg pointed out that e/w actually can make 3s because of the really fortunate club position|pg||
mb|p|pc|h9|nt|athene: a trump is east's only safe lead here|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "always bid 4H - you get 100% sympathy and 0% blame" - i agree|pg||
nt|athene: now west knows his partner is likely to have vulnerable holdings in all the side suits and will think which to play through to get him off the endplay|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok they may keep their system:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: NS just have to avoid panicking and trying to cash diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: no, michael's right (of course)|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure - what about if the defence force dummy with a third round of hearts immediately?|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, both minors are sort of "frozen". They can't play diamonds and if they rise A of clubs, declarer gets to pitch his D's|pg||
nt|pef: although two more hearts here makes it difficult|pg||
nt|smoller: I am not so sure of 3@S - look like declarer cant manage 3 times hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the standard defence when you see a threatening side suit in dummy is to force dummy|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, it was a close decision for W with Qx of hearts, but the rest of his hand is good for offense.|pg||
nt|pef: simple looking actually quite complicated|pg||
nt|chip: And 2H was most often a 3 trump raise.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|pef: well greco found by far the best continuation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pef: and so did hampson|pg||
nt|roswolf: a club switch would be my choice but i can see the cards|pg||
nt|bessi2: an informed source told me that welland just likes to conceal :)|pg||
nt|bessi2: there sure ain't nothing wrong with that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: some questions about how balanced "balanced" has to be|pg||
nt|roswolf: no void perhaps!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I routinely bid this way with 5-4|pg||
nt|roswolf: routinely OMG|pg||

nt|bagman: Here a good six spades if you need some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcmax: Has the set of slam deals arrived?|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think the great dealer in the sky just sent some over for us :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|bagman: It's sub par slam but much better than a Roland slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: S seems to have upgraded his hand slightly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, too good for me|pg||
nt|mikam1: How many hearts to bid?|pg||
nt|mikam1: I like 3|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mikam1: none|pg||
nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
nt|dburn: extra playing strength, it's true, but one always feels a bit nervous about opening a strong club with a distributional under-pointed hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Playing a strong club system myself I have found that is often a good idea when you are close hcp-wise and have a long suit that is not good enough to jump in|pg||
nt|mikam1: I guess 2@D is multi ish|pg||
nt|dburn: if the opponents pre-empt, it makes life more awkward than perhaps it need be|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: but when you have spades, that's less of a worry|pg||
nt|bagman: S hand is much better than a typical 5242 16 pointer|pg||
nt|dburn: with hearts, he might have bid those rather than a strong club|pg||
nt|mikam1: Well Schermer might have made life more difficult in a sense by bidding 3@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: On the other hand...he might have pushed the opponents into a making slam|pg||
nt|mikam1: So....these preempts cut both ways|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed he might - the three level is a lot more effective than the two level in this kind of position|pg||
nt|dburn: and to pre-empt with 2@d rather than 3@h is... well, "stolid" is a word that comes to mind|pg||
nt|jcmax: What would N have done over 3@H? 3N might be the right contract, but 14 hcp is a bit strong for that. 4NT?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|bagman: The problem with all NT bids is that Qxx is a very bad stopper as N cannot hold up|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe dbl, but then it might be difficult to get to NT when that is right|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|mikam1: 3@H would have made life tough|pg||
nt|bagman: That's why the preempts work|pg||
nt|mikam1: Now 5@S by North?|pg||
nt|bagman: N on his way to describe short hearts?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Will John move on...I think not|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mikam1: Unless he feels that partner's sequence is looking for a heart control|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: uh oh|pg||
nt|mikam1: If they play 6@D, someone has to figure out to tap the dummy|pg||
nt|jcmax: I guess from North's point of view South could easily be 5-5 and @D would be the right spot then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond must have taken 4@D as natural|pg||
nt|bagman: If they reach 6@S, S will play E for the Q of spades and make|pg||
nt|mikam1: 6@S will surely make, 6@D not so fast|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Schermer knows to shorten dummy|pg||
nt|mikam1: Great decision by Platnick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But all that is moot now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: diamond is holding his head and thinking|pg||
nt|mikam1: I think I would have played partner for 5-5 as Sabine suggests|pg||
nt|dburn: what did 3@c mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: shrugs and passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is a very lucky break for Diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He must have heard about my slams|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mikam1: So this will be a fortunate swing for Diamond - assuming normal finesse through the non-preemptor|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I make it 38.7234% approximately|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Diamond sighs and plays on|pg||
nt|bagman: The slam is bit under 50% (I think; especially after the preempt) so staying out would be fine normally; here the low preept short of forced NS to slam by taking out some bidding ...|pg||
nt|bagman: space|pg||
nt|bagman: sort of|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|bagman: Ok much under|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|bagman: In this sequence no chance to avoid the heart lead|pg||
mc|12|nt|dburn: not all that much - some chance of a trump coup if West has the singleton eight or nine of spades|pg||
nt|mikam1: If the opponents didn't know to cash a heart at trick one, it would be better|pg||

nt|bessi2: some players like overcalling 3@h with this hand, I prefer Hampson's style|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bit less secure than the previous hand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: 1@H  8-11  not 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well now south must try for the slam bonus|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pef: so he opened their strong 1c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This seems to be Puppet Stayman, asking for 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the idea is when responder is so limited it's easy to sort out quickly if it's a game or slam hand|pg||
nt|athene: and of course most positives to a strong club are in this range|pg||
nt|bessi2: to answer why.. I guess I like my preempts to be classic|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bridge is easy, clubs 4-4, so 9 easy tricks in NT, 10 without a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt isnt the most scientific bid and seems to have depressed south into passing - for what it was worth i would have bid 4@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 3@S showed hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: One advantage is that West has not disclosed his 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has the option of leading the @HJ second time playing north for @H9x|pg||
nt|bessi2: plus there are advantages.. 3@h bid makes it more likely for the opps to find finesses more easily if needed|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|chip: not sure about the followups here. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: all bids got notes but can't read them from here, sorry|pg||
nt|chip: Well, 9 tricks for NS are easy, its holding EW to 4 that requires a bit of luck.|pg||
nt|athene: he won't want to lead a club|pg||
nt|athene: difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i assume dummy has shown exactly four hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, that's an option created by the trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: ah, ok, he isn't put to the test there|pg||
nt|royhughes: Bramley may have been thinking partner could have Axx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: bramley felt his partner might have led from @HAxx but he would not have led from @HQxx, so finessing against dummy couldn't really gain|pg||
nt|royhughes: and that playing 3 rounds of trumps would be better than blocking them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: he won't want to lead a club, did someone say that?|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|bagman: Here three losers and 10 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|jcmax: This looks like an unstoppable 10 tricks in @H for EW. Must be disappointing for S looking at 3 aces!|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: S might X 4@H as N responded vul to the opening|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: yes, tempting to do so|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bagman: Not to X for one down but for the possibility of 2 or more down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: still, as Edgar Kaplan always discussed...when the opponents opt for 10 tricks on their own steamm....|pg||
nt|mikam1: steam|pg||
nt|mikam1: They may very well know what they're doing :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: if it's just steam, you should not double, but if it's steammm, you probably should|pg||
nt|jcmax: Doubling would be much more attractive when 40 some imps down. Not so much the other way around maybe|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|bagman: True; here the opps are 45 down so they might try a bit harder than normally|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|bagman: With that slam in the bag, he might have felt that no more chances for a couple of boards|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mikam1: maybe so|pg||
nt|mikam1: In any case, he wisely (on this hand) didn't|pg||

mb|1H!|an|spades|nt|royhughes: Hampson Greco play a kind of Precision, with 1D 2+ cards|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: west perhaps a little good for 3@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told the slam was bid in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: On the prior hand NS got to 5D in the other room, which required a different king of luck: hearts running, and perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: welland psyched a positive to a strong club?|pg||
nt|athene: that's usually sort of a bad thing to do :)|pg||
nt|pef: perhaps 1h is their negative response|pg||
nt|athene: or 1@C is just natural with transfer responses?|pg||
nt|chip: 1c isn't strong, it is most often 11-13 balanced. Here it is the strong balanced version. 1H showed 4+ spades|pg||
nt|pef: ok, the annotation to 1c says strong|pg||
nt|athene: i can imagine someone semi-psyching 1@H transfer in response to a [semi-]natural 1@C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|smoller: Spades are very well places, but defence can set up a diamond ruff or a a promotion in clubs|pg||

nt|roswolf: this seems very comfortable as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|royhughes: Yes, I'll leave the overtrick analysis to you guys|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chip: In principle 1c is balanced or clubs, but they like to do it on 5-3-3-2 hands of 17-19 even with a 5 card major.|pg||
nt|pef: both spades onside, it seems like it took a diamond lead to beat it|pg||
nt|roswolf: no automatic transfer to 4@S i am pleased to see - which is the usual occurence with these sequences|pg||

nt|Walddk2: With a score of 89% you mean?|pg||
nt|pef: exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: alerted 2c|pg||
nt|roswolf: the slam made on 78|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pef: I believe achieving an above average board against them in a club game led to "re-education"|pg||
nt|athene: light-ish 1@C|pg||
nt|royhughes: 11-13 is the low range for 1@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no room for usual 2-suiter scheme over 2@C really as you need 2nt natural, for one thing|pg||
nt|pef: platnick is probably feeling pretty pleased about his 1n making 2 in the closed room since a club or heart lead beats 1nt several|pg||
nt|athene: west probably wouldn't treat his hand as a red 2-suiter even if he had the opportunity, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playable in spades too|pg||
nt|pef: what would you guys bid with bramley's hand here?|pg||
nt|bessi2: unlucky break for the welland team on board 78|pg||
mb|2C!|an|GF artificial|nt|royhughes: Bramley showed hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: very light 1@S for second seat|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont know if it was unlucky roy didnt have to bid 3nt|pg||
mb|2H!|an|4+ diamonds|nt|pef: well that wasn't his best choice|pg||
nt|athene: well he has 11, if you count the @HJ twice|pg||
nt|athene: personally i wouldn't even count it once|pg||
nt|royhughes: Don't blame you|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C shows 5 hearts doesn't it?|pg||
nt|bessi2: of course not.. but slam was an underdog|pg||
nt|athene: or it is just a game-forcing relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|smoller: pass looked as a great winner|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D obviously hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: which ended up wagging iys tail|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: uts|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|athene: i don't see why he had to bid so fast|pg||
nt|chip: I think Greco will take expection to this.  On the prior deal EW bid 1C (strong) -1D-1N and lost 7 IMPS|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy starting to warp a bit in view of the match score|pg||
nt|royhughes: Presumably this shows a balanced hand|pg||
nt|royhughes: if diamonds are the longest suit, he must be balanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disciplined 3@H WOULD ALLOW NORTH TO SQUIRM OUT|pg||
nt|athene: i know NS play some odd stuff - maybe 1@S - 2@D is hearts actually|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: if you aren't going to pass, why not 3@C and play 3n if partner hasn't got four spades|pg||
nt|pef: the spots might be good enough for him to survive this|pg||
nt|chip: He wanted to be declarer to avoid a club lead through, and he did get a friendly lead. Still, 3c then 3S was an attractive alternative (and with the KQ of clubs a questionable ...|pg||
nt|chip: value, an invitational 3s is not unreasonable either)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess the problem with 3@C is, if partner bids 3@H (as expected), you can't really bid 3@S because that endplays him if he hasn't got four spades (he can't bid 3NT himself)|pg||
nt|pef: I've noticed that a lot of foreign pairs play 2n forcing (by the east hand) in this situation asking for a description of major lengths|pg||
nt|athene: you could just bid 3@C then 3NT over 3@H hoping partner reads that as showing four sapdes|pg||
nt|athene: spades|pg||
nt|athene: even 4@S is too high :) and bramley is thinking about slam|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must be thinking about either 3@s or 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think he can seriously be thinking about 3@HXX|pg||
mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|athene: south is going to commit to game|pg||
nt|athene: but has three possible strains in mind - notrumps, hearts, diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: now 3nt likely to play|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: blood may flow here but whose it is not certain|pg||
nt|bessi2: 3N non serious I imagine looking at his hand|pg||
nt|athene: probably just 4@S-1, flat board|pg||
nt|bessi2: Bramley has to close up shop now|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|roswolf: retransfer to @H|pg||
nt|royhughes: Now I think 4@h from north|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is i think a very practical contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but we meander on|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|pef: I think the positioning of the ace of diamonds and the doubleton in the north hand means that 4s is going down even double dummy here|pg||
nt|pef: interestingly in the closed room e/w stopped in 2nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|roswolf: AN ADVENTUROUS WAY TO ACHIEVE A PUSH|pg||
nt|athene: bramley just thinks ok, i only need pd to have some honours in his suits, like @SKQ @DAQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks very dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the hands fit well - that @HJ turns out to be worth a good bit after all!|pg||
nt|royhughes: the diamond lead threatens a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: certainly no trump finesse now|pg||
nt|royhughes: stops declarer from picking up the trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|athene: @HQ, diamond ruff, club, diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3NT interesting contract; club lead you can just lead diamonds towards dummy and finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: try for 1 club, 4 diamonds, 1 heart and 3 spades|pg||
nt|athene: of course much harder on a heart lead but how is that getting found?|pg||
nt|chip: Also, EW seem to only have 9 tricks, though winning the first D not best. NS do need to remove the heart at some point. to beat this.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: I think he can pretty much lead anything now and beat this|pg||
nt|athene: i have noticed several times in this event the precision 2@C opener has caused quite a few problems for opps|pg||
nt|athene: quite a limited bid when you play it as 6+ clubs so responder doesn't usually have huge problems with the lost space, but opps do|pg||
nt|chip: If N ruffs this, then needs to lead a heart back.|pg||
nt|pef: while we are waiting, perhaps the vugraph operator can let us know if there was any interesting discussion over the bidding of the previous board?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: There was none...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland: I showed 5152 with a minimum minimum I didn't like|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pef: I guess roy's response was routine|pg||
nt|athene: i assume bramley didn't open 1@S because he didn't want to wrongside 3nt (partner likely to respond 1nt)|pg||
nt|athene: so he just hides the fifth spade and treats his hand as strong bal|pg||
nt|pef: I think ruffing here was a mistake.  if he playslow and north ruffs, as chip said, north now has to play a heart back--at least there was a chance of going wrong, now almost none|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: My old eyes just can't read most of the notes.  Maybe I should ask them all to print and in crayon|pg||
nt|chip: Now defense is in better shape as declarer can't take another spade finesse. Probably best to throw a D.|pg||
nt|pef: bramley welland play 1c is either natural or various nt ranges, possibly with 5 card majors.  one of the ranges is 17-19 which is what he had|pg||
nt|athene: oh right |pg||
nt|athene: so systemically he couldn't open it 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: or at least he had the option of 1@C anyway|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, and routine for them to open a club with a 5 card major and a 5-3-3-2 hand if out of their 1N opening range (14-16)|pg||
nt|pef: correct (according to their system notes)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco fans his hand, folds it, puts it down and leans back|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: north might imagine his partner has another club honour and not the @HQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the defence mustnt be too active|pg||
nt|bessi2: The dbl of 3@h made his hand worse.. 4@d was an overbid in my opinion after having shown interest with 3@s.. but knowing the intricacies of their system I can't say for sure|pg||
nt|bessi2: NOT knowing their system i mean to say|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bessi2: ahh.. a spec suggests 4@d forced 4@h... end signal|pg||
nt|athene: right could be|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 4D apparently generally asked about the quality of the hand, and 4H was yuck|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and this will drift down|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|athene: ..ok, he finds the heart lead anyway - not much else to do by that point|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that the @C10 might be showing a heart card|pg||
nt|athene: an amusing possibility here is @DJ, ruffed by north, then @HK |pg||
nt|athene: east ruffs and plays @SA and @SJ and north can win but then has to lead into dummy, or north can unblock and let his partner win the last club|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bagman: His spades are solidish and the red suits are reasonable for 5@S|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jcmax: And what does it mean, if you first pass and then bid later? Would that be a better hand or a weaker hand or a "I couldn't make up my mind" hand?|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mikam1: Yes|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it's either "I can beat this whatever you lead" or it's a Lightner double|pg||

nt|mikam1: Lightner feels right, no?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcmax: Yes, it does.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: If the X is is Lightner, heart lead might be the only lead to beat it|pg||

nt|athene: just the @SK10xxx - is that enough?|pg||
nt|smoller: Down 2?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow a freak|pg||
nt|bessi2: my oh my.. this could be interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: nice flat hand here ;)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chip: looked like down 1|pg||
nt|pef: Did I miss something, wasn't that down 1?|pg||
nt|chip: 4S making looks pretty normal.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, fat fingers, corrected now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double from north, then 4@C if that's still a splinter for them over a double|pg||
nt|roswolf: where will the music stop on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes, Welland has more spades than usual|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C - 3@C and finish, i guess?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|bessi2: I like Welland's style here.. although I prefer opening 1@s myself|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the thin double means welland likely to get trumps right|pg||
nt|athene: he will see from the opening lead that north hasn't got @CAK so he really should have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|chip: They also opened 1S in the other room, but didn't double. Question about no 4C splinter, but perhaps that is not on after a double.|pg||
nt|roswolf: may play 3nt rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: many would raise the spades with that hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: still, just an overtrick this time|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C could be bid and let through on the lead|pg||
mb|5H|nt|roswolf: THESE GUYS GO FOR THE MAX|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco maybe is treating it as too good for 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmmm|pg||
nt|athene: misunderstanding over 3@C perhaps?|pg||
nt|pef: looks like guessing the spade will now be a lot more important than an overtrick|pg||
nt|chip: If 3C is a game try, seems like an overbid with all that junk.  5c looks like exclusion, but can't be. Maybe a delayed splinter?|pg||
nt|athene: welland has a really bad hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Bart starts to put out 5D card then corrects to 5S|pg||
nt|athene: he should be making whatever his weakest bid is - maybe he thought 3@C showed a minimum here (2nt system on) but bramley thought otherwise|pg||
nt|chip: Looks like they may well get to clubs or a slam.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H  may proke them into it|pg||
nt|roswolf: provoke|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely double 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: with a trick ineach major|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if south intends his bid as a sort of "non-forcing spade raise"|pg||
nt|athene: north must surely be wondering about that as he has a pretty easy pass otherwise?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: by "non-forcing raise" i mean it's an offer to play but opener can go back to spades if he really hates hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@S is what i would bid but i am a coward |pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 4@s is a decent spot too|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: roy isnt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: Should note that this is a complicated new system for bramley, though 4N makes a lot more sense. Now will presumably guess the spade as noted to win a (scary) IMP|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but this is safe enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson: passed me in exclusion again?|pg||
nt|athene: i'm told the other room chose the 4-3 spade fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: I only see 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 8 tricks on top plus extras ruffing|pg||
nt|royhughes: which the defence is out to stop!|pg||
nt|royhughes: this may be complicated|pg||
nt|athene: yes, only one obvious loser but it's all about winners|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer doesn't have 11|pg||
nt|athene: no way to ruff a heart then take a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: north has too many trumps for that|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm another illusion of a hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence will have to be careful|pg||
nt|royhughes: How do you plan this?  I think you try to make declarer's hand high, since it has the long heart.  So maybe up queen at T1 and play hearts|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm sure Greco is thinking more deeply than that!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: ace and another trump and declarer has to decide whether to try to make it (hearts from the top) or cater for 3-0 hearts and duck one|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this should be -1|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry of course ducking a heart would be cold for 11 tricks, he is only in 5 :)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if east is going to attack a minor suit, diamonds is the one to go for|pg||
nt|athene: he has too many clubs to hope to set up tricks there|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: a spec says he plays QC (he aint led from Jxxxx) and then a heart to the 8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: many pairs play after 1major - 2nt, 3@C is any min and perhaps welland thought that applied here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pef: claim?|pg||
nt|pef: I think we probably missed a bit of the play :)|pg||
nt|chip: just the trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: maybe we missed the bit where north switched to a trump at trick 3 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: got behind with slow response|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|royhughes: a heart finesse is maybe a good idea at t2|pg||
nt|athene: now he'll hope north had @HKJx or @HQJx originally|pg||
nt|royhughes: it loses an entry for the ruffs, though|pg||
nt|roswolf: dd i think it is always off but the defence needs care|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult because you want to throw a diamond on the 13th spade (which won't be good as the cards lie)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: not sure about that play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|royhughes: But that requires trumps to be drawn|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|royhughes: I didn't see any way for Greco to make it|pg||
nt|roswolf: now doomed and a possible game swing for welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: the roof now falls in|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|s9|nt|royhughes: down 2, i think|pg||
nt|athene: east can't really have @CAK, @SQ, @HA, @DK (16 count) so diamond back would be the quick way to beat the contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably -2 actually|pg||
nt|athene: but this is fine - north can see there is no rush|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: incroyable|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: well he loses one more trick; not exactly the roof falling in|pg||
nt|athene: he was always sure to go one down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Welland apologizes for his play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco-Hampson taking a break|pg||

pc|s3|nt|mikam1: I guess it depends on how light you're allowed to balance with majors |pg||

nt|bagman: Now a signal and then 5 hearts and 2 clubs for the defense (or after the next diamond)|pg||

nt|roswolf: YES|pg||
nt|roswolf: are the players back yet eric|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yes but director consulting about time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: playing boards out of order so this board will be up in a second|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the previous bd 6@SX-4 was the result welland gaining 11 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: now resuming on correct board|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: greco/hampson play both multi and weak 2 bids|pg||
nt|pef: 2h is a sound weak 2 bid by their standards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: After Greco cashed his aces he cont diamonds, roy won spade to dummy finess claim|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt perhaps from north now?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's not the right vulnerability for that sort of bid|pg||
nt|athene: double would work out very nicely but i think many would do that at imps|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H looks natural but roy may try something tactical|pg||
nt|royhughes: Greco will be looking at a pretty good hand and nowhere obvious to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|bessi2: welland will surely make a bid showing his Majors|pg||
mb|2D!|an|majors|nt|athene: sorry i *don't* think many would do that at imps :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: south should pass and leave the dice to fall where they will|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|athene: platnik did quite a lot of bidding in the other room? did diamond ever promise any values?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't blame Hampson for pulling, clarifying his hand type|pg||
nt|roswolf: now blood may flow|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe decent 18 count is worth a go at game when partner has four spades|pg||
nt|athene: welland  playing his partner for nothing|pg||
nt|athene: 800 is there for the taking|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandbagging!?|pg||
nt|athene: (heart lead, south gets in with the @HK and leads a spade to get a ruff there)|pg||
nt|roswolf: greco hasnt passed yet and nor has south|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would expect Greco to pass -- he has shown his hand|pg||
nt|athene: well greco can choose which way round to put his pass card but i don't see that he has any other room to exercise judgement|pg||
nt|royhughes: I agree, but he must be thinking about something|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: often a minor overcall over a weak-2 shows both minors|pg||
nt|athene: because otherwise you would double or bid notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so greco might be thinking that his partner could have clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but he didn't pull to 4@C|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|athene: bramley doesn't double again because he just doesn't want to hear 4@D from partner|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes roy i think chickened out|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: of course he wouldn't have been ecstatic to hear 2nt lebensohl then 3@D after the first double, but it's a bit more manageable a level lower i guess|pg||
mb|4H|nt|smoller: Seems best not to lead the singleton club|pg||
nt|chip: A bit surprised S raised with weak hearts and a soft hand, but guess he didn't want to defend 2S and hoped to make it harder (which it did)|pg||
nt|chip: Good decision by Welland to bid 4S, would not be so great if partner were 3-1-3-6.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Roy gets the screen closed again and asks Jeff something, Jeff reading roys note and writing a response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: another question from roy and a response|pg||
nt|pef: making 5 in the closed room was pretty impressive|pg||
nt|chip: perhaps after a stiff club lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: So NS missed a big opportunity|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: They may get 200 instead of 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip: probably questions about leads and signals.|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that seems very likely|pg||
nt|roswolf: rehi all|pg||
nt|bessi2: quite easy to let this through|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|athene: welland decided to believe his opps (who were vulnerable) rather than his partner (who was not)|pg||
nt|athene: which was maybe not ridiculous i suppose|pg||
nt|royhughes: True, and Bramley maybe didn't know his partner's 3N was for real, either|pg||
nt|roswolf: but you should ALWAYS believe pard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: yes, north led a club and got a ruff but that didn't really help the defence very much|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|chip: This will hold it to 4.|pg||
nt|roswolf: seems crazy to me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: well, up to a point|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|athene: but bramley is in first seat at favourable and he needs 50 imps the same as you do|pg||
nt|athene: some partners will tend to do things in that situation|pg||
nt|roswolf: niet you have 2 opps already why create a 3rd|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|chip: and get the hand over more quickly.|pg||
nt|pef: is somebody really thinking here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Jeff calls for director, tempo issue with Roys first pass he explains|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can cash one trump then just cash the @CKQ and @DA crossruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: or bart's 4C call|pg||
nt|athene: i can certainly imagine welland might have given it a think over 3@H - he almost has a double or a 3@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, the problem was with Bramley's break before 4C  Jeff is Hampson and Roy is Welland|pg||

nt|chip: I disagree, he seems well short of a bid. His hand is better suited to pass, planning to bid 3S over the DBL. Look how strong his partner is and 4S isn't cold.|pg||
nt|pef: n/s is making the call|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a mention about the general tactics here - the more active and aggressive your opps, the more you have to really know when your partner's bids promise things and ...|pg||
nt|athene: how much they promise|pg||
nt|roswolf: another action hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hang on to your hats|pg||
nt|athene: because you will often face these "should i believe opps or partner?" situations|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: fit jump would be useful here|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe -- the South hand isn't a classic for it|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w should buy the contract because of the @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director question about tempo on previous hand, both before about double and pass over 4D|pg||
nt|roswolf: HMM INTERESTING|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wondered if NS felt they might have doubled 4@D if the pass was quicker|pg||
nt|athene: north will not stop bidding over 4@S if his partner has shown some sort of good heart raise|pg||
nt|athene: he has the sixth heart AND the spade void|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have a chance to beat 5H on a diamond ruff, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think he they should have axed anyway so arguably no damage|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's hard to stop to double 4@S on the NS cards|pg||
nt|athene: a lot might depend here on whether south can show specifically a 3-card raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: well evereyone has stopped it seems|pg||
nt|athene: or just some "good raise"|pg||
nt|athene: facing the former, north might not go to the 5-level|pg||
nt|athene: facing the latter he surely will|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: director looking at previous hand to see if tempo influenced Hampson's pull of the X to 4D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, 2@D is normally a 3-card raise i assume|pg||
nt|athene: now north might bid 3@S trying to show his hand and get his partner involved over 4@S|pg||
nt|royhughes: Who is screenmate with whom here?  And Hampson tell who was taking time?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hampson and Bramley are screenmates|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may well see a tactical(ie pyschic) bid|pg||
nt|athene: a bid of 4minor from north should be much more concentration in that minor - north doesn't want to emphasize either minor, he just wants to say "i have a 6th heart and a spade ...|pg||
nt|athene: void"|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: did they put the board aside?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Director took the board...|pg||
nt|chip: As I noted earlier, 4s would not be a winning action if partner had long clubs and only 3S. Slow 4C might suggest that, but really in this auction doesn't point to anything much ...|pg||
nt|chip: specific (and could be N who was thinking)|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt looks ok over 1@S?|pg||

nt|royhughes: He's starting by just showing his 2nd suit (2D was artificial)|pg||
nt|athene: well yes but 2@D was a heart raise i assume|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right|pg||
nt|roswolf: on the last bd welland gained 2 imps - for the moment|pg||

nt|chip: Started same way in the other room, and N balanced with 1N as here, buying it.|pg||
nt|royhughes: Everyone's bidding the other side's suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if partner has a dead minimum you could lose quite a lot of hundreds|pg||
nt|pef: not buying it here, though|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D looks reasonable to me|pg||

nt|athene: just give partner @HA, @DAK and there you are|pg||

nt|athene: ok, welland forgot the system or is slightly psyching again?|pg||
mb|d!|an|6-7 pts any|nt|athene: definitely going against the field to pass that north hand|pg||
nt|pef: in the closed room schermer did not open the bidding as north.  schermer/chambers must be about the only pair in this event who wouldn't open the north hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: this is the hippy table - put some flowers in your hair and ignore conventional behaviour|pg||
mb|1N!|an|clubs + spade supp?|nt|roswolf: psychic probably|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know what system options are for North|pg||
nt|athene: if 1@D shows hearts, that explains why greco isn't attempting to show a major 2-suiter :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: so they missed a game that looks like it will probably make despite the bad club break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: hamp witing note for Welland|pg||

nt|roswolf: dbl shows 3@H?|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: THIS IS A MURKY AUCTION|pg||
nt|royhughes: 2NT a spade raise, like previous board|pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand for a passed hand, in a way|pg||
nt|roswolf: UNCLEAR|pg||
nt|royhughes: I suspect 2N says there may be game|pg||
nt|athene: but then again in another way he has a pretty bad hand :)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, East has a good hand for having passed, but maybe a bad one for having bid a vulnerable spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes being talked out of game is a hideous sin|pg||
nt|athene: he will expect his partner to have a singleton heart but that isn't marvellous|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's ok as at least hearts aren't getting overruffed, as north has 4 (ha, ha)|pg||
nt|royhughes: Game is borderline: spades come and hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|royhughes: Are you allowed to psyche an artificial bid in this event?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: both east and west know north may be at it |pg||
nt|athene: but you don't really want to have to try to ruff 3 hearts in the west hand|pg||
nt|athene: since partner is the one with the big spades|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: even for roy I find it hard to believe the 3n call|pg||
nt|chip: Yes, by anyone.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: N & S both writing notes for opps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: Perhaps 3D was ART, asking.|pg||
nt|chip: Seems odd for Hampson to choose hearts, and looks like this can be beater by either tapping the dummy twice, or leading trumps.|pg||
nt|pef: 4h can be beaten fairly easily by forcing dummy to ruff a diamond.  but somewehre in the auciton hampson may have shown spade support|pg||
nt|pef: aren't we starting to run into time problems here?|pg||
nt|chip: yes|pg||
nt|pef: what's the time limit?  2 hours and 10 minutes or something like that?|pg||
nt|smoller: yes, 2:27 in the morning here :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: another c*** overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|pef: bramley maybe hoping they get to 3n?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i see south gives north a lot of slack|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I meant clubs are 75% if you have enough entries, and you may be one short|pg||
nt|roswolf: that bidding was routine|pg||
nt|athene: it's good to overcall very aggressively over a precision-style 1@D because it's tactically vulnerable to intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: that's a lot of passing with a near solid 7 card suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|athene: responder can't raise easily when 1@D might be only a doubleton|pg||
nt|roswolf: yuck |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|royhughes: Hampson had to consider partner having Jx in trump|pg||
nt|athene: must lose three diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|athene: even if you managed to get some sort of elimination position, west can just stick up the @DJ so you are totally doomed|pg||
nt|athene: no way you can duck a diamond to east and endplay him|pg||
nt|athene: and you are short of about half-a dozen entries to strip the rounded suits anyway :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west have to be awake when declarer plays a diamond off the board|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't see any way either.  And Hampson can rise with the jack if you get close|pg||
nt|royhughes: But Welland will give it a try, I'm sure|pg||
nt|athene: he'll use an entry to run the @CQ i guess - the king might be onside after all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: welland trying a swindle|pg||
nt|royhughes: This looks dangerous to me -- might he not run into a diamond ruff on a hand that was makeable?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but roy is well versed in judging the table vibes|pg||
nt|royhughes: and I'm not sure -- maybe it's fairly safe|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially he puts max pressure on opps when others dont|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|royhughes: If East could put up a doubleton honor, take a ruff and exit in hearts, that would be one down if he had the club king|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: depends how many bids partner is allowed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jcmax: You mean you would invite him with 5@H David? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner had only one bid and only one bid, opening a strong game forcing 2@H would be my choice :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I assume partner is not allowed to bid|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght be hard to find a partner playing that kind of two bids|pg||
nt|mikam1: At the other table, Roy opened the North hand 2@S - perhaps state of the match|pg||
nt|dburn: no - would bid four diamonds, which playing the "South is only allowed one bid" system asks for aces and round-suit queens|pg||
nt|mikam1: Bart bid 2N followed by 3@H...probably thought it was forcing...|pg||
nt|mikam1: can't know everything in a new partnership (even in a practiced one)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: well, either he thought it was forcing or the Guinness Book of Records should be informed of a new level for pessimism|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|bessi2: Welland's bidding style in general can be quite funky... which can make him an extremely dangerous and difficult opponent|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H forcing presumably, but north has to be tempted to break discipline and pass it anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but they should stay low enough|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bessi2: is there is ever a reason to pass a forcing bid then this was it  lol|pg||

nt|bessi2: Bart must have felt a knot in his stomach when he discovered 3@h was passed out|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: same auction as before, so east has shown 5+ hearts? so i guess 2@H from west now|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: I don't think it was alerted as forcing unless I missed it|pg||
nt|athene: well if 4@D is a cue it's an overbid|pg||
nt|royhughes: If Welland is cuebidding up the line, he has denied a club control :)|pg||
