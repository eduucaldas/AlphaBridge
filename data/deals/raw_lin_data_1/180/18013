nt|vugraphzfe: Good Morning welcome to the Semi's of the USBC in Las Vegas we are ready to go|pg||
nt|henryb:  Rubin and Ekeblad play a complex strong club - canape - relay system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals   will post session scores and by clicking on team name you can access system summary forms for the partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php  or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin Ekeblad  defense upside down count and attitude  std honor leads shortness of 2 honors of 3 card suit will be rusinow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe both matches are playing the same boards |pg||
nt|henryb:  Bathurst - Zagorin play basically 2/1 with a few gadgets|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nope   different board  1 popped up in the other match :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the players are discussing the system and review the defense|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ekeblad will open 1@s; Rubin will probably relay a few times, find 4-1-3-5 opposite, and have to decide between 5@d and 3N|pg||
nt|chorush: Rubin-Ekeblad use a number of canape auctions that can be hard to defend against|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe bathurst opens 2@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  they are not hard, Ira, just unfamiliar|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches in this event are 120 boards   4-15 board segments each of 2 days|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner becomes USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl in Eindhoven The Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 2010 Trials determined USA1 to be   fleisher-kamil levin-weinstein martel-stansby|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin is explaining to Zagorin do you want me to alert every time I open a Diamond  Zagorin says yes so if I make a mistake its my fault if I don't I do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why you haven't seen them this week|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: okay we are ready to play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Good Luck to all|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D a couple of possibilities|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: missing Bathurst PASS|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Lets see some fab bridge|pg||
nt|chorush: I think the auction may be wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: assuming this is EW bidding    1@S=10-15 HCP, 4+@S maybe a longer but never a shorter 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=artificial game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=longer @C|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzfe: Sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S 5@C   1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  3@S = 1@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c = 3-5, 3@s = 3-1-3-5|pg||
nt|henryb:  4-5 not 3-5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my mistake different than henry's |pg||
nt|chessmaste: I will be quite happy to see N/S get the cards:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  "numeric" with more balanced first, so 3@h would have been 2-2, 3@s = 1-3, 3N = 3-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: 4@D = slam interest  asking Eke's opinion|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|chorush: Rubin could have a reasonable slam opposite  AKxx c Axx Jxxxx|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: 4@S=minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: NS standard carding     EW upside-down count, attitude and smith|pg||
nt|passell: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Not quite as good as in the othe room where East was declarer, but still VG |pg||
nt|chorush: The defense has no idea what Rubin has but know a lot about what the dummy will look like|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he's described game force and 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin has his hand on the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: sorry, Ekeblad is declarer|pg||
nt|passell: it can work both ways   relayers sometimes get swingy results|pg||
nt|passell: the defense always knows someones exact hand before leading|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin says he could have bid 3 diamonds as invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: toughest part of relays     remembering who's on opening lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Instead of the 2 hearts|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is really strange to play against a relay system particularly when the relayer becomes declarer. What you know is that the relayer knows a lot about partner's hand and chose this contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chorush: 1 imp at stake here. Zagorin will lead a spade next I am sure|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|henryb:  Especially since partner could have @sAK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zagorin is shaking his head|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: all tables still in one room  --   that's why each match playing different boards|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb:  that was, IMO, a well chosen lead by Zagorin|pg||

nt|andyv:  with match this close, I don't think Rubin was changing esp. since his team is ahead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 6 might be a bit off there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: faces D8, CA, and tosses the rest aside, making 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi all |pg||
mb|1D|nt|andyv:  NS will be playing a strong @c system and EW 2/1|pg||
nt|sybarra: is this the right score? |pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H doesn't fit   anything for either pair|pg||
nt|andyv:  or for any pair that I know of|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: oh its 107|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: really tighten up |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N = reject NT invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: goren-donn played 3NT while NS in the other room attempted 6@d in their 6-4 fit and went 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I have 9 that's worse than most 7s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin still studying dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @DJ: rusinow from 4 or more, standard from 3 or fewer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||

mb|4S|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  attitude only! or Suit preference. Sometimes opener's high card location is also known, in which case NO SIGNALS PLEASE|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin could have 5 spades explanation given to Zagorin by Bathurst|pg||

nt|passell: good lead   such length in partners suit gave him little hope there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Bathurst wears a baseball cap when he plays so you can't see his eyes|pg||
nt|chessmaste: If they gain an IMP a deal it will be a massacre - but rather a slow one|pg||

mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||

nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||

nt|passell: should be able to do anything you want playing with Forrester|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|henryb:  or nothing at all|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Too much pushing in the other room|pg||

nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
mb|p!|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||

nt|joest: you may not have two fast losers but that's not 12 winners|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: and after a free 2@H it was very optimistick to bid 5@C - the void in @S (one of partners suits) not a big value -with only 4 card @h|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: now we have a director call|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: claimed making 5 and Bathurst asked for line of play|pg||
nt|chorush: Looks like Ekeblad miscounted the diamonds and thinks they are good|pg||
nt|passell: he may be forced to lose 2 spades now  after false claim   dont know current rules   is he allowed to take a finesse now Ira?|pg||
nt|chorush: YOU'RE asking me? Used to be you couldn't|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Well, if he thinks the diamond are good he draws the trump and plays diamonds. South wins and has to play a spade, so it looks like one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Claim was making 5 and said dummy is basically good|pg||
nt|chorush: Since he claimed, he might be foreced to be et 2, by discarding on the 4th diamond|pg||
nt|passell: I think he will be forced to go down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- not allowed to guess @S finesse after the claim|pg||
nt|passell: yes  I agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: play king of clubs and pulling trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Director is writing down all the cards left on the table of all four players|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: claim and asked line of play|pg||
nt|chorush: I don't think whatever the rule is on finesses should even be applicable; He should have to discard on the fourth diamond which he thinks is good|pg||
nt|passell: ekeblad may be thinking about 4hearts he went down in|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He should not be|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Concentration is the name of the game|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: now they are discussing it will be on a spade guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 100% you are going to guess the spade wrong|pg||
nt|passell: yes   So many times  1 disaster leads to many more   Meckwell are the best ever about getting on to the next hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't agree with that - I think if you claim 5 you have to play diamonds|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Hamman is not bad|pg||
nt|passell: yes hamman  wolff were great about that   learned a lot from them about not steaming|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I have sympathy with declarer - he is a little unnerved at the moment|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin says his opinion says he should be down 2|pg||
nt|passell: it is clear he thought all the diamonds were good or he would have ruffed one earlier and claimed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a good coach would call timeout before next hand begins|pg||
nt|passell: good point Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: always down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but when @DK doesn't fall isn't it unreasonable to force @D continue?   [and not playing @DA seems unreasonable too]|pg||

nt|chessmaste: If Bathurst gets away to a good lead they might be hard to catch |pg||

nt|passell: this match  will have lots of ups and downs  |pg||
nt|jtmckee: if he never mentioned how he was playing spades|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Because he claimed all the tricks, assuming the diamonds were good|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I'll let the expert commentator's explain|pg||
nt|chorush: If he thought the diamonds were good, he cannot be presumed to know that the diamond king is missing|pg||

nt|pelu: yes a wrong claim by Eblad in 4@H - here making 11 - but nprob down 1 by TD|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|h4|pg||

nt|andyv:  and this looks like it's going down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson with his legs crossed, hands folded together holding his cards - typical posture when studying them - then folds his card and takes the thinker pose - typical when studying ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: can't get any read whether simson is confident or doubtful in his defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  he has to duck this |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: covers his face with his hand.  first time I've noticed that|pg||
nt|andyv:  so not sure why he's thinking so long about it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he thinks long about everything, doesn't he?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: in defense and in the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren in weird position,  but looks like he's going to make 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: especially in defense.  he has not gotten his share of hands as declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @DK still in dummy, trump pulled  to both ways to play @S work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad sighs again.  rubin takes a swig of water|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson leaning back with his eyes closed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin stifles a yawn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe Goren will play @D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson rubs his eyes.  ekeblad grabs his hair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: geez  this hand is much tougher single dummy    whodda thunk|pg||
nt|andyv:  this is why they introduced chess clocks:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson shakes his head and finally picks up his cards again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last round Wildavsky took a long time until Doub finally told him to do something.  But that contract was never beatable|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally players just sit and stew until the meditator breaks his trance|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: earlier, rubin wrote a note|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzfd: "if opponents stew on a hand, remind me to wake up. this does not apply if I'm dummy"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops      Hideous Hog:  if you're going to do the wrong thing -- do it quickly|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  this was an expensive ruff|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein might just play a spade back here in case garner has two diamond tricks coming and would be endplayed here|pg||
nt|joest: so b/c of the director ruling 4@h was down on board 5|pg||
nt|kit: I think the reason he passed initially was that he was pretty sure N-S would be stopping in 3@C, and then by doubling and bidding 4@H he keeps playing in spades an option if ...|pg||
nt|kit: partner has 5 spades and is short in hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Which makes a lot of sense|pg||
nt|joest: yes it does|pg||
nt|pelu: and better cards :)|pg||
nt|joest: or in the one in twenty when partner passes 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...Justin is a very thoughtful player|pg||
nt|joest: at some point, after the contract is already down one, I think you have to play a card :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  is that in the rule book?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is there a chance Rubin will finesse twice in @H???|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: He was hoping Weinstein would have a 3NT call I think -- which he would pass|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzfd: as usual, simson asks again to leave trick 1 up for a second.  maybe I should only report when he doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin taps his fingers atop the played trick once it's turned|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is good practice    and  automatic pause in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: you want to go smoke?  russ: may as well, never did finish the last one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: you're an enabler!|pg||

nt|andyv:  at the rate of this match, by board 115 we will have all the other vugraph viewers because those matches will be over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are we going fast enough to have a rate?|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  was S afraid the @h stopper was the K@h and anything he bid would wrong side it?|pg||
nt|psyck: playing rubensohl/rumpelsohl, he could bid 3@c xfr to @d & then bid 3@s|pg||
nt|joest: well there is a complication there too|pg||
mc|12|nt|joest: 3@c is invitational or better.  What if partner crosses you up by 'accepting' with 3NT|pg||

nt|andyv:  20 imps and 6 boards to go|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ek: when he bid 3NT I was very disappointed; simson: I was very pleased.  should have bid 1@S, harder to get|pg||
nt|andyv:  that would be rude of him|pg||
mb|1S|nt|psyck: he knows pd will not cross when he has AKQJ :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||
nt|joest: he is entitled to accept with a max|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||
nt|pelu: but when S has AKQJ he could be almost sure on 3@D by pd|pg||
nt|kit: With an invite, I just make an old-fashioned game try -- bid game and try to make it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: "he's reaching for cards - he bid"|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to have worked pretty well for you last week, Kit:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 1 left to score   Bathurst over Nickell by 41   so Bathurst will play winner of our match in the 120 board Semi Final|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I am faintly horrified that the other table is not ahead of us.  scheduled close in 18 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad riffles his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: but nothing short of a fire alarm would hurry simson|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice steal by Grue-Lall|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: N-S got frozen out of this auction -- but they will get a decent plus score anyway|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: thru 113   Diamond leads Deutsch by 59|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: casen, laughing: "at least we made it respectable"  as he leaves the room|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|kit: not so bad to be shut out when you have no game|pg||
nt|joest: +100 i think|pg||
nt|psyck: tough to get in vul for NS here with balanced hands|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: notwithstanding their 26 or 27 hcps |pg||
pc|s6|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|nt|kit: right.  They will be quite happy with +100 here -- on their own, they surely would have gotten to 3NT down.|pg||
nt|joest: they stopped in 3@h on board 8 so another small pickup for wolfson|pg||
mc|7|nt|joest: hello again all|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|andyv:  getting to 4@s should be no problem|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is a multi raise|pg||
nt|joest: anything from a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi again hope it doesn't happen much today|pg||
nt|joest: up to a balanced three card game force|pg||
nt|joest: it excludes a "jacoby2NT' type hand|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will presumably bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||
nt|joest: and garner will 'accept the transfer' to 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||
nt|kit: Which Grue will double I guess -- and then ?|pg||
nt|joest: he is rummaging through his imagination right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, sometimes it takes forever|pg||
mb|3H|nt|psyck: a hand where NS should not let 5 level belong to the opps|pg||
nt|joest: 'walking the dog' as they say|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is.....3@h:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: John wasn't operator yesterday :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep   i was very surprised yesterday|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Which declarer will get right when finding South has stiff heart|pg||
mb|5S|nt|andyv:  2N probably showed solid @s suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 2NT 6 good spades and a maximum|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks and johnson confirms semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias peeks in, won't be pleased|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final posted   Welland beat Jacobs  by 46|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c and @h loser, Doug will have to worry about losing 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: someone outside whoops, probably just confirmed that they won|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  taking the money|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: wd by N|pg||
nt|joest: well judged by everybody|pg||
nt|kit: The slow approach worked, talking Weinstein into doubling|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|psyck: i would not have expected them to get to 5 w/o knowing their side @c fit against an NV game|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, mis-saw auction|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
