pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|daman: he should make this on the nose|pg||
nt|athene: not a huge trump holding for the penalty pass, but doubling 2 of a minor is a "freeroll" to some extent - even if it happens to come home, it's not the end of the world|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Woodridge asks about signals: "standard count & attitude" and Suit Preference is? "standard"|pg||
nt|athene: nine tricks available now if he takes them|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|athene: finesse spades - if south wins, you have the long spades; if he holds up, you can just knock out the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: sorry if north wins the @SK you have the long spade|pg||

nt|jcmax: This one looks like EW will get to 3NT after a 1@D opening from N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think it's Zagorin & Bathurst but don't know about the Diamond team's pair - I'm sure the operator will get names in as soon as he has a chance - I was slow to start up here ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: because  I did something stupid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: i guess east will double and then just bid a gentle 2@H over 2@C from his partner?|pg||
nt|daman: looks like Hampson/Greco|pg||
nt|athene: does that do justice to his hand?|pg||
nt|athene: of course if wooldridge does something a bit more encouraging (3@C, 1nt) east might start thinking about slams|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcmax: I think it does. Especially if your style is to overcall 1@H up to 17 HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|daman: this session should go much faster than the last    Brad and Fred are very deliberate players  :)|pg||
nt|athene: he would have been a lot happier after 1nt for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and they are sitting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@H is forcing to game of course |pg||
nt|jcmax: E has a nice hand, but without any fit, where are the tricks for a slam?|pg||
nt|athene: now he might feel he is worth another push, with some fitting diamond cards opposite|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 4NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, true, but he might hope for @HJx or something lovely opposite|pg||
nt|pelu: only 2@C by Hampson in CR - and 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcmax: Of course if his partner has a stiff or even better doubleton @H honor slam should have good chances. But he took the low road. Probably knows his partner well :)|pg||

nt|athene: yes, if west had a diamond stop and some values and a fairly balanced hand, he might have preferred 1nt rather than 3@C|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|athene: so on the actual auction it was very likely he had a singleton heart|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcmax: Well, the standard meaning of the 3@C bid is something like 9-11 HCP. But it's possible EW have a different understanding.|pg||

nt|pelu: @C8 in S is a stopper!|pg||
nt|athene: south just has to keep that @C8 otherwise his partner can get squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wooldridge asks if they ever open 1@d with a 5 card Major and Diamond says not conventionally but maybe with a terrible hand nad terrible suit|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks destined for 3nt|pg||
nt|iceking: Greco maybe 2 strong for 2@H|pg||
nt|iceking: might just instead jump to 3nt now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room  NS Platnick-Diamond also playing Big Club   Wooldridge-Hurd play jazzed up 2/1|pg||
nt|roswolf: he will think about it for sometime|pg||
nt|cherilou: X and bidding your suit shows this hand to me--about 8 tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: ok, so 2/1 & not prec for NS then with this pair|pg||
nt|iceking: almost can play 3nt vs zero hcp|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|iceking: as it is this will work also |pg||
nt|iceking: but i dont really like this bid|pg||
nt|cherilou: he took a position and will make the contact|pg||
nt|roswolf: i always say thinking a lot leads too often to mistakes -imo this deserves to be a disaster|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: other room   1@D(precision)-X-P-3@C//P-3@H-P-3N//all pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: but he lands on his feey|pg||
nt|cherilou: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|roswolf: feet|pg||
pc|dT|nt|psyck: yes 2@h or 3N look better options|pg||
nt|iceking: he is just 2 good for 2@H|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but 4@H would be worthy of HH himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Wooldridge shows   response to DBL wasn't clearcut  either   2@C vs 3@C|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, i overcall with upto bad 18 , so my x & bids are strong, & still this looks too strong for 2@h here|pg||
nt|iceking: yes Hampson must have been close to 3@C bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: but world champs tend to be right more often than not|pg||
nt|iceking: as we see all lines make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of course 2@H rebid insufficient --  take away Hampson @CKJ and still game|pg||
nt|psyck: Maybe more likely to bid 3@c against a prec pair like other roon than a 2/1 pair this room, due to the @d holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|iceking: decl afraid @D are 5-1  |pg||
nt|iceking: he has no entry home if he playes 3rounds of @S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|athene: if it goes 1@D double, can south bid 2@D, as a passed hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i guess he might even bid it as a non-passed hand i suppose|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pelu: now 2@D by S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Many play that the cuebid promises another bid, but not as a passed hand.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north obviously intends 3@H to be forcing there|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: can't imagine anyone would go around passing a bid like that :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: north could have tried dropping the @DQ i suppose|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me S has a pretty good hand for just bidding 4@H. could partner have the same hand with @DKx instead of Qx?|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: well maybe south was worried that 4@C might not be taken as a cue there|pg||
nt|daman: they play big club and open all marginal hands|pg||
nt|vikentich: yes sabine i,m agree better bis is 4 cl of Damond |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wooldridge asks about 3@h: "2@h would be non-forcing; 3@h shows 5 hearts and enough to bid a game opposite a cue bid" W: "so you would DBL instead of overcalling with 5 hearts and ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: an average hand?" P: "might ... if it looks like a @h overcall, we'd overcall"|pg||
nt|athene: he thinks ok, i have shown my hand pretty well with 2@D, i might as well just keep things simple|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|jcmax: It all depends of course on how much the 2@D bid showed. but many play that as a passed hand it just promises 4-4 in the majors and not necessarily much strength|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Platnick asks about carding: "upside down"|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: well if it definitely promises 44 majors you can surely bid 4@C over 3@H and it sort of  has to be a cue :)|pg||

mb|1D!|an|Precision|mb|1N|nt|athene: yes but without really firm agreements, there are other things it could conceivably be, like 4@S-6@C and a  near-opener|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south was worried his partner might think he had that|pg||
nt|jcmax: If N now doubles can EW find their best suit?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|1 Major|nt|daman: North is sure to compete in @Hs    a double wouldn't be helpful|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: both sides alerted 2@d, Wooldridge asked and @d wrote something I can't read, but I'm guessing it showed @hs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: Maybe 1 major?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: probably a transfer|pg||
nt|daman: and 2@H would be @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play their normal notrump defence in this position|pg||
nt|athene: on the basis that opener hasn't really shown much of anything :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think you're right, Sabine. I leaned over and looked at the note and it looks like there's a 1 in it :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: cool|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: multi defense over NT|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now I am wondering, would that bid be a prealert? :)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|ahollan1: now @D shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: so is this mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if alert says  short in your suit   or just as Magnus says  mild slam try|pg||
nt|iceking: so north will check keycards now with his maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: my confidence ebbs away the more north thinks|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have like to show my shortness here, even N did open 1@D its usually the key reach slam show your shortness|pg||
nt|psyck: I play Xfrs after 2N rebid as Inv+ hands too & so this would be a mild slam try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond platnick will have strong 1@C auction   that will give them more room to explore|pg||
mb|5S|nt|roswolf: lack of imagination is a blessing|pg||
nt|iceking: dont understand this bid at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 6@S may well now be bid:(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick  3N north|pg||
nt|iceking: why not just check out keycards |pg||
nt|psyck: N did not check KC to check for trump quality instead maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because keycards won't give enough info|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant believe if 4@S here is slam invit 4nt is 2 play that doesnt make any sense to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this focuses directly on trump suit|pg||
nt|cherilou: 5@S sure seems aggressive when partber probably showed some mild slam interest and you have 2 little @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you want to be in slam opposite  @SAQxxxx  @CA ?|pg||
nt|iceking: north hand is super slammish though he has max in hcp and no jack in hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is utter lunancy if you ask me - but i am not playing for a place in the BermudaBowl|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: Right Magnus, normal to make a try after this seq|pg||
nt|cherilou: N has minimum for his 2NT bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me IFF [keyword] bidding over 4@S  that 5@S is best bid|pg||
nt|psyck: N has a very good max as 2N is 17-18 for them|pg||
nt|iceking: that will just have to happen then, bypassing rkcb is just crime in my books as there is no defense if you reach silly slam with 2 keycards missing |pg||
nt|psyck: South should have just rebid 4@s on 2N maybe|pg||
nt|cherilou: S had entire 5 level to que bid and didn'r--N should pass 4 @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: south has no real extras - and his trump suit is not really robust|pg||
nt|iceking: its little soft not try for slam with south hand i think|pg||
nt|cherilou: sorry entire FOUR leve;|pg||

nt|athene: declarer's choice is now whether to play clubs and try to reach them with a spade, or just to play on hearts|pg||
nt|athene: lead @HK is not ridiculous, i don't think|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes Peter, that way NS should always have a tleast 3@D, 2@H, 1@s and 1@C trick|pg||
nt|pelu: agree, Bill|pg||
nt|athene: playing on clubs gives the defenders another trick (the club) for no sure reward|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|an|promises shape, 4/5 or better|mb|p|nt|jcmax: South's 3rd diamond was the 5, his highest telling his partner he didn't want @C, so N would probably have worked that out.|pg||
nt|athene: grand slam here if you want it enough|pg||
nt|pelu: can u find 13 tricks Bill? I cant|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: oh no, ok, maybe that is a bit optimistic sorry :)|pg||
nt|daman: can you make 6 on a trump lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, because @DA falls|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|daman: luck be a lady tonight|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs have the agreement not to cue-bid a shortage in partner's suit|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pelu: even 12 tricks is hard work|pg||
nt|jcmax: A very good agreement in my view!|pg||
nt|athene: so if east did bid 4@D on this auction at some point maybe it should be something like 4-4-1-4 with singleton diamond honour|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jcmax: Specs are asking for an explanation of the bidding. it's really quite natural so far. 1@S was 4th suit and then 3@H was GF with 4-card @H support, 3@S a cuebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As a spec points out, you can make 12 tricks regardless of @DA, also on a trump lead. @HK, ruff @D, @C, ruff@D, @HQ, @C, @H claim|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe east feels that his previous bidding has shown short diamonds in his hand so cue-bidding them just guarantees it's a void|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A spade lead is the most challenging in 6@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: @D has run out of pass cards, points to previous one|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 5nt pick-a-slam?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you may have a problem on a spade lead when @C10 does not drop|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmm I wonder whether EW have the soecific agreement that 4@D shows a void in this auction. surely a void would be very diferent form thea  and definitely make a huge difference for ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: the W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: intending to pass 6@C but correct 6@D to 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so that you can't overtake @CJ later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Platnick asking for explanations of the auction - I didn't learn anything new|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 flat boards now :)|pg||
nt|athene: i agree a void is really *not* the same as singleton @DA - west might be looking at @DKQJxxx or something|pg||
nt|daman: a very good point Sabine|pg||
nt|athene: and might sort of want to know which it is |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now @d asking something ad he and Wooldridge writing back and forth, too small for me to see|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: You can also make it on a spade lead as pointed out by a couple of specs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: win spade, club over, diamond ruff, club, D ruff, S ruff, d ruff, HQ, top club...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe a bit double dummy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: opener shows @H holding for 3N    if Qxx is enough that implies  east hold @DAKxxxx   but that holding goes to game without asking|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|cherilou: then 3@C must have been like @D's--only reason to bid again with E|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: hmmm|pg||

nt|athene: do you think north should pass 3@D, Roland? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I think he is forced to pass|pg||
nt|peachy: N has to pass|pg||
nt|athene: a new meaning for the term "forcing pass" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: agree|pg||
nt|peachy: sry all, miscl|pg||
nt|jcmax: Maybe Roland, but does partner need 4 trumps to double in last seat? I believe many would double on honor 3rd and that doesnøt really look appealing to N.|pg||
nt|daman: you can't make unilateral decisions    it is bad for partnership morale   |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Vugraphzfb: W asks about the opening bid because it usually has 2 diamonds, and @d says sometimes with a stiff A or K of diamonds we open 1@d instead of 2 because 2@d misdescribes the hand so ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: badly|pg||
nt|athene: i can see why north pulled this, if 1@D promises 2+ diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|athene: it's all very well to say "the ace is as good as two small" but it's another trump your side hasn't got and they have|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|pelu: NS in CR had no breaks: they are in 4@SX|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: "live by the sword and die by the sword"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: north doesn't want to double a partscore when it looks as though the hcp are about 20-20 and opps could be in a 9- or certainly 8-card fit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|daman: but you cannopt assume your partner is a moron   he doubled 2NT    let him participate in the auction|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Bill, how do you like it when your partner does not involve you and takes the decision himself?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|athene: but if north just letes south double 3@D, that's *south* making the unilateral decision|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|jcmax: At this point no huge swings are needed. Avoiding disasters is the name of the game. bidding 3@S is unlikely to create a disaster. letting partner double 31D and passing it might.|pg||
nt|pelu: in the bidding S sign of in 3@S but N (??) bid 4!|pg||
nt|athene: it's all very well to talk about discipline and so on, but north really does not have the hand his partner is expecting him to have|pg||
nt|athene: south thinks he is facing a weak notrump|pg||
nt|athene: and the missing diamond is a big factor|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@s dopwn 1 sh be just a flat board, but..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So repairing your misbid is the way forward I take it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a bad approach in my view|pg||
nt|athene: i think if north passes and stands the double of 3@D, that is just letting partner take a unilateral decision when he really doesn't have enough information to do that|pg||
nt|athene: it's fine to trust partner - WHEN he knows what you have|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the dam has burst - i venture to suggest e/w are on tilt|pg||
nt|iceking: its very easy to forget your system i do that also often |pg||
nt|psyck: Not good for Diamond team, 6@h would hanve been in trouble on a @s lead other table & the previous deal was an unforced error|pg||
nt|cherilou: W had 2 ways to avoid @D loser--lead Q hoping RHO had singleton J or hope LHO had singleton K. Neither happening this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: that double looks fairly crazy too|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|iceking: looks rather normal dbl to me i guess iam crazy then:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|cherilou: leading Q hoping for singleton J also works when K doesn;t cover--so it is winning play more often|pg||

nt|iceking: remember here east isnt limited he could still have up good hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might fall here|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: west can get a lead-director in over 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: this bidding approach has the advantage that E may lead from his strongest suit....|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: double might say the same thing now but it's a bit rich|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Can W X for a @S-lead? (shortest major)|pg||
nt|athene: when he sees dummy west will wish he had doubled|pg||
nt|Walddk2: double? Lead your short major. I think you have too many spades to do that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: and not strong enough if you have that many|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: The known safety play|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: safety play the clubs (small to nine next)?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: he only needs 4 clubs, 1 heart, 1 spade, 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|jcmax: N is going for the safety play in @C|pg||
nt|athene: but is a bit short of entries to hand for that|pg||
nt|athene: normally when you take a safety play and there is the bad break, you are happy - but the hand isn't over yet|pg||
nt|athene: he could have led low to the nine first of course, which keeps things a bit more fluid|pg||
nt|pelu: the winning line was direct @C to @c9|pg||
nt|ferlema: We have uploaded some photos taken as soon as I finish the first step courtesy of Catalina Bathurst www.confsudbridge.org|pg||
nt|jcmax: The way the cards lie there are still plenty of chances to make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Fernando|pg||
nt|jcmax: N really did well going for the safety play. There are some communication problems which easily could have prevented him from doing so|pg||
nt|pelu: a small @H from dummy only if u see all 52 vards :)|pg||
nt|athene: leading to the @C9 without cashing the king first doesn't lose you much in clubs, though, does it|pg||
nt|athene: and is better for the hand as a whole|pg||
nt|pelu: but he could have played @H from hand in trick 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You won't be happy if you lose to the singleton 10|pg||
nt|athene: of course singleton @C10 with west is bad, but there are other layouts where it's better to do that|pg||
nt|athene: like, a small singleton with west :) which is more likely|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: This is tough to analyse even with all cards in view|pg||
nt|athene: if only west had fewer spades he would be leading the @SJ, just waiting for his partner to get in again|pg||
nt|athene: but of course he knows his partner has one spade at most so that is pointless|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes the players do it better when they are not distracted by knowing the layout|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well the way the cards lie declarer can just take his @D and @C tricks and then play a @S|pg||
nt|jcmax: W has only @S left and has to give dummy the last trick|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh true, that would only be 8 tricks, clubs are not good yet, sorry|pg||
nt|athene: i think west west's play of the jack from AJ doubleton at trick 1 really threw declarer off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter's suggestion of a low heart before would have worked, but that is double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would not do that at the table|pg||
nt|athene: not sure what he was playing for, leading the 10 - maybe hoping to set up some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|athene: but with @HJ8 doubleton west would have played the 8 at trick 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Platnick did look a little surprised when he saw the @h A|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|mc|7|nt|athene: basically if you want to bring the hearts in, you have to lead a little one, don't you?|pg||
nt|athene: i mean given the 8 just can't be doubleton|pg||
nt|jcmax: I guess you were right after all. A low @C to the 9 at trick 2 would definitely have made everything easier!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wooldridge: "if I just DBL, it would be so much better" Hurd: "did you have AJT of spades?" W: "yes" Hurd: "would do so much better"|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is duck here double dummy??|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: again the 2@S was the warning bell - especially with the spades under the bidder|pg||

nt|ahollan1: betting Hampson would overtake if duck -- but  this way easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick also opened 1N|pg||
nt|cherilou: W could have @C Q doubleton or third--then still make 3NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: You got me there - I was going to answer "me!" - that's why I'm not as slim as Sabine :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I thnk that Hurd said 3@d was natural and forcing, but not positive|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jcmax: W has a really good hand. but the jump to 4@S probably say: leave me alone!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder. Poor shape, aceless|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT was only limit raise +, and 3@D probably not GF, so i would have thought 3@S would be the weakest bid east could make?|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@S says "ok, i like the diamond fit, but still, game is enough"|pg||
nt|pelu: here the 2NT 10+ create a problem for West - do he know that East has minimum?|pg||
nt|daman: it is more of a command than a suggestion|pg||
nt|jcmax: the trouble with playing 2N as limit raise+ is that maybe it's not quite clear whether 41S just means: I only have a limit raise or whether it means: I only have a limit raise, ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: which i really hate now.|pg||
nt|athene: it was perhaps an overbid with the @CK likely wasted - and might get them too high|pg||
nt|athene: i agree very often bids which are only limit+ don't work well|pg||
nt|daman: bergen would have been OK here|pg||
nt|athene: because game and slam auctions are two very different things|pg||
nt|pelu: u are on safer ground when 2NT is GF|pg||
nt|athene: most top players will want to bash games in on any excuse  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if 2NT is limit or better, the limit ahand has to go through 3@S, no?|pg||
nt|athene: but when it comes to bidding slams, you sort of want to bid "properly"|pg||
nt|athene: if you mix these two things you can get into difficulties|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't really know their system agreements and can't tell, whether 3@D may be yet another try for game or whether it is definitely gf and looking for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: but here he feel that he has to 3½ @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How Peter?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No aces, wasted @CK, poor shape|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S must be some formof fast arrival based upon the auction|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: i think if you actually have a game force it is almost always advantageous to announce it as fast as possible|pg||
nt|dinos1: how can u know if @cK is wasted? W cd have @cAx and @hx|pg||
nt|jcmax: That's what I assumed earlier George, but difficult to be sure :)|pg||

nt|athene: thinking more about dinner than about what he can open|pg||
nt|jcmax: Can West "walk" the hand, so he gets doubled in 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: i bet the italians would bid 4@C with west|pg||
nt|athene: they like to show these shortages even without so many hcp|pg||
mb|4C|nt|daman: Flannery is a very good convention, combining constructive bidding and preemptive tactics|pg||
nt|athene: to help partner judge what to do over 5@C i suppose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: W actually took 3@d out and had it about on the tray, then took it back|pg||
mb|5C|nt|daman: let's talk more about it tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: Georg, dont play with Roland - he has the button :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think the idea is, north's 2@C bid has sort of told everyone that west "can't" have that many hcp, so in that case, 4@C is very descriptive|pg||
mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: often it's bad to use opps' bidding to help convey your hand but sometimes it is ok|pg||
