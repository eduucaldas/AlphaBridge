mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Hampson and Greco play a form of Precision with fairly light openers|pg||
nt|gulyas: W has a huge hand now, I am sure he wants to invite slam somehow|pg||
nt|jcwla: Making it all the more unlikely W will have any thoughts of bigger things.|pg||
nt|gulyas: still, with the same shape, if E had @SK and @DA, slam would be laydown|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, a perfect East hand could make a slam, but they will stop in 4|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm now reminding myself not to make predictions|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe a 4@D splinter could suffice here|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think that's a fair description|pg||
nt|royhughes: but I don't know what their second round jumps are like|pg||

nt|royhughes: Does North show count or give attitude here?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Count|pg||
nt|gulyas: in efffect in limited systems splinters are a slam try, as opposed to natural systems, where you only describe your hand and leave the decision to pd|pg||
nt|gulyas: when he is unlimited|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like Schermer gave standard attitude at T1|pg||
nt|royhughes: some play count, others just encourage with a doubleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hampson asking about carding, which varies with the situation. this was ud count|pg||
nt|jcwla: To me when Q-long hits on this lead it's clearly count that's called for.|pg||

nt|imp_jan: again, not an easy hand to defend|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes -- with this dummy Hampson will be tempted to defend passively|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer needs to give up both minor tricks to make, so they have the time, but can they find it? its hard to play into the 2NTer with his 10HCP in hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: The chance to make a telling discard for W on a second @C should do it.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: may be the best declare cld do is win and play a club back|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially with S eschewing stayman|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's difficult -- if declarer was 3=3=3=4 you probably want to go passive|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can make if the @D finesse is on, so he will go to dummy with a @H maybe to take the finesse?|pg||
nt|royhughes: If the diamond is on, he will always make, so I think a low club first|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: both diamond and wolfson teams lost seeding rights for one segment due to slow play yesterday. Wolfson against my team|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: I think the 9 was an unexpected card, and he took a lot of time when he saw it|pg||
