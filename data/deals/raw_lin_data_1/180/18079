nt|vugraphp1: hello everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Hi Kasia|pg||
nt|gulyas: at least don't hit him on the head|pg||
mb|1N!|an|9-12|nt|gulyas: hello Kasia|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hi there|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|an|forcing to xx|nt|sybarra: we see 2 nt iw wk, both minors |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Holy cow, it's in Polish|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: that is played often in conjuction with multi/tartan or muiderberg systems |pg||
nt|gulyas: who would have thought:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: N-S one of the top pairs in Poland who do not play Polish Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's more like 2/1|pg||
nt|athene: awkward problems for both sides in these auctions|pg||
nt|athene: for example, west might now be wondering whether 2@S is forcing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Iin Nail 1C= 15+ hcp with less than 4 hearts. 1D= 15+ hcp with 4H or more. 1H/S capped to 14HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: wyglada na to, ¿e by³ namys³ z rêk¹ E, ale IMO W ma czyste wznowienie|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wow - and they are still allowed to live in Poland?|pg||
mb|3H|an| |nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphp1: Namys³ faktycznie by³...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as opener does not raise with 3 cards, they can stay|pg||
nt|gulyas: it did sound like a trump lead is called for|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Nice summary|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is not making, to put it mildly|pg||
nt|gulyas: if they can get all the ruffs|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: in Polad 2nt is usually minors but 7-11 - they're playing 11-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, all the other suits were unappetizing.  This is a trump lead I can live with|pg||
nt|gulyas: wow, good result for EW in the closed room|pg||
nt|sybarra: with the right leadfor the ruffs, this could go down a lot |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: How did 4@H make I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North must surely have started with two top clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: and you still have 2 trumps to lose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, he switched to a diamond at trick 2|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|gulyas: did not start with @Hs, so only 1 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jkotor: 11 opening, 12 game, as I sayd before...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and 4 rounds of spades to pitch the second club, then some ruffing|pg||
nt|athene: difficult decision for south now as well - lead could be @DQ10x or a singleton, on the bidding, i suppose|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: now E has to play @Ss, or else...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: @c9 suit pref for @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: there you go|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|gulyas: with E out of @Ss, he is only down 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless some miracle happens of course, E has 2 trumps to come|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes if the lead is @D10xx it might be costly to take the ace, but here that is not likely to be the case|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jkotor: trying for -1, may produce -3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: No problem for N/S - the miracle happened at the other table|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|kamyk: pasa E nie rozumiem; wg utartych schematów ktr W oznacz "wywo³awcza do kierów" (bo kontra na 2@D = "wywo³awcza do pików")|pg||

nt|lukasz1982: last round today|pg||
nt|lukasz1982: tommorrow we'll start at 10 AM|pg||
nt|jkotor: ruff makes it -2 with @h escape from S|pg||

nt|vugraphp1: hello to everyone again!|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: we have two pair with really complicated systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome back|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: ok, thanks Kasia|pg||
nt|sybarra: aha|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: in the meantime, EW did bid 7@C on bd9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT: "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20-5 in the other match, playing the same boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like 1 @H=spades|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i hope I will be able to explain to you everything |pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: East might have considered hitting 3NT|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c a good raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gulyas: 4@C down 1, and so is every red suit contract NS may try|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was close to a t/o double here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is quite a gamble on a 15 count opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With one more diamond I could understand|pg||
nt|gulyas: the last time I did that, I had 5-5 in the Ms - we collected 800|pg||
nt|gulyas: with all the good boards he had, he should pass this - pd could not move, he only has 15, why do anything?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it does seem a bit masochistic to take another bid here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Partner is happy to defend 4@C, apparently|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: hello again, 3rd segment from 6 in on|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and 3 @H is "hitting the deck"  saying "enough" |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|blum1956: Yes/ Even if pd has a heart support which is far from being obvious NS may be short of tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: the grand rolled in in the meantime, for another 12|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H leaves me speechless and that takes a lot|pg||
nt|gulyas: unlucky somewhat, 4@H is on a finesse after all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One has to delve into his mind to see what we can learn from his thinking|pg||
nt|blum1956: Finally on the current board Jagniewski will pay the bill I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Kasia and Joe|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Walddk2: There is nothing to suggest that 4@H will play well|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe S did bid a t/o double |pg||
nt|Walddk2: He buys a dream dummy and still can't make|pg||
nt|gulyas: and he was considering passing as opposed to bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If South doubled 4@C we have an explanation|pg||
nt|gulyas: on a @S lead ducked by S, 4@C is 2 off actually on a trump promotion - no, the @D loser goes away then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are you sure he didn't, Kasia?|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats the only possibility I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is bonkers if South did not double 4@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Kasia has gone on strike, because we insulted his operating|pg||
nt|gulyas: bd 10 is also playing in 2@S in the meantime|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: W takes advantage of the limited nature of the 1@d bid to show a relatively good hand with great distribution.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: After a lengthy deliberation Jagniewski has decided to play @C7 from the dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|santyclz: Gm (10am here) Roland, Kasia.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: good play|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: I know Jagniewski from real life; he is a sensible individual and would not bid 4@H without a double|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|psyck: 3@hx would have fetched a tidy score, but it was normal for W to escape to 4@c with a min opening & a 7 card suit|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Rafal is also a nice guy|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and I think he was tossing up between 4@D and 4@H ... don't think it's sensible to pass 4@CX|pg||
pc|s6|mc|11|pg||
qx|o12|st||md|2SA965HKQJT93DCAQ6,SKQ432H75DAK9CKJT,S8H6DQJT876543C75,SJT7HA842D2C98432|sv|n|nt|sybarra: I wasnt sure he would guess the @C correctly |pg||
nt|gulyas: he went searching for info|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and figured S has the @SK, and N the A|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bjacobs: Final board of the set, and well done to our flawless operator Kasia Dufrat|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: The jury is out on Board 11 :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so S has to have something for his raise|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: they've turned the board - now N is Wojcicki|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Bill Frisby|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And thanks muchly to our flawless commentators Daniel, Michael and Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: ty all|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally our appreciation to the Polish Bridge Union (Slawek Latala)   for broadcasting this excellent event|pg||
nt|sybarra: transfer response and good hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: "never put an 8-card suit down in dummy" - what about -card suits?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: 9-card suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That dummy is absolutely worthless|pg||
pc|h6|nt|garden2005: otwarcia z trzeciej rêki podlegaj¹ regule "w najsilniejszy kolor 4+", w przypadku utrzymania siê przy grze przeciwnika jest to jednoczesnie wskazanie wistu|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muchly!?, minus 1 point to Bill|pg||
nt|blum1956: thx all|pg||
nt|santyclz: Paul Heitner:  There are no 9-card suits.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: now relays?  I will need help here |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@C is on a finesse, but since its trumps, they will not bid it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do N-S play Dwururka, Kasia?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand, Jagniewski did not promise anything .... unless diamonds are trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Nail they play I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i think they do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: deviced by Pazur|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|nt|gulyas: I hope I am not in the red yet:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand is worth 7 tricks in diamonds and none in hearts, but on the other hand 4@H is pretty much a command to put the dummy down, so....|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he hoped he might make a trick with a spade ruff|pg||
nt|athene: even a club ruff not inconceivable i suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The only consolation is that 5@D does not make either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But 3 down vulnerable is not exactly a triumph|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D was much more likely to be doubled|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Event continues in about 20 minutes I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 6-0, this may go down|pg||
nt|blum1956: this will|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2N asks for 3@c to show shortness, 3@h @s sing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pazur in Polish means 'nail'|pg||
nt|sybarra: let me try that again,  2 @S asked for 2n,  so that S cold show shortness.  and 3 @H says spades |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Pazur also devised Dwururka, the double-barreled rifle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in 2007|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|santyclz: E didn't want to x opposite a weak nt.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: this allows N to bid the nt,  with wastage in spades,   (or place the contract suitably) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a link to Dwururka but not Nail|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next is scheduled to start in about 20 minutes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kamyk: Omernik otwiera na 3. rêce w najsilniejszy kolor 3+ :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: AKDterc na wejcie na wysokoci dwóch te¿ ju¿ bardzo temu widzia³em - Andrzej Berezecki (Szwagier)|pg||
nt|garden2005: przy takiej dyscyplinie nale¿a³oby zawsze wistowaæ w kolor partnera|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: He'll look to cross-ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: Next set even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CCUQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bridge.com.pl%2Fnail2009_12_12.pdf&ei=sf7UTa-NC8SDOpTRzeML&usg=AFQjCNGOvmWWdH...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pUXdhNo5jhajOFaDReVQ&sig2=Wh8Klp1tspHfgK6DlXOZBQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: As I undersand it Roland, dwuruka is the 2 under opening bid system , i.e.,  1 @C=hearts |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gulyas: now...|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: We may be facing a delay as one room in the other match is still on board 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably due the fact that one pair was late|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Transfer openings yes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: thats good, I will have time for a quick lunch then:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But this is not Dwururka|pg||
nt|vugraphp1: i have Nail|pg||
