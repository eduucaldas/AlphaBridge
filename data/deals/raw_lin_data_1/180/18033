nt|andyv:  with match this close, I don't think Rubin was changing esp. since his team is ahead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: down 6 might be a bit off there|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: faces D8, CA, and tosses the rest aside, making 2|pg||

nt|sybarra: is this the right score? |pg||
nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H doesn't fit   anything for either pair|pg||

nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: goren-donn played 3NT while NS in the other room attempted 6@d in their 6-4 fit and went 1 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: I have 9 that's worse than most 7s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   or  http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/   but each match playing a different set of boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: phew didn't lose the broadcast this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: network burped|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin still studying dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @DJ: rusinow from 4 or more, standard from 3 or fewer|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson asks for another look at the spots for the thousandth time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: spade called, simson asks for another second|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs    upside-down: count, attitude, smith      NS  also upside-down suit preference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson has changed his gray polo shirt for a black one|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS part of the winning GNT team...I think 2nd time for them.. from Ohio.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson crosses his arms and sits back in his seat|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin watching the ceiling as he often does|pg||
nt|andyv:  was Rubin serious about playing 2/1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson in his thinker pose, elbow on his thigh, hand on his cheek|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John -- did Jacobs concede?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: no one told me if they did concede|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: of course rubin was not serious about playing standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson replied that he and simson were playing polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nickell team down 48|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and joked that it would be interesting if they had to switch systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody for EHAA??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I'd be all for EHAA, I could explain the bidding better then having played it myself|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: although I usually play strong club I don't know..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in a very fun friday night game   we used to play [very illegal]  one card if i dealt,  one card if partner dealt, opponent's card if they dealt|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfd: all the intricacies of either NS or EW system|pg||
nt|andyv:  and hello specs.  This is the semi finals...first set of what promises to be an exciting match|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Karen, Shir |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: hello all|pg||
mb|5D|nt|andyv:  EW play a precision style club|pg||
nt|peachy: -ley|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Not unexpected double from south.  Will east stick it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|mc|13|nt|joest: interesting choice to go with a forcing 2@d before bidding hearts.  I don't know if this sequence got the 5-6 message across or not|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS play a complex system of relays|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Jack|pg||
nt|joest: well not quite.  They do play lots of transfers though|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 3c meant as 3-1-4-5|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|joest: hi Kirshna|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW 1@d is 10-15 with 2+@ds|pg||
mb|1C|nt|gulyas: it looks like they are better off by not letting 4@S play out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1nt bid - it's a value bid, though partner may assume you have stoppers.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  14-16|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe only undertricks were makable there in any game there on a normal day|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 2@H  4-11 HCP, 5-7 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after the interruption the redeal button didnt automatically work|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and I was busy typing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 15-17 in 3rd seat vul, and all 4th seat|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will find the @s game|pg||
nt|robinswr: some would bid 1@s|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2N modified Ogust|pg||
nt|joest: they're in the wrong event if they don't :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, W has quite a pewerful hand, even opp a 14-16 hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: much better to support hearts and ignore the spades|pg||
nt|psyck: I agree with supporting @h, though 4 level is strange|pg||
mb|3H|nt|robinswr: only if playing a forcing club system|pg||
nt|peachy: NS methods include: We will open most 11 counts and many distributional 10 counts. We will open 1C with a balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary ...|pg||
nt|peachy: clubs. We open 1D with semi- balanced or unbalanced hands with primary diamonds or 4-5 in the minors. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 6+@H and   [i think] min|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|andyv:  low club is winner here|pg||
nt|joest: just gave up on slam. partner would need aperfecto I guess but if the ace of diamonds had been @hKQ....|pg||
nt|andyv:  when NS open 1@d, it's either semi balanced or unbalanced with mainly diamonds or 4-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|psyck: W also happy to hear opps bidding @d (lesser @d wastage with pd)|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: garner has the wrong shape, and these are the wrong colors, for saving in 5@d!|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d void is a big minus for slam searching opposite a NT bidder when you have limited values|pg||
nt|joest: if Howard is thinking here we may be in for a looooong session|pg||
nt|andyv:  we will be... both NS are deliberate players|pg||
nt|joest: north more so than south|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: @h2 turned quickly, ekeblad: "may I?", johnson: "mais oui!"|pg||
nt|psyck: he can see 4@s, 1@h, 1@d, 5@c for 11 tricks if blakc suits break|pg||
nt|kareno: I imagine 1nt showed hearts, given the rest of the auction.|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we see a ht lead here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 8 is probably suit pref for @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Welcome to Joe Shair from the USA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: This is a very unfriendly hand for declarer.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's the North Pole...|pg||
nt|peachy: He arrived in a sled, there is  still snow in santyclz land|pg||
nt|santyclz: Ran out in the desert, that's why I was late.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|robinswr: easy hand just needs both aces on sides|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psyck: so just took a lil time to see if he had to do anything in case trumps badly placed|pg||
nt|peachy: Weistein might duck this, I guess he is thinking of it anyway|pg||
nt|peachy: kib noted that must duck, squeezed otherwise. |pg||
nt|kareno: North must duck the heart |pg||
nt|peachy: I feel sorry for the operators, internet service glitches :(|pg||
mc|11|nt|peachy: or that is what I think, glittches in any case|pg||

nt|mikam1: let's see whether we can stay afloat this time|pg||
nt|mikam1: Curious to see how high the auction has gotten|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|4D|mb|d|mb|5D|nt|mikam1: Grue-Lall NS   Ekeblad-Rubin EW respectively|pg||
mb|6S|nt|ahollan1: Rubin DBL 4@D    wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not sure about 4D. i think thatbid should have a trick in it|pg||
mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|nt|mikam1: I believe 7 can be made on squeeze - North can't hold hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|7D|nt|kit: 6-card support and favorable vulnerability make up for a lot of ills|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikam1: But of course EW will take what they can get here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mikam1: Strange lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: wow   and  on 46   5@D   |pg||
nt|mikam1: Since scores are not posted...Grue Lall bid 2 slams on 46 and 47 - now this is third board|pg||
nt|mikam1: Actually the first was a grand|pg||
mc|8|nt|ahollan1: neither of these results helping the Wolfson cause|pg||
pg||
qx|c48|st||md|2S32HT8DT97432C972,SQ876HJ6432D8CKT3,SHK95DKQJ65CQJ854,SAKJT954HAQ7DACA6|sv|e|nt|vugraphzfd: network lagging, cross your fingers|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing wrong with being deliberate although yesterday's match between Aker and Wolfson produced some very long delays|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe Grue needed a mirror for that one :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: 2@H 10-15 or 11-15|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H   isn't part of Ekeblad system   maybe they really did switch system|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h=5+@hs and 4@c, 10-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh   i miscounted @C    10-15  5+@H & 4+@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: last board, ekeblad asked to see the final heart trick again, johnson said it didn't matter, played @s3 and conceded @s @H @d @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@c 2+ and not precision|pg||
nt|psyck: NS 2/1 style & EW precision|pg||
nt|kareno: We get to see all four hands!|pg||
nt|sybarra: great lead director overcall |pg||
nt|sybarra: (not)|pg||
nt|peachy: you said it faster, Karen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: LOL indeed!|pg||
nt|jpes: we don't seem to have missed many boards|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: the <aker-team was vslow playing all the way - also in 1. round <.9|pg||
nt|kareno: No squeeze in the OR as north ducked the heart.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not quite as good a 7@d sac as we saw last segment.|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand, no way to start a segment, coming from behind|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|joest: 1@s = either diamonds or a 1NT response|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: actually over double it's just diamonds, sorry|pg||
nt|psyck: These teams were originally seeded 5th & 10th, but some heavy seeds including Nickell & Gordon fell along the way.|pg||
nt|pelu: NS open on almost all 11 counts - and many distributional 10 counts|pg||
nt|psyck: NS's bidding summary says "Normal 21st century" :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: something to be said for rebidding 2@c|pg||
mb|5S|nt|andyv:  ordinarily 1@s by this pair shows no 4 card major and is similar to forcing NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Joe played spades and would have made his contract if a) spades broke or b) south held hearts and clubs and was squeezed on the third spade.|pg||
nt|kareno: 5nt would be choice of slams I think.  two places to play.|pg||
nt|kareno: Susan, can you tell us why 2@h was Alerted?|pg||
nt|peachy: Borth knows enough not to pick NT :)|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@h apparently showed diamonds.|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d shows hearts - some sort of criss-cross I guess.  And now I can't guess what 5nt means.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: consecutive partscores!  good luck partner, I stretched a bit|pg||
nt|andyv:  match got tighter as 4@h went down 1 in CR|pg||
nt|robinswr: make the queen of diamonds the king then its clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: the way you show a 2 1/2 spade bid is to bid 2 minor then raise 2@s to three|pg||
nt|santyclz: Effective preempting!|pg||
nt|jpes: this a b|pg||
nt|jpes: ockbuster result for wolfson|pg||
mb|p|pc|hT|nt|andyv:  unscrambling the tricks will be the EW task|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: well, its a bad feeling to go down in 2@S when u r cold for 6@D...|pg||
nt|robinswr: the spades are so weak that if partner has zero or one spade, 2 minor could be better|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am exeggarating, but u do make 6 as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h5|nt|psyck: very optimistic|pg||
nt|santyclz: At the other table s just bid 4@d.|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  pushed a little too hard on this one|pg||
nt|joest: quite|pg||
nt|pelu: even 4@h need some work|pg||
nt|joest: btw the pass was alerted b/c it said 'lead diamonds'.  A double would have meant 'don't lead diamonds"|pg||
nt|psyck: a simple doubly & raise to 3@h shows W's values for me|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I think their 1@s in comp was either minor, that is why the pass over 4@d|pg||
nt|joest: 1@s was diamonds|pg||
nt|pelu: no after thje free 2@H from East W has a GF hand|pg||
nt|joest: we used to call hands like east's "pickles and ice cream"  Some very good things and some very bad things.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all who know the systems for explaining.|pg||
nt|joest: "where do I start" thinks declarer.|pg||
nt|joest: even making five would be a challenge|pg||
nt|kareno: So presumably this auction shows red suits.  Two places to play and clubs was excluded by the 6@d bid.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: but over 5@C he could (sh) only bid 5@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  7@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  or 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the last score I had was Welland 262-204 over Jacobs.  if Jacobs conceded, no one told me, but it's plausible|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking may endplay E|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: would not be the first time they had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  his main hope is that all games go down now|pg||
nt|ybob: XX   QXXXX    XXX    AXX  = VERY GOOD SLAM |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: I definitely like 5D better|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: @H10  helps Ekeblad exit trump|pg||
nt|psyck: if you chose to rebid 2@c, would you bid on after 2@d?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|santyclz: To see the bidding at the other table, hover your mouse pointer over the other table score.|pg||
mc|13|nt|kareno: 3nt made in the OR.  Apparently they failed to cash out (including diamonds) after declarer surrendered a spade.|pg||

nt|sybarra: ir appears|pg||
nt|kareno: Might be hearts or some other two suits, suction style - haven't watched this pair before.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or multi landy,  long in one major |pg||
nt|peachy: Multilandy seems to be in vogue nowadays|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  1! may be 4C major with longer side suit 10-15|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s|pg||
nt|joest: some might try 2NT but that is a HUGE gamble with little reward.  either they double you or if they don't they know how to play the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and that won't happen here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Some might have tried a 1nt overcall.|pg||
nt|peachy: The explanation to the "4D only" is obvious, I missed it, thanks kib. Other room 1D was Precision "11-15, 2+" while this room it was natural|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I miss some alerts as it is often late|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson takes his cards out of his shirt pocket, fans them, then passes 2@c|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@d would be quite a view playing 2/1 with void in pd's suit & the style of light nv openings played nowadays|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest: well now here they do have thirteen tricks|pg||
nt|joest: unfortunately the d has four first|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1NT would not help you get to the correct strain|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: go smoke|pg||
nt|andyv:  or can be 12-14 with 5@s and 5-3-3-2 dist.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: I'd prefer that you stay and play the dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H is pass or correct,  a bit rambuncious maybe|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: since 1@S only promises 4 -- Drury promises 4   and Rubin hides his canape suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c is art. GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not by passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, just drury|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad trying to get director to turn dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT was ok, but should have bid 3@D then, meaning inv with @Ds, which he had|pg||
nt|psyck: I like that better Daniel|pg||
nt|peachy: Oft'repeated little sayiong , attributed to (I think) Jan Martel:  Operator is like a loongtailed cat in a small room full of rocking chairs.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: Normal but unfortunate lead.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  this shouldn't take too long|pg||
nt|andyv:  Steve should cash the A of @c and then lead 2nd @d|pg||
nt|joest: since they play 'normal' signals, weinstein might have overtaken there to prevent an accident|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may decide to play low @d and get @c back|pg||
nt|psyck: there won't be any problems defending this one looking at that dummy anyway|pg||
nt|joest: even if garner leads a spade they can't get everything untangled|pg||
nt|joest: only a trump switch would cost|pg||
nt|joest: this is one of those situation where when I am north and partner huddles forever I ask myself "Should I have overtaken?"|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@d after 1NT is would you would bid with x/xx/QJ10xxxx/Kxx|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok   andy and i have both used our screw up quota    we'll be fine from now on|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: how did you know?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm not done yet, Al|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson, laughing: I just hoped it wouldn't!|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard enough trying to remember their systems and what position they are!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director asked ekeblad where he was going, ekeblad: to change my flight home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :) :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson still hasn't turned trick 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: very slow defender throughout this match|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: unfamiliarity with EW methods and difficulty drawing inferences may contribute|pg||
nt|andyv:  they play udca carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and on cue: if you only had 4@s, what kind of shape could you have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: any longer suit|pg||
nt|joest: uh oh|pg||
nt|andyv:  wow|pg||
nt|psyck: but donno if I would do it at the table, normal to be worried of misfits & only nv game, also poor @d suit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|gulyas: S could make 6@D here again:) as long as no @S was lead either, ofc:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  however if they show AK combo, then first trick is a count request card|pg||
nt|pelu: agree that N sh take @DK + A and play @C|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|psyck: sure made me eat my words|pg||
nt|jpes: dcl got a little help with the lead|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|kareno: Only a trick high :)  With the diamond break.|pg||
nt|kareno: Garner expected more values from his adversely vulnerable partner.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you have to resist using those weapons :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|joest: defensive moral: when you know what is right, take control and do it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||

pc|h8|pc|c8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad returns, "thanks solly", sits down, carrying fresh coffee as usual|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in first 4 boards    Nickell has lost another 13   trails Bathurst by 61|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 2 rounds of @s ... I don't think he can afford a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the winner of our match plays Semi-Final against winner of Bathurst v Nickell|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: laughter elsewhere in the ballroom|pg||
nt|andyv:  they had an interesting board in the 7th round...20 imps swing for Bathurst|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin holding his cards in both hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds them again, leans closer to dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no 4th match on vugraph  so presumably  Jacobs [down 62] conceded to Welland |pg||
nt|andyv:  trying to decide if he can protect against a 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, trivial from here if spades behave|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson to ekeblad: go for another smoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson sighs and leans back again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad closes screen to exchange some whispers with simson.  rubin seems not to notice half of dummy had disappeared|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling his hand, planning his line of play|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: moving one card at a time into order|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  this line is better than 3-2 @s?|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe his assumption is whoever is ruffing is doing it with the long @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin sips his coffee.   now johnson's turn to tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren-Donn stopped in      4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, if S were 2-2 in the black suits, he could easily be going down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some kind of mixup after a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S=south|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: @dq selected|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  now he really has to hope the @ss are 2-2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: the bids do not want to appear so that we can tell you is lagging about 40 seconds behind and then sticks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very tough to win this event without a backhand|pg||
nt|mikam1: Ah...many troubles for the operator today - all is forgiven :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both sides play upside-down count & attitude      in case that hasn't been mentioned since last connectivity hiccup|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the tricks are 3 for NS and 4 for ew|pg||
nt|mikam1: I suspect some cards have been played too...looks like another crash coming here:(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at board-a-match N might get involved. at IMPs with  nice lead, evenm if in your twenties you don;t bend over to  pick up pennies lest your back give out|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: dummy has ts kjtx of diamond and 3 of clubs left|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: so all you master solvers see who can decided who has taken what :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the last trick was taken by Ekeblad|pg||

nt|andyv:  maybe net is talking a smoking break|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson: leave these out for a minute, just going to think for a little while|pg||
nt|ahollan1: internet is new toy in las vegas|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad thumps the table|pg||
nt|psyck: limit raise or better, foring to 3@h only for me|pg||
nt|robinswr: forcing passes is a compicated subject|pg||
nt|peachy: Sometimes overloading the 1C opener can be a disadvantage, preempts make it really uncomfortable|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  9 tricks pretty easy dbl dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: breaking simson's trance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: different rooms dropped  out this time|pg||
nt|andyv:  N should have no trouble setting up 2 tricks in @d and @c and should make OT|pg||
nt|kareno: Plenty high enough.  Wonder what 1@s was - diamonds?|pg||
nt|kareno: Usually diamonds, I'm told, thanks to a spec.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphzfd: did not see rubins spots|pg||
nt|pelu: with @cJ in W 3Nt and 4@H almost same chance|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|peachy: They are probably too high already|pg||
pc|s7|nt|psyck: he may be playing to not set up @d now, disc 1@s on @c & ruff one|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 3@c is puppet and 3N is 5@h (flip flopping with 3@h to show no 4 or 5 card major)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|gulyas: I would think it is not over 4@S, but someone should double this...|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: Rubin has problems in 4@H (Board 3) :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1@h seems about the limit here.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|psyck: then he needs to guess both maj finesses right|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|andyv:  4@d then was xfer to @hs|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: Very creative lead by Lall, wanting to lead through dummy's strength.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|joest: 4 diamonds + 2 clubs + 2 hearts|pg||
nt|joest: so guess theheart|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk5: The winner (on Tuesday) will be USA2 for the 2011 Bermuda Bowl to be held Oct. 15-29 in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. USA1, chosen at the 2010 USBC, will be the Fleisher team ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (Fleisher-Kamil, Martel-Stansby, Levin-Weinstein)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Specs were calling for a low @c.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  and went counter to Crane rule...and it worked!|pg||
nt|joest: is one way to make it is what I was going to say :)|pg||
nt|pelu: the slam only cost 3imp - Rubin didnt find the winning line in 4@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was Lall's main hope on that hand|pg||
nt|joest: that's a break for Bathurst|pg||
nt|joest: clearing diamonds while you have the spade king protected looks sorta straightforwarfd|pg||
nt|andyv:  here he just needs to play A@h and K@h and then, after pitching 2 spades, it's a matter of making 4 or 5|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff a @D now and he can claim with @hs 3-2|pg||
nt|joest: sorry I'm busy playing 3NT!|pg||
nt|andyv:  did you make it?|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||

nt|marlowepi: club 9 ominous|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: spade attack indicated|pg||
nt|mikam1: I actually don't think anything would help defense with proper timing by declarere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if S has 4 hearts E can overruff, so not sure diamond is inspired|pg||
nt|dinos1: if start with @s then @c goes on 4th @s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||

nt|sybarra: terrible lead problem for E |pg||
nt|peachy: lots of work, abd I think too much, so no|pg||
nt|kareno: Depends the lead and the defense.  With diamond lead, I think yes.  Ruff diamond, ruff club, two rounds of hearts, then clubs.  West must follow and spades go away.|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't think so with pd having a known suit |pg||
nt|jpes: its interesting how hard they work on part score hands|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  at least @s suit is sitting right as is @c Q|pg||
nt|pelu: @DQ = better @Hs than @s|pg||
nt|joest: on board 4 north-south did cash out effectively against 4@s unlike here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|robinswr: very slow here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jpes: the Q@D to make S worry|pg||
nt|santyclz: Kaplan was an early advocate of fighting for part scores at imps.|pg||
nt|peachy: The "nickels and dimes" do add up|pg||
nt|peachy: in a 120 board match|pg||
nt|santyclz: In one of the segments in the quarters, after 6 bds Bathurst had picked up 25 partscore imps from Nickell.|pg||
nt|peachy: I hope this is not an impending crash. The operators have had to suffer enough of those already|pg||
nt|jpes: garner is trying to see what he can do with J87@D in Wooldridge hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  5@c queen ask, |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rubin: who's on lead? ok, tell me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Exclusion not really needed if 3@S promised @SAce|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: basically he was cuebidding after I chose.  he showed 0 or 3 keycards and no queen of trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asking simson as the auction proceeded, rubin just waited for the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: I showed @h and I liked my hand for slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be much faster to play than 7@h where restricted choice would come into play|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: and he's leading a minor again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sassed rubin about the @c lead last time|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest: Weinstein knows declarer has at least two spades.  partner would not sit 1@d with five of them|pg||

nt|pelu: low-high in @S from S = even No|pg||
nt|pelu: prob @C10 now|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be able to figure out that S started with 4@s and 5@d so his other dist. should be 2-2|pg||
nt|joest: no|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: Wolfson was closing the gap - this will work against them IMO|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other partnerships  over strong NT  Lall plays  DBL=4@H/@S & 5+@C/@D   2@D=1-suit @H or @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if same with Grue    then the only option was 3@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when you have a suoeraccept, you can indiucate it via an unrevealing 2N call, which asks responder if he wants to know detauls, eg where your doubleton is. that way you dont assist ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: opps' defense when you bid a close game, as responder can just transfer you to game and be done with it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: couldn't they break when the connection is down??|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: LOL|pg||
nt|marlowepi: al, you are so logical and practical|pg||
nt|mikam1: Someone pointed out to me that he might not want to bid when the opps are vul and he has a good lead...quite possible|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and look where it's gotten me :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, but with stiff spade and total of just 4 major suit cards, likelihood of opps ending n 3N is not that great. so if NV maybe more to be gained from intervention|pg||
nt|mikam1: True...guess I'd like to know their methods|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too if they beat everyon in trials by 40+:)|pg||
nt|mikam1: By the way Diamond has opened a sizable lead vs. Welland - 49 imps now|pg||

nt|mikam1: Yes, long way to go...and the team trials are famous for big turnarounds|pg||

pc|d9|nt|robinswr: the problem with opening the south hand is that you have no good rebid over 1@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4H unlikely contract but may need to negotiate club ruff to beat it i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: one thing that 1@D DOES deny  is a hand with longer @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Rubin says all Grue does is pass|pg||
nt|mikam1: I probably wouldn't overcall 2@C on South hand, but it makes life difficult for the opponent's in terms of sorting out their majors here|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mikam1: Many stretch to overcall 1@D with 2@C for just that reason|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C is enormously preemptive over 1@D   especially when 1@D doesn't promise length|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in some cases it takes away an inverted minor raise too, forcing W to show the support via a 3-lvel cuebid|pg||

nt|ahollan1: glad i didn't predict a boring push|pg||
nt|kit: If he bids 3@D transfer and partner bids 3@H, then what does he do?|pg||
nt|andyv:  that may be a speed record for NS|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  and junior players saying to themselves...8 ever, nine never...|pg||
nt|joest: on the 3@CX hand n-s were down 2 in 3NT for a pickup for Wolfson|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: = a jump from 10 meter where u dont know if there are water in tha bassin :)|pg||
nt|psyck: he may have had to invent a 3@s bid if he tried 3@d xfr|pg||
nt|joest: 14-16 NT|pg||
nt|joest: can start with 3@c transfer and then bid 3@s naturally if he wants to|pg||
nt|kit: I like the idea of transfers there, but on this hand playing normal where 3@H is a natural force works out easier to handle|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+@D  many possible shapes  |pg||
nt|joest: Lall opens his flat ten count vulnerable before Garner can open his flat eleven count vulnerable :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, would have been interesting of @ck value was in @d|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you should go out of your  way to compete against 1nt|pg||

nt|psyck: right|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|kit: Which is why I think it is bad to play 3@C transfer invite or better -- partner can't cross you up if 3@D is forced|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  including 5 card @s suit|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|peachy: will you let her type, Karen ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: simson: you have another chance|pg||

nt|psyck: Looks like the connections will be a recurring problem today|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably heard your comments re great bridge |pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: there is a lot to be said for that kit.  And it solves the problem we are discussing in some transfer lebensohl methods|pg||
nt|gulyas: another push probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  spades play well for N|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad goes through the possibilities for rubin's shape, simson: "I've heard plenty" and passes|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: nothing in this room is hot|pg||
pc|h7|nt|robinswr: a simple way to bid over 2@s is to play 2NT forces 3@c. for other bids assume partner opened 2NT(15-17) and respond as you would to partner 's 2NT opening |pg||
nt|robinswr: 3@c stayman, 3@D transfer|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  this should go down 1|pg||
nt|kareno: She noted the diamond king onside but suggested they not bid any grand slam on a finesse.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1 left to score   Bathurst over Nickell by 41   so Bathurst will play winner of our match in the 120 board Semi Final|pg||

nt|kareno: Here's an explanation from a spec:  2D=natural, 2H=Nat, 3H=nat, 3S=non-serious slam try, 3N=spade Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: win some - lose some|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|santyclz: Win 10, lose 5 is a good long-term strategy.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  getting to 4@s should be no problem|pg||
nt|joest: 3@c is a multi raise|pg||
nt|joest: anything from a mixed raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hi again hope it doesn't happen much today|pg||
nt|joest: up to a balanced three card game force|pg||
nt|joest: it excludes a "jacoby2NT' type hand|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will presumably bid 4@H|pg||
nt|psyck: np Susan, at least we got back immediately|pg||
nt|joest: and garner will 'accept the transfer' to 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: but maybe he will find something imaginative|pg||
nt|kit: Which Grue will double I guess -- and then ?|pg||
nt|joest: he is rummaging through his imagination right now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, sometimes it takes forever|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 imps to Bathurst, tripling their lead:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=738&pid=155|pg||
nt|peachy: I'm not sure anyone has stats on the style, but my gut feeling is it pays more than loses|pg||
mb|2H|nt|psyck: a hand where NS should not let 5 level belong to the opps|pg||
nt|joest: 'walking the dog' as they say|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the answer is.....3@h:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N used to be semi-force  but yesterday operator alerted as Forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said semi|pg||
nt|andyv:  they have it marked as semi forcing|pg||
nt|psyck: with the transfer to opps known suit generally acting as a stayman substitute|pg||
nt|jpes: look at the score|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: John wasn't operator yesterday :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s info |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yep   i was very surprised yesterday|pg||
nt|peachy: Polish style 1C, natural, or bal 11-14 or bal 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: N-S should not be bidding to 5@S -- goes for 300, while 5@H might not be making -- it is on diamond guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  it may be a mistake to bid the E hand slowly if NS can get their @c suit in|pg||
nt|peachy: let me clarify on the club, kib says it is not polish style.. This is what it "is" : balanced 11 to a bad 14 or 17- 19 or distributional hands with primary clubs|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|kit: Which declarer will get right when finding South has stiff heart|pg||
nt|peachy: With the current proliferation of light opening style (11, and many 10 pointers even if balanced/ish) and then light responding style, one can easily get robbed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes, everyone opens |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  2N probably showed solid @s suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 2NT 6 good spades and a maximum|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks and johnson confirms semiforcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias peeks in, won't be pleased|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final posted   Welland beat Jacobs  by 46|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @c and @h loser, Doug will have to worry about losing 2@ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: someone outside whoops, probably just confirmed that they won|pg||
nt|sybarra: Weinstein trying to get out |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@c may have shown hearts in their transfer style.|pg||
nt|jpes: defense is so much more difficult than declarer play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everyone opens, everyone overcalls, nobody x's for penalty.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's a different game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  taking the money|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: they are in 2 h by n, losing the play|pg||

pc|hA|nt|robinswr: hurd has to play this carefully since spades are 4-2|pg||

nt|jpes: i think declarer has erred|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|andyv:  A@d and @d is 2nd but still have to guess what @d to put in when W ducks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D inverted raise even in comp|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural?|pg||
nt|andyv:  must be in wrong room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson said natural, forcing. forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@d will make this match a lot closer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just 1-round force  but Johnson might not pass for a while|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson puts his cards back in his shirt pocket|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NOW  RKC|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok...now 4@h is rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson points at cards in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: see if he shows the Q/extra length|pg||
nt|jpes: 60 bds a day is taking a toll|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: sighs and sets down his cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: if it was obvious he might have done so by now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is he worried that trump is @S???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing k@s may stop them from 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not on same wavelength re: 4@H may keep them out of 6@D|pg||
nt|gosia: diamonds is trump- afraid to show 1D q with only 9 HCP :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: simson burying his face in his hand again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way|pg||
nt|andyv:  even if he doesn't, S will still bid 5N (or whatever their K asking sequence is) after response of 2 key cards|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe a simple 4@s on 2@s better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: when they ask for Kings  it is  , not specific Kings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so he did deny Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad asks, simson says "this is blackwood" louder than his usual voice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@D in other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad: "who asked you to talk out loud?" and calls director|pg||
nt|andyv:  did he show 2 controls?|pg||
nt|chip: If 4H was RKC, surprised he didn't show the Q.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hesitation and S's comments could be a problem here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: you lose most of your rights, have to point out hesitations from the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|andyv:  re re|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: do u often have bad internet-conections?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: i think this asks   of kings  and 5@S=none|pg||
nt|psyck: difficult to stop below slam now|pg||
nt|kit: 3@H presumably natural, slammish, and a few Q-bids after that|pg||
nt|psyck: S clearly expected 3@s to have more goodies|pg||
nt|robinswr: jump to 4spade is no aces no kings no singletons or voids, good desciption|pg||
pc|s5|nt|joest: sorry about the net problems|pg||
nt|joest: 3@s doesn't look like a  Q and was alerted|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may just play here|pg||
nt|kit: Pass of the double probably denies club control, and redouble says he has a club control|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hope i'm getting this right|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe 3N was serious if 3@s showed @h fit|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 dow |pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: 3NT looks pretty non-serious to me|pg||
nt|psyck: redouble 1st round control likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: n|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|andyv:  i think so but I thought 5N would ask for specific kings but I don't have any notes to support that|pg||
nt|andyv:  good pick up here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still  i think Simson should have shown the Q    extra length could have been important to Johnson|pg||
nt|gosia: still 13 to Aker|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: johnson agrees that he asked for keycards, simson showed 2 without the Q, johnson asked for kings, and simson showed 0|pg||
nt|kit: Grue is bidding a lot on his 10-count|pg||
nt|joest: i know you have two aces but are there any brakes at all on the West vehicle? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they open most 10 counts not vul, E has to proceed with some caution|pg||
nt|pelu: last chance for Lall|pg||
nt|kit: Lall will certainly bid the slam -- he is thinking grand|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 3spades if you bid 4@c and partner bids 4@s there is no slam|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h9|nt|joest: opposite a limited opener that is optimistic|pg||
nt|kit: 5NT choice of slams -- worried about protecting his partner's king of clubs|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue's hand already limited to 10-13 range|pg||
nt|andyv:  can Grue pass this?|pg||
nt|kit: you are right -- can't be a grand|pg||
nt|joest: back on board 9 Bathurst-Zagorin also missed 6@d|pg||
nt|peachy: The other semifinal match shows a score gap also, about the same as here|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|nt|psyck: if 1N limited the 10-15 opening to 10-13, this is certainly optimistic bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: the 7@d in B9 = flat in 3NT|pg||
nt|joest: now in fairness if Grue had Qxx of spades we wouldn't be talking this way :)|pg||
nt|joest: not that we would EVER double dummy a hand!|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's that?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s9|pc|d3|nt|kit: Well, Grue could have Qxx of spades and 3 aces, couldn't he?|pg||
nt|joest: that's a grand!  |pg||
nt|joest: that's the perfecto|pg||
nt|kit: I guess that is 1NT opening|pg||
nt|joest: in the real world|pg||
nt|joest: down one|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, 1N 14-16, so this was limited to 10-13|pg||
nt|kit: Anybody have any idea why Grue didn't open 2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hello again :)|pg||
nt|psyck: I guess they prefer better suit quality for 2@c openings. cc only says 6+ 10-15 hcp though.|pg||
nt|pelu: we missed u Susan :)|pg||
nt|joest: so are we frozen or is garner thinking about the opening lead?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Grue had 2 chances to go anti partnership but score big swing...pass 4@c dbld and pass 5NT |pg||
nt|joest: well let's rule out the latter|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is 100% forcing and he has no idea what lall has|pg||
nt|kit: passing 4@C doubled way to big a position -- could have slam, and 4@C might not be making.|pg||
nt|joest: and this from the high priest of "I will pass a forcing call if it feels right!"  :)|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- but it doesn't feel right|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I didn't say they were right...only that they worked|pg||
nt|kit: does 4@C even make?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe on trump coup -- but better be playing for it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh good, I got Kit thinking:)|pg||
nt|joest: that's right play for all four trumps on your RIGHT and the guy who double you on the left to have a stiff|pg||
nt|andyv:  what's the problem?|pg||
nt|joest: everybody would play that way|pg||
nt|kit: routine|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 5N cold...all you have to do is duck the @c|pg||
nt|andyv:  bridge is such an easy game|pg||
nt|kit: rather imaginative double of 4@C byWeinstein btw to get club lead.  Pity it didn't matter.|pg||
nt|joest: in the meantime I have lost contact with what is going in real life in Las Vegas|pg||
nt|psyck: I thought life in LV was unreal|pg||
nt|pelu: Andy telling fairy tales|pg||
nt|joest: right now this board is living proof the adage:|pg||
nt|joest: "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"|pg||
nt|andyv:  including most of your money|pg||
nt|pelu: are we waiting for a lead?|pg||
nt|kit: probably a connection problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  they've had a few of those|pg||
nt|psyck: maybe operator catching up with play & will just enret result|pg||
nt|psyck: even if W had a 3rd @s, this would need a non @c lead...|pg||
nt|psyck: oh no, can disc immed|pg||
nt|pelu: only chance to make is: stif @hA and stiff @C on same hand - take out @ss + @Ds and play @H and wait for ruff-discard :)|pg||
nt|joest: we have sent someone into this room to see what's going on|pg||
nt|joest: we may have to crash the table and reload it|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: looks like ultimate handhog:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=6+@H some singleton/void|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H relay  confirming 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Ekeblad is writing a memo|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now Eke will be able to describe exactly 3613|pg||
nt|mikam1: and perhaps a minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also confirms he thins he remembers the system, otherwise would break relay with a Mayday bid:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H finishes the distribution|pg||
nt|mikam1: It's his system I believe :)|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|mikam1: and it's a good one too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that was the basis of my feeble jest|pg||
nt|mikam1: as long as no one forgets anything :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rubin knows to avoid NT   now it is question of slam investigation|pg||
nt|mikam1: I wonder if Grue could have broken the relay(s) by bidding 2@D...might have been worth it on some hands|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|marlowepi: not much chance of their over-reaching, nobody has much extra|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S forces 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikam1: Of course, he might go for a number too|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now rubin can differentiate weak vs strong slam interestt|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: you dont often go for a number  -- even when it is lurking for your with rbidly slavering jaws  -- when you have solid trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@C says strong interests  -- what do you think|pg||
nt|mikam1: I just hate to see my opponents get to relay 37 times to the perfect contract (especially if slam)|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H = minimum interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should end it|pg||
nt|mikam1: Should is the key word|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree with you. get in there if you can|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|mikam1: However he has xxxx diamond facing singleton...so...not easy to signoff|pg||
nt|dinos1: was 1@h 8-11?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  missing 5 keycards   minimum won't be able to cover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@S=RKC|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no 1@H was a couple of hand types  in this case  8+ balanced|pg||
nt|mikam1: this should end safely at the 5 level|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neither one has that great a hand after 1C and a pos response|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C=0/3 key cards|pg||
nt|mikam1: But Ronnie could envision Axx AKJxxx x AJx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a pile, and E has an entry-level 1C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that hand wouldn't say  minimum to the slam try|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mikam1: However, if 4@H said "no interest", Ronnie probably could have quit there|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i think we are seeing -50 bidding|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: director: you're ten minutes into overtime, simson: maybe there'll be a tie|pg||
nt|andyv:  14-16 NT for NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, hopefully we are caught up here|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully we are back |pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome back, all. Susan will have us updated in no time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|andyv:  except in 4th seat (15-17)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: patrias: anyone want one last cup of coffee?  ekeblad claims it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: 2@s was invitatinoal in that sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: except 3rd vul and 4th seat|pg||
nt|robinswr: both majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: likely we will be catching up now |pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfd: johnson: that was a screeching halt.  ekeblad asks johnson's range, simson: what seat was he in? then 14-16|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  with 17 hcp, Russ has nowhere to go.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|santyclz: Can beat it 3 with that lead.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|pelu: had a chance in OR - played by W and @D-lead - to Q and a @h on @DA, but wrong guess in @C|pg||
nt|psyck: 55 is sure tempting to enter, though vul & suits not great|pg||
nt|robinswr: its clear to enter with 55 also clear if 5431|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: defense can now take the first 4 trick|pg||
nt|pelu: tx Susan u had a hard time - hope for better connection in next segment|pg||
nt|psyck: lots of interesting & swingy deals, hopefully several more of such to come|pg||
nt|gulyas: good bid I think, and a partscore swing|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|robinswr: when you have a singleton you hope that the opponents have 10 points in that suit and that the ten points would only take one trick|pg||

nt|vugraphzfe: discuss how many point and Ekeblad's distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i've often wondered how counting of honors would affect tournament bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another Big 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: This is the last board of the first 60 out of 120 of the semi's of the USBC|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thx Debbie   and please thank the players|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H game force   a couple of hand types|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: will restart at 10:00 am PDT tomorrow for the final 60 boards|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = relay    |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|mikam1: Looks like a normal 3N in the end|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = [no singleton/void]|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p!|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mikam1: Thanks to Al and Marshall and of course Debbie :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: of). tune in tomorrow!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Rubin closing in on showing 5@S 4@H 22|pg||
nt|marlowepi: kudos:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: Thanks to BBO and the USBF and ACBL for allowing us to join and enjoy these boards|pg||

nt|mikam1: Oops - makes 4 (as kibitzers quickly corrected)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|mikam1: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||

nt|andyv:  this is the last board of the first set... a lot of action still left as they play 120 boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have a short break after this hand (as I recall)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all - this is the last one :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are there 13 imps to be had here?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  1@c=2+|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = inverted|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15, 0+   too numerous to describe|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gosia: Aker put up great battle|pg||
nt|andyv:  there are always 13 imps to be had somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but this hand doesn't bode well for the Aker team|pg||
nt|joest: 2@h  ART game force|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = good @H raise   2@H would be weaker|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to be much weaker although the @h honors are nice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Goren started with 1N  so that auction began 1 level higher|pg||
nt|gosia: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Garner already at 4@C and auction not over|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: ekeblad said 2@S showed 4, rubin is less sure "I believe a double would show 3, but since I showed 5..."|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3rd session starts at 4:45 Pacific daylight time|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3:45|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: final contract   4@S West|pg||
nt|andyv:  relay now|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT = an initial balanced GF|pg||
nt|joest: both major stopped|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|andyv:  this one may run out of steam |pg||
nt|psyck: nice for N to know S has a non minimum, they should get to 6@c eaily, hopefully not more|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: it's at 3:45 pacific time|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest: 3@s = shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  always a problem how to evaluate shortness when it's the Ace|pg||
nt|kit: Spade shortness will not exactly excite Weinstein|pg||
nt|pelu: often a problem to show shortness with an A|pg||
nt|joest: true but where can partners extra values be that won't produce some reasonableplay for slam?|pg||
nt|pelu: late - again :(:(|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|psyck: if they play minorwood or kickback, N can easily stop in time after finding only 1 side king after key card response|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: 10 minutes on clock|pg||
nt|kit: oh he will certainly get them to slam -- the key is to stay out of the bad grand.|pg||
nt|andyv:  KJ@h?  and 6@c may be wrong sided then|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gosia: no 13 imps here|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Susan, great job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, not now for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks John  and PLEASE  thank the players for us|pg||
nt|andyv:  great effort by both teams|pg||
nt|joest: 4@d = RKCB|pg||
nt|kit: why wrongsided?  Where would a heart loser go?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Congratulations to the Wolfson team|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: thanks Al and everyone|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT = two without|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 4@d kickback|pg||
nt|joest: could ask with 5@h now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kit: which he will -- he needs both kings to bid the grand|pg||
nt|psyck: 5!k would confirm all key cards & trump Q|pg||
nt|joest: 5@d asks about kings generally|pg||
nt|psyck: *5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: I think you right, scheduled restart in 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will see you all then :) |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: break after this hand|pg||
nt|jpes: good night all - it  is late on the east coast|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks to all commentators, Joe Shair, Kit Woolsey, Jim Pestaner, and to all spectaros who are the sole reason for these shows. Thanks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks to all, back in an hour|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks for coming, spectators, you make it all worthwhile!|pg||
nt|peachy: Expecially thanking you for your comments and other messages|pg||
nt|peachy: during the break, standings will be posted here for both matches http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=SemiFinals|pg||
nt|peachy: Sorry about the internet service problems, let us hope no more of it :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|joest: 5NT = diamond king|pg||
nt|joest: no heart king|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, that was private|pg||
nt|joest: no spade king|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: nicely done|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: so semi-finals  will be   Diamond v Welland   and  Wolfson v Bathurst|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty John and Al|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: they code naturally with 5NT showing the unbiddable king I guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: right|pg||
nt|joest: so a nice auctionto close out the set|pg||
nt|peachy: Spectator messages are always appreciated to keep us on the straight and narrow :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: probably a quick claim|pg||
nt|joest: thanks to Susan our operator and to everyone for their patience|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@c 2 way checkback maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: a @h fin would have enabled defense to get @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well done|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: I prefer to always have my coding be up the line, as there may be situations where two of the bids don't correspond exctly|pg||
nt|psyck: this shows the advantage of minorwood/kickback for minor fits|pg||
nt|psyck: Thanks all & see you shortly in the next set|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kit, Jack, CK, Susan and all the specs|pg||
nt|joest: i agre with you but that's not the way they look at it :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Peter!|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|psyck: same other table too, nicely done by both declarers|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|santyclz: Or sometimes -- awake.  Last night we did a segment with 11 partscores...|pg||
mc|11|nt|santyclz: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
